The sun rose above the horizon burning the clouds away. I was in tears listening to David because I truly understood what my potentials are. I lost 9kg of fat just doing zone 2 running in 8 wild weeks. My mental acuity sky rocketed and was ready to kick it to the next level and this podcast happened at the right moment.   My hands were freezing cold coming down the hill but my heart was filled with something profound.   From today on, I plan to do what I hate doing and grow some fucking anterior midcingular cortex. Thank you David. 2:07:10",
