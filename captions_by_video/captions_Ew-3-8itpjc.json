The Silk Road connecting China to the Middle East and Europe was established 130 BC by the Han dynasty to facilitate trade with the West. The same Han dynasty which has the earliest known written record of people eating noodles. Arab traders most likely brought noodles along with everything else they trade with like silk, spices, and paper (the process of which they learned from the Chinese) over a thousand years before Marco Polo was even born.",
