A good example in this video is his response to the very last question from the audience when he pauses for a tension-mounting 15-20 seconds ... before finally insightfully answering a question on how he would advise the current very politically correct Canadian Prime Minister on where he might be going wrong.

It hit me that the same is true with regard to food.  We can come up with an infinite number of dietary plans or ways of eating, but there truly are only a limited number of ones which will sustain human health generation after generation.  For instance, when human diets were researched almost 100 years ago, there was a wide variety, ranging from insects/nuts/fish on tropical islands to oil/fat/meat in the arctic, but all the diets still met certain narrow principles (A/D consumption from animal foods, fermenting grains/nuts/dairy, broth, salt, sea food, etc.).  No groups were vegan, for instance.  I suppose after hundreds of thousands of years, you sort of figure out what doesn't keep a population thriving long-term.    And (thinking aloud) we sort of threw it all out in the 20th century.  Progress at all costs, I guess.  Maybe there's wisdom in listening to the \"democracy of the past\"?  We now imagine we can eat any way, live any way, marry any way, raise children any way, and it will all work out.  Maybe it magically will, or maybe, as always, nature will select the fittest and the rest will die off, either with bad health or tribal warfare.",

      "comment": "38:00 onwards proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that this man is an anti-Enlightenment charlatan.    Despite his deflection, the point he makes is extremely postmodern (or premodern):  he argues anything that helps a human's motivation to survive is inherently true (\"Darwinian real\"), and that this truth is at least as important as universalized observations based on repeatable tests (\"Newtonian real\").  Peterson's nomenclature confuses things, as I don't think Darwin would agree that what made his work true was its value to human survival--it's true because it describes biological phenomena observed in a reality external to human motivations (today we call this \"science,\" though we might, here, want to say \"natural philosophy\" or \"natural history\" to avoid anachronism).    Indeed, Darwin's work ran counter to the meaning/telos that just about every thinker in his day ascribed to the world.  The point of natural selection was precisely that, in reality, there is no meaning to survival--just competition between species (or genes) within a finite and randomly/chaotically changing environment.  We humans might not like it that that's true--it might even be better for us if we collectively decide something else is true instead.  But, the fact is that it IS true--observably, repeatably, theoretically, demonstrably, objectively, etc etc.  To let go of this is to let go of any meaningful notion of the modern project (or \"Western Civilization\" as this guy likes to say).    You're being duped if you fall for this.  It's classic social-constructivist postmodernism, it's just in a conservative self-help voice, so y'all go for it.  Consider asking questions about why this guy wants to make human motivation a reality on par with Newton's laws--why he wants to present his worn out Freudian (!) readings of cultural history as a serious perspective on Darwinian theory.  As far as I can tell, he's trying to inject a conservative cultural agenda into fields in which it doesn't belong--and in turn to politicize reality.",
