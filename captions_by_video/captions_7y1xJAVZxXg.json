The woman is wearing a red blazer and the man has glasses and a yellow sweater under his suit jacket. They seem to be having a conversation. There are some candles on a table between them and there are stacks of books and vases with flowers around the room.AUDIO: I can hear music playing throughout the whole time. It seems like it might be a bit of a lively or upbeat tune. There's also some kind of singing or chanting that starts at about 1 second into the clip and continues until around 5 seconds. It's hard to make out the exact words though.What do you think about the scene? Does it remind you of anything?"
