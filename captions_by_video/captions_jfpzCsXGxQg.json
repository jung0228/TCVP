      "comment": "This abuse story really hits close to home for me. I dealt with a lot of verbal and psychological (occasionally physical) abuse from my mother and her parents when I had to live at their house after my parents got divorced. My experience was very similar, with the exception that none of it was being filmed for money.   At the time I thought it was totally normal. It was hard to focus on the bad things when I was constantly showered with toys and all other kinds of gifts that I hadn't even asked for (later on I would be screamed at for being a spoiled brat because of all the things I was given). I was about 13 when this started, and I got out of it when I was 15 once my mother was convinced to leave their house while my grandfather was out of state on a business trip. I remember my grandmother yelling curses at us from the top of the stairs as we packed our most important belongings with help from my aunt.   I had a therapist legally forced on me at the time of my parents' divorce whom I honestly disliked from the moment I met her. Talking to her felt very unnatural and uncomfortable. I didn't and still don't think I needed therapy at that time, nor do I think I need it now. I'm the type of person to deal with these sorts of issues on my own with my own reasoning skills. As the sessions went on, I only had less and less to talk about. By the time I was nearing the end of my sessions, I would simply walk into her office and say \"I have nothing to talk about.\" while the next 30 minutes was spent sitting in silence. The abuse at home I did talk about at first, but I know the way I talked about it was pretty nonchalant and tended to downplay the actual situation. At the time I was overwhelmed by all the legal intervention as at this point, I was only allowed to see my father once a week which was pretty devastating for me since I'd always had a very strong, close relationship with him. I new that if I spoke completely candidly about what was going on, I could be removed from my mother's custody which sounds good on the surface considering the abuse; however, it would have ultimately made the situation worse as my father had no chance at getting custody either because he'd had drug problems in the past, though he'd never been violent or in any way a danger to anyone.  My initial feeling about my therapist proved to be warranted as I later found out that she had been feeding any and all information I gave her to my grandfather who was the major instigator of the abuse (he is also suspected of being a pedophile and had apparently asked my mother for sexual favors while we were both living there. I also want to note that he was my mother's stepfather and not biologically related).   At this stage, maybe a month or 2 before we eventually left, I was really getting scared and desperate, so after I went out to the backyard, I called some of my friends from school and asked them for advice. They were also around the same age as me, so they weren't exactly the biggest help, though they did provide moral support and gave me the push I needed to do what I did next. I had an idea of what I wanted to do, but I lastly called my father to confirm that what I was about to do was a good idea. I then began walking quickly to a nearby park and recreational center because I didn't want my abusers around to control the situation.   When I got to the park it was about 10:00 at night. I took out my phone and called 911 and informed them of my location and that I was afraid of the members of my household. The operator informed me that they'd sent a car out and hung up, but I was still afraid of standing there by myself and was certain that my grandfather would find me soon, so I called my father's mother whom I currently live with along with my father and stepmother. She met me at the park and I ended up sitting in the car with her while we waited for the police. She had already known about the whole situation and was also very afraid for me. By the time the police showed up I was shaking and it seemed everything I needed to recount to the officer had totally left my brain. I did my best to ramble out everything that I could think of in between sobs as I'd started to cry halfway through my statement out of fear and general anxiety about what was going on. My good grandmother did best to fill in the gaps and provide information where she could.   The officer was a younger man who seemed very understanding and sympathetic. A few minutes later, another police car showed up (I later found out that the second officer was called in response to my grandfather having noticed my absence). The second officer was a woman who seemed a bit older than the other guy and was apparently his superior. I did my best to tell her the same things I told the male officer, but it was obvious that she didn't believe me, nor did she seem to care about my very real and immediate fear. I think the male officer tried to explain it to her, but she wasn't having any of it for whatever reason, and decided that I had just run away from home for shits and giggles. She wasted no time in putting me into the back of her police car and driving me back to my abusers.  When we got there, she spoke to my grandfather and laid out all the possible charges that could be pressed against me. He convinced my mother to go along with it, and I felt utterly defeated and totally helpless. After the stunt I pulled, the abuse was no longer sugarcoated with excuses and gifts but was instead openly hostile and malicious. I was lucky that it didn't last much longer.   After my mother and I had moved to a safe place, we had the legal charges against me dropped, and everything was much more peaceful. At that time, my time with my father was still limited, but with my abusive grandparents out of the picture, it was pretty easy to sneak extra time with him under my mother's nose by having him pick me up at the school bus stop before the bus came and skip that school day to spend the day with him. By the time I turned 16, there was really no way for her to keep me with her, so I packed my things and told her I was going to live with my dad. Everything has been okay since then. I still deal with a lot of anxiety and some minor OCD and have trouble getting out of the house to do things, but my psychological trauma has been kept to a minimum, which makes me feel very lucky.  Thank you for reading my story if you actually got this far. I don't often talk about it, but seeing this story play out has brought my own experience to the surface. I felt the need to document this here because I have a huge amount of empathy for these kids, especially Cody. He reminds me of myself a lot, though he's certainly dealing with this horrific abuse at a younger age than I did. I really hope he comes out of this situation relatively unscathed and grows up to become a kind, compassionate adult in the future because of it.",

Adults would even blow up  and scream at you when you egg them on but Cody clearly states he wants to be left alone so he can calm down. His father continues to record and torture him when he's trying to express his emotions without screaming at him. He's ignored and in some instances (in other videos) his brother is allowed to \"restrain\" him when Cody gets fed up with being ignored ( I use restrain lightly because his brothers kick him in the privates and even push down on his stomach/ribs when finally told by his father to let him go. That was shown in the booger under the desk prank or whatever it was called). Cody clearly has some issues that he's trying to work out about his family and home life. It's odd how he shifts the blame on someone else so quickly even though he says they \"own up to their actions\". I believe all this stuff was blowing up before Phillip made a video one it. If they were truly sorry (because to me it seems like they're more upset about losing a shit ton of money from their YouTube channel) they wouldn't even have mentioned Phillip's video or even attempted to say it was his fault. It's their fault for raising their children like that. The way things are going, Cody is on the brink of becoming intentionally dangerous and harming others when he gets older and the eldest one is going to become a bully of some sorts because he doesn't know any better since that's how he was raised. Honestly, I hope these children turn out okay.",
