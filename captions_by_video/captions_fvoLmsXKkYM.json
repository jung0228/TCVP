How old is this kid? fantastic emotional maturity in the face of this treatment from his family. These people need to be held accountable for this so that they don't crush this kids spirit. but wow.. the strength of people amazes me sometimes",

The first implies that the prank is more important than the person being pranked, even though the prank isn't much of a big deal anyway (it's \"just\" a prank, after all). So it's doubly insulting. Honestly, from the first second 1:07 something in her voice said she was really going to enjoy watching Cody suffer, and she thought everyone else was going to enjoy it too, like we're all in on it together.
