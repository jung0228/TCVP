      "comment": "CONGRATULATIONS 🎉 You sound like my 30 yr daughter! I put her on a pony at 9 mos old at our local Sunday Farmers Market. That was all she wrote! This was a weekly occurrence, and by far, my best disciplinary tool while she grew up. I’ve got pictures of her at every stage of her riding career. She became a champion hunter jumper, and to this day, I still feel like my heart will stop each time I watch her round a corner as she looks to where her course jumps begin. Watching her command her very large horse with ease over these high, scary (to me, not her) HIGH jumps is a sight to behold. Little did I know at the time that, like you, horses were in her blood. Thank goodness I didn’t try to stop her. I am not a horse person myself, nor were we a horse family per se, but I got on board quickly, trying to figure out how we could do it. It’s a criminally expensive sport, and I sacrificed a lot to make it happen for her. I mucked stalls, cleaned tack, fed and turned out horses, all so we could offset her boarding fees. Also like you, she has switched to Dressage, a beautiful dance between rider and horse. She also works full time as an engineer in Tech. She works remotely, and she’s at  the barn at 5:30am to ride and train for several hours before she starts work. She often goes to the barn again later in the day. I, myself, have yet to find anything in life that I love this much, and am passionate about. I’m proud of her, and I’m proud of YOU for unwaveringly following your dream, even during very difficult times!",
