      "comment": "400 episodes..and it feels like he’s just warming up. Unbelievable Lex❤And if Eternal Peace would mean the suppression of progress(Elon talks about this 1:03:50), then i would say the antidote is: Killing Boredom. By lifting the majority of the world, poor people, out of poverty. Giving them an actual chance to adventure, explore and create. Instead of fighting over food, land or money. Raise equality on Earth across the board as far as possible (would be an interesting discussion) and you will unlock so much potential by doing so, that General Progress would actually get a Leap Frogging Boost in every academic field. Unparalleled amounts of brilliance released from every corner in the world. There will always be hate, pain and suffering. But War is not ingrained in human nature. So let’s give it a shot, Elon?",

      "comment": "As usual, Lex is possibly my favorite interviewer.  He asks good questions, doesn’t rush guests, and he connects with a wide variety of people.  Sometimes I‘ve been unimpressed with Elon, but more often I think I’d enjoy being stuck in an elevator, with either of these two—it’d be interesting instead of somewhere between dreary & dreadful! Around 53:45—Lex “Is there a master plan” vs Elon saying there’d be no purpose for a simulation, because a creator would know the outcome:  When I went to college (in Fremont 😎) in the early 80s, for our RN program 92% was the cutoff for an A, 84% for a B, & 76% for a C.  75% & below—a D—failed the program.   People busted their fannies to stay in the program, but it would’ve been hard to argue with the rationale: Patients deserve a nurse who has sufficient grasp of each area to pass both theory & the “practical lab” with a minimum of 75%.  (Certainly they gel together further in a job!) I think we’re here with a purpose, but for there to be a God, the results would have to matter.   I think God knows what we’ll choose, but we don’t.   I think individuals often think enough of themselves—or we rationalize—that the purpose of life is to prove to ourselves who we really are, especially if we stand up for what we believe is right or for core principles—especially when they conflict.  Do we choose Good, Better or Best, or are we content with “So What”, or to take advantage of others?  I tend to think whatever is after this life, there are parameters here, and there, that matter.  Maybe only those with deep integrity will have the full benefit of the best of the next life.  I always thought all the building blocks of our world have intelligence—I agree with Elon that that must be all or nothing.  I was also pleasantly surprised to hear Elon say Israel should aim for extraordinary kindness and that an eye for an eye is a strong perspective in the Middle East!  I’ve been saying it’s hard to expect Do Unto Others and “Go the extra mile” when culturally the whole region’s kept the Abrahamic law of an eye for an eye.   “Commit extraordinary kindness”…. Well verbalized, and he’s right, that’s the only thing that would be a help.   Being a doormat or inviting repeat acts of aggression is not part & parcel of forgiveness.  Forgiveness is about not letting others’ aggression change or sour who you are inside.  A balance IS possible, but the people would have to push Netanyahu.  I don’t think he’ll come to that on his own. “Beating Hatred in the Eternal realm is the hardest boss battle.  In life and in the video game”.   I didn’t expect to rethink Diablo!",

The hospital ship he was on stopped on the side of the river and the captain made the announcement that their destination is under Russian control. The captain urged whoever could walk to get off the ship now and start walking West, as the US is only about 50km away. He ended up being a US POW, working at a dairy farm in Denmark until he was allowed to return home.",
