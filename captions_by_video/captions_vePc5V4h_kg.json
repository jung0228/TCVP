What I mean is that a shark will react if the shark detects something getting inside the water(splash) while bleeding, on the other hand if it is only blood getting in the water, the shark might think that the animal bleeding is out of the water and therefore out of reach. There has to be a reasonable possibility of food for them to make a move.(edit) minute 14:45 as you proved hitting metal, they react to sounds so a splash on the water could be more interesting for them than just the blood.",
