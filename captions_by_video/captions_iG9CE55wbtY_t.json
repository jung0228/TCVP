      "comment": "Ken touches on an important issue - the negative impact the schooling system (especially university education) has on society. The reason kids lose their natural creativity and imagination is because the schooling system, ESPECIALLY university, puts them in a box. This by the way is not some random consequence of education, but it is BY DESIGN. There is a world system (some call it the matrix, which is a metaphor for all you think the world is) and it is universities which are responsible for putting you in the box (the matrix) and maintaining this system. In other words, universities are the guardians of the system. Ken affirms this when he says at 11:20 \"They all came into being in order to meet the needs of industrialism\" and at 11:55 \"The universities designed the system in their image\".  Ken also illustrates just how blind psychiatry is by labeling ADHD as a psychiatric disorder i.e a handicap, when in fact it is actually an attribute if channeled in the right direction i.e the Arts.  Ken sums it all up very well at 18:12",
