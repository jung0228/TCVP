      "comment": "10:33 That Monet, Woman With Parasol, I well remember striking me hard in some Parisian gallery, (My wife took me around so many) in1996. The light, the mood, so evocative of a beautiful moment. I remember her rushing us past a whole roomful of Van Gogh in London, because we had already seen his locations in rural France and his work in Paris, and now she was so keen to see the Turners!",

      "comment": "That Peder Severin Krøyer painting at 9:38 caught me off guard. The sunlight scattered through leaves looks so beautiful and real but in a way that's a million times more interesting (in my opinion) than any photograph that could be taken in a similar situation. Of course I immediately went and googled the artist and discovered that the same could be said of many of his paintings. Wow, okay, I guess I'd better start planning a trip to Skagen!",

This appears to be an incongruency. A quick google search says that Leroy died in 1885. Just a heads-up. Your work is appreciated. ^^",
