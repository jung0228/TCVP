      "comment": "\"As soon as calculators got great we couldn't do math anymore, as soon as these phones came out (contacts lists) no one can remember anyone's number anymore\". That's a really good point alex brought up around the 1:00:00 mark in my opinion. I can only remember like 3 phone numbers, one of them is my own lol. Granted I can do basic math, I'm a carpenter so I kinda have to, but I'd imagine if I was an engineer/architect or really just anyone who does more sitting paper work style math, I'd have a calculator and I'd probably be even worse at math ironically lol. No that's a very good point gps as well like honestly I'm 26 and I wouldn't be able to find the job site (it being a different place every now and then all throughout my state) I think of my dad and I'm like ok how in the fuck did you figure this out before gps?? Lol no it's a good point though",
