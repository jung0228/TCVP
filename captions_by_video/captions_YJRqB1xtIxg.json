The vehicles seem to be moving along a highway or something similar.AUDIO: There's a voiceover saying \"two pints of the president's blood type\" and then mentions that the car leading is the United States Secret Service vehicle. It also says \"this car leading the secure package.\" So it seems like there might be some kind of security operation going on related to the president. What do you think about this? Do you have any ideas on why they'd need two pints of the president's blood type?"
