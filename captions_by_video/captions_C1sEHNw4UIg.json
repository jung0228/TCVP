      "comment": "​ @NoahsUniverse   I feel that you have not watched this video fully, especially the last minutes....Because here you can see the true and sincere review of someone who actually read the bible and extremely cares for the audience to have a mentality of responsibility and respect the book that binds responsiblities to every human being and here he reminds us that we are responsible for our own actions and it's consequences. Just watch his visage while he speaks on this matter -> 1:15:49 - 1:18:15 ..the guy almost burst up in tears and is so passionate that we people think our thoughts fully before violating/disregarding our conscience(to speak in the context of this timestamp.)",
