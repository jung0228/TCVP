I work in a company for the disabled that does not allow sex and after watching this I realized that no one should have any say so in our clients sex lives! I feel like sex is natural so who are we to tell them what they can and can’t do? This also irritates me because one of my clients has a girlfriend he’s been with for 10 years and he never even been able to kiss... I can only imagine the build up frustration :/ I wish companies would be a bit more open minded in how they could possibly be feeling, I like her confidence as well but not everyone is comfortable enough to come out and say something especially people with disabilities. This makes me want to make a change.",
