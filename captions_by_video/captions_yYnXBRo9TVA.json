The lowest temperature we've ever experienced here was 8 celsius, in the past.  but over the years we were used to expect for a well balanced weather between middle October and the following April. Also, during this period of the year it is normal to be raining. But year after year the average temperature is rising. And in 2018, particularly, we're almost at christmas and the weather is way far hotter than the normal (Today: 29 celsius in the evening / 19:30 pm). The UV rate today is at 15, considered at extreme level. The water volume of many rivers is decreasing year after year, and people has suffering with lack of pipered water in many days of the year. Sun power is like 200% of the normal and it's been hard to live here without using an air conditioner or sunscreen many hours a day. No, the world isn't getting warmer, definitely. We should just rake the floor of the forest.",

Look it up, Trump was right. Germany is fast becoming dependent on Russia for their energy needs, that too can be verified. But is that a bad thing? Trump goads them into reality and reconsidering. Those laughing government officials, including Merkel are communist sympathizers, as Merkel's dad was a devoted communist who moved her and his family from Western Germany to communist Eastern Germany, where she was raised. No joking matter. Trump is right again. Those who laugh, do so out of ignorance. Paris is most Definitely no longer Paris. Look up videos of vast immigrant homelessness! Streets are littered. And now French citizens are rioting. Trump proved right again, like a prophet! I too have a friend, she's from Europe, and well before the California fires she commented: we clean the forests to keep them healthy and safe. How? I asked. We sweep the forest floor. What? We cut out the undergrowth to sweep it clean. Now I'm ignorant on this point, but I have a friend who shared that with me. Me thinks Trump was right again!
