In a college year I have to try my hardest not to skip my first deadline, because if I skip one then for the rest of the year, deadlines seem irrelevant. Its like my monkey has now seen that the panic monster is harmless really, and it now isn't scared of it for the rest of the semester, until some major change happens and at the semester end it is like my brain presses a reset button.  And the cycle starts all over again and my monkey is again scared of the panic monster until it skips a deadline,...... And so on and so forth.",
