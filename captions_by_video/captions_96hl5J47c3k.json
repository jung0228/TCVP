      "comment": "I know that abstraction like fun patterns on plates or the carvings in picture frames have been around, but I wonder how it felt to look at a cubist painting for the first time. I remember in 2010 or so when I first heard dubstep. I hated it, because it felt like my brain was melting a little bit, but I knew that it was too interesting and engrossing to NOT bleed into all other kinds of music. And now it's easy to listen to. When I see abstract art, or art where the colors are strange like the painting at 1:16, I am totally unbothered. You could make that highlighter yellow with eye tricks and zebra stripes and I won't be fazed. I wonder if van gogh made people's brains feel all melty.",
