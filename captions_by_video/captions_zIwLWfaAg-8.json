The human race will just be more fossils on this little world.   The solar system is a shooting gallery. We will get hit one of these days. The plates of the Earth are moving, one of these days they will shift dramatically as they have in the past, and we will lose millions, maybe billions, of lives. We have a large number of nuclear weapons, it's only a matter of time before a mistake is made and disaster strikes. ... That's not even touching diseases, or general climate change, or things like super volcanoes. These aren't scare tactics. These are facts.
