The number \"1\" appears next to his name, Benjamin Pavard, and it says \"France v Argentina.\" The FIFA TV logo is also visible.AUDIO: There's music playing throughout the entire clip. It seems like an energetic piece, possibly related to sports or a game. No specific speech or sound effects can be heard from the players or other sources. So, that's my analysis based on just those six seconds. What do you think about it? Do you have any other questions regarding this video?"

The goalkeeper in orange is trying to block it. The crowd in the background looks excited.AUDIO: There's some music playing throughout the video. It seems like there might be some commentary or announcements too, but they're not very clear. Oh, and at one point, there's applause from the crowd. So, that's about it! What do you think about the game?"
