One person walks across the patio towards the fire pit area.AUDIO: Someone is speaking about wanting to have the experience of seeing something even if it didn't last long in the sun. It seems like they're reflecting on a past event related to the sun. There's no other significant sound in the audio except for the speaker's voice.If you want to talk more about this video or share your thoughts, feel free to let me know!"

          "query": "VISUAL: The video shows a backyard at night with some people working on a pool area under a tarp. There's also a fire pit lit up nearby. Then it transitions to a daytime scene where a man is standing near a pool, holding something red. He seems to be doing some kind of work or maintenance. The background has houses and mountains.\n\nAUDIO: There's no clear audio described here. It just says \"effort\" which doesn't give much context about any specific sounds. So, I can't really describe anything from the audio part. What do you think about this video? Do you have any other questions related to it?"
