I know of many people who ultimately value their (induced-by-other) trauma. A famous example is the Stockdale Paradox. This guy was a POW for something like 8 years and he had this to say: \"“I never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of my life, which, in retrospect, I would not trade.” While the story of survival and perserverence is impressive to say \"I'm glad I was a POW and suffered through torture\" is a bit troubling.",

And happiness is seemingly the most 2 dimensional, boring and useless of all the emotions. I’m never driven to do something if I’m happy. So, lemme simplify my life and cut it out a bit. This pattern of thinking “happiness= a wast of time” eventually became automatic and, I would rather think sad, depressing thoughts than happy ones. I actually gave myself depression. Like, bad depression. Like 2 years into this and I was like “wait. I’m depressed. And I actually did this deliberately. Broooo. I’m an idiot” and laughed my ass off for like 20 mins. So than I was like “ok. Some happiness is way more useful than none at all. Imma just think some happy thoughts again, even if I think they are delusional, and maybe I can balance out and forget this ever happened. And like 4 months later, that worked. So yeah. I think if you are in the opposite boat where you think happiness is dumb….don’t like use this video as confirmation bias. You have to at least see it as like, neutral. Because, it is important. Like, why tf would you ever commit to anything or take a risk if it’s not gonna work out. Or like, go out if your comfort zone if you don’t care. It’s like, these sorts of videos are decent for those who already properly understand what this dude is talking about. It’s like “oh yeah. I’ve been slacking. Thank you.” But, if you are 19 year old me, and an idiot….think first. Lmfao.",

The sun is low on the horizon, casting a warm glow over the water and sand. After that, there's a forest scene with tall trees and sunlight filtering through the branches.AUDIO: A male voice is speaking throughout the video. It seems like he's explaining something related to sunlight, but I can't make out all the words clearly.What do you think about these two scenes? Do they seem interesting to you?"
