I'm surprised these phone reviews never go over more of the UI aspects of phones. I've been using my dads Samsung and the notifications are weird and unreadable, the default apps are ugly and hard to navigate. The hundreds of details all over the phone from of the base UI are just ugly. These are MASSIVE factors for me. Those sort of things you have to deal with ALL day for years. More attention should be applied to this stuff as it's in my opinion far more important than the hardware. I want to see a side by side comparison of the swipe down menu between all 3 big phones. Or the swipe up menu to switch apps etc.",
