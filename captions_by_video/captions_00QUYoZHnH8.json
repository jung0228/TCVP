      "comment": "3:35 ~ 3:40 the reason isn’t that simple. If timezones are applyed correctly to each country, 12 o’clock should be the time when the sunlight perpendiculary meets the surface area your country is on. To put it easier, at 12 PM the sun should be directly above your head.  For political & historical reasons, South Korea(seoul) follows Japan(tokyo)’s timezone. But as you can see on the map, seoul is further west to tokyo. Because of that, the sun doesn’t meet the land perpendiculary at 12 in seoul. It actually does at 12:30PM. So South Korea uses a timezone that is 30 minutes earlier than what is should be. North korea is actually using a ‘correct’ timezone.  P.S (edit) - north korea now uses the same timezone as south korea",
