      "comment": "I share this with you because I love you all deeply. I dont share to push anything, but there is an urgency and I want to share because I care.  Time is so short, and our lives are like vapors. We all share in common that one day we will die, and none of us know that day or hour, but it will come and it's important to know where we'll be for eternity. There are only two places, heaven or hell; there is no in between state. There is only one way to heaven, and that's through Jesus. He is the way, the truth, and the life just as His word says. I get being unsure, I get the world we live in throwing out all kinds of things anymore, and it can be hard to know what the truth is, but there is an absolute truth and it is Jesus, and His work on the cross for our salvation, so believing in Him we can have peace in our eternity. We are all sinners in need of a Savior, and Christ knew we could not and can not save ourselves. So God Himself came down in the flesh and lived the perfect righteous life for us, fulfilling all the commandments.  He was then crucified and willingly layed down His life and was forsaken by the Father on the cross to take the punishment for all our sins. He was buried and rose again on the third day. His resurrection defeated death, and proved that His punishment was payment enough for the Father for our sins. For the wages of sin is death, but Jesus paid our wages with His death and ressurection! He did all of this so that through Him we would now have a way to heaven, to be with Him forever because He loves us. He died our death. He was spotless and blameless for us, and when we believe in Him, He imputes His righteousness to us, and cleanses us of all our sins.  I pray that you would not turn your heart to this, or shrug it off, or think about it later Please think about it now, there is no promise of later for anyone.   If you are unsure, please be sure either way, that yes Jesus is who He says He is, or no He is not. Seek the Truth, and Jesus says if you seek Him you will find Him. He IS the truth you will discover. Eternity is on the line, and more so than ever in history He is returning so soon, and unexpectantly to those that dont believe, and He wishes for none to perish, but all to come to faith. God loves you fiercely. He created you and knew you before time even began, He had you in mind, and demonstrated His love that while we were yet sinners Christ died on the cross for us. To redeem us to Him. He has made a way for you, and all you have to do is call out to Him. Realize you are a sinner before a Holy God, and in need of a Savior. Repent (change of mind and heart) of your sins, and believe in the finished redemptive work of Jesus Christ on the cross alone for the remission of all your sins (past, present, future) and eternal life!   When you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart man believes and is justified and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Roman's 10: 9-10)   For it is by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works lest any man should boast (Epehsians 2:8-9)  Call on the name of the Lord. All who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved (Roman's 10:13)  https://savedmag.com/bill-gates-quantum-dot-digital-tattoo-implant-to-track-covid-19-vaccine-compliance/",

      "comment": "REPENT AND SEEK GOD!  Crazy times are upon us.  There’s no denying it.  Jesus Christ could very well crack the sky open and return quite soon.  Our only recourse is to recognize our need for HIM, REPENT (turn from our own thinking/mindset/ways), and SEEK GOD alone in His Word and prayer.  Only HE can wake us up and reveal to us accurately the condition of our own heart, and the season we’re in as a nation/world.                         “Is there anything I need to get right with God?”    This should be at the forefront of our minds right now.  Let’s ASK the LORD to show us anything we need to deal with, and TRUST Him to show us.  He promises we’ll find Him IF/WHEN we seek Him with our WHOLE HEART.  We must do that, now!  God is a righteous God!    SIN CANNOT AND WILL NOT ENTER HIS KINGDOM!   WE MUST REPENT NOW BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE!   HE’S STILL GIVING US TIME!!  Behold, the LORD’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, or His ear dull, that it cannot hear, but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear.  (Isaiah 59:1-2)  (We do not REPENT to a priest or fellow man.  There is only one Mediator between God and man - the LORD Jesus Christ.  He broke open the Holy of Holies when He died on the cross.  We REPENT directly to our Father God!)  Seek the LORD while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near.  Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.  “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,” says the LORD.  “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.”   (Isaiah 55:6-9)  “YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN!”  Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”  Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old?  Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”  Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’  The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes.  So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”  (John 3:3-7)   Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?”   Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.”  (Acts 2:37-38)  1. Repent from your sins =      Turn completely from your own ways  2. Be baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ      (after repentance) = Understanding that the old you is      DYING WITH CHRIST, and that you are RISING ANEW into      a completely new life, to be lived as Christ determines from      now on!       Old things are PASSED AWAY –      BEHOLD ALL THINGS HAVE BECOME NEW!  3. Be filled with the Holy Spirit of God =      This is not a “feeling”, but a LIFESTYLE      of ABSOLUTE SURRENDER to Jesus Christ,      and being led moment by moment by His Holy Spirit!!  Please surrender to Jesus Christ if you haven’t already!  It’s not about religion.  It’s about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.    We must cast down EVERYTHING to do with SELF and ALL false religion and tradition that perverts the truth of God’s Word in ANY WAY, and SURRENDER TO GOD, HIS WAY, as He reveals to us in His Word!    We MUST be done with ALL OTHER THINGS we’re leaning on.    We CANNOT trust in SELF or OTHERS, ONLY GOD!  Do not receive the mark of the beast!  Thus says the LORD, “Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart departs from the LORD.  For he shall be like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land which is not inhabited...   Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose hope is the LORD.  For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river, and will not fear when heat comes; but its leaf will be green, and will not be anxious in the year of drought, nor will cease from yielding fruit.”  (Jeremiah 17:5-8)  LET US TURN TODAY FROM ALL OTHER ‘gods’ AND ‘idols’, TO THE ONE TRUE GOD, WHO ALONE MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH AND IS WORTHY OF ALL GLORY HONOR AND PRAISE!!  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers… For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance...   And you became followers of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit... Your faith toward God has gone out… how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.      (I Thessalonians 1:1b-10)  You may watch an encouraging movie on the power and love of God working through His disciples TLRmovie.com Shalom!",
