Now that you'll be a father, this will be the legacy of pewdiepie, a great legacy to leave behind. I still remember back in 2013 when I first got a hold of your channel, and now, reminiscing of the war with T-Series, and everything that came after, it's great to remember all those tales, a good memory, and a teary eye. You'll forever be the number one in the world. 👊",

It has a sort of upbeat, energetic vibe. No specific speech or sound effects stand out.Anything else you noticed in the video that you want to talk about?"

Then it cuts to a man sitting on a red and black gaming chair, talking directly to the camera.AUDIO: There's some music playing in the background during the first part.
