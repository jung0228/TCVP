I'm slightly confused though as to what the point of sharing it was? And to be honest, I'm completely confused as to what the point of Fox sharing the details of the deaths were? I didn't hear anything that refuted a single thing that Trevor said? The point of the Black Lives Matter movement is that Black people are being killed by white police officers DISPROPORTIONATELY to white people in this country. For as many cases of people being shot and killed after attacking police officers that were mentioned in the video, there are just as many cases of completely innocent people being killed. But Fox refuses to acknowledge that, right? A lot of these things go both ways, I'd be careful with who you dare to watch things.",
