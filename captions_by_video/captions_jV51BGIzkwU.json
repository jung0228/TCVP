There's even a shot at 2:44 where the car's clock goes back in time.  That aside, I am now interested in what sort of repairs the Range Rover needed after this race.  Being able to do these sorts of things once vs being able to do them all the time is a pretty big difference for the owner.  An off-roader isn't really an off-roader if it requires a trip to the mechanic every time you take it off-road.",
