And he gave him the name Jesus.  I urge Muslim brothers/sisters to compare with Issa of Quran",

      "comment": "This account of three religions is totally unfounded and delusional at best, since true Christianity is not a religion, that anyone would discover if they would take the time to read the Word of God. Christianity is all about Jesus Christ, who came as a man, to pay for the sins of the world. Only that sacrifice would satisfy the perfect and righteous demands of God the Father who is perfect, and cannot tolerate sin. This was done out love. when we recognize that we, being sinners, can receive forgiveness of sins by confessing, then asking Jesus to come in and indwell us, that is what Christianity is all about. Christianity is a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, God the Son. That guarantees us life guided by Him who knows best in this life , and an eternity with Him in heaven. The Bible tells us in Acts 4:12 \"Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\" Find the immense love of God today, for He loves you and wants to have a relationship with you. try it. You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain.",
