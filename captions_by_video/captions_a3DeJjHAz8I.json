When I first heard the word chimp, I thought it would be like those cute lil monkeys in a carnival. But as I read many articles and saw pics(ex 1:44) the chimp was HUGE! (200lb, hence gorilla?)Moreover this thing is a wild animal. Okay, Dogs and cats are pets, but wild animals wll always hv that \"killer instinct\". After all, you'll nvr know when a wild animal may snap on u no matter how friendly it is",
