      "comment": " @gustavoandrade58  You are wasting your time.  Here are a few fun passages from the Bible. Like when the Lord says baby’s will be eviscerated;  \"See, the day of the Lord is coming — a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger. . . . I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty. . . . Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives violated.\" (Isaiah 13:9–16 NIV)  Or when the Lord threatens rape of Israelites who are being attacked by the Babylonians; \"Hear and give ear; do not be haughty, for the Lord has spoken. . . . And if you say in your heart, 'Why have these things come upon me?' it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up, and you are violated . . . because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies. I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen.\" (Jeremiah 13:15–26 NRSV)   I have always thought this was the worst verse in the bible, and my opinion remains unchanged.  \"O daughter Babylon, you devastator! Happy shall they be who pay you back what you have done to us! Happy shall they be who take your little ones and dash them against the rock!\"(Psalm 137:8–9 NRSV)  God was not merely saying that regrettable collateral damage might occur during wartime. He said believers should be happy — some translations say \"blessed\" — to kill innocent babies of those who are keeping you from worshipping your own god.  So present an argument that is valid, without you being a hypocrite",
