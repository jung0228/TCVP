The only way the ball should move to the left is 1. if the ball was spinning the other way or 2. if the air on the left travels all the way around the ball parallel with its spin, but that's not what the diagram shows. You see what I mean? EDIT: Oh wait I get it now, I guess the ball has little resistance against the air so that allows it to easily spin along the air on the right and the left air blowing over it pushes it away from the right air, so that makes sense, yeah. It's just that if the ball's spin was fully resisted by the air, then the diagram would make no sense. And even then, the diagram could still be wrong if the air had enough resistance on the ball's spin to overpower the amount of spin you applied to it and thus not allow it to spin.",
