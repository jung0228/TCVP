      "comment": "I can’t believe I’ve never watched this before! It’s so cool to hear what bob says, because it confirms so many things my family have told me before. So my aunt actually used to be one of the flight attendants for Area 51 for over 40+ years(now retired), she would fly people in daily. Once they land in Area 51 she had to stay there all day until the team was ready to go. She said that they had a full gym, lounge area to watch soap opera’s to stay busy for the attendants. As far as bob talking about the ship (32:45) and it being cold to the touch and the material it was made of, my grandpa was a space x engineer and was sent to Area 51 for a test on a material around the 1950’s-1960’s. They did all there standard testing that they would do for space crafts on this thin sheet of metal he said was as thin as tin foil. They froze it, heated up as high as they could and said it was completely cold to the touch. They also took a sledge hammer and tried making a dent in it and it didn’t do a thing! I’m just blown away. I think this is so cool and I’m glad this video continues to surface and bob gets his recognition!",

      "comment": "🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🛸 Bob Lazar worked at S4, a subset of Area 51, on advanced propulsion systems for UFOs. 03:30 📑 Bob received a letter from EG&G, leading to an interview and a job at S4 with a focus on power and propulsion systems of alien spacecraft. 06:05 🌐 On his first day, Bob encountered a flying saucer in a hangar, marking the start of his involvement with extraterrestrial technology. 11:05 🛠️ Briefings indicated the goal was to back engineer the alien craft, and Bob's specific role focused on power and propulsion. 15:45 🌍 Nine different extraterrestrial crafts were housed at S4, each unique in design, but details about their origin were limited. 17:09 ⚠️ Bob expressed concerns about the lack of understanding of the technology and the potential dangers involved in working with such advanced systems. 19:29 🌌 Paperwork suggested the crafts were from the Zeta Reticuli star system, specifically ZR3, but Bob couldn't verify the accuracy of this information. 20:51 🌌 Bob Lazar discusses Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system, and mentions it's where the technology he worked on may have originated. 25:31 🌀 The reactor had a base similar to a cyclotron, and Element 115 was a key fuel. The stable version of Element 115, acquired from the craft, defied known physics. 31:19 👽 The inside of the craft had three small seats around the reactor, no control panels, and minimal recognizable components. It seemed designed for beings smaller than humans. 34:11 🤔 Bob Lazar speculates on the different roles of sections within the craft, mentioning gravity amplifiers, emitters, and a potential navigation or computer system. 35:34 📏 The estimated size of the craft is around 52 feet in diameter. Bob Lazar mentions seeing nine different crafts, each with distinct designs and sizes. 38:22 🕵️ Bob Lazar's work involved limited hours and unusual scheduling. He worked on testing and analyzing the craft, violating traditional thermodynamic principles. 43:33 🚀 The UFO demonstrated impressive maneuvers, lifting off quietly, hovering silently, and making left-right movements, defying conventional physics. 45:22 🛣️ Test flights of the craft were scheduled on Wednesdays with lower highway traffic, emphasizing secrecy around Area 51. Lazar had the test flight schedule, allowing him to witness more radical maneuvers. 47:38 👽 Lazar's secretive work led to strained personal relationships, with his wife suspecting an affair due to the monitored phone calls, creating additional stress in his life. 49:42 📹 Lazar took friends to witness a test flight, capturing video footage that George Knapp possesses. Multiple witnesses confirm the sighting, adding credibility to Lazar's account. 51:47 🎥 Lazar's decision to go public was influenced by the need for witnesses and validation. The video evidence, though limited due to the technology of the time, supports his claims. 55:28 🤐 After getting caught during a test flight observation, Lazar underwent debriefing, and transcripts of monitored phone calls were used to emphasize the need for secrecy. 01:00:57 🛸 The government's acknowledgment of UFOs goes beyond 1969's Project Blue Book; they continue studying and even aim to reverse-engineer UFO technology. 01:01:40 🔄 Terminology shift from UFO/UAP to AAV (Advanced Aerospace Vehicles) in official documents aims to align public perception with classified information. 01:01:52 🗣️ Hillary Clinton informed the public about the shift from UFO to UAP nomenclature, emphasizing the government's seriousness in studying these phenomena. 01:02:33 📡 The significance of studying UFOs lies in credible data from visual pilots and radar systems, proving their aerospace nature. 01:05:49 ⚛️ Bob Lazar's prediction about gravity waves was validated by the detection of gravitational waves in 2015, supporting his claims. 01:11:13 📄 The Wilson Memo suggests a recurring pattern in UFO-related projects, involving putting away and revisiting technology every 8-10 years, emphasizing private industry's role in control. 01:16:03 🏞️ The $22 million government-funded program (AATIP) aimed to study Skinwalker Ranch phenomena, indicating government interest in unusual sightings and events. 01:17:14 🕵️‍♂️ The Wilson Memo, confirming the meeting between Admiral Wilson and a scientist, reveals challenges in accessing non-terrestrial materials due to private industry control. 01:19:06 📼 After George Knapp obtained the tape, five o'clock news showed the UFO, leading to threats and consequences for Bob Lazar and people connected to him. 01:19:51 🕵️‍♂️ Coming forward about Area 51 negatively impacted the lives of people connected to Bob, with audits, clearance revocations, and other consequences for those associated with secure programs. 01:20:19 🤔 Despite assurances, going public didn't protect Bob Lazar, causing significant stress and challenges, as he faced skepticism and potential threats. 01:21:00 🌌 Bob discusses the profound implications of the UFO discovery, questioning why the government keeps it secret, and highlighting the importance of addressing humanity's two big questions: the existence of extraterrestrial life and the meaning of life. 01:23:42 🚀 Bob Lazar suggests that the advanced technology, particularly force fields, makes a nation invincible, creating a motive for governments to keep it secret and gain a strategic advantage. 01:27:02 🛸 Discussion on recent UFO sightings, specifically the Gimbal craft, and how it aligns with the behavior and propulsion systems of the crafts Bob Lazar claims to have worked on. 01:28:52 🤖 Different UFO shapes reported over time might serve various purposes, implying different tasks for these unidentified objects, challenging the conventional saucer-shaped UFO stereotype. 01:35:07 🌌 Speculation on the evolution of extraterrestrial beings, suggesting they might be synthetic organisms with no reproductive organs, influenced by a different form of technological progression. 01:36:32 🔄 Reflecting on human civilization as the sex organs of the machine world, drawing parallels between technological innovation and the biological imperative to reproduce. 01:37:16 🤖 Elon Musk discussed on Joe Rogan's podcast that humans are already cyborgs, integrating technology like phones and watches into their lives. 01:38:41 💡 There's a biological progression and integration with technology, driven by a need for technological innovation that seems tied to materialism. 01:39:53 🐒 Primatologists suggest that monkeys and chimps are entering a stone age, using tools and experimenting, similar to human technological evolution. 01:42:41 🤔 Mention of Ted Kaczynski and his ideas about the negative consequences of technologicalprogress. 01:43:37 🛸 Discussion on the possibility of extraterrestrial influence on Earth's development and the idea that aliens might observe and influence civilizations. 01:48:04 🌌 Speculation on the uniformity of the cosmos and the potential biological uniformity in the universe, leading to similar patterns of development. 01:51:43 🛰️ Brief mention of classified projects related to weapon systems, time distortion, and gravity affecting time in advanced crafts. 01:53:11 📡 Discussion on a UFO's rapid movement, potentially involving a gravity distortion field or time dilation effect. 01:55:07 🌐 Tesla's concept of wireless electricity explored; potential consequences on modern electronics if implemented. 01:56:45 👽 Speculation on the difficulty of imagining technological progression for an alien civilization and the impact of different starting points. 01:57:28 🔍 Bob Lazar describes a unique honeycomb hatch in the craft, its collapse mechanism, and its relatability to human understanding. 01:58:36 🧩 Bob Lazar's past faced efforts to erase his education and employment history, including disappearance of his birth certificate; verification challenges. 02:00:57 🤔 Discussion on a biometric device (handprint scanner) used at S4 for security clearances, showcasing how Bob's badge was activated through bone measurements. 02:06:07 🕵️‍♂️ Verification of Bob's employment history at Los Alamos through a 1982 phone book directory and a visit to the facility with George Knapp. 02:08:56 📜 Bob Lazar reflects on the challenges of being discredited, emphasizing the fuel provided to skeptics and the dangers of confirmation bias. 02:09:24 🌎 Joe Rogan acknowledges the importance of the podcast in providing a clear and concise platform for Bob Lazar to address the world, discussing the credibility accumulated over theyears. 02:11:28 😷 Bob Lazar's initial anxiety and migraine attributed to the 30 years of persecution and attempts to erase his past;

      "comment": "@44:50 I really want to believe Bob, but his general lack of details on basically everything is unnerving. Most everything he says is something that can be thought up with a creative mind after watching star wars, which had just come out a few years prior to when he says this took place. Elements on the periodic table are setup that way for a reason based on properties and doesn't prove too much. For example at this timestamped moment. He describes the moment as it should be and how it could be envisioned, but sounds like it's not been lived. He never mentions, \"I\" walked underneath the craft or it moved above \"me\" and it disappeared from my point of view from the gravity influence. This is your first time seeing it hover around, and you act like that's supposed to be known that it disappears when its above you. Like you spent hours there everyday working on a project for 6 months and don't have exact dimensions measured of everything? You \"estimated\" the craft to be roughly 52 feet in diameter that you were working on for 6 months? Doesn't 52 feet in diameter seem a little big for something that holds three, 3 foot tall creatures with a basketball sized power source. He fails to mention much of any details from the briefings he had read before working on the craft when asked about them multiple times. What tests were made on every inch of the ship? What chemicals did you test on the outer shell? Did any acids effect it? Would the material heat up or change colors if you took a blow torch right against it? There was a bullet hole through one so how strong can it be? You guys didn't try to pound on it with a hammer? There's no buttons or anything at all in the craft but this other group is working on the craft and made the dash go transparent somehow and you didn't try to figure out where the button is?  It honestly sounds like something out of a very vivid dream someone may have, being able to easily recall and never forget the experience, but lacking detailed information and only remembering the main points. That being said I still believe we are probably in possession of otherworldly craft. If we had these craft for that long though and have been reverse engineering them. Im curious as to an example of technology that could have stemmed from studying these craft over all these years that might be widely used for different purposes today? But If I properly went through the process of a degree and putting effort in to become a physicist, my title on a google search would not read \"self proclaimed physicist\".",
