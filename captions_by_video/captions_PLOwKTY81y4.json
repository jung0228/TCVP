What’s happening to our world this 2020 get’s all of us thinking just how fragile life is, and just how little we have control over things. We need God. We need to step off of our high horses and humble ourselves, acknowledge that we need God. And He will make things better again.   2 Chronicles 7:14  “if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” <— this right here is the answer. 👍🏻",

Even sinners love those who love them. 33 And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. 34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.  35 But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back.

It was 10:30 pm when my mom called so we talked for about 2 minutes and then i heard a loud bang. The call just ended after that loud bang so i was worried for my mom. I tried to call her for 30 min straight then she picked up and said \"well talk tomorrow bby\". Then i went to my aunt's house for brunch and told what happened yesterday. She also said that if i wouldn't have called her my mom would've died/injured because the house that my mom lives in is close where the bomb exploded. (How you might ask? Well she went somewhere that has phones so that she could call me.)  Ps: sorry for my bad english",
