Ill just say the impression that they believe all western women are promiscuous. Also they like to use dirty english words like \"pu**y\" and \"di*k\".",

There are other people walking around him, some in business attire. The background shows red brick buildings typical of London.AUDIO: There's a male voice speaking throughout the clip. It seems like he's talking about feeling at home while doing what he wants, having friends visit Japan who enjoyed it for two weeks, but then mentioning something negative at the end, though it's not clear what exactly. There's no music or sound effects, just the man's speech.If you have any more questions about this or want to discuss something else related to videos, feel free to let me know!"
