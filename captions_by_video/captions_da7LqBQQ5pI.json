I'm just surprised that she actually knew the exact reason why I (and perhaps a lot of guys as well) watch porn almost everyday. Basically it's a fantasy, since I can't have it in reality. In real life, an introverted & socially-awkward guy like me always have a very hard time to attract girls, even though a lot of people have said that I'm quite good-looking myself for a guy, not to mention also quite privileged, & I'm a musician as well. I don't think people truly realize/understand how hard it is for some guys to get a girl. I guess that's why there is also an \"incel\" & \"MGTOW\" things now which is growing.",
