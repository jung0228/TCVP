Again with the women suffer because; men weren't shown how to be men. I think the one's that really suffer in this case are the men. Not the women.

The left has lost its way because they had no end state, they don't know what to do so they create friction so they can continue the fight.",

Then, suddenly, the public sentiment shifted leftwards after the arrival of a fresh, socially-focused, vision represented by the then Tony Blair and New Labour. Up until then all we had was the stone-like, clockwork, soul-less right who had atrophied. Now we are seeing the reverse where the left liberals have become the ideology that we need to break free from to move forward.",

Immense is the wisdom of the LORD; he is mighty in power and all-seeing.  The eyes of God see all he has made; he understands man's every deed.  No man does he command to sin, to none does he give strength for lies.  Say not: I am hidden from God;  in heaven who remembers me?  Among so many people I cannot be known;  what am I in the world of spirits?  Behold, the heavens, the heaven of heavens,  the earth and the abyss tremble at his visitation;  the roots of the mountains, the earth's foundations,  at his mere glance, quiver and quake.  Of me, therefore,  he will take no thought;  If I sin, no eye will see me;  if all in secret I am disloyal,  who is to know?  Who tells him of just deeds?  And what could I expect for doing my duty?”  Such are the thoughts of senseless men,  which only the foolish knave will think.   Jesus O Savior  I know not if you are real  Come  Come  live in me ..
