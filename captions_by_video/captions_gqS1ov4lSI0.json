You are not to support other causes. - But you claim Islam is a religion of peace and mercy. What a joke! 4. You have the fasting but when people cannot fast during the month, you pay somebody to fast on your behalf, and you earn righteousness! - But you deny what Christ Jesus did for you on the cross and His resurrection so that believers can get His righteousness (Rom4:25); 5. You go on perform the pilgrimage, but we heard what happened to the women (*being sexually abused) at the “holey place”. - Al Fadi",

Everyone can learn from this, if anything, the art of dialogue and what we can gain from it.  Second, from the start of 18:00 you start to talk about accountability with Mohamed Hijab. I think everyone should listen to this from all sides of this conflict. We need to separate the individuals from the ideology. I think what most people have against the west is this baseless idea that western ideology is the solution to all problems. That it's the only right way of doing things and people take this idea too personally. While in fact, we shouldn't.",

      "comment": "He expounds biblical text? He doesn’t submit himself to the Lord Jesus Christ and is an ecumenist. He really believes that Jews, Christians, and Muslims all serve the same God “of the Book.” Except that’s not even remotely true, as the Bible is clear that the Lord broke the covenant he made with Israel for their betrayal of Christ and only cared about a Messiah (Messiah is Hebrew coming into English and Christ is Greek coming into English, but they both mean the same thing…the anointed one of God…the Christ, the Messiah.  The Jews rejected him because he wasn’t the Messiah they were expecting. They read all the scriptures about God making Israel the shining beacon of the world that all the gentiles will come to. They weren’t looking for the Messiah of Isaiah 53 who is the suffering Savior to brutally die to take on the sin and iniquity of his people. That’s what the name Jesus Christ (comes from the name יֵשׁוּ הַנוֹצרִי in Hebrew into English)…Jesus is also the name that comes from Greek into English, though that name from the Hebrew into English is Joshua…Joshua and Jesus…both names mean “salvation of the LORD” or as the angel Gabriel told Mary that his name would be JESUS for he shall save his people from their sins.  I explain all this linguistic territory, because the Jews didn’t want a meek Savior coming to preach his gospel to save men’s souls…they just wanted a savior to come and break off Rome. They are still half-blinded to this unto this day because the Bible says that Jews are half blind right now, they can only see the law of God but not the grace of God (Romans 11:1-10).  The Muslims have a completely false gospel. They have a false prophet (curses be upon him) who is burning in hell right now, and so will every Muslim that follows that wicked false prophet will go to the same place he went. The Quran and hadiths make no sense and are contradictory, in so many ways that I can’t get into over a YouTube comment. The catholic church actually sent Muhammad to the Arabs (Muhammad was of a white complexion, the hadiths explain this): references being Sahih Bukhari 4:56:767, Sahih Bukhari 1:8:367, Sahih Muslim 8:3325, Sahih Muslim 4:1014, Sunan Abu Dawud 3:1169 and so many others. Muhammad was a white man. As I said, the pope of Rome sent him out to subjugate the Arabs for the papacy but it ended up turning on them when the Muslims tried invading Spain and other European nations. But the whole point was to drag the Arabs into submitting to the catholic whore. But look at the Quran, it exalts Mary more than Muhammad….  Biblical Christians are the only ones with the truth because we have the full canon of biblical text. We’re hated throughout all the world just like Christ told us as the world hated him, they’ll hate us also. We know where this world is heading. We have a living God. Eventually (in a time soon coming) there will be a false messiah who will lead Israel and eventually the entirety of the world. He will be working by the power of Satan and people will be deceived into thinking he is the true coming of Christ.  Jordan Peterson knows nothing of these things, and I don’t say that with any pride. Jordan Peterson helped me to come out of my bitter atheism in 2017 and eventually God pulled me out of the pit and darkness I was in in October 2018 and I was born again and became a child of God. The Lord Jesus Christ can save to the uttermost. People must repent of their life of sin and turn to the true God and Savior Jesus Christ.",

Pageau said more with his silence than the other two said with all their words. He clearly inhabits Christian virtue -- gentle, kind, more inclined to listen than to speak, more interested in understanding than being understood, and comfortably at home in his relationship with God. His smile at 35:09 is priceless, especially compared to Jordan's somewhat dour expression. I also liked how he refused to take the floor when Peterson asked him to speak, firm in his faith and not needing to explain himself to anyone. Amazing. Subscribed.",

      "comment": "21:10 Mohammed speaks about all of the downfalls of western societies in particular he mentioned how slavery continues into the 1800s the trans Atlantic slave trade specifically ..  let's use the same argument but instead of the western worlds we look at the Arabian peninsula for a  better example shall we?  Slavery was not legally abolished in Qatar until 1952, in Saudi Arabia it wasn't until 1963, in the sultanate of Oman slavery was still a legal practice until 1970 .. but that's not taught in our mainstream western academics it's most certainly not widely spoken of in the public domain, I think slavery is abhorrent regardless of whom the perpetrators are, or whomever it's perpetrated against. But my point being it only ever seems to be the western world who gets a finger wagged at it and told,  \"Now you sit down and shut up you've been a bad influence on the world.\" Now I'm certainly not saying that our system hasn't got it's structural flaws but the flaws that presented themselves weren't ignored or even worse defended by the west but within the Arabian peninsula there is a doctrinal obligation which means you cannot question let alone critique the religious texts from which the society is based upon the West as it were sought to put an end to those heinous ideologies which would see any person as less than another or permit one to take for themselves another person as property and it was rather successful at that for the most part at least within their own remit, now the religious texts I've been speaking of, is of course the Quran and the Hadiths which I would invite anyone to study if for no other reason than to have a comparative of the Abrahamic teachings but those texts would permit such awful, immoral, inhumane, acts of intolerance if ever they were implemented into a western society or into the legal system. That being said I don't tar every Muslim with the same brush but Islamists in particular and the evidence of this is on the surface level you don't have to dig far to find the rot but they have set out to overthrow and undermine the liberties for which the western world has fought/died for so they might implant either by Dawah or force Islamic Sharia ... If you enjoy your freedoms then that's not something you'd want.   I write this in the hopes that not only Mr.Peterson but also anyone who has read this far might research into the theology of Islam as he has read into the theology of Christianity somewhat extensively.",
