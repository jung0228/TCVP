What creates the earthquakes are energy after tension is released, like a rubberband being stretched before releasing (except the energy building up is from external/outward friction of two independent elements). Edit: That's also why the quakes have different magnitudes, and some areas experience larger than others in general - because of the shapes on the tectonic plates.  Would appreciate it if you didn't spread misinformation.",
