And he does it so effortlessly that makes it all even more beautiful.",

      "comment": "11:53- This is a powerful spiritual experience. As a jazz saxophone musician, there were times during my improvisational solo that suddenly, my fingers were moving by themselves, playing perfect notes, beautifully and blissfully, without me thinking about what to play or how to play the notes. The mechanical, physical work of thinking and playing the keys was on autopilot, and freed my brain to observe and enjoy my solo concerto. But the moment I realized, or became aware of what was going on, I guess I was startled, and instantly took back physical cognition, interrupted the flow, and went back to the thinking-work process. I told another musician about it, and he said that I was in the 'zone' On another instance, I was playing in a church group, and Interestingly, when I mentioned it to my guitar player, church musician, he said that I was in the secret place of the Most High! I guess I cut the branch that I was sitting on when I returned to my physical self awareness. I say I was captured by the Holy Spirit, which, by the way, very few leaders, spiritual and non-spiritual speakers every mention. I had an unusual experience in a Pentecostal church while playing music. It was rationally unexplainable.",

Now as I begin this biblical series, I decided to pull a small core sample out of the lecture for display purposes. :)    Word of the Day: Inviolable  - \"never to be broken, infringed, or dishonored.\"  --- 1:22:00 - \"Morality for me is about action. I'm an existentialist and what that means is - I believe that what people believe to be true is what they act out, not what they say.   So there are lots of definitions of truth; truth is a very expansive word and you can think about Objective truth, but behavioral truth is not the same as objective truth.  What you should do isn't the same as what is, as far as I can tell, and people debate that but I think the reason this has to be the case is because [a field doesn't tell you how to walk across it. Since there are an infinite number of ways to walk across a field, you can't extract out an inviolable guide to how you should act based on the array of facts that are in front of you; there are just too many facts and they don't have directionality.]\"",

      "comment": "I enjoyed this very much. It's a pity, however, that he hasn't moved from the existential elements of the Christian faith to the Spirit:  Christ the Wisdom and Power of God 18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written:            “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;           the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”  20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22 Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength.  26 Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28 He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are, 29 so that no one may boast before him. 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”  The Holy Bible: New International Version.

From Genesis chapter 1. Read the fourth commandment in the 10 commandments law in Exodus 20:8-11 which validates Genesis chapter 1. How come every one keeps the seven day weekly cycle in the world? Could it be that the bible is true? Denying the God of the bible and his Son Jesus Christ reveals that you are antichrist. Read 2 John 2:22. Without faith In God there is no salvation.
