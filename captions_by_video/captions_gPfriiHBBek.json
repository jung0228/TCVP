The Book of Job tells us that humans must live in harmony with nature and seek to learn from its wise and mysterious ways: “But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or the plants of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you.",
