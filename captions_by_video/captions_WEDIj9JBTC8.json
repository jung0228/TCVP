      "comment": "Hopefully this will clear things up:   At the beginning of the year, they raised money by selling 1/3 of the equity in the company for $500 and also raised $250 through a debt issue. Cash balance: $750 = 500 + 250 They then spent $300 to buy the first stand and $200 on inventory (this is your cost of goods sold, or COGS). Cash balance: $250 = 750 - 300 - 200 At the end of year 1, we see they sold $800 of lemonade, and paid $530 in labor costs (remember, we already bought the inventory, and depreciation is a \"non-cash\" charge - we're accounting for having to replace the lemonade stand every 5 years). Cash balance: $520 = 250 + 800 - 530 Finally, they paid $25 in interest, leaving them with negative EBT (earnings before tax) of $15 and therefore had a tax credit of $5 (this was sort of skipped over): Cash balance: $500 = 520 - 25 + 5  Note this matches the ending cash balance (bottom line) in the cash flow statement at 8:15. With that, we have enough to spend $300 on a second lemonade stand with money to spare.",

At the end of Year 1 you have $800 in revenue + $250 residual cash left after buying the 1st stand and inventories - $530 labour costs - $25 debt + $5 tax compensation. That brings you to $500 neccessary to start up another lemonaid stand. Or you can do it another way: go to the Cash Flow Statement (@ 08:19) and see step by step how you come to $500 at the end of Year 1.",

As First Assumptions said: $300 for a Stand, $200 for a year of Inventory for 1 stand [Cogs price goes up each year].  Every year inventory per stand is already paid at the \"Less: COGS\" My money to reinvest comes from 1 Stand as Labor costs $530  With my $530, i can buy Another Stand and Enough inventory for the new stand (Remember that the first stand already paid its inventory at the end of the year)  From now on, lets continue with the \"Income Statement: The Next Four Year\" My Revenue in year 2 is $1764 Less: COGS (420) [210 per stand, 2 stands] Less: Depreciation (120)  Less: Labor (530) [Thats someone else i employed] Less: Labor (530) [That me working at first stand] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EBIT: $184 Less: Interest (25) Less: Taxes (65) [Assuming 35% of EBIT] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net Income: $81  If we continue reinvesting our $530 of our labor, at fifth year, we shall have enough cash to buy 3 stands and continue our growth xD.   At End of fourth year, we shall have a net income of $608 That, added to the net income of third year of $286 and the secont year $81.  Were sitting at $975 + $250 (initial cash) = $1225 That means: More then enough to sustein our growth (For now xD)",

You can see numbers and labels that seem to be related to income statements over several years. There s also a bit about lemonade stands and cups sold. Hmm. as for the audio, someone is speaking, probably explaining or narrating what s on the screen. They mention something about net income reaching $1500 by year five and talk about earnings per share. Does that help? Let me know if you want more details!"

It's my first time seeing an income statement and just want to get all the numbers right and see how you got them. Thanks a lot for the video! It's great for someone like me with zero knowledge in this to learn and pick up.",
