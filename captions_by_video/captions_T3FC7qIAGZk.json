So many people who consider MBTI hardly better than astrology, or brush off personality tests in general; it always pains me because MBTI has become one of the theories that I've come to believe with the highest level of conviction. Intuitively, anecdotally, it seems so clear how MBTI approximates (and approximates well), very real phenomena with regard to humans' processing patterns, and, in effect, their behavior in many instances",
