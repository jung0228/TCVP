At first glance, it may not look like it has anything to do with America but when you think about it, the dress is produced from ocean plastic, right? The USA has some of the biggest fast fashion brands e.g. Gap, L Brands, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, American Eagle Outfitters and Abercrombie&Fitch. The fast fashion industry is one of the biggest contributors of ocean plastic pollution. A dress (fashion) made of plastic represents an issue that is faced in modern USA. Sustainability is definitely ingrained in America's fashion lexicon 💁",
