      "comment": "What Matt is experiencing at 28:35 is called hyperventilation tetani. The high oxygen and low CO2 levels in your blood are interacting with your pH of your blood wich leads to muscle cramps due to differences in your calcium levels. I wouldn’t recommend to do this kind of breathing manoeuvres at home because hyperventilating can cause severe harm. But if you see someone experiencing the same, give him a paper/plastic bag to breath in. This will lead to an increased level of CO2 and you will stop the cramping. Be careful guys and stay healthy",
