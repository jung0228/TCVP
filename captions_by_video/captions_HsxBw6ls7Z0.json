The Lobster killed by Jake was clearly a Lobster of the infraorder Astacidea (I'd say that you should have used the American Lobster, Homarus americanus). The Lobster tail that you used was of the Caribbean Lobster (Panulirus argus) which is of the infraorder Achelata. Not only are these animals long evolutionary roads apart, but you'd be getting some significant flavour and possibly texture changes between them.",
