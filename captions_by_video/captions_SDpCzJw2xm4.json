I'm not saying it can't be done -I'm  just saying a lot of things can go wrong. Stupid things like not having correct size containers for the dough to rise, or the pizza sticking to the peel. Also, I did not pay enough attention to his note that you will probably need to add a lot more flour than 5 cups to knead the dough to the correct consistancy. My advice is to watch lots of videos on making NY-style pizza before you give it a go, and set your expectations low for your first few pies, so you won't be too disappointed if it does not turn out perfect when you start out. Good luck!",
