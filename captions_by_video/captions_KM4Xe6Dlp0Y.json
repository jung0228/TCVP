She also acknowledges that society thinks these aspects are what beauty is all about.",

There are MANY young people out there who wish to become models, NOT for the ego massage or to lead a glamorous life. Being a model doesn't require any special skills or training. It can provide money for college or to fund other creative or entrepreneurial aspirations, so that one can go on to a happy and successful career doing something else!",

      "comment": "Sorry, but I don't like the UNDERLYING message of this video. Please, if I completely missunderstood, feel free to correct me (and if so, my apologies for what I am about to say also go to the young lady in the video)  Now, first of, let me say that she seems hypocritical to me. Why? Well, she wants to make it seem like she kinda dislikes that everything is superficial, thus portraiting herself as a 'good' person who TRIES to stand above superficially judging people or herself. Thus she tries to show her own 'noble' striving towards freedom of vanity, it seems. Yet, throughout the video, I couldn't help but feel that secretly she actually wanted to rub in to us how lucky she was. Like, when she was saying sth along the lines of ''It's so unfair, I'm only privilged because I'm a pretty, white girl'' - I don't know, that sounds pretty vain to me. Again, if I missunderstood, I am deeply sorry, but that is the impression this video left me with.  But that's not my main point. The problem is the underlying message. She basically suggests that either you are lucky and you're born with the perfect looks or you are not and there is basically very little chance of ever improving your situation. That message right there is extremely discouraging to many, and also wrong. Not everyone is just gonna accept it like ''oh, I think I look bad, but now it's okay because the lady said it's not right to think looks are important anyways''.  Now, let me start of by saying that I think humans do have some sort of an influence on their outer appearance that goes beyond pure genetics (and i DON'T mean plastic surgery, nonono!). There's so many things factoring in on this, for instance: one's perception of himself/herself, relations to people you grow up with, what you eat, neurotic behavior (or rather NO neurotic behavior), just to name a few of these factors. Just reducing the looks to a matter of genes is plain wrong, and could probably discourage some people quite a bit. Besides, people carry several 'hidden' genes which can be deactivated or activated by certain circumstances/lifestyles.  Besides, I don't like the whole ''I feel so bad about it but I do it anyways'' vibe and the ''It's sooo unfair that police men and people in general treat me better because I'm so pretty'' - sorry, still sounds vain and hypocritical (again, as I was saying above, speak up and correct me if I'm wrong)  Lastly, why on earth would she tell us 5:44? Also, all those pictures of her life, like a slide show. I know, it's her profession to ''exhibit'' herself (sorry if I used incorrect word), but that still seems so... narcissistic... in a way. If I am wrong, feel free to enlighten me, but well, that's the impression I had :P",
