      "comment": "I was part of one of the teams that won the RoboCup@Home World Championship in household robotics a few years back. I cannot stress Marques' point at 4:25 enough. They would absolutely show everything they can do autonomously. I personally think household robotics is a vastly more difficult niche compared to self driving cars, and look how that is going. That being said, the handover of the dish is either very impressive or very dangerous, time will tell which one it is.  You don't even have to think so far as to misreading medication for harm a robot can do. You have a machine in your house capable of moving around nearly 70 pounds plus whatever it is carrying or manipulating. If that thing spasms out because the wifi cuts or something else malfunctions, it can severely harm or even kill you on its own.",
