      "comment": "@21:53 \"This ambiguity in China's messaging - and the anti-secession law itself - leaves a lot open to interpretation\" This is clearly a non-committal statement because they do not want to commit themselves to making a definitive claim.  Well, I will do it for them.  China is an authoritarian-dictatorial government. That type of government / power truly believes they can do and take what they want and they have clearly shown that over the past years. They want Taiwan - period.  Their messaging and Anti-secession law ambiguity is purposely made that way. The \"wide open interpretation\" is on purpose and not made for the Western world, it was purposely made for the use by China, to manipulate what it means, what it says and to their convenience.  This useless reporting that \"we don't know for sure\" is zero value and purposely misleading.  Of course we know for sure. As to when, we don't know. As to how? - we can be pretty sure of that.  China will always try to bully first. Intimidation, undermine Taiwan society and government. A plan that has been underway for the last few decades.  When will they use force?  - When they have Joe Biden and Australia under control, to ensure their (CCP) military has a better chance of success, then they will invade for sure.  Simply, there is absolutely NO ambiguity, NO maybe, China will move to take Taiwan. It is just a matter of when.",

That older generation only applies to the Chinese people came to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-Shek (probably around 5% of Taiwanese population).  The vast majority of Taiwanese whose families have been living in Taiwan for generations, don't have that feeling.  Most of Taiwanese feel some culture connection with a combination of Japan, China and US (that is, besides the aboriginal connection).    Taiwan was part of Japan for 50 years.  During these 50 years Japanese government built Taiwan into a modern society.  Old Taiwanese appreciate Japanese governance way more than the suppression (including a massacre that killed tens of thousands and following state terrors aimed to eliminate Taiwanese elites) brought by Chiang Kai-Shek.  It was until president Lee Teng Hui ascending to the power that Taiwanese can freely express we are not Chinese without fear of prison or death.  That's why so many Taiwanese are very thankful and respectful to president Lee.",
