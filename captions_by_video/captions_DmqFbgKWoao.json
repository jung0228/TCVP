      "comment": "What he says at 15:12 is KEY for anyone wanting to draw or paint more loosely and fluidly. He basically says that he used to draw very tightly and meticulously. Repetition of this technique is what led to an intuitive understanding of form until he no longer needed to have an iron grip on what he was drawing. The understanding was inside him so he could draw the lines as quickly and fluidly as he felt like and it would still turn out looking correct. If you feel like you draw too “tight” just keep practicing over and over and really try to internalize the form, without thinking too much about the tightness or looseness. Before you can draw loosely you draw tightly, even a savant like Kim Jung Gi.",

      "comment": "5:33 I have a question for you Stan, I think I have heard you mentioning \"the math behind perspective\", but I saw Marshall's videos, I've read enough of perspective books to understand the basic concepts like vanishing points, horizon line, etc. but I've never seen math used beyond the basic concepts of perpendicular, parallel, oblique and at most angle measurements. Is that all there is? or is there a point where you really get deep into trigonometry?  In computer graphics you have a view matrix, a projection matrix and a model matrix that map 3d coordinates to 2d coordinates in the projection plane, I understand enough of it to look deeper and find how it could be done on paper, there's a lot of sine and cosine calculations, angles to radians, vectors, matrices and even quaternions, which I get, but I still feel like I am missing the glue between human drawing and computer drawing, and \"the math behind perspective drawing\" just seems to be it, yet I am not able to find math past elementary school math in perspective drawing, just a lot of intuition. Thank you and best regards!",
