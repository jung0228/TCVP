Whether they will care, mock us, or hate us for simply not eating what they ate is insignificant matter.  Isn't \"God told us not to, so be it\" is sufficient enough for reason not to eat pork? Of course, it's not enough for the rebellious type. That is also the difference between us and the Christians. As long as we bear witness that Islam is truth, then \"We hear and we obey\" (Quran 24:51). We are more obedient and submissive to God, since that is the essence of a Muslim (The one who submit to God).",

The pig has a split hoof but it does not chew the cud hence it is forbidden. This was the law spoken by God to Moses. (Not stated by Jesus because he literally wasn't born yet but he would also probably not eat pork)  Later in the new testament, in acts particularly, it is stated that many of the old laws may be a stumbling block for gentile converts so they decided to set certain rules regarding this change in law. 1) no idolatry or food sacrificed to idols 2) no blood as it is the life of the animal 3) no sexual immorality or food used for sexual immorality  Please go do your research before making conclusions and changes to your beliefs.   Fun fact, leviticus 19:19 it also states do not wear clothing woven of 2 kinds of material.  So to all you pork abstainers, are you wearing 100% cotton?",

And I figured that the video’s answer to why so many people avoid pigs would be rooted in some “scientific” explanation. Not surprised; but sure, there are many scientific/historic reasons as to why Muslims may avoid pork, same with the Children of Israel/Yahudi (Jews, it’s an anachronistic term so I tend to not use it so much) avoid it. These can be the   many health benefits or have some reason historically. But the REAL answer as to why both groups avoid it is simple:  Allah (Adonai/אלהא) commanded it as so and we obey.  Now for the non-religious this may seem foolish or confusing. But the reality is when God commands something we listen and obey. The same way we obey a king, president, teacher, parent when they command us to do something applies here. Now if we question it, we can find many explanations and at the end of the day whichever one best makes sense we’ll accept it. It’s just one less animal to kill we’re content with Chickens, Goats, Lambs, Cows etc it’s not that important to eat it for us. Also as a Muslim we believe the Quran is the “DIRECT” word from Allah. I implore you to research “Author of the Quran” because it cannot be the prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him). The information, signs, stories, style and miracles that can be derived from it show that the authorship of the book is beyond the scope of a human. So if we assume that God, Allah, really sent down the Quran then no matter what the book asks us to do we listen.   Side note it’s interesting why some if not many Christians denominations have abandoned the pork ban. I’m aware that Paul suggested that Jesus changed/abolished the law but Jesus himself said in Matthew 5:17 that he has not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. Even if Peter received a vision from him, those are what happened to Peter and Paul. Shouldn’t it make more sense to follow the laws of the Torah if Jesus came to fulfill it? (even if one was a gentile when converting) But that’s a different topic and I’m not here to argue/debate. Just wanted to share some my thoughts on this topic.",
