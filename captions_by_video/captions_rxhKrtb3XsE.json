      "comment": " @b7wL9cJk3  There is a game show called \"Price Is Right\" that is popular in America. In that game show, there are women/models who help introduce items contestants can win if they can guess how much each item costs.  So what the angry brother is saying, is that the model on Price Is Right isn't doing a good job presenting those items because contestants think they are worth less than they really are. So the joke is that the brother is marrying a beautiful and successful model, and the other brother has to be negative about everything, so the only thing he can criticize is that he thinks she isn't a good presenter of the items she displays. (This joke is expressed best in an idiom in English called \"Sour Grapes\" based off of \"Aesop's Fables\". This is when something good happens to someone else, but to make yourself feel better you find fault with it. An example would be if your friend bought a brand new car, and you respond \"It's not smart to be brand new cars because they only go down in value the moment you drive it off the lot. So just because you can't afford to buy a brand new car, you find fault with someone who can.\")  It is also funny on another level because the show comes on at 10:00 o'clock Monday through Friday, and that is when most responsible men are at work earning a salary.  And so I responded \"this is the reason that a video can't be on youtube that doesn't already have 'dislikes' \" because there is always a negative person out there who will \"thumbs down\" even the best video out of spite.",
