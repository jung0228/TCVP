Bougainville's referenda was held, not in 2018 but in 19, returning an overwhelming vote in favor of independence. An agreement between Bougainville and Papua New Guinea was reached would have Bougainville gain independence by 2027. FIFA 2018 was held in Russia and won by France. The JWST was delayed multiple times and was deployed in late 2021.  1:01 - 2019: Britain's exit from the EU was postponed a couple times and Britain eventually left in early 2020. FIFA 2019 was held in France and was won by America.  1:10 - 2020: \"Quite eventful.\" Jidda Tower has been indefinitely delayed due to labor shortages relating to the 2017 purge. The tallest structure remains the Burj Khalifa. The Tokyo 2020 Olympics were delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bigelow Aerospace laid off all their employees in 2020 and all projects were indefinitely delayed.  1:33 - 2021: India's maiden human space flight has been delayed to 2024.  1:39 - 2022: As of Oct 2022, the Tiangong space station is still under construction. FIFA 2022 is still scheduled as planned. The 2022 Beijing Olympics went forward as scheduled, and Norway won the most gold and overall medals.  2:00 - 2024: Completion of the Fehmarn Belt fixed link has been delayed to mid-2029.  2:35 - 2025: Britain's phase out of coal has been brought up to 2024.  2:52 - 2026: Most recent date given by Musk has a crewed mission arriving in 2029. Closest thing I can find about a NASA asteroid mission is the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission which would have a robot collect a boulder from an asteroid and have astronauts explore that smaller boulder, which was cancelled in 2017. Completion of the Sagrada Familia has been delayed until after 2026.  3:24 - 2027: See 2026 re: SpaceX mission to Mars.  3:58 - 2029: Portion of the rail connecting Bakersfield to Los Angeles has been delayed until 2033.  4:11 - 2030s: Chinese human lunar mission has been given a more specific date of 2030.  4:37 - 2031: Russia doesn't have a more specific date than 2030s.  5:34 - 2042: Current UN population projections put the 9bn mark in 2037. Current US Census projections expect non-Hispanic White Americans to be a minority in 2045. Apparently Elon Musk has been projected to become the first trillionaire in 2024, though I'm not sure if these projections take into account the fall of Tesla stock & his buying of Twitter.  Anything else I didn't comment on either seem to still be correct predictions, or have such incredibly variable projections from different experts that I didn't feel it would be appropriate for me to give a definitive answer.",

The only thing that should concern us in the future is our salvation. The Bible tells us about heaven and hell. About God's love and our repentance of sin.   Philippians 2:10,11 so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.  Isaiah 45:23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.  Romans 14:11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.  Revelation 22:1-5 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.  2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.  3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:  4 And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.  5 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.",
