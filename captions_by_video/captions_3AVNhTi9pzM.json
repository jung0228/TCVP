We aren’t taught on an emotional level, it’s all about facts.   I Hope someday in The future over The horizon i may be able have that knowledge.",

      "comment": "7:50 \"He was, however briefly, a human being\"   As where the 80(!) Million others who where mobilised in WW1.     I get annoyed at the melancholy and the way people look for symbolism in a picture who'se only importance is that we know who they where and what happened to them. if there was no WW1, you would not give this photo a second look.If this photo was not taken by that partcular photographer, you would not even look at it the first time. Their heads are above the horizon. yes, that happens autmatically when the photographer is about one head shorter than his subjects. That's not symbolic, it's normal. The dance is ofcourse the biggest symbol, although nobody would ever describe war as a dance. People with melancholy hindsight do. As dance with death... If that's the comparison then you desperately need to learn about what went on in WW1. it was no dance, it was slaughter. 40 million dead, that's 27.000 a day...that's one every three seconds. To call it a dance with death is to be a complete piece of shit with no sense of reality.   It's only human to romantisise the story behind the photo but the fact is that pictures like this exist for all of the other 40 Milion dead. They where all just going about their lives when a couple of arseholes who did not have a farting clue about anything where too busy expanding their economies that they collectively decided to fight over it. Well, to make their people fight over it. 40 Million dead becuase a handfull of incompetent idiots could not work things out....",

My mom told me that this Sander photography was always well known in our family, but after my grandparents passed away many years ago no one had any idea who these men were. So THANK you again1 Greetings from Germany. PS: Otto Krieger's descendants have a nice butcher's shop in neighbouring Bitzen (the village to the north of Dünebusch in 5:19).",
