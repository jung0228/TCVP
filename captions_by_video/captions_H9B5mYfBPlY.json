(in reference to the conversation around 2:07). it is NOT always the case that there are '3 fingers pointing back at one's self'. i adopted that attitude towards someone as i always have default, bc of my spiritual background, which generally serves me very well. in that case, however, it took me years, unfortunately, to admit -no, none of this was me. it was a toxic, manipulative individual with no ability or desire to own their part and not participate in toxic behavior. the work i had done in understanding, apologizing, reframing, forgiving, etc. was unjustified. what i really needed was strong boundaries and to remove myself but it was subtle and insidious for a long time. it's important to realize when that is happening. toxic and abusive people are not your fault or responsibility.",

I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, I know this full well.\" -Psalm 139:13-14  \"But in fact, God has arranged the parts of the body, every one of them, just as he wants them to be.\" -1 Cor 12:18  \"Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you be circumcised, Christ will be of no advantage to you.\" -Gal 5:2  \"And I testify again to every male who receives circumcision, that he is in debt to keep the whole Law. You who do so have been severed from Christ...you have fallen from grace.\" -Gal 5:3  \"For when we place our faith in Christ Jesus, it makes no difference to God whether we are circumcised or not circumcised. What is important is faith expressing itself in love.\" -Gal 5:6  \"But if I still proclaim circumcision...then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.\" -Gal 5:11  \"I wish that those who are pushing you to do so would mutilate themselves!\" -Gal 5:12  \"And even those who advocate circumcision don’t really keep the whole law. They only want you to be circumcised so they can brag about it and claim you as their disciples.\" -Gal 6:13  \"For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. Rather, what matters is being a new creation.\" -Gal 6:15  \"For there are many who rebel against right teaching; they engage in useless talk and deceive people. This is especially true of those who insist on circumcision for salvation. They must be silenced. By their wrong teaching, they have already turned whole families away from the truth. Such teachers only want your money\" – Titus 1:10-11  \"Watch out for those wicked men – dangerous dogs, I call them – who say you must be circumcised. Beware of the evil doers. Beware of the mutilation. For it isn’t the cutting of our bodies that makes us children of God; it is worshiping him with our spirits.\" – Phil 3:2-3  \"But each of you should remain in the place in life that the Lord has given you. Stay as you were when God chose you. Was a man already circumcised [Old Covenant] when God chose him? Then he should not become uncircumcised. Was he uncircumcised [New Covenant] when God chose him? Then he should not be circumcised. Being circumcised means nothing. Being uncircumcised means nothing. Doing what God commands is what counts.\" -1 Cor. 7:17-19  \"Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching, saying, 'Moses commanded you to be circumcised. If you aren't, you can't be saved.' But Paul and Barnabas didn't agree with this, argued strongly with them, and were appointed to go up to Jerusalem with other believers chosen to go with them. The apostles and elders met together to consider this question. [...] Peter got up and spoke to them, 'Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me to take the good news to unbelievers. He wanted them to hear the good news and believe. God knows the human heart. [...] Now then, why are you trying to test God? You test him when you put a heavy load on the believers' shoulders [regarding circumcision]. Our people of long ago couldn't carry that load. We can't either.\" -Acts 15:1-2, 6-10  \"Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.\" -1 Tim 4:7  Jesus' birth didn't immediately revoke all of the Old Testament covenant requirements. His birth fulfilled prophecy.  His Baptism covenant replaced circumcision and crucifixion replaced all of the other requirements to have \"salvation\".",

      "comment": " @JaneCooper190072  I'm soooo embarrassed for you. You lived your whole life thinking you were part of a religion that you don't even comprehend.    The Christian Apostle Paul, was the first - whole - intactivist ♥️🙏🏻😍  For Christmas I asked my family for the three book set “Commentary of the Holy Scriptures”, to give me more of a context of each book and verse of the New Testament; it also shows the scene which the passages were set within the second century.   In this day/age, local pastors/churches, friends, and family really suck with their narrow and limited (as well as ignorant) interpretations. They’re too confusing and silly, and my own interpretations I see don’t matter either. Everyone throws their own interpretations at each other, and it’s become annoying.  So I figure, it should be each of our goals to look into history (pre-10th century), to understand the one European view of these New Testament books. Not 40,000 new age American views.   My family was very kind, and I now own the set. It was written from Orthodox Archbishop Averky (Taushev), and they are the volumes that are widely circulated today in Russia which help others strengthen their faith.   Point being, I’m looking into circumcision specifically as my starting point. A quick glance over volumes II & III and trying to remember where I saw circumcision being spoken about...  I see two areas:  In the book of Acts, chapter 11 Volume II: the circumcised Christians at the time (Jewish Christians/Judaizers), were upset that Peter sat, lived, and ate with the “uncircumcised”. (P.56). These Judaizers were upset that these new people who also called themselves faithful Gentile converts, saw the “holiness of the Old Testament Law” as a false teaching. The Judaizers feverishly began to rebuke Peter for allowing this in his household, and it’s noted that this was only the start of Peter’s mission, and catechization of the faithful was not necessary at this time. “With this account, Peter did not directly answer the issues raised by the Jewish Christians, instead he showed them the will of God; to accept  those within the Church as brothers; and Peter’s account calmed them. (P. 57).  Volume III, p. 53 The Epistle of the Holy Apostle Paul to the Galatians:  I see that Galatia was a region in Asia Minor, neighboring Cappadocia, Lycaonia, Pontus, and other regions. The country was originally settled by Greeks, but soon the Jews moved to Galatia when Jews were forced out of Palaestine, Emperor Augustus gave special patronage to the Jews that moved to Galatia, which is mentioned by Josephus.   The Christian communities in Galatia began growing in large numbers, first with Paul, then Silas, and Timothy as they went through the cities delivering the news of the missionary journey from the apostles and strengthing their numbers.   P. 54. The purpose of this epistle was the apparently rabid Judaizers in Galatia, who began to insist on the necessity for circumcision, and other rites of the Old Jewish (Mosaic Law) for salvation. The Judaizers saw how lax Paul was, and his favor with Pagans, and they belittled his ministry by saying he wasn’t of Jesus Christ; he was only of his own selfish lips. Many Judaizers fell away by the time Paul arrived, (Gal 1:6). And he was astounded at how foolish and frivol the Judaizers were.   Paul immediately began to write to the people, to uncover their delusions. He wrote it with his own hand. (Gal 6:11).   Galatians is mapped out as follows:  1. Prologue, Paul’s greeting and introduction where he expresses the main theme. 1:1-10 2. A defense of Paul’s apostolic diginiry, which had been brought into question by the Judaizing false teachers. 1:11-2:1-21 3. A dogmatic section, in which Paul powerfully and completely reveals the main theme of his epistle — the reference of the Old Testament to the New, and the end of the importance of the Law of Moses (Jewish Law) after the coming of Christ the Savior. 3:1-29 & 4:1-31 4. A moral-instructive section, in which the foundation of the Christian life, separate of the Old Testament Law, is described. 5:1-26 & 6:1-10 5. A conclusion, in which concrete instructions are given concerning circumcision and reverence due to the Cross of Christ. 6:11-18  A few really cool points to summarize from the book of Galatians:   • Paul accounts his attendance to the first Christian Council of Jerusalem. (All Christians should additionally research the 7 important councils central to the faith).  • This Council declared Mosaic (Jewish Law) unnecessary in the life of a Christian.  • St Titus was one of the first uncircumcised (whole) men to be baptized and presented to the apostles, they did not require him cut for good reason.  • Paul’s epistle received sanction of all the elder apostles at this council. • The eldest of the apostles acknowledged how the Apostle Paul had a unique calling to preach to the uncircumcised; just as Peter’s calling was to the Jews.   ... SO MUCH MORE INFO. Christians who hadn’t already had a Jewish background, absolutely never cut for sure.",

You will both be alright if you continue to love her and listen to her, not just her words, but however you communicate. Remember that they will interpret things not necessarily as you meant or as they are, but choose the worst possible explanation.(1:50:20) . As long as you love her, show her how to love and love her unconditional;ly, it will all be okay. Everyone has issues, just teach her how to handle them rather than she develop unhealthy coping skills.  I am trying to undo pain I didn't mean to cause my girl when I was not available to her when we lost my partner and her step dad(when in second grade,  she called him her faux pas...that is how clever she is) I am always so grateful for being so devoted to her in her first five years especially because it makes our healing more accessible because of our strong foundation. Don't choose a job that pays more so you can provide more material stuff, pay attention to her, the reward is so much greater.",
