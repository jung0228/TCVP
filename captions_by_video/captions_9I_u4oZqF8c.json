It's not a big gas tank with more fuel than you thought it's a solar powered device you can use for a few seconds after letting it charge awhile. If you don't get it, think of it this way, you're not willing it to have more energy to do that. Your body has recovered long enough to. You could have just used up the energy and someone bursts in with a chainsaw, guess what mate, you aint getting your arms up to try to grab something and defend yourself they're still as useless as in the normal scenario no adrenaline, fear, or willpower will make them move because the chemical reactions in the arms aren't even physically possible to do until they recover.",
