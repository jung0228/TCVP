      "comment": "@ Kyrstin   Stoneking you can't fathom spending $5k on a ticket, because you travel for leisure and not business. If you're flying for business, where 100's of thousands or millions of dollars are at stake, $5k is nothing. If an exec is going to Europe, you figure not ONLY his flight time, but door to door travel. The exec travels to the airport. Gets to the airport 1-1/2 - 2 hours before departure, for check in and boarding. Flight time depends on where flying to and from, let's say 8 hours. Then there is deplaning, getting baggage, getting through customs, getting your ride, then travel to the airport. An 8 hour flight is now 12 hours or more door to door, home/office to hotel. Let's change the scenario a little. The exec does an in/out blast. He/she works at the office all/most of the day, let's say Monday. Drives to the airport and catches a 6pm flight from Chicago. That flight arrives at 8:30 am Tuesday, in London. The exec showers, dresses in fresh clothes and is off to the client/branch office, for an 11 am meeting. The exec does their business and leaves the office at 5 or 6 pm. Maybe they do a business dinner and finally checks in to their hotel at 8 or 9 pm. They get up at 6am in the morning for an 11am flight. They  have breakfast, catch a 1 hour ride to the airport, arrive 2 hours before, check in and finally board. Their flight arrives at 2 pm and get home at 4-5 pm Wednesday. That $5k seat is cheap, to make sure the exec is fresh for the meeting and relatively comfortable for the trip home. The exec left their home at 6 or 7 am Monday morning and it's now Wednesday night. Now do that every 1-2-3 months.",

It also turns out that schedules are also a big draw, especially for business customers, so an airline can attract more customers by having two mixed planes at 7:00am and 7:00pm than just at one of those times with all business class.  While they could probably fill one plane with all business class, in the long run, they would lose customers because of inconvenient scheduling and few options.  Essentially, economy class enables airlines to fly more planes at more times.",
