The Jewish People were given Israel, the Arabs were given Palestine, but the Arabs started a war to reclaim the territory. They lost the war, and after that Israel took more land than was initially provided.   I’m not condoning the horrific acts committed by either side but at least watch the video if you’re going to comment about it. See 2:20 in the video for the point I made.",
