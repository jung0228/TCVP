      "comment": "Excellent video. I'm Japanese and have subscribed your  channel since episodes on countries starting with B. I'm so happy that It reached my country!  Here are some corrections that I noticed:  2:24 Japanese government claims 4 of the Kuril Islands as their territory, not 2. They also include Shikotan Island and Habamai Islands.  2:40 Japanese people actually did take over the island of Sakhalin to some extent. They exchanged the island of Sakhalin for the Kuril Islands with Russia in 1875.  13:56 wrong picture for Fukuzawa Yukichi.  12:58 There is no photograph of Honda Tadakatsu because he died more than 400 years ago.  13:01 Tokugawa Ieyasu not Leyasu  13:03 Saigo Takamori not Saifo  13:13 Takeshi Kitano not Hitano  13:15 wrong photo for Akira Toriyama. The man on the photo is Hayao Miyazaki.  Again, I'm so proud to see your video on Japan.  Thank you.",
