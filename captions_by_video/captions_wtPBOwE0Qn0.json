'Parade' ~ parade, assume at least 3 meanings + Time. 1) Freud: A DIFFICULTY IN THE PATH OF PSYCHO-ANALYSIS(1917) \"I will say at once that it is not an intellectual difficulty I am thinking of, not anything that makes psycho- analysis hard for the hearer or reader to understand, but an affective one - something that alienates the feelings of those who come into contact with it, so that they become lessinclined to believe in it or take an interest in it. As will be observed, the two kinds of difficulty amount to the same thing in the end. Where sympathy is lacking, understanding will not come very easily.\" 2) Moses | Trojan Horse  | Joshua 'Karen Horney' Whores Jericho Walls  3) \"The New Mission of Judex\" serial 4) Chaplin \"The Floorwalker\" (1916) satire of Futurism and Marcel Duchamp (get one back for the 'team').
