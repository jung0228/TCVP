They're standing on some grassy ground. In the background, there are lots of people in different colored shirts, some are walking around, some are standing still. It looks like an outdoor event or gathering. Then they start throwing something at each other, and it seems to be some kind of game or competition.AUDIO: I can hear someone speaking, saying things like \"100 people here\" and \"I'm not gonna win.\" There's also music playing in the background."

It seems there might be some music playing in the background, but no distinct speech or sound effects are clear. So, yeah, mainly just the music. What do you think about the video?"
