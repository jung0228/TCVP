      "comment": "9:30 i really relate to that, everyone told me not to do shrooms if i wasnt going to make it a big life changing event but honestly i only did it bc i was drinking with my friends and we were all doing it while smoking weed. i had never done it before so i had no goals and was just taking it for fun, but it effected me so deeply anyways bc just like u described it enhanced everything i already was telling myself. My life completely changed afterwards, i quit every one of my addictions and focused on my work and studies. all my my self belief i was trying to force for years became reality. a true blessed feeling that no matter the circumstance i will always be able to hold my own. i am my own innocence and my own protector. I am not limited by how other people are able to help  me bc i can truly rely on myself. its always been true but i never really believed it until i did shrooms. when i started tripping i actually left my group of friends and was on my own for a while to really reflect. ive always known what was right in my head but shrooms spoke the words into my heart and thats when i became able to truly live as i am meant to",

If that's what you're giving patients, you might as well just send em home... 5 dried grams is Terrence McKenna's \"heroic\" dose. How you got that wrong in such a well done video, titled \"heroic dose,\" is beyond me... Recreational use goes anywhere from 1 gram up as high as you'd like. I've personally eaten an entire ounce over a 24 hour period... A good breakthrough ammount for an average first timer is 1 gram at first, increasing .5 grams every 30 minutes to 2 grams. My first complete breakthrough was at 2 grams. My first total \"ego death\" and life altering trip was at 4 grams... Give people correct info.",
