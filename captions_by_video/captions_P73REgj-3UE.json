Which means that the rest of the reenforced part is warm but not hot as its not directly above a fire and its reenforced. Second example 13:05, hes showing us what hes grabbing and explaining how he got the fire on the stick so easily incase people ask in comment section. 2 examples, shows that he talks. he has his own special way of communication and thats what makes him better then the rest. He doesnt carry on talking non-stop to keep us entertained. He probs doesnt talk because his subscribers arent there to hear someone talking on and on, theyre here to see someone build shit.",
