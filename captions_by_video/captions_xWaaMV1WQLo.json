In the background, there are other people, some in yellow shirts. The court is wooden with markings for the game. There's also a large logo or design painted on the floor near where the boy stands.AUDIO: I can't really tell what kind of speech is being heard from just these six seconds. But there is definitely music playing throughout the whole time. It seems to be some sort of upbeat, energetic music that might go along with a sports event or something similar.If you want to know more about the video, like if there were any specific actions the boy did or if the music had different sections, feel free to ask me more!"
