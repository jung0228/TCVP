Then He was buried, but on the third day he was resurrected from the grave and defeated death.   If you repent from your sins, confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Yahushua ( one you know as Jesus) is king and savior and that He is the son of God you will be saved.  There is a coming wrath upon the earth where The Father will punish the wicked and unrepentant people. Christ will come and save His church from the wrath of The Father.  Please save yourself from this wrath and live a new hope filled life honourable to the Most High by keeping His commandments May the Father bless you all.
