The room looks like a hospital ward or room, with medical equipment visible. The walls are light-colored and there's a window letting in some natural light.AUDIO: I can't really tell much from just these six seconds. It seems to be mostly background noise, maybe some faint conversation or music, but it's hard to say for sure.What do you think about the scene? Do you have any other details that might help me describe it better?"
