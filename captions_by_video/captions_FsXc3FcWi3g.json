Young people today, indeed most of them are still young and also selfish, but let me say once again, not all Muslim women are like that, and fortunately there are still many who have awareness in the style of dress as Muslim women, so only a little like that.  11:47 ( Explanation, again x) ) Not every Muslim women in Indonesia like that, even though they don't wear clothes like those in other places, here although they are different, most of them pay attention to being fashionable, even so they still cover what they call aurat, so as your answer from me :  \" Hmmm ... NO \" Back to the explanation I gave earlier  So just that I guess 😂😂 Thank you so much for your Geography/Explanation about our Country. The others was correct and perfect, and not wrong... And i like your Long-Short explanation tho, that was really good tbh 😂😂👌 Once again, let me gift my Big Thanks to you, really..
