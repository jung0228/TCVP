      "comment": "At 2:39:00 in this video, Dr. Huberman says when we want to/have the will to do something but we keep CHOOSING (subconsciously & consciously) to let ourselves be distracted from doing it; 'til we don't do it at all, resulting in feeling disappointed in ourselves, THEN there are 2 ways of looking at it:       1) We can focus on our thinking & SEE how our inner thoughts/dialogue are serving to help us NOT DO the thing (by thinking ; it's too hard, it'll hurt, I'm not smart enough etc.) OR how our thinking can/COULD BE used to serve us to GET US TO DO IT (by thinking ; I'll feel so good when I've DONE it, I'll feel proud of myself/ happy I DID overcome what I HAD TO to accomplish MY goal, by the strength of MY WILL, the outcome'll be YAY!! {= how we envision that outcome will benefit us/make us feel empowered about ourselves + STOP making us feel like/think we're lazy, useless or UNable etc. each time we don't do what we WANT to do.} OR we can;      #2) Decide to ACCEPT OURSELVES & our choice to NOT DO what we keep avoiding doing. We CAN CHOOSE to NOT DO IT, if we DON\"T REALLY WANT the outcome envisioned or WE DECIDE there's not enough payoff for us to DO it.        Like I\"ve told my kids, if they want a mate but they'd RATHER stay online, sleep, read THAN DO ANY & everything they could be doing that WOULD help them connect with people & actualy find a mate; THEN maybe they needed to STOP condemning themselves & STOP feeling less than others for not having a mate yet. Maybe they needed to ALLOW themselves the choice, GIVE themselves the ok to not be seeking a mate for the time being & STOP letting other's expectations make them feel like they should be SEEKING A MATE or already HAVE one. AXXEPT THEMSELVES and still be proud of themselves. A novel idea to many.       I think it's the CRUX of WHY people feel unhappy, when we will spend so much time downing ourselves for who we are, based on something we've been taught tobelieve/ think that was mplanted in our heads by society, media & SOME people's opinions that our brain uses to keep telling us that \"WE'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGHas we ARE, not \"as good as\" others.       So if you like just how you are, you CAN accept yourself & stop beating yourself up, it's YOUR LIFE.        But if you really DO WANT something you CAN also OWN THAT & reframe your thoughts related to it to more  empower you to ASSIST YOU to get it done.         I found acceptance in some areas AND changing negative thoughts in others; to be how I stopped judging myself & beating myself up all the time. We can BE GOOD TO OURSELVES, LOVE & ACCEPT ourselves, AND focus in on things that really do matter to us.",
