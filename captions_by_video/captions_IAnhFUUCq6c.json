      "comment": "1:26:20 That style of focus on eccentric abduction of the scapula was what really helped me build a better mind-muscle connection with my lats myself. I did it mostly with one armed high cable rows and used my off hand to reach across my chest and feel the lat and really try and visualize the rhomboids between my shoulder blades and the lats outside of them moving away from my body and trying to just control a more moderate weight with just contraction of my scapula. It's done wonders for my back development and in turn my deadlift squat and bench have all improved significantly from having a more solid and tight lats activation in all of those movements. Wonderful advice here from Dr. Galpin!",
