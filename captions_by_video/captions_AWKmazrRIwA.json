One has a map-like pattern, another is orange, and the third is yellowish - brown. The background seems to be a dark blue sky with some blurry shapes that might be mountains or buildings.AUDIO: I can't really tell what's being said in the audio because it's not clear enough from just these few seconds. It could be someone talking about something related to the visuals, maybe about the peace treaties mentioned in the caption. But without more context, it's hard to say for sure.If you want to talk more about this video or have other questions, feel free to let me know!"

      "comment": "17:20 I know this was just an example, but as someone who is half Moroccan Jewish (Sephardic) and half Russian Jewish (Ashkenazi), I can tell you that you don't know how right you are. Russian and Moroccan Jews have completely different traditions and values. Russian Jews tend to be far more conservative then Moroccan Jews.   For example, in Judaism, there is something called a Mitzva. While this word does not translate well into English, you can think of it like a religious Event. It could be a good thing like a wedding, or a bad thing like a funeral. Now both Russian and Moroccan Jews have very different ways of observing Mitzvas. Russian Jews tend to focus more on the praying aspect of Mitzvas and have celebration as a secondary thing if at all. Moroccan Jews however, do the exact opposite. They will focus almost entirely on celebration often even during bad Mitzvas. The mindset here is that you should be celebrating being alive and even during a funeral the person who died wouldn't want you to be depressed.   This mindset tends to make a lot of Sephardic Jews seem weird to other Jews. I remember when my grandparents (Ashkenazi ones) came back from an organized holocaust tour (they were visiting a bunch of the concentration camps), they told me about a running joke that the Sephardic buses were were the party buses of the trip. This is because Sephardic Jews tend to prefer celebrating being alive than mourning the dead.",
