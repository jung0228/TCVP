      "comment": "@2:34 he hits it right on the head. I’m 22 and have a panic disorder. Since I took this job at Steak ‘n Shake a year ago and got sober I have truly learned to be a people person by just trying when it came to customer service. I have become our best customer service person we have and was even promoted to customer service trainer before management. Been here for over a year now. In the beginning I thought I was above it and wanted bigger and better but learned to associate myself with the people I worked with, with the customers and see we are all just human beings trying to make it in life in some way. It takes effort but I learned to be kind, patient, and hardworking through the many 50+ hour weeks of working here. Will forever be thankful. I’ve finally learned to be a responsible young man. Obviously with many outside factors such as almost 2 years of consistent therapy and feeding myself content from individuals like Jordan Who just understand the struggle and know the way out. Take heed to this podcast young lost kings. Find yourself, God bless",

In 2017 I was bedridden with actual paralysis from my chest down trying to recover from having 13 vertebrae bolted together T4 to L2 with acute chronic pain along with 11 years r taking fentanyl and oxycodone. My first challenge was to just move my toes which took over a year to see results then it was practicing standing with a walker and another year of practicing. 1% improvement was my goal, roughly 1% per month with extreme efforts to see. Fast forward since then, I’m past 4 years of no fentanyl or any opiates,I now travel the western states with my dog Tigger in our bus motorhome. We walk everyday and our record is 3.5 miles in a day. The way out of depression, pain and hopelessness is consistently pursue 1% improvement and the feeling of reaching 2% is likely to be your favorite feeling of self respect and accomplishment  🙏♥️💪🐕🚌",
