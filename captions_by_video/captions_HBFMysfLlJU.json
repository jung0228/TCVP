The setting seems to be some kind of formal event or gathering, like a wedding reception. There are other people around them, also dressed formally. The man is looking up and talking, while the woman is smiling and holding something small in her hand.AUDIO: Someone says \"I do\" followed by \"Monsieur.\" Then there's a pause, and someone asks \"What was?\" It sounds like they're having a conversation about something important, maybe related to the event. What do you think might have happened?"
