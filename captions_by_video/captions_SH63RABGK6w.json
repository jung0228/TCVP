Saying that Singapore and Hong Kong should serve as a model for an entire continent is pure BS: these city-states are geographically primed for economic success (both are at critical sea-lane junctures). You could argue that these city-states are selfish since their borders have the effect that revenue incurred from the trade-activities don't trickle to the surrounding countryside (where the poor farmers live which supply those city-states with the necessary food) via taxes etc. If every country were as selfish, everyone would be poor.",

      "comment": " @howardjones7370  It would be interesting to see you review your own comments after another 50 years.   In this case I'm talking about you, not the Church.   Your words and manner do not reflect either discipline or maturity.     Getting things right' according to YOUR lights never was the business of the Church.   Its main business is to preach the Gospel to the ends of the earth.  See Matthew 28:19-20, if you are not too lazy.  Bit by bit, that has been done, so that not too many regions remain today, where the name of Jesus has not been heard.    But you ARE correct about one thing, which the addition of a 'plus' to the 2,000 years.   For the faith of the mostly Jewish apostles was the faith of  King David, of the Hebrew prophets, of Moses, Abraham, Noah, even Abel, the first martyr.  But I won't credit you for stumbling upon a point which you could have discovered through diligent research, and may not understand anyway.   Also for your consideration:  1.  Have you lived YOUR life perfectly?  See to that before sitting in judging the Church.  The first Hebrew Psalm states: 'Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, NOR SIT IN THE SEAT OF SCOFFERS.'  2.  Read the 7th chapter of Romans, and if you can understand plain words, you should be able to tell that two natures are at war within the believer, the redeemed and the unredeemed.     When Christians sin, not that they should (but they do), it shows that the old nature is still present,  which dominates the lives of unbelievers completely.  Sanctification is not an instantaneous process.  (Are you still there?   Don't blanch or faint at the sight of polysyllabic theological terms.)   3.  Did you ever read Jesus' parable of the wheat and the tares? Not all 'Christians' are Christians, but some go through the motions  without concern for the substance.  Or perhaps they hold syncretic beliefs. But no one can be a half-Christian.   But you, in your rush to judgment, are apt to tar disparate groups with the same brush, according to the worst evils committed by any of them.  4.  The Gospel is about salvation, not reformation of human culture per se.  Even unsaved people often desire reformation of human culture, and work very hard at it, but they will miss their salvation unless they believe in Jesus.  What do you desire more?  To be a 'god person' in your own sight and in the sight of your fellows, or to have your sins forgiven by God?     You can't have both.  They are mutually exclusive options.    You are walking about BLINDFOLDED, virtue-signaling about your own self-imposed blindness.   What a silly spectacle.  Sure man, you're a real model to follow.",

(John 3:16)  'For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.'  On the cross, Jesus took the blame for our sins.  We could NEVER have justified ourselves by our own merits.    Jesus said that 'not even when one has an abundance does one's life consist of one's possessions.'",

I have no problem with some of her statements, as regards the  universal and ubiquitous nature of colonialism for example.  Or take the proven capacity of 'free markets' to release economic potential, so long as we are willing to justify cruel exploitation and repression of labor as a 'necessary evil'.    Granted these points, she is speaking in a worldly manner of worldly subjects.  Here are a few things which the Holy Spirit has to say regarding wealth and power:  (Psalm 49:20)   'Man in his pomp, yet without understanding, is like the beasts that perish.'  (James 5:1)  'Come now you rich, weep and howl for the miseries which are coming upon you.    (James 2:5)  'Listen, my brethren:  did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?'  Surely this does not romanticize poverty or imply that all poor people are automatically saved!   But those who are not already full of themselves, who feel their own dependency and inadequacy in heir very bones, are better positioned to receive the grace of God than those who think they have the world by the tail.",

Not just for the strong.  Right after the ad for gold (LOL seriously, Jordan?), at 6:30 comes the bullshit. The \"entrepreneur\". She has to close her eyes to recite her title and organisation name, because it's so long she barely remembers it. I know this kind of people well, having lived in the \"developing\" world. Boisterous, political, vocal, but ultimately lacking in substance, disconnected from facts and expertise. I'm sure she'll do well for herself.  \"Capitalism\" and the West profit from keeping the poor countries poor. You want to bring your country out of poverty just so another takes its place? Just go up in the rank? FEZs are loopholes allowed In the current system. The whole world should be a FEZ. But it's not allowed, it has to be controlled to keep the status quo.",
