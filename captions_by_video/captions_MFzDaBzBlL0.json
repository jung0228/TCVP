I think the reason that people wobble so much when they start isn't a sensitivity thing.  It's just that when you start on a bike, you have to make a ton of micro adjustments to get your balance.  Most of those adjustments are small, unconscious, and quick, so someone trained in making adjustments on a normal bike will create twice the rotational instability, which will create a larger unbalance issue.  You really need to be in complete control to get it on your first try, otherwise only several weeks of training will suffice.",
