The background is dark, probably nighttime. There's also some kind of sign or logo at the bottom that says \"Smarter Every Day\" with a little icon next to it.AUDIO: I can't really tell much from just the audio since there isn't any speech or music mentioned. But there seems to be some sort of impact sound effect during the explosion."
