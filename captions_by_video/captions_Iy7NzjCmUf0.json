Thank you so very much for putting this together. I have been very anxious all day and came here knowing watching this would help. And it does. It matters what we do on a very tiny scale.. But in the big scheme of things it really doesn't matter at all.. Even if our conciousness is eternal.. Lightyears from now, it remembers nothing of anything we worried about today.. Everything will be new. Maybe we've crossed over into another dimension completely.. Because this here is just one dimension of what is... And we have no clue of how many dimensions there are!!!
