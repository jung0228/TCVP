The fact on the US dollar trade value declining due to the war at 19:50 when fact checked with the first 3 credible sources I could find is flatly incorrect. Trade transactions since 2012 have increased 1.4% to over 88 % FX transactions. The only real decline I have seen is held reserves of US dollars which has only declined 1% in the last decade which makes sense as other economies grow stronger.   Not sure Why I felt the need to say this but its out there now. If any one has alternate data or I may not be understanding statistically something different he is referencing please help me understand.",
