      "comment": "(01:21) \"...because of a financial system that leaves millions underserved.\" Partially true, and here's the truth of the statement:  The Federal Government has made cheap money available to banks, and banks still maintain very high interest rates on credit cards.  All consumers must service loans having interest rates that are substantially higher than what banks pay for the money that they are given by the Federal Reserve.  Considering the rates charged to banks, home loans should be hovering at about 2 percent, student loans should be at about 3 percent, and credit card interest rates should be at about 10 percent.  There is another side to this story.  Manufacturing has slipped from America and has been sent to China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.  Americans must compete with extremely desperate people for work that used to pay a living wage.  Some argue that if only Americans would get rid of that pesky minimum wage, and those ridiculous clean air and water regulations, everything would be great!  If \"great\" means being paid less per hour than the cost of a small potato, then I guess things would be great, but I don't think that's a \"great\" idea.  I do not understand why Americans (even the desparate) are so against re-establishing tariffs on imported manufactured goods.  What is so wrong with that?  What is so wrong with employing Americans, FIRST?  Clearly, giving our manufacturing away to the rest of the world has not made it a more stable place.  Look at how China is rattling its sword at Japan and Taiwan.  Look at what's going on in the Ukraine.  Look at the continuing horrors going on in the Middle East!  Giving away American wealth has not made the world safer, and it has destroyed America's financial foundation.",

I can understand that.  But the other 85%? That's 42.5% of households.  If I'm living paycheck to paycheck, I'd get up to a buffer of a few thousand quick smart.

Steve jobs had this exact same problem when he started Apple. He got an order of I believe 50 Macintoshes, but didn't have the money. So he negotiated with the supplier and with the buyer.  If she offers the buyer bettter terms for upfront payment, or for paying half upfront (or whatever the cost of materials is), she can buy the materials and still make the products and build her critical mass financially.  Or she can do the same with the supplier, negotiate, explain the situation, if necessary offer to pay slightly more for credit terms.  While I don't know her situation, there are solutions which people can find on an individual level. Sure systematic change is necessary long term, and we're working towards that.
