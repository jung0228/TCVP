The background has several illuminated boards with different questions on them like \"CATCH THESE MEN\", \"STATES THAT END IN 'HAMPSHIRE'\", \"WHAT COLOR IS GREEN\", and \"CURRENT BLACK PRESIDENT\". The numbers 0, 200, 200, 200, 200 are also visible below the boards.AUDIO: A man is speaking, and there's laughter from an audience in the background. It seems to be during a game show or quiz show. What do you think about it? Do you have any other thoughts on the video?"

It seems like there might be more to the sign, but only these two parts are clearly visible. Then we see three people standing behind podiums labeled \"JEOPARDY!\". They seem to be contestants or participants in a game show setting.AUDIO: You can hear laughter and applause in the background. The laughter is probably from the audience reacting to something funny said during the game show. The applause could be for a correct answer given by one of the contestants or just general excitement about the game show. What do you think was so funny?"

The other two are standing still. The background has blue panels.The AUDIO: There's applause at the beginning, then someone says \"Kathy Lee let's start with you\" followed by more applause. It seems like they're starting some kind of game or show. So, what do you think about it? Do you have any ideas for how the game might go?"
