      "comment": "I was a child sex abuse detective and investigated CSAM (child sex abuse material, formerly referred to as child pornography). My hats off to these men for bringing these horrors into the sunlight. This is such a problem inside the US. Many of the kids are completely forgotten with no one to advocate for them. So often they grow up to enter the criminal justice route. I've interviewed hundreds of these kids and 99% have one thing in common: parents abused drugs and little to no family structure.  Imagine an American resurgence of the nuclear family. I can't help but believe it would alleviate so many of our societal ills.  Also, 31:23 makes me choke up. The stuff you're exposed to is so evil and horrific. I pray he has counseling and help to process the images. EMDR and psilocybin helped me become human again after I retired.",

I have a good friend who was a child psychologist but had to retire at an early age despite being very successful. When I asked him why, he got very, very serious and shared with me a small sample of the cases he used to work. They are still seared into my brain 15 years later. But, the reason he had to retire was because he was suffering from PTSD. That is how horrifying the evil that is perpetrated on children is, and right here in the USA. It takes a massive amount of faith to confront evil head on. It took me a while to get over what he shared with me. I'll never repeat it, and I no longer think about evil the same.",

We need to hear your testimony.  This nation needs Godly men to cry out in repentance on behalf of our nation and the nations of the world.  Men need to repent in tears on their face before GOD. Men were meant to be the protector to the weak.  True religion is helping the widows and visiting the fatherless.  What have we become when we exploit the weak instead of protect them.   He said he would hear our cries and heal our land.  We pray for revival because this type of lifestyle only leads to death.  Jesus said in Revelations 12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.  Thank you for your testimony may GOD use it to defeat the enemy.  Nothing is more powerful than someone weeping in repentance and sorrow for their sin before GOD.",
