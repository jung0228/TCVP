      "comment": "5:06 This is really valuable to hear. I started programming a little in elementary school, but got out of practice because of competitive video gaming. My diehard Linux system engineer dad suggested I learned Python. I was convinced that focusing on math and science was more important than immediately learning to code, because that was harder, and besides, I thought, I'm proficient with computers and would probably learn to program from a professional teacher sooner or later. Fast forward 10 years: Now I'm in university studying physics, and the programming rabbit hole turned out to be a lot deeper than I thought. I'm almost failing my classes because I've just taken on a different personality and lifestyle from when I was a kid, and can't concentrate in front of a computer for long enough to complete my assignments, and no one really seems to know what is going on. Should've listened to my dad.",
