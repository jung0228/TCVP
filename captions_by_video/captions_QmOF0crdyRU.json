      "comment": "1. Cold Water therapy effects on dopamine, adrenaline and nor adrenalin 2. Dopamine can be released in 2 ways: Local release and volumetric release 3. How pleasurable or satisfying you feel doesn't depend on peak level of dopamine. It depends upon difference in baseline level and peak level of dopamine. How you feel depends upon your previous level of Dopamine as compared to present level. Many drugs just increase both baseline level and peak level instead of increasing the difference between them. A big Dopamine release makes it more challenging to achieve higher dopamine release the next time. There should not be High level nor low level of Dpamine for long.  4.Just Increasing dopamine level will make us excited but that excitement will be for very less period of time 5. Chocolate increases Dipamine 1.5 times but it goes away in few seconds. Desire of sex or act of sex increases dopamine 2 times 6. Nicotene(smoked) increases dopamine 2.5 times above base line (Very short lived) 7. Amphetamine, Cocaine, Nicotine, Sex increases dopamine in everybody that takes them. Exercise, Hard Work and Studying increasea dopamine but it is subjective 8. After achieving something, Dopamine increases but after some time it falls down. It falls down even below the baseline. The extent it drops below the baseline is directly proportional to how high the peak was. After achieving something, if you feel preety happy, the dopamine will not fall that much but if you feel extremely happy, your dopamine will fall extremely after a day or two. (Eg:- Postpartum Depression). Anyway, we return to the baseline after some time.  9. If we continue to engage in something exciting  regularly, after sometime it will be less exciting to us. 10. Some people release dopamine at higher level after a certain activity which deplete the releasable pool of dopamine. So, after sometime, dopamine falls below base level and it leads to a low feeling. Some people do the dopamine spiking activity again and again to bring back dopamine up to experience pleasure again since they are feeling low. But as we know, they have depleted the stock of releasable dopamine. The baseline begins to lower again and again. This is called ADDICTION and Addicted people don't feel pleasure at all.  11. Addiction is the progressive narrowing of things that bring you pleasure. If I am addicted to video games. I will feel happy in only playing it. I will not feel happy in exercise, study, social activity and my life will be ruined. After a some time, my system will stop releasing dopamine even after playing video games and nothing is left for me which can increase my dopamine. This is the start of depression. Spiking dopamine again and again is the main cause of decline in The baseline level. 12. If you experience a win whether it is school, sports or relationship; be highly careful about allowing yourself to experience a huge peak of Dopamine.  13. You kind of like exercise and to do exercise you increase dopamine by drinking energy drink and listen music to do exercise then you are increasing the number of conditions required to achieve the high level of dopamine by doing exercise. Don't use stimulants everytime you study or everytime you workout or anything in which you want to enjoy the process. Taking these stimulants (Music, energy drinks, Motivational reels) before the task will reduce the level of enjoyment and undermine the ability to stay motivated. The best way is to get excitement and motivation from the task itself whether it is Study or Workout. So. ENJOY THE PROCESS only. 14. Some Healthy ways to increase Dopamine so that the base level is maintained:: Cold water Therapy which increases Adrenalin and nor-adrenalin rapidly while dopamine shows gradual increase to 2.5 times above baseline and comes back to normal in 3 hours (Here there is a sustained increase instead of Rise and Crash) 15. If you work hard for the end result then the process will become very challenging. 1:39:02 is an amazing example. When someone gives reward or we reward ourself then we tend to associate our pleasure with reward rather than the work itself and if the reward is stopped, we lose interest in the process of the work. But again, Take a special care of not spiking dopamine just prior or even after to the effort. Learn to raise Dopamine from effort itself. 16. Example of Porn: Those who are indulged in it find it difficult to seek enjoyment in the productive process. Watching porn and Masturbation increase dopamine level⬆️ and then fall down very quickly⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️ below base line . Now to raise dopamine level much higher is difficult to feel pleasure again.",

Isn't this a little contradicting to the point where we should learn to spike dopamine from effort itself? Wouldnt this mean that even if I am able to learn how to spike dopamine from working hard, running, working out, that eventually I will still find these activities less interesting and hence the dopamine spike will become smaller and smaller?   I just want to understand if I interpreted anything wrong or somehow its different when its spiking dopamine from effort itself.",

      "comment": "*What did i learn from this podcast:*  - cold showers are essential to my day, it can increase dopamine by 2.5 times (equivalent to that of cocaine ) but instead of having it crash down it maintains after! - Dopamine is a finite but renewable source, this means that if you were to have a big spike in dopamine it comes crashing down but it would go below your baseline, this will make you feel worse - If there are activities you want to continue doing, avoid stacking dopamine spiking activities together like pre workout, music, texting and working out if you wanna continue working out, the same principle will apply to studying etc… - if there is an activity you find difficult like studying, don’t spike dopamine before and after the activity, instead make yourself derive dopamine from the activity (studying itself). Especially when there is a great resistance to the activity, tell yourself that despite the activity being hard and difficult you are doing it BECAUSE you enjoy it! - “Don’t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort, and don’t spike dopamine after engaging in effort. Learn to spike dopamine from effort itself.” - Andrew Huberman  1:47:31 - Working only for the sake of a reward that will come afterwards can make it more challenging and us less likely to do it in the future because of the way dopamine affects time perception and only being released at the reward. This relates to growth mindset, pleasure from the process, from conquering the effort (deliberate effort exposure).",

You can ignore the rest of the day, or week, or year =) It 'defines' me. It is 'who I am' and who I want to be known as. (Don't mess with me, kinda image.)  =) Here's a nice little present for you and readers, relevant at 1:40:00 - maintaining dopamine during work, rather than the end-reward focus... (From Hackman & Oldham, 1980;  Smith, Kendall, & Hulin, 1969) 1 Task definition (clarity about what is to be done and how) 2 Task meaningfulness (the real purpose of the job, who it serves, what they get) 3 Task endpoints (defining milestones revealing advancement and satisfaction) 4 Task skill variety (change of activity rather than monotonous repetition) 5 Personal growth (feeling you are learning, becoming more capable, useful) 6 Personal autonomy (you have ability to make choices, decide how things are done) 7 Personal social contact (you share the experience instead of being alone).",

      "comment": "1. Cold Water therapy effects on dopamine, adrenaline and nor adrenalin  2. Dopamine can be released in 2 ways: Local release and volumetric release  3. How pleasurable or satisfying you feel doesn't depend on peak level of dopamine. It depends upon difference in baseline level and peak level of dopamine. How you feel depends upon your previous level of Dopamine as compared to present level. Many drugs just increase both baseline level and peak level instead of increasing the difference between them. A big Dopamine release makes it more challenging to achieve higher dopamine release the next time. There should not be High level nor low level of Dopamine for long.   4.Just Increasing dopamine level will make us excited but that excitement will be for very less period of time  5. Chocolate increases Dopamine 1.5 times but it goes away in few seconds. Desire of sex or act of sex increases dopamine 2 times  6. Nicotine (smoked) increases dopamine 2.5 times above base line (Very short lived)  7. Amphetamine, Cocaine, Nicotine, Sex increases dopamine in everybody that takes them. Exercise, Hard Work and Studying increases dopamine but it is subjective  8. After achieving something, Dopamine increases but after some time it falls down. It falls down even below the baseline. The extent it drops below the baseline is directly proportional to how high the peak was. After achieving something, if you feel pretty happy, the dopamine will not fall that much but if you feel extremely happy, your dopamine will fall extremely after a day or two. (E.g.:- Postpartum Depression). Anyway, we return to the baseline after some time.   9. If we continue to engage in something exciting  regularly, after sometime it will be less exciting to us.  10. Some people release dopamine at higher level after a certain activity which deplete the releasable pool of dopamine. So, after sometime, dopamine falls below base level and it leads to a low feeling. Some people do the dopamine spiking activity again and again to bring back dopamine up to experience pleasure again since they are feeling low. But as we know, they have depleted the stock of releasable dopamine. The baseline begins to lower again and again. This is called ADDICTION and Addicted people don't feel pleasure at all.   11. Addiction is the progressive narrowing of things that bring you pleasure. If I am addicted to video games. I will feel happy in only playing it. I will not feel happy in exercise, study, social activity and my life will be ruined. After a some time, my system will stop releasing dopamine even after playing video games and nothing is left for me which can increase my dopamine. This is the start of depression. Spiking dopamine again and again is the main cause of decline in The baseline level.  12. If you experience a win whether it is school, sports or relationship; be highly careful about allowing yourself to experience a huge peak of Dopamine.   13. You kind of like exercise and to do exercise you increase dopamine by drinking energy drink and listen music to do exercise then you are increasing the number of conditions required to achieve the high level of dopamine by doing exercise. Don't use stimulants every time you study or every time you workout or anything in which you want to enjoy the process. Taking these stimulants (Music, energy drinks, Motivational reels) before the task will reduce the level of enjoyment and undermine the ability to stay motivated. The best way is to get excitement and motivation from the task itself whether it is Study or Workout. So. ENJOY THE PROCESS only.  14. Some Healthy ways to increase Dopamine so that the base level is maintained:: Cold water Therapy which increases Adrenalin and nor-adrenalin rapidly while dopamine shows gradual increase to 2.5 times above baseline and comes back to normal in 3 hours (Here there is a sustained increase instead of Rise and Crash)  15. If you work hard for the end result then the process will become very challenging. 1:39:02 is an amazing example. When someone gives reward or we reward ourself then we tend to associate our pleasure with reward rather than the work itself and if the reward is stopped, we lose interest in the process of the work. But again, Take a special care of not spiking dopamine just prior or even after to the effort. Learn to raise Dopamine from effort itself.  16. Example of Porn: Those who are indulged in it find it difficult to seek enjoyment in the productive process. Watching porn and Masturbation increase dopamine level and then fall down very quickly below base line . Now to raise dopamine level much higher is difficult to feel pleasure again.",

So if you need to study or do hard work, do that first, even just 15 mins in the morning after you wake up dedicated to look at the study material or work goals can have a positive effect.",
