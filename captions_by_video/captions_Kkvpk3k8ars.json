I would wonder though why those people go to the extreme of paying someone to be their GF 🤔 . Maybe a deeper issue that needs to be resolved 😶.  I'm sure she'll make a great friend,  but wants to keep her business and personal life separate. 👍",

It’s a job, and she is obviously doing something that brings people satisfaction. I enjoy when my barista takes the time to make amazing latte art. And i don’t feel taken advantage of when I tip that person, knowing they did it for the tip, yet it also brightened my day and brought joy to my life. I’m so tired of judgy people imposing their rigid standard of expectation on all others. YES there is a line that SHALL NOT BE CROSSED, and some awful things in this world that people-both men and women do for money (you can rent a boyfriend here too folks, ive seen more than one doc on this subject) but i do not see her as one of those awful people, worthy of such harsh criticism and judgment. “I only participate in wholesome activities. Since I don’t dink alcohol, I won’t go out if they require me to drink”. 4:25  She’s a lot more “wholesome” than some friends i know who are out looking for the wrong thing. Either way...irregardless, It’s just not our place to say.... And props to her for having guts to go on film and owning herself fully for who she is and what she does. It’s cool- she’s the “Meow Girl” folks!✌🏼🐱 ♥️",
