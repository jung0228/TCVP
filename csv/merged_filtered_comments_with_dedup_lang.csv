I'm slightly confused though as to what the point of sharing it was? And to be honest, I'm completely confused as to what the point of Fox sharing the details of the deaths were? I didn't hear anything that refuted a single thing that Trevor said? The point of the Black Lives Matter movement is that Black people are being killed by white police officers DISPROPORTIONATELY to white people in this country. For as many cases of people being shot and killed after attacking police officers that were mentioned in the video, there are just as many cases of completely innocent people being killed.

Cash balance: $250 = 750 - 300 - 200 At the end of year 1, we see they sold $800 of lemonade, and paid $530 in labor costs (remember, we already bought the inventory, and depreciation is a ""non-cash"" charge - we're accounting for having to replace the lemonade stand every 5 years). Cash balance: $520 = 250 + 800 - 530 Finally, they paid $25 in interest, leaving them with negative EBT (earnings before tax) of $15 and therefore had a tax credit of $5 (this was sort of skipped over): Cash balance: $500 = 520 - 25 + 5  Note this matches the ending cash balance (bottom line) in the cash flow statement at 8:15.

BEWz4SXfyCQ,joerogan,podcast,['47:38'],"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🛸 Bob Lazar worked at S4, a subset of Area 51, on advanced propulsion systems for UFOs. 03:30 📑 Bob received a letter from EG&G, leading to an interview and a job at S4 with a focus on power and propulsion systems of alien spacecraft. 06:05 🌐 On his first day, Bob encountered a flying saucer in a hangar, marking the start of his involvement with extraterrestrial technology. 11:05 🛠️ Briefings indicated the goal was to back engineer the alien craft, and Bob's specific role focused on power and propulsion. 15:45 🌍 Nine different extraterrestrial crafts were housed at S4, each unique in design, but details about their origin were limited. 17:09 ⚠️ Bob expressed concerns about the lack of understanding of the technology and the potential dangers involved in working with such advanced systems. 19:29 🌌 Paperwork suggested the crafts were from the Zeta Reticuli star system, specifically ZR3, but Bob couldn't verify the accuracy of this information. 20:51 🌌 Bob Lazar discusses Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system, and mentions it's where the technology he worked on may have originated. 25:31 🌀 The reactor had a base similar to a cyclotron, and Element 115 was a key fuel. The stable version of Element 115, acquired from the craft, defied known physics. 31:19 👽 The inside of the craft had three small seats around the reactor, no control panels, and minimal recognizable components. It seemed designed for beings smaller than humans. 34:11 🤔 Bob Lazar speculates on the different roles of sections within the craft, mentioning gravity amplifiers, emitters, and a potential navigation or computer system. 35:34 📏 The estimated size of the craft is around 52 feet in diameter. Bob Lazar mentions seeing nine different crafts, each with distinct designs and sizes. 38:22 🕵️ Bob Lazar's work involved limited hours and unusual scheduling. He worked on testing and analyzing the craft, violating traditional thermodynamic principles. 43:33 🚀 The UFO demonstrated impressive maneuvers, lifting off quietly, hovering silently, and making left-right movements, defying conventional physics. 45:22 🛣️ Test flights of the craft were scheduled on Wednesdays with lower highway traffic, emphasizing secrecy around Area 51. Lazar had the test flight schedule, allowing him to witness more radical maneuvers. 47:38 👽 Lazar's secretive work led to strained personal relationships, with his wife suspecting an affair due to the monitored phone calls, creating additional stress in his life. 49:42 📹 Lazar took friends to witness a test flight, capturing video footage that George Knapp possesses.

BEWz4SXfyCQ,joerogan,podcast,['44:50'],"@44:50 I really want to believe Bob, but his general lack of details on basically everything is unnerving. Most everything he says is something that can be thought up with a creative mind after watching star wars, which had just come out a few years prior to when he says this took place. Elements on the periodic table are setup that way for a reason based on properties and doesn't prove too much. For example at this timestamped moment. He describes the moment as it should be and how it could be envisioned, but sounds like it's not been lived. He never mentions, ""I"" walked underneath the craft or it moved above ""me"" and it disappeared from my point of view from the gravity influence. This is your first time seeing it hover around, and you act like that's supposed to be known that it disappears when its above you. Like you spent hours there everyday working on a project for 6 months and don't have exact dimensions measured of everything? You ""estimated"" the craft to be roughly 52 feet in diameter that you were working on for 6 months? Doesn't 52 feet in diameter seem a little big for something that holds three, 3 foot tall creatures with a basketball sized power source. He fails to mention much of any details from the briefings he had read before working on the craft when asked about them multiple times. What tests were made on every inch of the ship? What chemicals did you test on the outer shell? Did any acids effect it? Would the material heat up or change colors if you took a blow torch right against it? There was a bullet hole through one so how strong can it be? You guys didn't try to pound on it with a hammer? There's no buttons or anything at all in the craft but this other group is working on the craft and made the dash go transparent somehow and you didn't try to figure out where the button is?  It honestly sounds like something out of a very vivid dream someone may have, being able to easily recall and never forget the experience, but lacking detailed information and only remembering the main points. That being said I still believe we are probably in possession of otherworldly craft. If we had these craft for that long though and have been reverse engineering them. Im curious as to an example of technology that could have stemmed from studying these craft over all these years that might be widely used for different purposes today? But If I properly went through the process of a degree and putting effort in to become a physicist, my title on a google search would not read ""self proclaimed physicist"".",en,5.0

And I figured that the video’s answer to why so many people avoid pigs would be rooted in some “scientific” explanation. Not surprised; but sure, there are many scientific/historic reasons as to why Muslims may avoid pork, same with the Children of Israel/Yahudi (Jews, it’s an anachronistic term so I tend to not use it so much) avoid it. These can be the   many health benefits or have some reason historically. But the REAL answer as to why both groups avoid it is simple:  Allah (Adonai/אלהא) commanded it as so and we obey.  Now for the non-religious this may seem foolish or confusing. But the reality is when God commands something we listen and obey. The same way we obey a king, president, teacher, parent when they command us to do something applies here. Now if we question it, we can find many explanations and at the end of the day whichever one best makes sense we’ll accept it. It’s just one less animal to kill we’re content with Chickens, Goats, Lambs, Cows etc it’s not that important to eat it for us. Also as a Muslim we believe the Quran is the “DIRECT” word from Allah. I implore you to research “Author of the Quran” because it cannot be the prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him). The information, signs, stories, style and miracles that can be derived from it show that the authorship of the book is beyond the scope of a human. So if we assume that God, Allah, really sent down the Quran then no matter what the book asks us to do we listen.   Side note it’s interesting why some if not many Christians denominations have abandoned the pork ban. I’m aware that Paul suggested that Jesus changed/abolished the law but Jesus himself said in Matthew 5:17 that he has not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. Even if Peter received a vision from him, those are what happened to Peter and Paul. Shouldn’t it make more sense to follow the laws of the Torah if Jesus came to fulfill it? (even if one was a gentile when converting) But that’s a different topic and I’m not here to argue/debate. Just wanted to share some my thoughts on this topic.",en,4.0

JN3KPFbWCy8,LexFridman,podcast,['11:10'],"🎥 Elon Musk discusses the role of war and military conquest in empires throughout history. 00:50 War and military conquest have been a significant part of most empires and dynasties throughout human history.  The Roman Empire celebrated excellence in warfare and had many excellent generals.   🎖 Many people in the US lack a visceral understanding of the horrors of war, unlike those on the frontlines in Ukraine and Russia. 11:10 The speaker's grandfather was severely traumatized by his experience in World War II.  The speaker's grandfather was not eligible for officer status due to not finishing high school.  The speaker's grandfather was categorized as a cannon fighter.   🌍 The video discusses the inevitability of conflict between dominant powers and the impact of economic strength on war. 21:31 Athens and Sparta couldn't avoid a clash despite seeing it coming.  The United States has been the most powerful economic engine since 1890.  China's economy is likely to surpass that of the US, leading to potential conflict.   🌍 Acts of kindness can be an antidote to the cycle of reciprocal violence. 32:45 After World War II, instead of crushing the losers, the Marshal Plan was implemented to help rebuild Germany and other countries.  Conspicuous acts of kindness can stop the cycle of reciprocal violence.  Grock AI assistant, an incredible engineering work, was recently released.   🤔 The video discusses fundamental questions about consciousness, emotions, and the existence of a soul. 42:56 There may be more to consciousness and emotions than just atoms bumping into each other.  AI may play a role in discovering the nature of consciousness and the soul.  The existence of thoughts, actions, and feelings in humans is a compelling illusion that needs further exploration.   🤔 The speaker discusses the idea of a simulation and suggests that higher beings may create simulations to see what happens. 53:44 The purpose of a simulation may be to observe the outcomes and see what happens.  Humans create simulations to understand and predict outcomes, such as with rocket launches.  Simulations are necessary when testing something that cannot be directly observed or tested.   🌍 The video discusses the potential dystopian effects of AI and compares it to the societies depicted in '1984' and 'Brave New World'. 1:05:29 The drug called Soma mentioned in 'Brave New World' is actually a real muscle relaxant used for treating pain and discomfort.   ⚡ The growing demand for electricity for electric vehicles and AI is leading to an electricity shortage, and the challenge lies in maximizing the useful productivity per watt for training NE nuts. 1:15:30 The limiting factor to progress in this domain is silicon chips, and there will soon be more chips than can be plugged in and turned on.  The initial constraint is voltage step down Transformers, as power needs to be stepped down from 300,000 volts to around 7 volts.   🔍 The speaker discusses their bias towards open sourcing and their concerns about AI safety. 1:24:59 The speaker believes open sourcing is important but is concerned about the lack of AI safety focus in companies like Google.  The speaker mentions their discussions with Larry Page about AI safety and how Larry did not care about it.  The speaker highlights Google's acquisition of DeepMind and their abundance of AI researchers and resources.   🎥 AI can analyze movies and recommend them to users with high accuracy, surpassing the recommendations of friends. 1:35:27 AI can analyze movies and act as a movie critic or TV series to recommend movies to users.  The AI's recommendations are based on analyzing hundreds of millions of movies and shows, making it better than friends' recommendations.

Sometimes I‘ve been unimpressed with Elon, but more often I think I’d enjoy being stuck in an elevator, with either of these two—it’d be interesting instead of somewhere between dreary & dreadful! Around 53:45—Lex “Is there a master plan” vs Elon saying there’d be no purpose for a simulation, because a creator would know the outcome:  When I went to college (in Fremont 😎) in the early 80s, for our RN program 92% was the cutoff for an A, 84% for a B, & 76% for a C.  75% & below—a D—failed the program.   People busted their fannies to stay in the program, but it would’ve been hard to argue with the rationale: Patients deserve a nurse who has sufficient grasp of each area to pass both theory & the “practical lab” with a minimum of 75%.  (Certainly they gel together further in a job!) I think we’re here with a purpose, but for there to be a God, the results would have to matter.   I think God knows what we’ll choose, but we don’t.   I think individuals often think enough of themselves—or we rationalize—that the purpose of life is to prove to ourselves who we really are, especially if we stand up for what we believe is right or for core principles—especially when they conflict.  Do we choose Good, Better or Best, or are we content with “So What”, or to take advantage of others?  I tend to think whatever is after this life, there are parameters here, and there, that matter.  Maybe only those with deep integrity will have the full benefit of the best of the next life.  I always thought all the building blocks of our world have intelligence—I agree with Elon that that must be all or nothing.  I was also pleasantly surprised to hear Elon say Israel should aim for extraordinary kindness and that an eye for an eye is a strong perspective in the Middle East!  I’ve been saying it’s hard to expect Do Unto Others and “Go the extra mile” when culturally the whole region’s kept the Abrahamic law of an eye for an eye.   “Commit extraordinary kindness”…. Well verbalized, and he’s right, that’s the only thing that would be a help.   Being a doormat or inviting repeat acts of aggression is not part & parcel of forgiveness.  Forgiveness is about not letting others’ aggression change or sour who you are inside.  A balance IS possible, but the people would have to push Netanyahu.

YAxL4TB6pmQ,TheYoungTurks,news,['01:21'],"(01:21) ""...because of a financial system that leaves millions underserved."" Partially true, and here's the truth of the statement:  The Federal Government has made cheap money available to banks, and banks still maintain very high interest rates on credit cards.  All consumers must service loans having interest rates that are substantially higher than what banks pay for the money that they are given by the Federal Reserve.  Considering the rates charged to banks, home loans should be hovering at about 2 percent, student loans should be at about 3 percent, and credit card interest rates should be at about 10 percent.  There is another side to this story.  Manufacturing has slipped from America and has been sent to China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.  Americans must compete with extremely desperate people for work that used to pay a living wage.  Some argue that if only Americans would get rid of that pesky minimum wage, and those ridiculous clean air and water regulations, everything would be great!  If ""great"" means being paid less per hour than the cost of a small potato, then I guess things would be great, but I don't think that's a ""great"" idea.  I do not understand why Americans (even the desparate) are so against re-establishing tariffs on imported manufactured goods.  What is so wrong with that?  What is so wrong with employing Americans, FIRST?  Clearly, giving our manufacturing away to the rest of the world has not made it a more stable place.  Look at how China is rattling its sword at Japan and Taiwan.  Look at what's going on in the Ukraine.  Look at the continuing horrors going on in the Middle East!

YAxL4TB6pmQ,TheYoungTurks,news,['5:37'],"""Don't Cry Over Spilled Milk"", You'll Be There All Day!  My comments to the YouTube Video: ""SPENT: Looking For Change"" My Classification: Finances - Financial Overhaul  Rather than discussing the obvious, the results of bad decisions regarding how one spend's or does not save money, I would encourage a dialogue that looks at the ""root cause"" of financial woes, both for individuals and corporations. We also must not forget the fact that 'corporation's' are groups of 'individuals'!   There is a money management system in place, and has been since the beginning of time, that if followed correctly benefits everyone.  It's simply: ""1 + 1 = 2"", ""2 - 1 = 1"", ""0 + 0 = 0"". Problem is this simple money management system does not work when emotionalism takes a front seat.  All human beings need to feel secure within themselves. How that security looks to each one is different as habits are formed early on in a person's life; before grade school! If a person has learned to make decisions using emotions as their 'yardstick', the outcome's can be disastrous.    Some of the causes of emotional spending are triggered by fear; the fear of being lonely, being unloved, not being able to live as one has become accustomed, no longer able to satisfy selfish desires, no longer accepted by those who are privileged. Fear turn's simple task's into monstrous nightmare's.  My opinion is that most of our governing laws have been created and put into action based on ""individual's"" emotion's. You must have an emotional experience that moves you to action. Something must be triggered deep within your soul which prompts you to 'do something'. When making critical decisions regarding finances, ask yourself this question, ""How will this decision affect me as well as those around me""? [affect - ""produce a change""  effect - ""result"" / ability to bring about a result. ]  If at any point and time you find yourself unable to stop and ask this question before you act, then there's a good possiblity the outcome will not be the most desirable.  I also believe there is always hope! Just because your circumstances seem bleak to impossible right now, remember a journey begins with the first step. Stop where you are and begin anew. Look back only to understand those things that got you where you are today; and be honest. Start a new journey by doing things differently. Also always keep alert as life is a constant change; each new day brings about newness.   Matthew 5:37King James Version (KJV)  37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.  5:1–7:29 The Sermon on the Mount is the first of five great blocks of Jesus’ teaching in Matthew (Introduction: Characteristics and Themes). It is the classic statement of the ethics of the kingdom of God. The early church favored a literal interpretation but fully applied the sermon only to special classes of Christians, especially monastics. Others, such as the Anabaptists, have attempted to apply it literally to every Christian. Still others have viewed it as legalistic, as a provisional, temporary code, or as a heightening of the law of Moses with the aim of inducing repentance (Luther). Finally, some have argued that the demands of the sermon are not to be understood literally, but that Jesus was concerned with inward disposition rather than outward conduct, or that the severity of the sermon is intended to compel a decision by the hearers either for or against God’s demands on their lives.  We must recognize that the sermon is directed to the disciples and through them to the whole church today. The sermon addresses both inward motives and outward conduct (5:21, 22, 27, 28). These legitimate demands are so strict (5:48) that no one can completely obey them, and we are therefore driven to the grace and mercy of God. In some cases Jesus uses obviously intentional exaggeration to illustrate the absolute requirements of God’s law (5:29, 30).

The sound technician was supposed to shut down the mic when the recording started, but the mic was still open. He figured his mistake when the recorded vocal kicked in and pulled back the mic fader on the mixer, because the mic picked up her singing in a different pitch and possibly some sound bits from the stage speakers (at 1:21). You can actually hear the quick fade-out. Also, they put a somewhat heavy reverb effect on the mic line for the live part, whereas the vocal effects on the recording are rather light. Her voice sounded rather soft in the live part (or the live mic she used was less sensitive), but her vocal on the pre-recording was pretty loud/powerful.

H9B5mYfBPlY,TimFerriss,podcast,['6:11']," @JaneCooper190072  I'm soooo embarrassed for you. You lived your whole life thinking you were part of a religion that you don't even comprehend.    The Christian Apostle Paul, was the first - whole - intactivist ♥️🙏🏻😍  For Christmas I asked my family for the three book set “Commentary of the Holy Scriptures”, to give me more of a context of each book and verse of the New Testament; it also shows the scene which the passages were set within the second century.   In this day/age, local pastors/churches, friends, and family really suck with their narrow and limited (as well as ignorant) interpretations. They’re too confusing and silly, and my own interpretations I see don’t matter either. Everyone throws their own interpretations at each other, and it’s become annoying.  So I figure, it should be each of our goals to look into history (pre-10th century), to understand the one European view of these New Testament books. Not 40,000 new age American views.   My family was very kind, and I now own the set. It was written from Orthodox Archbishop Averky (Taushev), and they are the volumes that are widely circulated today in Russia which help others strengthen their faith.   Point being, I’m looking into circumcision specifically as my starting point. A quick glance over volumes II & III and trying to remember where I saw circumcision being spoken about...  I see two areas:  In the book of Acts, chapter 11 Volume II: the circumcised Christians at the time (Jewish Christians/Judaizers), were upset that Peter sat, lived, and ate with the “uncircumcised”. (P.56). These Judaizers were upset that these new people who also called themselves faithful Gentile converts, saw the “holiness of the Old Testament Law” as a false teaching. The Judaizers feverishly began to rebuke Peter for allowing this in his household, and it’s noted that this was only the start of Peter’s mission, and catechization of the faithful was not necessary at this time. “With this account, Peter did not directly answer the issues raised by the Jewish Christians, instead he showed them the will of God; to accept  those within the Church as brothers; and Peter’s account calmed them. (P. 57).  Volume III, p. 53 The Epistle of the Holy Apostle Paul to the Galatians:  I see that Galatia was a region in Asia Minor, neighboring Cappadocia, Lycaonia, Pontus, and other regions. The country was originally settled by Greeks, but soon the Jews moved to Galatia when Jews were forced out of Palaestine, Emperor Augustus gave special patronage to the Jews that moved to Galatia, which is mentioned by Josephus.   The Christian communities in Galatia began growing in large numbers, first with Paul, then Silas, and Timothy as they went through the cities delivering the news of the missionary journey from the apostles and strengthing their numbers.   P. 54. The purpose of this epistle was the apparently rabid Judaizers in Galatia, who began to insist on the necessity for circumcision, and other rites of the Old Jewish (Mosaic Law) for salvation. The Judaizers saw how lax Paul was, and his favor with Pagans, and they belittled his ministry by saying he wasn’t of Jesus Christ; he was only of his own selfish lips. Many Judaizers fell away by the time Paul arrived, (Gal 1:6). And he was astounded at how foolish and frivol the Judaizers were.   Paul immediately began to write to the people, to uncover their delusions. He wrote it with his own hand. (Gal 6:11).   Galatians is mapped out as follows:  1. Prologue, Paul’s greeting and introduction where he expresses the main theme. 1:1-10 2. A defense of Paul’s apostolic diginiry, which had been brought into question by the Judaizing false teachers. 1:11-2:1-21 3. A dogmatic section, in which Paul powerfully and completely reveals the main theme of his epistle — the reference of the Old Testament to the New, and the end of the importance of the Law of Moses (Jewish Law) after the coming of Christ the Savior. 3:1-29 & 4:1-31 4. A moral-instructive section, in which the foundation of the Christian life, separate of the Old Testament Law, is described. 5:1-26 & 6:1-10 5. A conclusion, in which concrete instructions are given concerning circumcision and reverence due to the Cross of Christ. 6:11-18  A few really cool points to summarize from the book of Galatians:   • Paul accounts his attendance to the first Christian Council of Jerusalem. (All Christians should additionally research the 7 important councils central to the faith).  • This Council declared Mosaic (Jewish Law) unnecessary in the life of a Christian.  • St Titus was one of the first uncircumcised (whole) men to be baptized and presented to the apostles, they did not require him cut for good reason.  • Paul’s epistle received sanction of all the elder apostles at this council. • The eldest of the apostles acknowledged how the Apostle Paul had a unique calling to preach to the uncircumcised; just as Peter’s calling was to the Jews.   ... SO MUCH MORE INFO. Christians who hadn’t already had a Jewish background, absolutely never cut for sure.",en,5.0

SkY1DiyCqTU,AbroadinJapan,travel,['11:30'],"I have visited Japan twice now, once last summer 2016 and just now Dec. 2017.  Yes, there are definitely things that are expensive especially in Tokyo but boy, you also have lots of cheap options.  This video is really good but I just want to clarify some things and/or add info.  The Tokyo subway is vast and is operated by multiple different lines (private and government).  One is a private company which is Japan Rail who also operate the Shinkansen.  You can only get the Japan Rail pass outside of Japan as a tourist and is definitely worth it.  Like the video says, it only takes one long ride on the Shinkansen to make the 1 week pass worth it and on top of that you can ride the Japan Rail trains in the city for free.  BUT, here is the clarification, JR is not the metro/subway, it is only a portion of it.  There is a massive network of trains.  If you ONLY got the JR pass, you cannot ride the rest of the subway system in Tokyo.  You can only ride on the trains operated by JR.  Now the video is wrong in that it says you have to stand around buying tickets if you don't get the JR pass.  That's also not true.  What you should do is to buy a PASMO or SUICA card.  These are literally train debit cards and they work across all these different train companies.  They come preloaded with amounts and you can just tap your way through all the trains and it will deduct an amount each time.  No need to go buy a ticket each time and figure out how much it costs.  When the balance runs low (and you'll see your balance every time you tap),  you can just re-charge them in the ticket machines.  I got mine from Haneda airport and when I left I just returned it at the airport and I got a 500 Yen deposit refund for the card.  Concerning the food, I would definitely pick Yoshinoya over the other ones.  I find its quality just a bit better and the prices just as good.  But I had a lunch at Nakajima in Shinjuku and it is a 1 Michelin Star restaurant.  Guess how much the lunch is:  800 Yen!  So how's that for a budget lunch at a 1 Michelin star restaurant.  It opens at 11:30am so lineup early.  I waited just short of an hour but if you get there like 11:30am your wait should be shorter.  There is also a 1 Michelin star ramen place in Tokyo (near Sengoku) and cheapest ramen is 1000 Yen, its name is Tsuta.  And there are many other top notch ramen shops whose prices are cheaper too.  I also find 7 Eleven, Lawson, Family Mart to be full of good stuff to buy but you can try their local grocery stores and they have even MORE items with the same prices.  And the food shops in the train stations are amazing and tons of selection with excellent prices.  I also agree with the video's recommendation of business hotel.  I got one last year and it slept 3 of us plenty well with a kitchen/dining table too and it was just a bit higher than the capsule hotel prices.  Happy travels in Japan!",en,130.0

We need to hear your testimony.  This nation needs Godly men to cry out in repentance on behalf of our nation and the nations of the world.  Men need to repent in tears on their face before GOD. Men were meant to be the protector to the weak.  True religion is helping the widows and visiting the fatherless.  What have we become when we exploit the weak instead of protect them.   He said he would hear our cries and heal our land.  We pray for revival because this type of lifestyle only leads to death.  Jesus said in Revelations 12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.

A good example in this video is his response to the very last question from the audience when he pauses for a tension-mounting 15-20 seconds ... before finally insightfully answering a question on how he would advise the current very politically correct Canadian Prime Minister on where he might be going wrong.

It hit me that the same is true with regard to food.  We can come up with an infinite number of dietary plans or ways of eating, but there truly are only a limited number of ones which will sustain human health generation after generation.  For instance, when human diets were researched almost 100 years ago, there was a wide variety, ranging from insects/nuts/fish on tropical islands to oil/fat/meat in the arctic, but all the diets still met certain narrow principles (A/D consumption from animal foods, fermenting grains/nuts/dairy, broth, salt, sea food, etc.).  No groups were vegan, for instance.  I suppose after hundreds of thousands of years, you sort of figure out what doesn't keep a population thriving long-term.    And (thinking aloud) we sort of threw it all out in the 20th century.  Progress at all costs, I guess.  Maybe there's wisdom in listening to the ""democracy of the past""?  We now imagine we can eat any way, live any way, marry any way, raise children any way, and it will all work out.  Maybe it magically will, or maybe, as always, nature will select the fittest and the rest will die off, either with bad health or tribal warfare.",en,39.0

My name is Markiplier and welcome to Fleeing the Complex. Now, this is a direct sequel to Escaping the Airship, which came after Stealing the Diamond which came after Escaping the Prison which came after... Something about a bank (Breaking the Bank). I don't know, I played them all out of order so I don't really know which ones come after which. But I know that I love these games and I've been waiting for this one for a long time- (Ooh. Sorry.) 0:20 Dmitri Johannes Petrov (as shown in 31:20): Ah, hello, Henry. Welcome: to ""The Wall"". Some of the most cunning and notorious criminals are kept here (Mark: And me.), and now we have the infamous Henry Stickmin. You're going to be here for a long time. 0:36 Mark: Because I blew up the w- 0:37 Dmitri Johannes Petrov: Grigory, take him. 0:39 Mark (whispering): Sorry! Didn't mean to ta- 0:41 Dmitri Johannes Petrov: You wait here until cell found. 0:43 Mark: Sorry! 0:45 Mark: Hello! Who are you? 0:48 Mark: Do not- What does the sign say? Do not. Either way, I'm very bad at these games which means I'm very good at finding all the failures. And this game has over 60 unique failures that I've seen.. Or that I've heard about! 0:59 Henry proceeds to ask for help 1:02 Mark:..What? Was that your flirting noise? And how did she do that? She's very strong! 1:07 Mark: Okay, bye! I won't come rescue you I suppose! 1:13 Mark: Oh. Uh.. Maybe I should help her out- maybe? 1:16 Mark: Oh hi. Oh yay! I got a friend ! 1:20 Mark: Oh man, there's gonna be so many (Ellie: Thanks!) different ways- 1:23 Guard 1:...And I'm like: ""Look at how much I care"". I don't care. I ended up buffing up my guys and doing like 70 damage. 1:30 Guard 2: Heh that's funny. 1:32 Mark: I'm gonna go with the one that has the fart sound effect because.. 1:35 Guard 2: Oh yeah that's not- 1:36 Mark: HEYYY LOOK AT ME! (He ha ha ha ha, no! Why would they do that? He ha ha ha ha ha ha!) 1:48 Mark: Oh, okay! I don't know what happened! Why did they all start dancing? Oh, man I love these games so much. 1:56 Mark: Uh..Uh..Uh ta- tall guy. I wanna go with tall guy. 2:01 Guard 2: Oh yeah, that's not, ok (whats he talking about here)- 2:03 Mark: Excuse me? (Henry: Hey, buddy.) 2:08 Mark: Oooh no! Oh ok! Alright then. Uhhh, how about this! 2:12 Guard 2: (repeats the same thing)- 2:13 Mark: Oh, look! We're smart! Oh, we did good! Man all the animations that went into these games is amazing. 2:19 Ellie: Hmm. If we can get you up there, you can get in and open this door. 2:23 Mark: Okay. How do I do that? Oh, the GraviToR (v2.0), this didn't work very god the last time, and I don't know how we're gonna have The Force, but uhh. I'll try the GraviToR- No, Judo Throw! 2:33 Mark: AAGH- Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! 2:37 Mark: Ok, The Force! Do we have that? 2:40 Mark: Oh God, why!? Nohohoho! ...Oh okay. Alright then, thank you! Thanks, ma'am! 2:48 Mark: Ow! Oh! Hello! 2:52 Ellie: Quick! In here. 2:54 Random Convict: Ula patusta! (idk what it means) 2:56 Guard 3: Hold in right there, inmates! 2:57 Mark: 'Ula patusta'? Uh, eh, ah... Grenade and taser! 3:04 Mark: How'd that happen!?... Oh, okay. You're not even gonna logic yourself out of this. Uh. Crossbow, grenade! WHA! 3:13 Guard 3: Ow. Uh oh. NEVER!! 3:15 Mark (after laughing about what happened): Oh, man, I love this game. I- I like- I remember when I was playing Escaping the Airship and then it gave me the best belly laughs. Oh. Anyway, enough about me, more about the game! (Shut up, Markiplier! No one cares what you think!) 3:32 Mark: Taser, sniper! AH! Oh, God! (Oh. Thank you!) 3:37 Guard 4: So, you say all inmate is out of cell? 3:40 Guard 5: Yeah, some idiot must've opened all the doors. (Ellie: Hey, I just grabbed these. Maybe they'll come in handy.) Are we waiting for someone, or? 3:45 Guard 4: I thought you press. 3:47 Mark: Umm, toss. Wha- I don't know why, but toss. 3:50 Guard 5: (Not sure what he's saying)- ...There is convict here! 3:54 Guard 4: Get down on ground. 3:55 Mark: Why did that work? Why did that one work?! Oh, God. What have I done? 4:02 Ellie: Henry! Help! 4:04 Dmitri Johannes Petrov: Back to your cell, inmate. 4:06 Mark: Re- Really? Adrenaline. Make a face. Imma go with adrenaline. 4:11 Henry proceeds to grab the wrong stick-person. 4:13 Mark: Oh hi. Well, okay! Huh? If I was going that fast anyway why wouldn't it work before? (Chooses make a face) 4:21 Dmitri Johannes Petrov: What, you think that will upset me? Oh, very ma- (gets hit by a fucking car) 4:26 Ellie: Thanks, I guess? Now let's get out of here. 4:30 Mark: Yay, we were saved by random chance! Man, there are a lot of ways to go about things. Yeah, thanks green-haired du- Ooooh. I'm dead- Oooh ho ho ho ho! Oh, okay. 4:44 Mark: How about the truck! Not as cool as the motorcycle, but it's pretty good anyway. Let me guess, it's the company owned truck and it's gonna come right back into the building. (Random convict: Eh, who's driving?) 4:54 Mark: AWW, MAN! Okay, alright then. Alright, the really cool motorcycle, that's probably the best way to go! 4:59 Dmitri Johannes Petrov: Well, if it isn't Henry. (I got no fucking clue about what he is saying). You are going to regret every- (gets stopped by a stop sign) 5:09 Mark: Holy crap! Where'd you get that? Why is he still alive?! 5:17 Mark: YEAH!! I did it! I got a friend and we went out together! Yeah! I really don't know how long this games gonna be, because that- that was just ONE of the endings and there are SO many places that I could've gone. What they've added, which is really nice about this, is they've added THIS. Which is a map of the different things that I could do and all the failures that I've seen, so that I can actually go back and play through and try to find the failures again, so that's exactly what I'm gonna do. (Deep breath) Starting from here. 5:46 Mark: Bounce Bros! Aw, ho ho ho ho ho ho kay. 5:52 Mark: I love this. Okay, the GraviToR, which I knew was gonna be bad. 'Cause it's ALWAYS been bad! (thinks that it will actually work) Oh, (quickly fails) oh!...Huh? 6:02 Mark: Sniper, crossbow! (laughs) NO! NO! (laughs some more) Oh my God! ""Let's see that instant replay"". (Laughs his ass off at the MLG video) 6:26 Mark: YouTube Poops and MLG compilations are my favorite things to watch on YouTube. Okay, anyway. Alright, uh, pass by. 6:35 Guard 5: Will we group with, uh, third floor? We'll help them clear out maximum security, how about that? 6:40 Guard 4: Da. I like. 6:41 Mark (realizing he's screwed):..Oh! 6:42 Random convict:...GO GET THE GUARDS! 6:44 Mark (laughing): Okay. Alright, blend in. 6:49 Ellie: Hold the elevator! Thanks. Can you believe this inmate operate? Crazy, huh? 6:54 Guard 5: Yes, it is pretty crazy. Oh, are you guys new here? 6:57 Ellie: Oh yeah, we transferred..from.. the eight floor. 7:00 Guard 5 (doubting): From the cafeteria? Nice try, inmates. 7:05 Mark: Oh, well, then. That was less interesting as I thought it be. 7:10 Mark: The KNEE! Prepare thy groins! 7:13 Henry does a smash 7:17 Mark: Who the hell was that back there? Alright, imma go the branching pattern. (quickly realizes he's gonna abandon Ellie) Oh no! Why would I abandon my friend?! I'd be such a douchey thing to do! Alright, let's do exactly that thing. ""Ellie will remember that"" well too bad, Ellie! I gotta do this all by myself! 7:28 Guard 1 (from earlier):..So, at this point, he only has like, 10 health left. And he plays ""The gates are open!"", and I'm like ""Look at how much I care"". Heh, I don't care. 7:38 Mark: (Deep Breath) I'm gonna pickpocket something for some reason. (After watching) Cool! A Skyrim reference! I guess. 7:53 Mark: Command Melody. Ah, (The Legend of Zelda) Wind Waker references, I love it! (After failing) Oh, okay! Well, good, for, me, then! 8:14 Mark: Imma sprint on ya. Imma sprint on ya. 8:17 Guard 1: I ended up buffing up my guys and doing... Was that the convict? 8:21 Guard 2 (from earlier): Uhh, yeah, I think so. 8:23 Guard 1: What are we supposed to do when someone tries to escape again? 8:26 Guard 2: Uhhh.. I think shoot em'. 8:28 Guard 1: Ah, yes. That sounds right. 8:34 Mark: Oooh! No, (laughs)! Oh, okay. (Deciding) Whoopee Cushion. Because why not? 8:37 Guard 1: I ended up buffing up my guys and- (whoopee cushion makes its thing) 8:39 Guard 2: Oh, come on! 8:41 Guard 1: Are you serious? That was totally you! 8:43 Guard 2: You what? Don't you accuse me! 8:45 Guard 1: Come on, just admit it! 8:46 Guard 2: It wasn't me! 8:49 Mark: Oh man, I gotta stop picking the silly ones because it's obviously the silly ones aren't gonna be the ones that actually work. I've played these games enough, I should probably know about this. (To Henry) Use the GraviToR! (Deciding) Power Jump. Alright. 9:07 Mark:..Hey! Why did that- Ooh, what? Why did that one work?! Why do I always pick the ones that work? Let's do the logical Longshot! BANG! I wonder how this gonna go wrong. (In realization) Uh oh. 10:07 Mark: OOOOOOH! OH MY GOD! (Laughing) Did his spine explode?! Augh (laughing). (Deciding) Balloon. Because logic and reason. 10:20 Mark: But, no! It's- it's oxygen! It's- it's not lighter than air! It's not! It's just air in that, it wouldn't- Oh it got- OH, it was so big it slid- swiggles- friction... I'm not smart. (Deciding) Yeah, balance. Seems logical. (After failing)...Well. Plunger Boots! (Deciding something else instead) He- Helium! 10:54 Mark: I sometimes forget that this game kinda forgets about reality a little bit... Oh boy, it worked! I'm so happy! Alright, let's just keep moving forward. (Deciding) The box. 11:11 Guard 7: Huh? Just a box. (Are you thinking what I'm thinking?)",en,811.0

Oh, 12:00 A.M, the first night. If I didn’t want to stay the first night, why would I stay any more than five? Why would I say anymore than two - hello. Okay...Hello? Hello - oh, ah I can’t move. That’s a creepy skull...There’s creepy things on the wall - Oh, hello. Phone Guy begins dialogue “Hello, hello hello,” Hi! “Uh, I wanted to record a message for you, to help you get settled in on your first night.” Eugh.. “Um, I actually worked in that office before you, and I’m finishing up my last week now as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming..” Euuagh..! “But I’m here to tell you, there’s nothing to worry about,” Agh.. “You’ll do fine! So, let’s just focus on getting you through your first week..” Okay! Sounds go- “Ah, let’s see..First there’s an introductory greeting from the company that I’m supposed to read - i-it’s kind of a legal thing, you know, ahm - ‘Welcome to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza-” Okay “‘..A magical place for kids and grownups alike-” Mark wheezes indistinctly in the background Heheha.. “..Where fantasy and fun come to life,” Eugha..! “”Freddy Fazbear entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person, upon discovering that damage or death has occured, a missing person report will be filed within ninety days or as soon as property and premises had been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpet’s have been replaced,’ blah blah blah - now that might sound bad, I know, but-” Yeah! “-There’s really nothing to worry about! Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No, if I was forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years, and I never got a bath, I’d probably be a bit irritable at night too. So just remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children, and you need show them a little respect, Right?” Okay! “-Okay-” Ha-okay! “So just be aware, the characters fo tend to wander a bit-” Nehaheugh- “They’re one some kinda of free-roaming mode-” hehauhuhugh! “Uhh.. Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for two long,” Oohoohoo- “Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day, too, but then there was the bite of eighty-seven.” The bite..?! “Yeah..” What bite?! “It’s amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe,” Why?! “Now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as the night watch here, if any, is the fact that these characters - if they happen to see you after hours, they probably won’t recognize you as a person-” Oh..Oh! “They’ll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without it’s costume on. Now, since that’s against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear’s pizza, they’ll probably try tooo.. Forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit.” Oh, I get it… “Uhm, now that wouldn’t be so bad if the suits themselves weren’t filled with cross-beams, wires, and animatronic devices-” Augh? “”Especially around the facial area,” uh-huh.. “Now you can imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those can cause a bit of discomfort-” Yeah! “-or death. “Uh, the only parts of you that would get to see the light of day would be your eyeballs and teeth that pop out of the front of the mask-” Euah! Oh! Why? What happened? “Now, they didn’t tell you these things when you signed up, but hey! First day should be a breeze, I’ll chat with you tomorrow, uh.. Check those cameras and remember to close the doors, but only if absolutely necessary.” That’s not good! “*incomprehensible* because of the power. Now, goodnight!” Phone guy’s dialogue ends. Goodnight? Oooh no! Oh that’s bad! I understand what I need to do. I need to watch the cams so that they don’t come after m- startled gibberish - Ho hi! There you aaaaaare, pretty bunny thiing… Ooh-kay, okay, okay, I get it, I get it, I get it- where’d you go- You’re still there? Alright, you stay there. I don’t know if it’s good that you’re staring at me - Oh my god, I thought it was weird that it couldn’t move, but this is totally different brief pause than any horror game I’ve ever played. So, what you gotta do incase you’re not getting it, is you gotta watch pause to take a breath the cameras to make sure they don’t come by, while you gotta watch power. Is he still there..? Hi, you’re still there - wait a minute, what? Did you move? Ok-ie, you didn’t move. You don’t move neither. You don’t move nothin’! Don’t see ya movin’, I don’t wanna see anything.. Hohoh, my god! This Is terrifying! Why do I leave the doors open, why isn’t there enough power? Hi, okay you moved again. Hi, what’re you doing there? Might be gettin’ a little close to mee.. Uh oh, oh, oh no.. Oh no, no! No, no no no, noo no no no eughh! Close it, ngahh! Hagh, don’t look at me! Okay, you’re over there, alright.. It’s okay! Why can’t I even have enough power for lights? takes a breath stay right there, you douchebag! You stay right - aff, there! another audible breath ..God damn it! That is like this is like the most terrifying game I’ve ever played! Ugh, they’re gonna pop out at me! Oh, god he’s gone - hi, okay you’re just gonna alternate between the two places, it’s totally fine, your other friends.. They ain’t movin’.. softly They ain’t move much.. I see where I am, you’re not near me! So that’s good.. Just gonna pauses briefly periodically check How much longer do I need - I need less ‘til six A.M, am I gonna have enough power? And if I run out of power am I able to get by? Oh god… You stay right there! Why am I still using some power? Oooh, god.. Seriously I’m gibberish - This is like, this is like… Bad! You’re still there, kay - this is the first night! They said it should be easy the first night so I’m only assuming one of em’ is gonna be wandering around and its just the creepy bunny guy. Happy fun time at Freddies Fun Land.. Havin’ such a wonderful time.. Still there? Okay, you’re still there! I’m gonna name you Bunny pause Baaalliday oh, god where’d he go?! He’s here! Hooh! Where’d he go? Hi again, okay.. You stay right thaff - there! And I don’t have to deal with you! ..Probably shouldn’t do that, I need to conserve power! God dammit that was like.. Half the damn thing, the doors were down! ..Still there? softly hookay, okay, ookay.. Heheuhahahaha..*faint tune begins playing* I hear that! ...I hear that! Oh god! Where’s the other one? Where is he? Eagh! Euugh! Whereishe? Where’d he go? Where’d he go, where’d he go? Where are both of them? Bothofem’- Hi, you’re really close to meee.. Oh god, it’s not six A.M. yet? Hi, okay, so I think I just need to keep the left door closed.. Mark makes faint noises of panic that gradually grow in volume uhh, hehauhaha! Uhh, uhuh - Not okay, not okay! Is he behind that door? No? Where’d he go? Where’d he AH! Oh, hi, hi! Hi, hi, hi, hi, okay, okay, I don’t have much power left. What’re you gonna do? Is the other one still there? Ngh! ambient noise rings out ..Hi! Ooh, you moved again! Where, where, where where… Heehuhahaha! What do I do? What do I do? Oooooh, you’re still right behind that dohoor.. Hoo what happens if I open the door? Imma run out of power! Ooh, Imma run out of power! Ishethere? gibberish that gives way to wheezing ensues I don’t wanna die! Aaah, 1 percent power! gasps for air doors come up and an ambient effect is triggered as the power goes out ingame AH! Ooh no..! Oh no.. Noo, no no no no no no no! Oh, no no nono no.. a jingle begins to play as Mark stares at the screen in fear, soon noticing the blinking eyes of the games mascot HI! OH, GOD DAMMIT! HOW ARE YOU DOING? jingle changes as the dialogue “6 AM” is put on screen Did I make it? Mark spews gibberish and throws his arms up, gasping for air Yeah! Oh god, not again! Why would I do this? gibberish my job? deep breath ookay, okay. So I ran out of power -but, phone rings oh hi, hi again. Do you have an se sage advice for me? Yep, kay, yep. I know, yep, yep yep yep. What can I do for you? phone continues to ring I know! Phone guy’s dialogue plays once again oh god..”Hello, hello! Uh, well if you’re hearing this you made it to day two! Uh, congrats!” wheezes briefly hehe! “I won’t talk quite as long this time, since Freddy and his friends tend to become more active as the week progresses.” whispered what? “Uh, it might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk, just to make sure everyone’s in their proper place-” No.. “Uh, interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn’t come off stage very often, I’ve heard he becomes a lot more active in the dark though, so hey, I guess that’s one more reason not to run out of power, right?” Aeugh! “Uh - I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door light - uh, there are blind spots in your camera view, and those blind spots happen to be right outside your doors, so if you can’t find something, or someone on your cameras, make sure-” Eugh!” to check the door light. Uh, you might only have a few seconds to react -uh, not that you would be in any danger, of course. Uh, far from that. Also, uhh, check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time, the character in there seems to be weakened and becomes more active if the cameras remain off for long periods of time.

The reason kids lose their natural creativity and imagination is because the schooling system, ESPECIALLY university, puts them in a box. This by the way is not some random consequence of education, but it is BY DESIGN. There is a world system (some call it the matrix, which is a metaphor for all you think the world is) and it is universities which are responsible for putting you in the box (the matrix) and maintaining this system. In other words, universities are the guardians of the system. Ken affirms this when he says at 11:20 ""They all came into being in order to meet the needs of industrialism"" and at 11:55 ""The universities designed the system in their image"".

QmOF0crdyRU,HubermanLab,podcast,['1:39:02'],"1. Cold Water therapy effects on dopamine, adrenaline and nor adrenalin 2. Dopamine can be released in 2 ways: Local release and volumetric release 3. How pleasurable or satisfying you feel doesn't depend on peak level of dopamine. It depends upon difference in baseline level and peak level of dopamine. How you feel depends upon your previous level of Dopamine as compared to present level. Many drugs just increase both baseline level and peak level instead of increasing the difference between them. A big Dopamine release makes it more challenging to achieve higher dopamine release the next time. There should not be High level nor low level of Dpamine for long.  4.Just Increasing dopamine level will make us excited but that excitement will be for very less period of time 5. Chocolate increases Dipamine 1.5 times but it goes away in few seconds. Desire of sex or act of sex increases dopamine 2 times 6. Nicotene(smoked) increases dopamine 2.5 times above base line (Very short lived) 7. Amphetamine, Cocaine, Nicotine, Sex increases dopamine in everybody that takes them. Exercise, Hard Work and Studying increasea dopamine but it is subjective 8. After achieving something, Dopamine increases but after some time it falls down. It falls down even below the baseline. The extent it drops below the baseline is directly proportional to how high the peak was. After achieving something, if you feel preety happy, the dopamine will not fall that much but if you feel extremely happy, your dopamine will fall extremely after a day or two. (Eg:- Postpartum Depression). Anyway, we return to the baseline after some time.  9. If we continue to engage in something exciting  regularly, after sometime it will be less exciting to us. 10. Some people release dopamine at higher level after a certain activity which deplete the releasable pool of dopamine. So, after sometime, dopamine falls below base level and it leads to a low feeling. Some people do the dopamine spiking activity again and again to bring back dopamine up to experience pleasure again since they are feeling low. But as we know, they have depleted the stock of releasable dopamine. The baseline begins to lower again and again. This is called ADDICTION and Addicted people don't feel pleasure at all.  11. Addiction is the progressive narrowing of things that bring you pleasure. If I am addicted to video games. I will feel happy in only playing it. I will not feel happy in exercise, study, social activity and my life will be ruined. After a some time, my system will stop releasing dopamine even after playing video games and nothing is left for me which can increase my dopamine. This is the start of depression. Spiking dopamine again and again is the main cause of decline in The baseline level. 12. If you experience a win whether it is school, sports or relationship; be highly careful about allowing yourself to experience a huge peak of Dopamine.  13. You kind of like exercise and to do exercise you increase dopamine by drinking energy drink and listen music to do exercise then you are increasing the number of conditions required to achieve the high level of dopamine by doing exercise. Don't use stimulants everytime you study or everytime you workout or anything in which you want to enjoy the process. Taking these stimulants (Music, energy drinks, Motivational reels) before the task will reduce the level of enjoyment and undermine the ability to stay motivated. The best way is to get excitement and motivation from the task itself whether it is Study or Workout. So. ENJOY THE PROCESS only. 14. Some Healthy ways to increase Dopamine so that the base level is maintained:: Cold water Therapy which increases Adrenalin and nor-adrenalin rapidly while dopamine shows gradual increase to 2.5 times above baseline and comes back to normal in 3 hours (Here there is a sustained increase instead of Rise and Crash) 15. If you work hard for the end result then the process will become very challenging. 1:39:02 is an amazing example. When someone gives reward or we reward ourself then we tend to associate our pleasure with reward rather than the work itself and if the reward is stopped, we lose interest in the process of the work. But again, Take a special care of not spiking dopamine just prior or even after to the effort. Learn to raise Dopamine from effort itself. 16. Example of Porn: Those who are indulged in it find it difficult to seek enjoyment in the productive process. Watching porn and Masturbation increase dopamine level⬆️ and then fall down very quickly⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️ below base line . Now to raise dopamine level much higher is difficult to feel pleasure again.",en,648.0

Try to dopamine fast.   2) Cold showers can raise dopamine without the crash.   3) Don't layer in dopamine raising activities with things you want to get more motivated for. E.g Listening to music while working.   4) Don't reward yourself before or after hard activities, let the activity itself produce dopamine.   5) Intermittent schedule of celebrating your wins. Don't celebrate every time and use a randomiser to dictate when to celebrate.  6) exception to the rule is caffeine (I.e coffee, tea) 1:20:00 1:19:45 Coffee good in moderation, Drugs and energy drinks bad  also 7) social media in general are bad because they basically let us waste dopamine that would be released in other circumstances.

Generally, most people don't like working hard. Some people do, but most people work hard in order to achieve some end goal. End goals are terrific and rewards are terrific whether or not they are monetary social or any kind. However, because of the way that dopamine relates to our perception of time, working hard at something for sake of a reward that comes afterward, can make the hard work much more challenging and make us much less likely to lean into hard work in the future.  1:41:43 My colleague at Stanford, Carol Dweck, as many of you know, has come up with this incredible theory and principle, and actually goes beyond theory and principle called   ""Growth Mindset"", which is this striving to be better to be in this mindset of I'm not there yet, but striving itself is the end goal.  And that of course delivers you to tremendous performance. It's been observed over and over and over again, that people that have growth mindset, kids that have growth mindset end up performing very well because they're focused on the effort itself.  And all of us can cultivate growth mindset. The neural mechanism of cultivating growth mindset involves learning to access the rewards from effort and doing. And that's hard to do because you have to engage this prefrontal component of the mesolimbic circuit. You have to tell yourself, okay, this effort is great, this effort is pleasureful.  Even though you might actually be in a state of physical pain from the exercise, or I can recall this from college, just feeling like I wanted to get up from my desk, but forcing myself to study, forcing myself and forcing myself.   What you find over time is that you can start to associate a dopamine release.  You can evoke dopamine release from the friction and the challenge that you happen to be in. You completely eliminate the ability to generate those circuits and the rewarding process of being able to reward friction while in effort, if you are focused only on the goal that comes at the end. Because of the way that dopamine marks time.  So if you say, oh, I'm going to do this very hard thing, and I'm going to push and push and push and push for that end goal that comes later.  Not only do you enjoy the process of what you're doing less, you actually make it more painful while you're engaging in it.  You make yourself less efficient at it, because if you were able to access dopamine while in effort, dopamine has all these incredible properties of increasing the amount of energy in our body, and in our mind, our ability to focus by way of dopamines conversion into epinephrin. But also you're undermining your ability to lean back into that activity the next time.  The next time you need twice as much coffee and three times as much loud music, and four times as much energy drink and the social connection just to get out the door in order to do the run or to study. So what's more beneficial in fact can serve as a tremendous amplifier on all endeavors that you engage in. Especially hard endeavors is to A, not start layering in other sources of dopamine in order to get to the starting line, not layering in other sources of dopamine in order to be able to continue, but rather to subjectively start to attach the feeling of friction and effort to an internally generated reward system. And this is not meant to be vague, this is a system that exists in your mind, that exists in the minds of humans for hundreds of thousands of years, by which you're not just pursuing the things that are innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth, water when you're thirsty. But the beauty of this mesolimbic reward pathway that I talked about earlier is that, it includes the forebrain. So you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part.  I know it's painful, I know this doesn't feel good, but I'm focused on this. I'm going to start to access the reward. You will find the rewards, meaning the dopamine release inside of effort if you repeat this over and over again. And what's beautiful about it is that, it starts to become reflexive for all types of effort. When we focus only on the trophy, only on the grade, only on the win as the reward, you undermine that entire process. So how do you do this? You do this in those moments of the most intense friction. You tell yourself this is very painful and because it's painful, it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later, meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine, but you also have to tell yourself that in that moment you are doing it by choice and you're doing it because you love it. And I know that sounds like lying to yourself, and in some ways it is lying to yourself, but it's lying to yourself in the context of a truth which is that you want it to feel better. You want it to feel even pleasureful. Now, this is very far and away different from thinking about the reward that comes at the end, the hot fudge sundae for after you cross the finish line and you can replace hot fudge sundae with whatever reward happens to be appealing to you. We revere people who are capable of doing what I'm describing. 1:46:22  1:45:25 How to attach pleasure to effort: ""In those moments of the most instense friction you tell yourself this is very painful and because it's painful, it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later, meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine, but you also have to tell yourself that in that moment you are doing it by choice and you're doing it because you love it.""  1:47:31 “Don’t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort, and don’t spike dopamine after engaging in effort.

rxhKrtb3XsE,KeyandPeele,comedy,['10:00']," @b7wL9cJk3  There is a game show called ""Price Is Right"" that is popular in America. In that game show, there are women/models who help introduce items contestants can win if they can guess how much each item costs.  So what the angry brother is saying, is that the model on Price Is Right isn't doing a good job presenting those items because contestants think they are worth less than they really are. So the joke is that the brother is marrying a beautiful and successful model, and the other brother has to be negative about everything, so the only thing he can criticize is that he thinks she isn't a good presenter of the items she displays. (This joke is expressed best in an idiom in English called ""Sour Grapes"" based off of ""Aesop's Fables"". This is when something good happens to someone else, but to make yourself feel better you find fault with it. An example would be if your friend bought a brand new car, and you respond ""It's not smart to be brand new cars because they only go down in value the moment you drive it off the lot. So just because you can't afford to buy a brand new car, you find fault with someone who can."")  It is also funny on another level because the show comes on at 10:00 o'clock Monday through Friday, and that is when most responsible men are at work earning a salary.  And so I responded ""this is the reason that a video can't be on youtube that doesn't already have 'dislikes' "" because there is always a negative person out there who will ""thumbs down"" even the best video out of spite.",en,73.0

To put it easier, at 12 PM the sun should be directly above your head.  For political & historical reasons, South Korea(seoul) follows Japan(tokyo)’s timezone. But as you can see on the map, seoul is further west to tokyo. Because of that, the sun doesn’t meet the land perpendiculary at 12 in seoul. It actually does at 12:30PM. So South Korea uses a timezone that is 30 minutes earlier than what is should be. North korea is actually using a ‘correct’ timezone.

ZMrgtotgThk,HauteLeMode,fashion,['39:14'],"I feel your 'acceptable' interpretations of the theme aren't being nearly flexible enough. People thought more outside the box and cleverly about their looks this year, and I think that's appropriate considering what happened in 2020 and is still very much happening. America is something to be critiqued, and I think a lot of the gowns did that in subtle, cheeky ways. Interpreting it just as ""must be referencing an American designer or including a flag"" is so limiting and not really the intention, at least not as I perceived it.   Take the look at 23:50. That is obviously another reference to Audrey Hepburn. I think it's actually super clever for a European designer to reference a European who made her fame in Hollywood, practically defined everything that came after, and eventually became an American fashion icon all without ever actually being American. Same goes for the one you named as being a ref to her at 39:14.   The ""Peg the Patriarchy"" look is TOTALLY on theme. Patriarchy is steeped into the very bones of the United States, and the top looks like a bulletproof vest or some kind of military gear. Having that statement on that piece and then having the tailored white pant just makes me think of going to war with the patriarchy and not caring who you have to F*ck to do it. that's a statement on America if I've ever heard one.   Grimes' sword was forged from a melted down gun and she looks like she's dressed for war- referencing the American inner conflict over the 2nd amendment. It's no coincidence her other hand is holding a book- the most vocal opponents of firearms are people who are highly educated and those who work in schools.   Lil Nas X went with looking at American excess- gold on gold on gold, lavish, taking something and making it so over-the-top that it's unbelievable. The final look was a very rock 'n roll style to me, just updated to be more sexy and less campy. I was a little shocked you called it out while literally having it facing, because it SCREAMS rock'n'roll to me. Elvis would have totally worn that... well, when he was more trim, anyway.   Olivia's look said Madonna meets punk rock to me, which suits both her musical trajectory and inspiration and fits the theme.   Some of the ones you praise highly were just so on-the-nose. Like, I feel like any third grader would come up with making a ballgown like the stripes on the flag. Having them be unwound and unfinished was a neat idea, but the overall concept was so boring. Anything that just said ""Hey how can we use stars and stripes to make it American-y"" missed an opportunity to do literally anything more interesting.",en,140.0

Time is so short, and our lives are like vapors. We all share in common that one day we will die, and none of us know that day or hour, but it will come and it's important to know where we'll be for eternity. There are only two places, heaven or hell; there is no in between state. There is only one way to heaven, and that's through Jesus. He is the way, the truth, and the life just as His word says. I get being unsure, I get the world we live in throwing out all kinds of things anymore, and it can be hard to know what the truth is, but there is an absolute truth and it is Jesus, and His work on the cross for our salvation, so believing in Him we can have peace in our eternity. We are all sinners in need of a Savior, and Christ knew we could not and can not save ourselves. So God Himself came down in the flesh and lived the perfect righteous life for us, fulfilling all the commandments.  He was then crucified and willingly layed down His life and was forsaken by the Father on the cross to take the punishment for all our sins. He was buried and rose again on the third day. His resurrection defeated death, and proved that His punishment was payment enough for the Father for our sins. For the wages of sin is death, but Jesus paid our wages with His death and ressurection! He did all of this so that through Him we would now have a way to heaven, to be with Him forever because He loves us. He died our death. He was spotless and blameless for us, and when we believe in Him, He imputes His righteousness to us, and cleanses us of all our sins.  I pray that you would not turn your heart to this, or shrug it off, or think about it later Please think about it now, there is no promise of later for anyone.   If you are unsure, please be sure either way, that yes Jesus is who He says He is, or no He is not. Seek the Truth, and Jesus says if you seek Him you will find Him. He IS the truth you will discover. Eternity is on the line, and more so than ever in history He is returning so soon, and unexpectantly to those that dont believe, and He wishes for none to perish, but all to come to faith. God loves you fiercely. He created you and knew you before time even began, He had you in mind, and demonstrated His love that while we were yet sinners Christ died on the cross for us. To redeem us to Him. He has made a way for you, and all you have to do is call out to Him. Realize you are a sinner before a Holy God, and in need of a Savior. Repent (change of mind and heart) of your sins, and believe in the finished redemptive work of Jesus Christ on the cross alone for the remission of all your sins (past, present, future) and eternal life!   When you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart man believes and is justified and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Roman's 10: 9-10)   For it is by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works lest any man should boast (Epehsians 2:8-9)  Call on the name of the Lord.

Is that all there is? or is there a point where you really get deep into trigonometry?  In computer graphics you have a view matrix, a projection matrix and a model matrix that map 3d coordinates to 2d coordinates in the projection plane, I understand enough of it to look deeper and find how it could be done on paper, there's a lot of sine and cosine calculations, angles to radians, vectors, matrices and even quaternions, which I get, but I still feel like I am missing the glue between human drawing and computer drawing, and ""the math behind perspective drawing"" just seems to be it, yet I am not able to find math past elementary school math in perspective drawing, just a lot of intuition.

It's a pity, however, that he hasn't moved from the existential elements of the Christian faith to the Spirit:  Christ the Wisdom and Power of God 18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written:            “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;           the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”  20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22 Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength.  26 Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28 He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are, 29 so that no one may boast before him. 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”  The Holy Bible: New International Version.

jfpzCsXGxQg,PhilipDeFranco,news,['10:00'],"This abuse story really hits close to home for me. I dealt with a lot of verbal and psychological (occasionally physical) abuse from my mother and her parents when I had to live at their house after my parents got divorced. My experience was very similar, with the exception that none of it was being filmed for money.   At the time I thought it was totally normal. It was hard to focus on the bad things when I was constantly showered with toys and all other kinds of gifts that I hadn't even asked for (later on I would be screamed at for being a spoiled brat because of all the things I was given). I was about 13 when this started, and I got out of it when I was 15 once my mother was convinced to leave their house while my grandfather was out of state on a business trip. I remember my grandmother yelling curses at us from the top of the stairs as we packed our most important belongings with help from my aunt.   I had a therapist legally forced on me at the time of my parents' divorce whom I honestly disliked from the moment I met her. Talking to her felt very unnatural and uncomfortable. I didn't and still don't think I needed therapy at that time, nor do I think I need it now. I'm the type of person to deal with these sorts of issues on my own with my own reasoning skills. As the sessions went on, I only had less and less to talk about. By the time I was nearing the end of my sessions, I would simply walk into her office and say ""I have nothing to talk about."" while the next 30 minutes was spent sitting in silence. The abuse at home I did talk about at first, but I know the way I talked about it was pretty nonchalant and tended to downplay the actual situation. At the time I was overwhelmed by all the legal intervention as at this point, I was only allowed to see my father once a week which was pretty devastating for me since I'd always had a very strong, close relationship with him. I new that if I spoke completely candidly about what was going on, I could be removed from my mother's custody which sounds good on the surface considering the abuse; however, it would have ultimately made the situation worse as my father had no chance at getting custody either because he'd had drug problems in the past, though he'd never been violent or in any way a danger to anyone.  My initial feeling about my therapist proved to be warranted as I later found out that she had been feeding any and all information I gave her to my grandfather who was the major instigator of the abuse (he is also suspected of being a pedophile and had apparently asked my mother for sexual favors while we were both living there. I also want to note that he was my mother's stepfather and not biologically related).   At this stage, maybe a month or 2 before we eventually left, I was really getting scared and desperate, so after I went out to the backyard, I called some of my friends from school and asked them for advice. They were also around the same age as me, so they weren't exactly the biggest help, though they did provide moral support and gave me the push I needed to do what I did next. I had an idea of what I wanted to do, but I lastly called my father to confirm that what I was about to do was a good idea. I then began walking quickly to a nearby park and recreational center because I didn't want my abusers around to control the situation.   When I got to the park it was about 10:00 at night. I took out my phone and called 911 and informed them of my location and that I was afraid of the members of my household. The operator informed me that they'd sent a car out and hung up, but I was still afraid of standing there by myself and was certain that my grandfather would find me soon, so I called my father's mother whom I currently live with along with my father and stepmother. She met me at the park and I ended up sitting in the car with her while we waited for the police. She had already known about the whole situation and was also very afraid for me. By the time the police showed up I was shaking and it seemed everything I needed to recount to the officer had totally left my brain. I did my best to ramble out everything that I could think of in between sobs as I'd started to cry halfway through my statement out of fear and general anxiety about what was going on. My good grandmother did best to fill in the gaps and provide information where she could.   The officer was a younger man who seemed very understanding and sympathetic. A few minutes later, another police car showed up (I later found out that the second officer was called in response to my grandfather having noticed my absence). The second officer was a woman who seemed a bit older than the other guy and was apparently his superior. I did my best to tell her the same things I told the male officer, but it was obvious that she didn't believe me, nor did she seem to care about my very real and immediate fear. I think the male officer tried to explain it to her, but she wasn't having any of it for whatever reason, and decided that I had just run away from home for shits and giggles. She wasted no time in putting me into the back of her police car and driving me back to my abusers.  When we got there, she spoke to my grandfather and laid out all the possible charges that could be pressed against me. He convinced my mother to go along with it, and I felt utterly defeated and totally helpless. After the stunt I pulled, the abuse was no longer sugarcoated with excuses and gifts but was instead openly hostile and malicious. I was lucky that it didn't last much longer.   After my mother and I had moved to a safe place, we had the legal charges against me dropped, and everything was much more peaceful. At that time, my time with my father was still limited, but with my abusive grandparents out of the picture, it was pretty easy to sneak extra time with him under my mother's nose by having him pick me up at the school bus stop before the bus came and skip that school day to spend the day with him. By the time I turned 16, there was really no way for her to keep me with her, so I packed my things and told her I was going to live with my dad. Everything has been okay since then. I still deal with a lot of anxiety and some minor OCD and have trouble getting out of the house to do things, but my psychological trauma has been kept to a minimum, which makes me feel very lucky.  Thank you for reading my story if you actually got this far. I don't often talk about it, but seeing this story play out has brought my own experience to the surface. I felt the need to document this here because I have a huge amount of empathy for these kids, especially Cody.

Adults would even blow up  and scream at you when you egg them on but Cody clearly states he wants to be left alone so he can calm down. His father continues to record and torture him when he's trying to express his emotions without screaming at him. He's ignored and in some instances (in other videos) his brother is allowed to ""restrain"" him when Cody gets fed up with being ignored ( I use restrain lightly because his brothers kick him in the privates and even push down on his stomach/ribs when finally told by his father to let him go. That was shown in the booger under the desk prank or whatever it was called). Cody clearly has some issues that he's trying to work out about his family and home life.

If they were truly sorry (because to me it seems like they're more upset about losing a shit ton of money from their YouTube channel) they wouldn't even have mentioned Phillip's video or even attempted to say it was his fault. It's their fault for raising their children like that. The way things are going, Cody is on the brink of becoming intentionally dangerous and harming others when he gets older and the eldest one is going to become a bully of some sorts because he doesn't know any better since that's how he was raised. Honestly, I hope these children turn out okay.",en,52.0

My mental acuity sky rocketed and was ready to kick it to the next level and this podcast happened at the right moment.

The conversation highlights his current focus on learning and studying, particularly in the field of medicine. 13:51 Goggins reflects on his struggle with ADHD and the process of teaching himself how to focus, expressing empathy for others facing learning disabilities. 19:30 Goggins discusses the constant friction and challenges he faces daily, emphasizing that everything he does requires a high level of effort and dedication. 21:23 David Goggins reflects on his challenging background, physical limitations, and military disqualifications, emphasizing the importance of overcoming obstacles through relentless effort and focus. 27:35 Goggins reveals the haunting impact of his difficult past, detailing the mental and emotional challenges he faced in trying to overcome societal judgments, racism, and personal limitations. 37:01 The conversation explores Goggins' relentless pursuit of self-improvement, highlighting the absence of positive reinforcement (""all stick, no carrot"") and the continuous internal battle he faces to prove himself wrong. 39:50 Goggins delves into the constant self-doubt he battles, particularly during challenging moments, and how he must consistently outwork his own negative self-perceptions to succeed. 41:14 Goggins emphasizes the absence of a ""get out of jail free card"" in his journey, advocating for the mindset of ""stay hard"" and the necessity to outwork one's inherent limitations to achieve personal growth. 46:31 The anterior mid-cingulate cortex, a brain structure, grows when individuals engage in activities they don't want to do. It's linked to willpower, challenges, and overcoming adversity. 48:25 The key to developing the anterior mid-cingulate cortex is consistently doing things that are hard and uncomfortable, not just more of what you enjoy. Friction, discomfort, and facing challenges are essential. 55:11 The lack of friction, challenge, and struggle can negatively impact individuals, even those born into wealth. Goggins emphasizes the importance of the ""stick"" and being haunted to drive personal growth. 01:00:04 The anterior mid-cingulate cortex gets activated when the body is pushed to move despite resistance. It's associated with the dopamine reward pathway, indicating that pain and friction can trigger a sense of accomplishment and pleasure. 01:05:44 David Goggins discusses the plasticity of the brain and emphasizes the concept of ""no days off"" to facilitate personal growth. 01:07:29 Goggins criticizes the prevalence of mediocrity, expressing frustration at people's reluctance to put in the necessary work to improve their lives. 01:10:48 Goggins discusses the tendency of people to attribute past success to external conditions, highlighting the importance of recognizing personal responsibility. 01:11:44 The conversation shifts to addressing the difficulty people face in making positive changes in their lives, particularly in areas like weight loss. 01:13:04 Goggins challenges individuals who resist change, emphasizing that they need to create a false reality to overcome mental and physical obstacles. 01:14:27 Goggins warns against relying solely on external sources for motivation, stressing the importance of self-exploration and examining one's internal desires. 01:15:25 Reflecting on his weight loss journey, Goggins highlights the ongoing struggle and emphasizes the harsh reality that positive change is challenging and uncomfortable. 01:17:44 Goggins shares examples of friends who made significant positive changes in their lives after a single conversation, underscoring the role of self-criticism in triggering transformation. 01:20:36 The discussion touches on personal weaknesses, such as procrastination, and Goggins emphasizes the need to start immediately, irrespective of the time. 01:26:20 David Goggins emphasizes the sacrifices he makes for success, including lack of sleep and unconventional lifestyle choices, driven by his determination to maintain his inner strength. 01:26:50 David Goggins discusses the challenge of balancing discipline in relationships, highlighting the tension between personal goals and the needs of loved ones. He emphasizes the importance of clear communication about individual priorities. 01:31:28 Goggins reflects on past mistakes of compromising himself to please others, emphasizing the importance of being true to oneself and not sacrificing personal fulfillment for the sake of relationships. 01:34:50 David Goggins encourages open and honest conversations in relationships, advocating for individuals to reveal their true selves to others. He highlights the power of authenticity and the liberation it brings. 01:36:14 Goggins shares his personal journey of self-discovery and overcoming societal expectations, encouraging individuals to embrace their true selves, even if it means defying conventional norms. 01:37:41 David Goggins emphasizes the significance of self-awareness and confronting one's insecurities and fears, asserting that embracing the truth is the starting line for a fulfilling and empowered life. 01:41:58 David Goggins rejects external dependencies for motivation and emphasizes the importance of the unseen work—personal struggles and triumphs—as the true source of internal motivation and strength. 01:46:15 David Goggins emphasizes the importance of internal strength and the misconception that people have about his life. 01:47:14 Goggins discusses the capacity for everyone to build true confidence and the misunderstanding surrounding his approach. 01:48:37 The conversation shifts towards the process of building inner strength, focusing on actions and verbs rather than success. 01:53:49 The discussion touches on the frustration of being misunderstood, especially regarding Goggins' use of intense language, which he explains comes from a place of realness. 02:00:26 Goggins explains his approach to relationships, both with close ones and the general public, maintaining a boundary to preserve his ability to continue self-improvement. 02:04:10 Goggins describes his perspective on capped success, prioritizing continued self-improvement over financial success and recognizing the perishable nature of his unique willpower. 02:07:32 The conversation explores the perishable nature of the willpower Goggins possesses, emphasizing the importance of turning the mind's manifestations into concrete actions for lasting growth. 02:10:21 Daily actions are pre-planned, akin to an artist creating a masterpiece. Spending time alone without distractions allows the mind to reveal the next steps. Passion and determination stem from understanding oneself, not external influences. 02:15:37 Mastery of internal dialogue involves a two-way conversation, acknowledging both positive and negative voices. The symphony of voices within oneself determines the actions taken, leading to real-world outcomes. 02:20:02 Prioritizing learning how to fail is essential for eventual success. Acknowledging failures, enduring hardships, and practicing perseverance lay the foundation for achieving long-term goals. 02:25:47 The unconscious mind, the supercomputer, controls most aspects of behavior. Going inward involves confronting the deep, dark aspects of oneself, cleaning the internal ""cupboards,"" and deliberate decision-making for meaningful actions. 02:30:30 Facing and embracing the hardships of the ""dungeon,"" the uncomfortable and scary place in our minds, is crucial for growth. Confronting and cleaning out our deepest fears is essential to becoming the person we're meant to be. 02:32:54 Life is a continuous test, and challenges arise when we least expect them. Going inward, acknowledging flaws, and actively working on self-improvement are vital to passing life's tests and fulfilling our purpose. 02:34:46 David Goggins emphasizes the importance of authenticity and brutal honesty in personal growth. Sharing one's struggles and vulnerabilities not only aids personal development but also inspires others to confront their own challenges. 02:35:45 Andrew Huberman expresses gratitude for David Goggins' openness and authenticity.

And some are impossible because you just can't. But a lot of them you can. But people don't want to go through the process of focus, of teaching yourself how to truly focus. This is where my message gets lost"". 19:15 ""Nothing is easy"". 20:21 ""I'm not trying to maximize money or maximize people knowing me. I do these things because maybe someone out there will understand me and get it and say, I can grow from this guy, and others just won't"". 22:06 You have no fucking idea how great you really are because you are using such minimal, minimal of what you have. And if people can learn to focus, this is what's possible. 22:40 The most frustrating thing in the world for me is when normal people judge a man like myself on what it really takes to extract greatness from nothing. It takes every bit of who you are if you choose that route. If you don't, Merry Christmas, do what you got to do. 28:51 No matter how much you improve, no matter how much you change who you are, it's not permanent. 33:10  What life really is for the majority of us is hell. And (on social media) so while people love to show you the cars, and the house, and the vacations and shit, all that's good. All that's happy. I'm going to show you the side that I know most of you are going through. And people hide very well. I don't want to hide anymore. 33:53   Human beings want to show you the best side (of life). And they want to hide the worst side.  36:01 How do you want to live?  How do you want to die? How do you want to fucking be remembered? 38:55 You know exactly what to do, exactly what to do. It just sucks doing it. 40:42 So there is no get-out-of-jail-free card. This is why I say stay hard. Because when you weren't given the gifts, the only thing you can do in life is stay hard. 44:50 Everybody has the ability to do it, but they just don't want to. 45:32 Hard work looks horrible. 46:15  There's a brain structure called the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. when people do something they don't want to do like add three hours of exercise per day or per week It's about adding more work that you don't want to do. This brain area gets bigger. 47:10 The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is smaller in obese people. It gets bigger when they diet. It's larger in athletes. It's especially large or grows larger in people who see themselves as challenged and overcome some challenges. And in people that live a very long time, this area keeps its size. 47:38 In many ways, scientists are starting to think of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex not just as one of the seats of willpower but perhaps actually the seat of the will to live. 57:12 Most people are missing something because they don't know who they are. They never examined themselves. They've never done this experiment on themselves. You create your own self. Most people are missing something because there's so much trapped in there. 1:06:26 If you can't imagine yourself doing something, the person that's doing it is crazy. 1:49:56 Once you figure out your brain, you become unstoppable in almost anything.  1:57:10 Normal people who only have one voice. Never created the second voice. The winning voice is the second voice.  1:58:32  I know why you go on Instagram. I know why you do because you just have the time. You have the time because you don't want to put that time into bettering yourself. 2:11:54 It's impossible to listen to you and listen to what your mind and body are telling you we must do. Because people don't do enough of it. They don't do any of it. They don't have passion. They lack passion, drive, and determination because you haven't spent time with yourself. Your mind will tell you what is next. 2:17:10 There are three voices, strong, medium, and weak. the only way to, quote-unquote, ""know it"" is to spend a hell of a lot of time there.  2:20:02  The path to winning is going to be years of failing first.  2:25:28 psychiatrist Paul Conti said, ""The supercomputer of the brain is the unconscious mind. It's the part of our mind that controls almost everything. 2:26:41 he calls it the cupboards. You have to look in the cupboards. And it's often really scary what you find in there. And most people are just like, I don't even want to know the cupboards are there.  2:30:46 David Goggins said, ""Those cabinets are fucking dusty, dirty, and scary as shit. Broken glass, fucking dark, spiders, cobwebs. But most of all, your biggest fears, the biggest things that put you in a fucked up place you are today are in there.

Granted these points, she is speaking in a worldly manner of worldly subjects.

SH63RABGK6w,JordanBPeterson,talk show,['28:19']," @howardjones7370  It would be interesting to see you review your own comments after another 50 years.   In this case I'm talking about you, not the Church.   Your words and manner do not reflect either discipline or maturity.     Getting things right' according to YOUR lights never was the business of the Church.   Its main business is to preach the Gospel to the ends of the earth.  See Matthew 28:19-20, if you are not too lazy.  Bit by bit, that has been done, so that not too many regions remain today, where the name of Jesus has not been heard.    But you ARE correct about one thing, which the addition of a 'plus' to the 2,000 years.   For the faith of the mostly Jewish apostles was the faith of  King David, of the Hebrew prophets, of Moses, Abraham, Noah, even Abel, the first martyr.  But I won't credit you for stumbling upon a point which you could have discovered through diligent research, and may not understand anyway.   Also for your consideration:  1.  Have you lived YOUR life perfectly?  See to that before sitting in judging the Church.  The first Hebrew Psalm states: 'Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, NOR SIT IN THE SEAT OF SCOFFERS.'  2.  Read the 7th chapter of Romans, and if you can understand plain words, you should be able to tell that two natures are at war within the believer, the redeemed and the unredeemed.     When Christians sin, not that they should (but they do), it shows that the old nature is still present,  which dominates the lives of unbelievers completely.  Sanctification is not an instantaneous process.  (Are you still there?   Don't blanch or faint at the sight of polysyllabic theological terms.)   3.  Did you ever read Jesus' parable of the wheat and the tares? Not all 'Christians' are Christians, but some go through the motions  without concern for the substance.  Or perhaps they hold syncretic beliefs. But no one can be a half-Christian.   But you, in your rush to judgment, are apt to tar disparate groups with the same brush, according to the worst evils committed by any of them.  4.  The Gospel is about salvation, not reformation of human culture per se.  Even unsaved people often desire reformation of human culture, and work very hard at it, but they will miss their salvation unless they believe in Jesus.  What do you desire more?  To be a 'god person' in your own sight and in the sight of your fellows, or to have your sins forgiven by God?     You can't have both.  They are mutually exclusive options.    You are walking about BLINDFOLDED, virtue-signaling about your own self-imposed blindness.   What a silly spectacle.  Sure man, you're a real model to follow.",en,2.0

BzB5xtGGsTc,WendoverProductions,documentary,['8:30'],"@ Kyrstin   Stoneking you can't fathom spending $5k on a ticket, because you travel for leisure and not business. If you're flying for business, where 100's of thousands or millions of dollars are at stake, $5k is nothing. If an exec is going to Europe, you figure not ONLY his flight time, but door to door travel. The exec travels to the airport. Gets to the airport 1-1/2 - 2 hours before departure, for check in and boarding. Flight time depends on where flying to and from, let's say 8 hours. Then there is deplaning, getting baggage, getting through customs, getting your ride, then travel to the airport. An 8 hour flight is now 12 hours or more door to door, home/office to hotel. Let's change the scenario a little. The exec does an in/out blast. He/she works at the office all/most of the day, let's say Monday. Drives to the airport and catches a 6pm flight from Chicago. That flight arrives at 8:30 am Tuesday, in London. The exec showers, dresses in fresh clothes and is off to the client/branch office, for an 11 am meeting. The exec does their business and leaves the office at 5 or 6 pm. Maybe they do a business dinner and finally checks in to their hotel at 8 or 9 pm. They get up at 6am in the morning for an 11am flight. They  have breakfast, catch a 1 hour ride to the airport, arrive 2 hours before, check in and finally board. Their flight arrives at 2 pm and get home at 4-5 pm Wednesday. That $5k seat is cheap, to make sure the exec is fresh for the meeting and relatively comfortable for the trip home.

He should have finished the 100 miles, then turned around, run back to the start, then turn around again and run to the halfway point, AT LEAST.  Also @0:37 ""And during the race I kept an eye on him and around mile 70 (he weighed, probably about 260lbs which is quite large for an ultrarunner) he had broken all the small bones in both of his feet and had kidney damage""  At ""mile 70"" eh? How did he know either of these injuries were happening? Did he have a portable X-ray/MRI machine on hand to run a few scans, or is he making it up? The SEAL guy wouldn't have let on that he was injured because, well, he's a super hard ""40% rule"" Navy SEAL!!

f7CW7S0zxv4,OxfordUnion,debate,['9:00'],"The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, took place on 13 April 1919 when troops of the British Indian Army under the command of Colonel Reginald Dyer fired rifles into a crowd of Indians, who had gathered in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab. The civilians had assembled to condemn the arrest and deportation of two national leaders, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew. There has been much debate over whether the crowd knew of the proclamation Dyer had made banning meetings, in its supposed inefficacy, however, Raja Ram has argued that the crowd formed in deliberate defiance, being the beginning of Indian nationalism.[2]  The Jallianwalla Bagh is a public garden of 6 to 7 acres (28,000 m2), walled on all sides, with five entrances.[3] To enter, troops first blocked the entry by a tank and locked the exit. On Dyer's orders, his troops fired on the crowd for ten minutes, directing their bullets largely towards the few open gates through which people were trying to flee. Official British Indian sources gave a figure of 379 identified dead,[4] with approximately 1,100 wounded. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.[5] This ""brutality stunned the entire nation"",[6] resulting in a ""wrenching loss of faith"" of the general public in the intentions of the UK.[7] The ineffective inquiry and the initial accolades for Dyer by the House of Lords fuelled widespread anger, leading to the Non-cooperation Movement of 1920–22.[8]  On Sunday, 13 April 1919, Dyer was convinced of a major insurrection and he banned all meetings; however this notice was not widely disseminated. That was the day of Baisakhi, the main Sikh festival, and many villagers had gathered in the Bagh. On hearing that a meeting had assembled at Jallianwala Bagh, Dyer went with Sikh, Gurkha, Baluchi, Rajput troops from 2-9th Gurkhas, the 54th Sikhs and the 59th Sind Rifles[9] to a raised bank and ordered them to shoot at the crowd. Dyer continued the firing for about ten minutes, until the ammunition supply was almost exhausted. Dyer stated that 1,650 rounds had been fired, a number apparently derived by counting empty cartridge cases picked up by the troops.[10]  Dyer was initially lauded by conservative forces in the empire, but in July 1920 he was censured and forced to retire by the House of Commons.[11] He became a celebrated hero in the UK among most of the people connected to the British Raj,[12] for example, the House of Lords,[13] but unpopular in the House of Commons, which voted against Dyer as a Colonel. He was disciplined by being removed from his appointment, was passed over for promotion and was prohibited from further employment in India.[14][15] Upon his death Rudyard Kipling declared that Dyer 'did his duty as he saw it'.[16] The massacre some historians have argued caused a re-evaluation of the army's role, in which the new policy became minimum force, however, later British actions during the Mau Mau insurgencies have led Huw Bennett to question this school of thought.[17] The army was retrained and developed less violent tactics for crowd control.[18] Some historians consider the episode a decisive step towards the end of British rule in India.[19] At 9:00 on the morning of 13 April, the traditional festival of Baisakhi, Colonel Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later.[40] Meanwhile, the local CID had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.[41]  By mid-afternoon, thousands of Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus had gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh (garden) near the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and is) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with locked gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting-area and playground for much of the year.[42] In the center of the Bagh was a samadhi (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet in diameter.[42]  Apart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh. It was estimated that about 20,000 to 25,000 people had gathered in the Bagh by the time of the meeting. Dyer sent an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd.[42] By this time, both Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, were well aware of the meeting, but took no actions to prevent it or send police to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.  An hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 16:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety Sikh, Gurkha, Baluchi (note that the Baluch Regiment of the British Indian Army did not have Baluch troops, the British having failed in their efforts to get the Baluch to enlist and serve; the Baluch continued to fight an insurgency of varying intensity with the British from 1839 to 1947. The Baluch regiment was staffed by troops from the Punjab and other areas of India), Rajput from 2-9th Gurkhas, the 54th Sikhs and the 59th Sind Rifles soldiers.[9] Fifty of them were armed with .303 Lee–Enfield bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armored cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had few narrow entrances. Most of them were kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.  Dyer—without warning the crowd to disperse—blocked the main exits. He 'explained' later that this act ""was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.""[43]Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.[10]  Many people died in stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and many more died during the night.[44].",en,85.0

negative experiences can guide us away from paths that don't resonate. 26:12 🚀 Early positive experiences fuel a love for learning; negative experiences can block curiosity and discipline. 27:51 ⚡ Energy and motivation can come from both desire and aversion, guiding us toward or away from our purpose. 30:11 🌟 Paying attention to frustrationor anxiety signals helps redirect life choices towards fulfillment and purpose. 35:43 🚪 The Sublime lies beyond societal constraints; it's an experience that transcends limitations and connects us to something larger. 37:44 🧭 The human brain craves transcendental experiences, seeking the Sublime within to avoid the allure of false, external Sublime experiences. 43:25 ⏰ Deep immersion in activities, like writing, creates a Sublime experience where time becomes immersive and pleasurable. 43:52 🌟 Power isn't just about domination; it's deeply wired in us to have some control over our environment and circumstances, compelling us to seek influence in various relationships. 46:36 💡 Power, in interpersonal relations, involves influencing others for mutual or personal benefit, but it's a complex terrain where direct commands often create resistance. 48:25 🧠 Recognizing the need for power isn't a flaw; it's inherent in everyone, and suppressing it leads to passive actions, hindering control and influence. 51:50 🛡 Understanding power dynamics isn't about manipulation; it's crucial for social interactions, self-protection, and avoiding commonpitfalls in relationships. 53:25 🌐 Discovering your place, professionally and personally, aligns with finding where your strengths benefit yourself and others, avoiding energetically costly pursuits. 55:46 🔍 Seduction isn't purely about trickery; it involves an exchange between individuals, tapping into vulnerabilities to create connections and influence. 56:55 🧬 Seduction traces back to human history's taboo concepts, arousing desire by prohibiting something, triggering contrary impulses. 59:13 📚 Seduction extends beyond the negative connotations; it involves vulnerability, allowing someone into your mental space, and surrendering to the influence of others or ideas. 01:00:39 📖 Vulnerability is not a weakness but a positive trait, fostering emotional and intellectual intelligence, facilitating surrender to another'spower. 01:03:00 🔄 Seduction can be challenging to disengage from due to attachment systems, often leading to difficulties in breaking away despite knowing the negative consequences. 01:04:38 🌹 Seduction tactics aren't gender-exclusive; both men and women utilize various tactics for seduction, sometimes leading to abusive dynamics in relationships. 01:06:16 🌟 Seduction as a power dynamic: Men historically dominated by powerful, siren-like women; enjoying a sensual, pleasing escape from their usual masculine world. 01:08:23 💃 The interplay of sexual and power dynamics: Topping from the bottom - a mutual illusion of power exchange in seductive and romantic relationships. 01:09:44 🎭 The illusion of control in seduction: The weaker-seeming person often leads the dynamic, blurring who truly holds power in the relationship. 01:11:20 🧠 Neurobiological insights into dominance: Separate neural circuits exist for nonsexual physical power and sexual behavior, indicating distinct forms of control. 01:14:19 🧬 Biological roots of love: Robert Greene explores the biological desire for deep connection and the physics of coupling, emphasizing the importance of vulnerability. 01:18:38 🌍 Social context and vulnerability: Concerns about hookup culture, social media, and the impact on vulnerability, advocating for a return to communal, authentic connections. 01:21:23 💡 Embracing vulnerability: Encouraging vulnerability as a positive attribute, leading not just to romantic success but also to creativity and mental energy. 01:26:25 🚀 Path to change: Advocating for a shift from closed-off egos to open vulnerability, hoping for a human spirit resurgence to combat societal disconnect. 01:27:05 🔄 The pendulum effect: Acknowledging societal swings, emphasizing the need to transcend injustices without being overwhelmed by constant exposure toinjustice. 01:28:43 🛑 Overwhelm from social media: Reflecting on the impact of social media's constant exposure to injustice on creativity, purpose, and the capacity for vulnerability and love. 01:28:57 🌍 Knowing when to ignore distractions in modern life, focusing on controllable actions, and understanding the impact of algorithmically designed content on our attention can prevent energy drain. 01:31:59 💡 Addressing injustices involves more than individual efforts; it requires collective action, movement building, and engaging with larger-scale issues like climate change or systemic challenges. 01:33:59 ⚖ The modern understanding of masculine and feminine roles is in flux, leading to confusion, mixed signals, and challenges for young individuals in defining their identities amidst societal expectations. 01:37:53 🌟 True masculinity isn't about stereotypes; it's about resilience, emotional control, inner strength, confidence, and the ability to withstand life's hardships without resorting to insecurity or abusive behaviors. 01:41:05 🛠 Finding mentors or role models involves integrating qualities from various individuals, evolving throughout life, and adapting these influences to create a personalized path rather than conforming to a singular ideal. 01:50:18 🧠 Engaging with knowledge goes beyond just reading; it involves digesting and transforming ideas into your own thoughts. 01:51:26 📚 The difference between dead and alive thinking lies in actively interacting and refining ideas, not just absorbing them. 01:53:47 💡 Anxiety can lead to hasty decisions; embracing it and exploring multiple alternatives enhances thinking and decision-making. 01:56:04 🖋 Embracing anxiety in creative processes leads to continuous refinement, essential for achieving excellence. 01:58:24 📝 Writing a book involves intense self-doubt and constant improvement before achieving a satisfying result. 02:00:03 ❤ Finding convergence in interests and values, beyond superficial aspects, is vital for lasting romantic partnerships. 02:07:54 🤔 Self-awareness is crucial; knowing your values helps avoid mistaking admiration for alignment in relationships. 02:11:30 🕵‍♂ Understanding a partner's character, detecting hidden facets, and embracing mystery sustains long-term interest and depth in relationships. 02:12:12 🤔 Relationships thrive when there's intrigue and a continuous sense of discovery about each other over time. 02:13:07 🎶 Shared interest in life engagement matters more in relationships than shared preferences like music genres. 02:14:58 🎸 Music preferences give insights into a person's character and qualities, reflecting nonverbal cues that can be revealing. 02:17:57 🗣 Nonverbal communication is crucial; we've evolved to understand it deeply, but in today's word-oriented society, we overlook it. 02:19:34 📺 Observing nonverbal cues like body language, tone, and microexpressions can reveal people's true intentions and emotions. 02:23:24 🕵‍♂ Detecting genuine emotions through nonverbal cues, especially sincere smiles, helps in navigating relationships and avoiding toxic individuals. 02:26:11 🔍 Trust your intuition about people; nonverbal cues like tone of voice and body language convey more truth than words. 02:30:31 💬 Interacting in person sharpens nonverbal communication skills, vital for understanding others deeply in a world moving towards virtual encounters. 02:32:40 🤖 Concerns about AI include its potential to lack the depth of human intelligence, especially self-awareness and holistic understanding. 02:34:16 🧠 AI advancements mustn't replace deep thinking; reliance solely on AI might hinder critical thinking development. 02:35:38 📚 A challenging task catalyzed Robert Greene's paradigm shift, emphasizing discipline and deeper understanding. 02:36:46 🏔 The analogy of climbing Mount Everest illustrates the value of the journey over instant solutions provided by AI. 02:39:56 🧠 Concerns arise about AI diminishing emotional expression, reducing language, and limiting emotional nuances.",en,742.0
50BZQRT1dAg,HubermanLab,podcast,['01:25:43'],"Thank you, Andrew and Robert. Great conversation🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  08:43 🌱 Finding one's purpose involves reconnecting with the unique inclinations and passions identified in early childhood, resisting external pressures, and staying true to one's primal interests. 10:37 🧠 The concept of ""impulse voices"" in early childhood directs individuals towards their inherent strengths and inclinations, which, when identified, can serve as a powerful source of purpose and direction. 19:23 🌱 Self-discovery involves recognizing early seed emotions that ignite a visceral sensation, signaling a potential life purpose. 24:49 🧠 Both positive and negative experiences shape our interests and pursuits, influencing our path towards our purpose. 20:46 🌐 Personal fulfillment often stems from a deep emotional connection to certain activities or interests, creating a constant source of delight. 29:03 🌊 Paying attention to deeper, more profound aspects of oneself, rather than immediate pleasures, is essential for self-awareness and finding purpose. 35:01 🌌 Puberty marks a significant transformation in the brain and life, altering perspectives, responsibilities, and learning capacity. 39:20 🧠 The difference between false and real Sublime experiences: False experiences like aggression and addictions are temporary illusions, while the real Sublime, a transformative and lasting feeling, is connected to human nature's deep part. 44:33 💼 Power, seduction, and purpose: Power is essential in relationships, seen as a resource, and involves influencing others subtly. Seduction is rooted in human nature, often tied to taboos, and implies an exchange. Finding purpose aligns with one's innate strengths, contributing to a sense of power and connection. 01:00:39 💡 Importance of Childhood Influences: Childhood experiences, fairy tales, and interactions with parents deeply shape one's susceptibility to seduction. 01:02:18 🤝 Vulnerability and Confidence: Allowing oneself to be vulnerable implies confidence, as it involves the trust to return to oneself after being influenced by others. 01:09:16 💑 Power Dynamics in Seduction: The Art of Seduction was conceptualized as an art invented by women to wield power over men through seduction and theatrical effects. 01:11:20 ⚖️ Power and Equality in Love: There's an exploration of love without power dynamics, emphasizing equality, connection, and the biological desire to deeply connect with someone. 01:19:03 🌐 Modern Societal Dynamics: Drawing parallels between the landscape of politics and social dynamics, the lack of vulnerability hinders the setting aside of egos and inhibits the union of people. 01:21:23 🗝️ Robert Greene emphasizes the positive dynamics of vulnerability, framing it as a pleasurable and healthy attribute that can impact not only romantic relationships but also mental and creative aspects of life. 01:22:47 🧠 Escape the Prison of the Ego: Greene discusses the concept of escaping the self-imposed prison of the ego, encouraging openness to others, vulnerability, and letting go of defense mechanisms for personal growth and meaningful experiences. 01:25:43 🌐 Social Media Impact: Greene discusses the negative effects of social media, expressing hope that people will become disenchanted with disconnection and alienation, turning towards more real and communal interactions, preserving the human spirit against technological influences. 01:28:15 🚫 Selective Ignorance: Greene emphasizes the importance of learning to ignore certain things in modern life, suggesting that constant exposure to negative content on social media can distract from deeper purposes and drain energy. 01:36:18 ⚖️ Masculinity and Femininity: Greene addresses the confusion around gender roles, pointing out the need for positive models of masculinity and femininity. He highlights the importance of inner strength, resilience, and quiet confidence as traits to venerate in masculinity. 01:39:14 🌐 Lack of Role Models: Greene reflects on the challenges of today's youth growing up without clear role models for positive masculinity and femininity, expressing a sense of loss in the absence of such guiding figures. 01:39:27 🍽️ The overwhelming variety of options in expressing masculinity and femininity, especially in the age of social media, raises the challenge of choosing one's identity and role models wisely. 01:41:05 🔄 Selecting role models is crucial in personal development. Creating a patchwork of influences, rather than adhering to a single ideal, allows for a more balanced and adaptable self-discovery. 01:43:36 📚 Mastery, as a guide, emphasizes the importance of finding mentors and role models for personal and professional growth. It involves the ongoing process of seeking positive qualities in others and integrating them into one's life. 01:45:41 🤝 Building relationships with mentors is not a passive act; it requires courage, engagement, and a genuine connection. The mentor-mentee relationship can be a powerful tool for rewriting one's family history and finding positive influences. 01:49:10 🚀 Having a clear sense of purpose in life serves as a filter for navigating choices in various aspects, from career to social media consumption. Purpose guides decision-making and helps in allocating energy to meaningful pursuits. 01:54:00 🧠 Managing anxiety is crucial for creative thinking. The ability to withstand the discomfort of uncertainty allows for the refinement and development of ideas, turning them from dead concepts into alive, personal creations. 01:55:36 📝 The creative process, as described by Robert Greene, involves significant internal turmoil and anxiety. Pushing through this discomfort leads to the transformation of initial ideas, resulting in a fulfilling sense of accomplishment. 01:56:46 🖋️ Greene's writing process is marked by an initial phase of self-doubt and dissatisfaction with the work. However, the persistence in pushing through anxiety results in continuous improvement and the eventual achievement of a high-quality outcome. 01:58:12 📚 Robert Greene discusses the challenges of writing a book and the anxiety associated with setting and achieving milestones in various domains of life. 02:05:07 ⚖️ Emotional connections and shared values are vital for a successful, lasting relationship, beyond superficial factors like physical attraction. 02:07:54 🧠 Self-awareness is crucial in choosing a compatible partner; understanding one's character and values helps in finding a lasting connection. 02:13:48 🗣️ Non-verbal communication, including body language and facial expressions, plays a significant role in understanding a person's true character and detecting authenticity. 02:17:13 😄 Sense of humor is a crucial component in a relationship; compatibility in humor, along with non-verbal communication, contributes to the success of a romantic partnership. 02:19:05 🤔 Pay attention to non-verbal communication by muting words, observing behavior, and detecting cues like posture, smiles, and eye expressions. 02:20:13 🧠 Milton Ericson, paralyzed at 19, mastered non-verbal communication by observing people during his paralysis, learning different forms of yes, no, and various expressions. 02:23:24 🕵️ Detecting genuine vs. fake smiles is crucial in understanding people, especially in romantic relationships, helping avoid toxic connections. 02:24:48 👀 Recognizing ""dead eyes"" in narcissists is vital, as it reflects a lack of genuine interest and helps avoid toxic relationships. 02:27:46 🎙️ Subcortical courtship: The influence of a person's voice, especially that of a mother, plays a significant role in seduction and emotional impact. 02:36:46 🧠 The danger of relying on AI: Depending solely on tools like ChatGPT might bypass the essential cognitive process of thinking, challenging oneself, and achieving deeper understanding. 02:37:27 🧠 Robert emphasizes the danger of becoming overly reliant on AI and technology, urging people to develop and use their brains actively. 02:41:47 🧠 Robert highlights the incredible complexity and plasticity of the human brain, advocating for the recognition and worship of this remarkable organ over technology. 03:01:25 ⏳ Urgency and finding one's purpose are discussed, with Greene emphasizing the need to escape apathy and laziness, and to pay deeper attention to surroundings and oneself. 03:02:32 ⚔️ Introducing the concept of ""death ground,"" Greene explains how pressure and urgency can be powerful motivators, drawing inspiration from Sun Tzu's strategic thinking. 03:03:54 🏔️ Greene shares a story about a mountain climber to illustrate the extraordinary energy and focus that arise under life-threatening situations. 03:06:48 🙏 Expressing gratitude, the host acknowledges Robert Greene's profound impact on people's lives through his books and various channels, commending the valuable knowledge he shares.

50BZQRT1dAg,HubermanLab,podcast,['02:32:26'],"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  08:58 🌱 Finding one's purpose is a process that involves reconnecting with the unique inclinations and impulses from childhood. 10:47 🤔 As individuals age, external influences (teachers, parents, peers) can drown out their inner voice, making it essential to rediscover childhood passions and inclinations. 13:21 💡 Childhood impulses, or ""impulse voices,"" provide clues to one's natural inclinations, guiding individuals toward their unique life tasks. 16:10 🧠 Emotional engagement with a subject accelerates learning, emphasizing the importance of aligning one's career path with their primal inclinations. 17:21 🚀 Discovering one's life's task brings a sense of direction, acting as an internal radar, and even later in life, it's never too late to embark on this journey of self-discovery. 25:30 🌱 The discussion touches on the role of genetics and environmental influences in shaping interests, and the significance of early positive experiences in fostering a love for learning. 27:22 🛤️ Greene shares his personal journey, highlighting the impact of both positive and negative experiences in shaping his career path. 29:03 ⚖️ The conversation delves into the balance between immediate pleasures and long-term fulfillment, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness in understanding one's true desires. 31:46 🔄 Reflecting on frustration and anxiety as signals, Greene discusses the value of understanding and addressing these emotions to guide life decisions. 35:43 🚪 Greene introduces the concept of the Sublime, describing it as experiences just outside the conventional circle of thought and behavior, with a focus on transcendental moments. 39:47 🌐 The distinction between real and false Sublime is discussed, emphasizing the importance of authentic, transformative experiences over external, fleeting sources of pleasure. 41:21 🕰️ Huberman relates early experiences of delight to the Sublime, highlighting the profound connection, activation state, and sense of purpose that such experiences can generate. 42:03 ⏳ Time perception is briefly touched upon, with an acknowledgment of the subjective nature of time during immersive, Sublime experiences. 43:52 🤔 The discussion shifts to the topic of power and seduction. 46:36 💡 Power is defined as a primitive, primal need for control over one's environment and circumstances. 51:50 🔄 Learning the dynamics of power is essential for personal and social growth, not just for domination. 53:25 🔍 Finding one's place in social hierarchies and aligning with one's strengths contributes to a fulfilling life. 55:46 💖 Seduction is explored as an exchange, involving vulnerability and the act of letting someone into one's psyche. 58:20 🔄 Vulnerability is reframed as a positive trait, essential for intelligence and emotional growth. 01:02:32 🛡️ Confidence plays a role in vulnerability, allowing one to navigate seduction without being detrimentally affected. 01:06:16 📖 Robert Greene discusses the dynamic of powerful men being dominated by seductive women throughout history. 01:08:23 💑 The concept of ""topping from the bottom"" is explored, where both individuals in a romantic exchange may engage in a temporary illusion of power dynamics. 01:09:44 🌌 Robert Greene introduces the idea of the Art of Seduction being invented by women who lacked power in other aspects of life, using sex as a means of control. 01:13:38 🤯 David Anderson's research on separate neural circuits for sexual and nonsexual mounting behaviors challenges conventional notions of power dynamics. 01:16:38 💔 Robert Greene delves into the concept of escaping the ""prison of the ego,"" advocating for vulnerability as a positive dynamic in various aspects of life. 01:20:56 🌐 Concerns about the impact of social media, hookup culture, and pornography on young people's ability to experience deep connections and vulnerability. 01:24:50 📚 The chapter titled ""Escape the Prison of the Ego"" in Robert Greene's upcoming book emphasizes the pleasures and benefits of vulnerability, urging readers to open themselves up to real experiences. 01:27:05 🔄 A hopeful perspective that, despite challenges, the human spirit can lead to a shift away from current closed and divisive tendencies toward more open, communal, and creative periods in history. 01:28:57 🧠 Robert Greene discusses the distraction of modern life, emphasizing the importance of ignoring certain things for mental well-being. 01:31:59 🌍 Greene suggests that individuals can contribute positively by focusing on actionable issues like voting, joining causes, and addressing climate change instead of getting overwhelmed by every injustice. 01:36:05 🚻 Greene touches on the confusion in contemporary times regarding gender roles, emphasizing the need for positive role models to guide individuals in navigating masculinity and femininity. 01:48:15 ⚖️ Greene highlights the challenge of too many choices, advocating for a sense of purpose to act as a filter and guide in decision-making, be it in career choices or daily life. 01:50:18 🤔 Engaging with powerful individuals involves developing social skills through active participation and overcoming fears and anxieties. 01:51:00 📚 Engaging with ideas involves more than just reading; it includes thinking, reflecting, and eventually turning them into one's own through a creative process. 01:57:43 📖 Writing involves continuous improvement, battling self-doubt, and pushing through anxiety to achieve a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. 01:58:24 🤔 Managing anxiety is crucial in various domains of life, including writing a book; breaking down tasks into milestones helps generate enough inertia to move forward. 01:59:34 💑 Convergent interests in a romantic partnership go beyond surface-level preferences, involving deep connections, emotional values, and shared character traits. 02:03:18 💰 Values like money, stability, and character traits are essential in evaluating potential partners for a lasting relationship. 02:05:20 🤝 Emotional connections and shared values are crucial in building a

This was a weekly occurrence, and by far, my best disciplinary tool while she grew up. I’ve got pictures of her at every stage of her riding career. She became a champion hunter jumper, and to this day, I still feel like my heart will stop each time I watch her round a corner as she looks to where her course jumps begin. Watching her command her very large horse with ease over these high, scary (to me, not her) HIGH jumps is a sight to behold. Little did I know at the time that, like you, horses were in her blood. Thank goodness I didn’t try to stop her. I am not a horse person myself, nor were we a horse family per se, but I got on board quickly, trying to figure out how we could do it. It’s a criminally expensive sport, and I sacrificed a lot to make it happen for her. I mucked stalls, cleaned tack, fed and turned out horses, all so we could offset her boarding fees. Also like you, she has switched to Dressage, a beautiful dance between rider and horse. She also works full time as an engineer in Tech. She works remotely, and she’s at  the barn at 5:30am to ride and train for several hours before she starts work. She often goes to the barn again later in the day. I, myself, have yet to find anything in life that I love this much, and am passionate about.

However, regarding your statement about worshipping the brain, perhaps we should just get down on our hands and knees and worship the God who created our brains, and gave them to us as a gift to help us navigate life.

Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives violated."" (Isaiah 13:9–16 NIV)  Or when the Lord threatens rape of Israelites who are being attacked by the Babylonians; ""Hear and give ear; do not be haughty, for the Lord has spoken. . . . And if you say in your heart, 'Why have these things come upon me?' it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up, and you are violated . . . because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies. I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen."" (Jeremiah 13:15–26 NRSV)   I have always thought this was the worst verse in the bible, and my opinion remains unchanged.  ""O daughter Babylon, you devastator! Happy shall they be who pay you back what you have done to us! Happy shall they be who take your little ones and dash them against the rock!""(Psalm 137:8–9 NRSV)  God was not merely saying that regrettable collateral damage might occur during wartime. He said believers should be happy — some translations say ""blessed"" — to kill innocent babies of those who are keeping you from worshipping your own god.

When I see abstract art, or art where the colors are strange like the painting at 1:16, I am totally unbothered.

It's essential to focus on self-improvement and productivity from a young age. 06:50 🤝 Surrounding yourself with loser friends can drag you down. The people you associate with significantly impact your self-image and your level of success. 07:17 💄 Looks maxing and building social media status can make you more popular in high school and college. Being physically attractive and having a strong online presence can boost your popularity. 10:37 😂 Being funny and charismatic can enhance your social appeal. It's about having the courage to express your sense of humor and developing warmth, power, and presence. 15:42 🎉 Initiating and hosting social events can make you more popular. Being the one who takes the lead in organizing gatherings can increase your social value. 19:14 🚹 Pursue high-quality relationships regardless of your age. 20:12 🎉 Enjoy social events, but don't overdo them, especially when it involves late nights, partying, and drugs. 21:06 🚫 Don't engage in degenerate behaviors just because you feel like you're missing out; focus on what aligns with your values and interests. 29:05 🎉 Social experiences improve with age as you work hard, make more money, and meet higher-quality people. 36:56 🚷 Transition from low-quality friendships to a period of solitude, and then attract higher-quality people into your life by improving your social skills. 37:39 🤝 When attending social events, be a value giver, not a leech, to maintain invitations and enhance your social standing. 38:45 🌟 Bringing charismatic personalities or attractive people to social events can significantly increase your value and social status. 42:30 🤔 Evaluate your friends based on warmth, presence, power, social skills, and future projection to determine their value as friends. 44:06 🚪 Gradually reduce contact with low-quality friends who don't align with your self-improvement goals to enhance your own progress. 48:07 📚 To excel academically, prioritize high-impact activities using the 80/20 rule and tackle the most challenging tasks first thing in the morning. 57:43 🧠 Prioritize your tasks: Focus on your most important task, like studying, first thing in the morning when you wake up, even before eating. This can lead to improved concentration and better results. 59:37 🚫 Avoid merging socialization with study: Keep your study and work time separate from socialization.

Their heads are above the horizon. yes, that happens autmatically when the photographer is about one head shorter than his subjects. That's not symbolic, it's normal. The dance is ofcourse the biggest symbol, although nobody would ever describe war as a dance. People with melancholy hindsight do. As dance with death... If that's the comparison then you desperately need to learn about what went on in WW1. it was no dance, it was slaughter. 40 million dead, that's 27.000 a day...that's one every three seconds. To call it a dance with death is to be a complete piece of shit with no sense of reality.   It's only human to romantisise the story behind the photo but the fact is that pictures like this exist for all of the other 40 Milion dead. They where all just going about their lives when a couple of arseholes who did not have a farting clue about anything where too busy expanding their economies that they collectively decided to fight over it.

While the line does rotate, the orientation of the ellipse's minor axis should remain the same (and not rotate as seen on the video) - the minor axis should point to the left vanishing point and since the camera or the plane of the ellipse doesn't shift change in any way, the vanishing point (and the orientation of the ellipse) should stay unaltered! c) ...and a question: At 3:23 Proko clarifies that the face centerline should be at the center of the frontplane, not the head-width. aren't these two the same?

You see what I mean? EDIT: Oh wait I get it now, I guess the ball has little resistance against the air so that allows it to easily spin along the air on the right and the left air blowing over it pushes it away from the right air, so that makes sense, yeah. It's just that if the ball's spin was fully resisted by the air, then the diagram would make no sense.

I was convinced that focusing on math and science was more important than immediately learning to code, because that was harder, and besides, I thought, I'm proficient with computers and would probably learn to program from a professional teacher sooner or later. Fast forward 10 years: Now I'm in university studying physics, and the programming rabbit hole turned out to be a lot deeper than I thought. I'm almost failing my classes because I've just taken on a different personality and lifestyle from when I was a kid, and can't concentrate in front of a computer for long enough to complete my assignments, and no one really seems to know what is going on.

However, the tech lead criticizes its slippery surface and size. 05:52 🪑 The Autonomous ErgoChair 2, around $400, is praised for its customization options, including adjustable lumbar support, seat tilt, and armrests. However, its firm cushion hardness is noted as an issue for prolonged sitting. 07:46 🪑 The Steelcase Gesture chair, priced at $1000, is commended for its beautiful design, customizable armrests, and professional feel. However, the fear of getting it dirty and its foam cushion hardness are highlighted as drawbacks. 09:36 🪑 The Staples Hyken chair, around $200, stands out for its lumbar support, headrest, and tilt-lock features.

He gave a portion of earth to Abraham, his son Issac, and to grand son Jacob, whose name God Himself changed to Israel.  https://www.gotquestions.org/Israel-land.html  Question: ""What is the land that God promised to Israel?""  Answer: In regards to the land that God has promised Israel, Genesis 15:18 declares to Abraham, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates.” God later confirms this promise to Abraham’s son Isaac and Isaac’s son Jacob (whose name was later changed to Israel). When the Israelites were about to invade the Promised Land, God reiterated the land promise, as recorded in Joshua 1:4, “Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates—all the Hittite country—to the Great Sea on the west.”  According to Genesis 15:18 and Joshua 1:4, the land God gave to Israel included everything from the Nile River in Egypt to Lebanon (south to north) and everything from the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates River (west to east). So, what land has God stated belongs to Israel? All of the land modern Israel currently possesses, plus all of the land of the Palestinians (the West Bank and Gaza), plus some of Egypt and Syria, plus all of Jordan, plus some of Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Israel currently possesses only a fraction of the land God has promised.  If Jehovah God, Creator of Universe gave them that land, who can stop Him? Any point in fighting against Creator?",en,12.0

it requires time, effort, and understanding, as they are deeply ingrained in the self. 52:30 🌟 While beliefs and internal narratives may take time to change, the process of rewiring the self is possible and empowering, leading to a better quality of life. 01:06:00 🤔 Changing beliefs and internal narratives can be challenging, even when making positive life changes. 01:06:54 🧠 Beliefs and internal narratives may persist despite engaging in positive behaviors. 01:08:04 🧰 Practical tools are needed to help individuals address mental health issues and change negative thought patterns. 01:09:01 🍔 Mental health concerns can manifest differently in individuals, and understanding their unique patterns is essential. 01:10:55 👥 Approaching mental health as individuals with unique needs is crucial for effective treatment. 01:11:56 🌟 Some people may resist introspection and self-exploration, but it can be essential for personal growth and healthier relationships. 01:16:27 💪 Changing the function of self requires awareness, understanding of defense mechanisms, and conscious effort. 01:18:07 🤖 The ""function of self"" involves the actions and behaviors we engage in, shaped by our awareness and defense mechanisms. 01:23:06 🧐 Defense mechanisms like projection can distort our perception of situations, leading to anger and frustration. 01:25:49 🚗 Projection can also affect our interactions with people, causing us to project our emotions onto others. 01:26:31 🧠 Defense mechanisms like projection, displacement, and projective identification can impact our interactions with others and lead to incorrect attributions. 01:31:05 🤔 Trickle-down anxiety, where stress from a leader impacts those around them, is a common phenomenon in various fields. 01:35:19 😅 Sarcasm and cynicism can be forms of humor but can also serve as unhealthy defense mechanisms, impacting relationships and worldview. 01:40:49 👀 Salience, or what we choose to pay attention to, plays a significant role in our self-awareness and how we function in the world. 01:45:00 🔄 Shifting salience can lead to significant changes in one's life and outlook, even in dramatic cases. 01:47:07 🧠 Understanding repetitive behavior: Repetitive behaviors, even when individuals know they shouldn't engage in them, may serve a purpose or have underlying motivations. 01:48:54 🔄 Repetition compulsion and trauma: People may repeat certain behaviors or situations as a way to try to fix or change the past, particularly in cases involving trauma, even though it seems counterproductive. 01:50:45 🤔 Defense mechanisms and judgment: Unhealthy defense mechanisms can cloud judgment and lead to repeated mistakes, while healthier mental processes allow for better decision-making. 01:54:52 🔍 Self-awareness and exploration: To address repetitive behaviors and improve mental health, individuals should explore all aspects of themselves, including self-awareness, defense mechanisms, salience, behavior, and personal strivings. 02:05:30 🚫 Fear and change: Fear can hinder personal growth and change, but by exploring one's psychology and addressing underlying issues, it's possible to reduce fear and make lasting improvements in various aspects of life. 02:07:23 🚀 Generative drive is an inherent human quality that fuels our desire to change, learn, and improve our lives. 02:13:31 ✨ Peace, contentment, and delight are not passive states but active outcomes of aligning with our generative drive, fostering a sense of agency, and practicing gratitude. 02:26:48 🚀 Identifying activities that prime your generative drive can provide a deep sense of satisfaction and energy, making them valuable for personal growth and productivity. 02:28:53 🚀 The generative drive is the key to living a fulfilling life, where individuals feel peace, contentment, and delight by actively engaging in positive actions and creation. 02:31:10 🌟 Creating things, both tangible and intangible, can be immensely satisfying and contribute to a sense of purpose and well-being. 02:33:02 🧠 Thinking can be a powerful tool for learning and problem-solving, but it can also be misused when it serves as a barrier to action or indulges in negative, repetitive thoughts. 02:37:12 🌊 Capturing moments of potential creation, regardless of their scale, can lead to feelings of agency, gratitude, contentment, and delight. 02:48:45 🌪️ Excessive aggression or pleasure-seeking can lead to destructive behaviors, such as envy and covetousness, which can hinder the generative drive and overall well-being. Balancing these drives is crucial. 02:49:27 🧐 Excessive aggression or pleasure-seeking, when they eclipse the generative drive, can lead to destructive emotions like envy, as seen in the movie ""American Psycho."" 02:51:15 😡 Envy can be a root cause of destructive behaviors, including violence and even active shooters, as it often arises from a sense of inadequacy and resentment. 02:56:07 😞 Demoralization can occur when aggression and pleasure-seeking are too low, leading to feelings of isolation, powerlessness, and vulnerability. 03:02:10 😔 Demoralization can manifest differently, from self-isolation and self-neglect to seeking solace in affiliating with others who share similar demoralized feelings, which can lead to both positive and negative outcomes. 03:10:29 🚀 In some cases, individuals with a strong aggressive drive may channel it positively towards productivity and achievement, even if it involves confrontational or challenging situations. 03:10:57 🧠 Medication alone often oversimplifies complex mental health issues and may not address underlying problems effectively. 03:11:38 💪 Creative and generative drive should be prioritized over competing and aggressive drive for optimal mental health and well-being. 03:14:11 🌱 Focusing on what brings delight, curiosity, and energy can lead to a more fulfilling and peaceful life. 03:22:41 🔄 When feeling stuck or demoralized, explore all aspects of the Self, seek self-awareness, engage in self-reflection, and consider professional guidance. 03:30:04 💊 Medication can provide temporary relief but should be used in conjunction with self-exploration and talk therapy to understand and address the root causes of mental health issues. 03:31:30 🧠 Medicines are sometimes used for psychological issues, which can lead to over-reductionism in treatment. 03:32:12 💊 Misdiagnosis can occur when the root cause of a problem isn't explored, leading to inappropriate medication. 03:34:56 💊 Medication can have a role in treatment, but it should not be a substitute for understanding and addressing underlying issues. 03:35:37 🧠 Understanding oneself and the components of self-awareness can lead to agency, gratitude, peace, contentment, and delight. 03:38:38 🧠 The structure and function of self can help understand and address conditions like narcissism, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

We CAN CHOOSE to NOT DO IT, if we DON""T REALLY WANT the outcome envisioned or WE DECIDE there's not enough payoff for us to DO it.        Like I""ve told my kids, if they want a mate but they'd RATHER stay online, sleep, read THAN DO ANY & everything they could be doing that WOULD help them connect with people & actualy find a mate; THEN maybe they needed to STOP condemning themselves & STOP feeling less than others for not having a mate yet. Maybe they needed to ALLOW themselves the choice, GIVE themselves the ok to not be seeking a mate for the time being & STOP letting other's expectations make them feel like they should be SEEKING A MATE or already HAVE one. AXXEPT THEMSELVES and still be proud of themselves. A novel idea to many.       I think it's the CRUX of WHY people feel unhappy, when we will spend so much time downing ourselves for who we are, based on something we've been taught tobelieve/ think that was mplanted in our heads by society, media & SOME people's opinions that our brain uses to keep telling us that ""WE'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGHas we ARE, not ""as good as"" others.       So if you like just how you are, you CAN accept yourself & stop beating yourself up, it's YOUR LIFE.        But if you really DO WANT something you CAN also OWN THAT & reframe your thoughts related to it to more  empower you to ASSIST YOU to get it done.         I found acceptance in some areas AND changing negative thoughts in others; to be how I stopped judging myself & beating myself up all the time.

Russian and Moroccan Jews have completely different traditions and values. Russian Jews tend to be far more conservative then Moroccan Jews.   For example, in Judaism, there is something called a Mitzva. While this word does not translate well into English, you can think of it like a religious Event. It could be a good thing like a wedding, or a bad thing like a funeral. Now both Russian and Moroccan Jews have very different ways of observing Mitzvas. Russian Jews tend to focus more on the praying aspect of Mitzvas and have celebration as a secondary thing if at all. Moroccan Jews however, do the exact opposite. They will focus almost entirely on celebration often even during bad Mitzvas. The mindset here is that you should be celebrating being alive and even during a funeral the person who died wouldn't want you to be depressed.   This mindset tends to make a lot of Sephardic Jews seem weird to other Jews. I remember when my grandparents (Ashkenazi ones) came back from an organized holocaust tour (they were visiting a bunch of the concentration camps), they told me about a running joke that the Sephardic buses were were the party buses of the trip. This is because Sephardic Jews tend to prefer celebrating being alive than mourning the dead.",en,22.0

IAnhFUUCq6c,HubermanLab,podcast,['01:53:46'],"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  16:31 💪 Exercise choice alone does not determine the adaptation; it's the application of the exercise (sets, reps, rest ranges) that primarily influences the outcome. 20:54 📊 You don't necessarily need to assess your one-repetition maximum; conversion charts can estimate it based on your repetitions and weight lifted. 22:22 🏋️ For strength and hypertrophy, modifiable variables include choice of exercise, intensity, volume (reps and sets), rest intervals, and progression. 25:51 📆 Training frequency is essential; how often you perform an exercise affects your progress. 35:08 💪 To develop strength, you need to impose a high-intensity demand, typically above 85% of your one-rep max, with low repetitions (5 or less) per set. 38:29 💪 For strength training, rest periods of 2 to 4 minutes between sets are recommended to maximize outcomes. 39:29 ⏳ Limiting strength and hypertrophy training sessions to around 60 minutes can help manage recovery and prevent overtraining. 40:29 🔄 Super setting push-pull exercises can be an effective way to maintain intensity and cardiovascular effort during a workout. 41:28 🩸 Different types of exercise adaptations lead to various physiological responses, and you can strategically choose your training approach based on your goals. 42:27 🏋️‍♂️ Hypertrophy training and anaerobic conditioning can offer the most comprehensive physiological adaptations across multiple categories. 44:24 🧠 Early adaptations to exercise are primarily neural, but sustained hypertrophy takes weeks and involves changes at the muscle fiber level. 45:21 💡 Training frequency is crucial, and waiting too long between workouts may miss the window for inducing further hypertrophy. 46:21 🔄 The gene cascade and protein synthesis process play a role in hypertrophy, with a recovery window of 24 to 48 hours between workouts. 47:48 💪 Strength development involves changes in the nervous system, muscle contraction, and connective tissue, making daily training feasible. 49:45 🤔 Strength and hypertrophy have a relationship, but more muscle doesn't guarantee proportionate strength gains. 58:10 💪 Repetition ranges for strength training are typically five or less, with the frequency being as often as every day. Rest intervals can range from two to four minutes, or longer for one-repetition maximum attempts. 59:12 💪 For hypertrophy training, effective repetition ranges can vary from five to 30 reps per set. A minimum of two times per week per muscle group is recommended for hypertrophy. 01:00:10 💪 Training for strength can follow the ""three to five concept,"" which involves selecting three to five exercises, doing three to five reps, three to five sets, resting for three to five minutes, and training three to five times a week. 01:13:32 💡 The ""mind-muscle connection"" or being intentional about contracting specific muscles during exercises may contribute to greater muscle growth. 01:18:01 🧠 Proper muscle activation during exercises is key for muscle development, and compensatory movements can hinder progress. 01:19:23 💡 Visualization, tactile feedback, and touch can help improve muscle group activation during exercises. 01:23:20 🔑 Separating breath from brace is essential for effective core stabilization during exercises. 01:35:07 💪 Adrenaline ramp-up during workouts can lead to energy crashes later. Down-regulations after workouts can help avoid this issue, even with just a few minutes. 01:36:08 🕒 Taking short breaks, as short as one minute, between intense activities can help conserve neural energy and enhance performance. 01:38:05 🏃‍♂️ When focusing on endurance training, choose exercises with minimal eccentric landing to reduce muscle damage and soreness. 01:39:59 🚴‍♂️ Activities like cycling, swimming, and rowing are good options for endurance training with minimal eccentric loading. 01:41:57 🔄 Mixing strength training and endurance training in the same workout or within the same week is generally not detrimental to overall progress. 01:47:18 💪 Interference between endurance and muscle growth is less significant than previously believed, especially if energy intake is controlled. 01:52:15 🚶 Incorporating more movement into your daily routine, like walking during phone calls or pacing, is essential for overall physical health. 01:53:46 🏃‍♂️ Dr. Andy Galpin recommends doing something once a week to reach a maximum heart rate (close to max intensity), lasting at least 30 seconds, for optimal cardiovascular health. 01:54:46 💓 Maximum heart rate (approximated as 220 minus age) is a rough measure and may vary significantly among individuals; focus on reaching a challenging heart rate during exercise. 01:56:12 🏋️‍♂️ Incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts that challenge maximum heart rate once a week can complement hypertrophy training and provide various cardiovascular benefits. 02:00:41 🩺 Identifying your point of physiological failure (e.g., legs vs. cardiovascular system) helps tailor your training to address specific weaknesses. 02:02:11 🏃‍♂️ To build well-rounded endurance, include three components: once-a-week high-intensity training, extended moderate-intensity cardiovascular work, and 2-6 minutes of high-intensity work followed by equal rest periods, repeated as needed. 02:15:04 🏋️‍♂️ Training just below the threshold of pain can help improve tissue tolerance and desensitize pain signals, especially for conditions like low back pain. 02:16:04 💧 Proper hydration is essential for health and performance. Aim for half your body weight in ounces of water per day and replenish fluids lost during exercise. 02:17:30 💧 Hydration needs vary based on individual factors like sweat rate. Sweat testing can help determine sodium loss and guide electrolyte supplementation. 02:31:01 💧 Pre and post-exercise hydration recommendation is around 500 milligrams of salt each time. 02:34:22 💧 If you're losing more than 1% of your body weight during exercise, it's essential to focus on hydration. 02:34:53 🍽️ Whether to train fasted or not depends on personal preference and the type of training, but it's generally okay for the average person. 02:36:54 🥶 Avoid immediate cold exposure like ice baths after strength or hypertrophy training, as it can interfere with muscle growth. 02:37:25 ❄️ It's best to wait at least a few hours before cold exposure after a workout to minimize interference with hypertrophy. 02:38:31 🥶 Cold showers are not as effective as ice baths for recovery and adaptation, and it's preferable to separate them from strength training. 02:40:59 🏋️‍♂️ Cold exposure may not be as detrimental to strength development as it is to hypertrophy, so it's less concerning in strength-focused training. 02:49:29 🏋️‍♂️ Sauna use after strength and hypertrophy training could have potential benefits, although there isn't official data yet. It might be beneficial after endurance training as well, assuming proper hydration. 02:49:57 🌡️ An ideal regimen might involve training, then sauna or heat exposure, followed by cold exposure on off days or several hours away from training, optimizing recovery and adaptation. 02:50:59 ❄️ Cold exposure in the morning can lead to improved overall relaxation and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) scores throughout the day, reducing the need for excessive caffeine. 02:51:28 🌊 Sitting still in cold water immersion creates a thermal layer around you, so it's more effective to move around a bit to break up this layer for better cold exposure results. 02:51:57 💪 Regular cold exposure can lead to enhanced adaptability and reduced fatigue, as seen consistently in athletes' HRV scores. 03:02:42 🔵 Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) can improve training performance by helping to regulate pH levels in muscles, reducing fatigue, and enhancing endurance. 03:07:40 🫐 Inhaled oxygen is used by the body to create energy by breaking down carbohydrates or fats, with carbohydrates stored as glycogen in muscles. 03:08:08 🔬 Anaerobic glycolysis, which breaks down carbohydrates for fuel in low-oxygen conditions, produces acid as a byproduct, leading to fatigue buildup. 03:14:06 💡 Sodium bicarbonate can temporarily increase alkalinity in the body, delaying the onset of fatigue during intense exercise. 03:15:34 🥤 To use sodium bicarbonate, start with a small amount (e.g., half a teaspoon) dissolved in water, consumed around 45 minutes before exercise. 03:16:04 🤢 Gastric distress is a potential side effect of sodium bicarbonate, so use caution and experiment to find the right dosage. 03:24:57 🌙 Understanding and addressing environmental factors can significantly improve sleep quality, even when other aspects have been optimized. 03:25:26 🌬️ Monitoring environmental factors during sleep, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality, can impact sleep quality. 03:25:57 😴 Re-breathing CO2 around your face during sleep can lead to sleep problems; addressing this can improve sleep quality. 03:26:56 🛏️ Absolute Rest is a commercial sleep optimization device that can diagnose sleep-related issues and improve sleep quality. 03:28:19 🤝 Dr. Galpin's ability to distill complex information into practical protocols is highly valuable to many people. 03:29:17 📲 Connect with Dr. Andy Galpin on Instagram and Twitter for further information on exercise science and related topics.

gqS1ov4lSI0,JordanBPeterson,talk show,['4:56'],"He expounds biblical text? He doesn’t submit himself to the Lord Jesus Christ and is an ecumenist. He really believes that Jews, Christians, and Muslims all serve the same God “of the Book.” Except that’s not even remotely true, as the Bible is clear that the Lord broke the covenant he made with Israel for their betrayal of Christ and only cared about a Messiah (Messiah is Hebrew coming into English and Christ is Greek coming into English, but they both mean the same thing…the anointed one of God…the Christ, the Messiah.  The Jews rejected him because he wasn’t the Messiah they were expecting. They read all the scriptures about God making Israel the shining beacon of the world that all the gentiles will come to. They weren’t looking for the Messiah of Isaiah 53 who is the suffering Savior to brutally die to take on the sin and iniquity of his people. That’s what the name Jesus Christ (comes from the name יֵשׁוּ הַנוֹצרִי in Hebrew into English)…Jesus is also the name that comes from Greek into English, though that name from the Hebrew into English is Joshua…Joshua and Jesus…both names mean “salvation of the LORD” or as the angel Gabriel told Mary that his name would be JESUS for he shall save his people from their sins.  I explain all this linguistic territory, because the Jews didn’t want a meek Savior coming to preach his gospel to save men’s souls…they just wanted a savior to come and break off Rome. They are still half-blinded to this unto this day because the Bible says that Jews are half blind right now, they can only see the law of God but not the grace of God (Romans 11:1-10).  The Muslims have a completely false gospel. They have a false prophet (curses be upon him) who is burning in hell right now, and so will every Muslim that follows that wicked false prophet will go to the same place he went. The Quran and hadiths make no sense and are contradictory, in so many ways that I can’t get into over a YouTube comment. The catholic church actually sent Muhammad to the Arabs (Muhammad was of a white complexion, the hadiths explain this): references being Sahih Bukhari 4:56:767, Sahih Bukhari 1:8:367, Sahih Muslim 8:3325, Sahih Muslim 4:1014, Sunan Abu Dawud 3:1169 and so many others. Muhammad was a white man. As I said, the pope of Rome sent him out to subjugate the Arabs for the papacy but it ended up turning on them when the Muslims tried invading Spain and other European nations. But the whole point was to drag the Arabs into submitting to the catholic whore. But look at the Quran, it exalts Mary more than Muhammad….  Biblical Christians are the only ones with the truth because we have the full canon of biblical text. We’re hated throughout all the world just like Christ told us as the world hated him, they’ll hate us also. We know where this world is heading. We have a living God. Eventually (in a time soon coming) there will be a false messiah who will lead Israel and eventually the entirety of the world. He will be working by the power of Satan and people will be deceived into thinking he is the true coming of Christ.  Jordan Peterson knows nothing of these things, and I don’t say that with any pride. Jordan Peterson helped me to come out of my bitter atheism in 2017 and eventually God pulled me out of the pit and darkness I was in in October 2018 and I was born again and became a child of God. The Lord Jesus Christ can save to the uttermost. People must repent of their life of sin and turn to the true God and Savior Jesus Christ.",en,17.0

gqS1ov4lSI0,JordanBPeterson,talk show,['20:17']," @Adam20672  John 10:30 came in a dialogue fallowing ""My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all"". Can someone give something to himself? Here we are one means we are one in purpose.  John 8:58 ""Before Abraham was, I am."" This isn't even grammatical let alone making a CLEAR claim of divinity   John 14:9 obviously mean that whoever saw Jesus no longer needed to see the father because Jesus himself with miracles was sufficient proof. Doesn't mean they were one  John 17:5 again, Jesus being in God's glory before the world existed doesn't mean he is God. According to the Islamic teaching, All human souls were created before Adam's descent to Earth and we all were asked about who our Creator is. In fact, just 2 verses earlier in John 17:3 Jesus says that God sent him, showing a clear distinction between God and Jesus.  Mark 2:5-7 yes, only God can forgive sins, but God communicates and relays his forgiveness through his prophets. It's very common. Again, Jesus doesn't need to be God to receive this communication.   John 20:28 it isn't justified to interpret Thomas's response, who was a devout Jew, to be addressing Jesus as God. It's a mistranslation as he was only addressing him as ""divine"" and not as the ""Almighty God."" So, it is similar to when Moses is described as being a ""god"" Exodus 7:1 or when all Jews are described as being ""gods"" in Psalms 82:6. Also, more interestingly, in John 20:17 the distinction between Jesus and the father is not only asserted again, but also says the father is the father of all humanity, not just Jesus. Why do you ignore this one? How absurd for God to be talking to himself in this manner  Revelation 1:8 is weakest claim to the divinity of Jesus. This was not a statement by Jesus. This was a dream John had! How can you ignore the many EXPLICIT and DIRECT statements by Jesus showing a distinction between himself and the father?  The cornerstone of Christianity, yet we cannot find one single UNAMBIGUOUS claim by Jesus to be God. It's just Christians doing mental gymnastics with the text to find in it what they want to find.",en,16.0
