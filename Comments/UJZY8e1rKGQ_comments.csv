@brianmurphy8811,"Jones - Nah, this story isn't over, just wait until he hits prison.  Inmates typically have a whole different set of punishments for what they view as worst offenders.  Rapists, Child molesters, and wife beaters.  Depending on where he goes, he can probably expect to have all of his shit stolen daily/weekly (whenever he gets any mail), likely physical assault, possibly sexual assault, and then whatever the inmates feel like doing to him, just to make things worse.  A <redacted> spent some time in jail, <redacted> would tell me all these stories of what it was like there.  One thing inmates would do is take a dump in your shoes, and then use a plastic bag to push it up into the toe area, so you couldn't see it before putting your shoes on.   That's just one example.  So yeah, Mr. Jones is about to spend the worst possible time you can possibly spend, in jail.  Virginia - I think right now, at this time in American history, we can all agree that political rhetoric/venom, has ratcheted up, and yes, higher than it was during Obama's presidency (This does not mean, that Obama was always treated with respect...that's an utter fallacy, it just means it's getting worse), and I have to say, this act, and the stabbing, etc... are a natural escalation of the rhetoric (At least, I've expected it to go this route for awhile now).  You may think no sane person would go there, but, not everyone is sane.   There are truly those out there who think that just by killing all political opponents, it will solve some problems.  And with the rhetoric getting worse and worse and worse, I don't think it's any surprise that it starts translating into real world violence.  And, until we do start acting like adults, and behaving in a manner befitting the ideals/principles of our Democracy, this will continue to get worse, and we will continue to see more people justifying violence towards political opposites.  Grenfell Tower - I don't really have words for this one...  The footage of that guy really hit me hard.

@anthonycranston9843,"While I firmly believe the pedophilia is wrong, especially when it harms children, I do believe that we as a society need to make it more easy to get help for it. It is a psychological problem, and some states even allow for psychiatrists to report and get people put in jail just for admitting that they have had thoughts about children, there seems to be no way for people to get proper help for it, due to the fact that everyone around them will hate them as soon as they find out. It seems to be quite backwards to hate something without trying to fix it. Everyone seems to be perfectly fine and feel so self righteous when they talk about how disgusting pedophiles are,even if they didn't do anything wrong. All it does is push these people further and further away,until they feel like they have no escape but the actually commit a crime.      Don't get me wrong though, as soon as they touch a child or anything of the sort, they need to be punished to the fullest extend of the law. These people often were abused children themselves, and need the proper psychological help.",8년 전,17,

Child molestation is a choice, soliciting sexual acts from children is a choice, but having the urges isn't. The more we treat the word pedophile as the same as child molester, the more pedophiles who are morally upright don't feel comfortable getting the help they need. And if they don't get the help they need, it's that much more likely the urges make them go crazy and they go over the line.   Child molestation is wrong and disgusting. What this youtuber did was wrong and disgusting. But pedophilia is a mental condition and people with it need help, both for themselves and for the sake of those they might hurt. I usually agree with you, but the stance you take on this subject and the way you treat the terms pedophile and child molester as synonymous is something that does more harm than good.",8년 전,8,

@EvilLuisito,"Bernie supporters were also very violent at numerous Trump rallies. They were ripping signs, blocking ambulances and punching Trump supporters. I'm not saying all leftists are the same, but it's important to understand that many progressives are marxists/socialists and they do in fact want a violent communist revolution. They despise capitalism, they think we live in a evil white supremacist patriarchy and they want to replace individualism with collectivism.  It's of course silly to claim everyone who supports Bernie is a commie. But it's also a no true scotsman fallacy to pretend ""real progressives"" aren't like this. The left clearly has a growing authoritarian problem and it's dividing progressives / liberals and pushing leftwing libertarians/centrists to conservatism.  I think progressivism, feminism and social justice has become a religion and a danger to society tbh. A growing number of progressives want to change things for the worse (just for the sake of changing things) and they even want to regress society by bringing back gender/racial segregation...

@kiomaru1,"as much as i dislike the idea of pedophilia, i think 30 years of prison would be very unfair.  We have to remember that while he explicitly demands his under aged fans to send him sexual pictures/photos, the fact is these fans still had the option not to abide to what he said and just report him or ignore him by simply not doing it. they might be young, but they are not 4-5 years old but somewhat grown teenagers, they should have had a better judgment to what they are doing. Plus, He did not Blackmail them, kidnap them, and there wasn t any sort of violence involved.  don t get me wrong, i still think he should serve some jail time for emotionally manipulating his under aged fans, but sentencing it for something like 30 years of prison would put his Non-violent crime on the same pedestal as something heinous like murder or actual rape, when the only damage from what he did stems from potentially emotionally scarring these teens to exposing his disgusting fetishes to the broad public. this is nothing compared to what murder/rape/ or any violent crime that would give you 30 years of prison can destroy.  just to be clear again, i am not defending him or trying to normalize pedophilia, i just think that the overall public disgust on sexual act to under aged people tends to cloud people sense of reasoning when dealing with these issues.",8년 전,9,

That despite not being your ""Standard"" celebrities the power Youtubers have over their communities can lead to abuses some main stream celebrities do and they think they can get away with it because no one considers them influencial in mainstream media, yes i know some people sadly make stuff up for ""Views"" and ""Drama"" but i mean for the ones willing to go to the police who are spoken to by specialists who do conclude foul play has occured, or the cases where multiple persons in multiple countries or states come forward with no previous contact to each other with similar stories to be investigated, the UK recently had the international operation Ewetree (Still ongoing?) which investigated sex offences against minors by media celebrities from as far back as the 70s to 2017 if necessarry and didnt look at youtubers like this sickening individual, I am in favour for such a thing to be done with youtube to clean up these Foul creators and send a clear warning the community will not tolerate this behaviour or individuals who use their power to abuse their fanbase and other creators.

Many media outlets on the left, I have noticed have treated Sanders in a similar manner that many UK outlets were treating Corbyn. Even worse however, is I saw many people citing this as ""the left's normalization of violence,"" despite the fact that the people who are right-wing in this country voted for someone who said ""I could shoot someone on 5th avenue and get away with it."" In my opinion this stems from a strong amount of contempt people on both sides of the political spectrum both have for one another, this in my opinion has been occurring since the Kathy Giffords incident which draws many parallels to this one.(Albeit the shooter in that incident was a right wing extremist)",8년 전,0,

Taking pictures of young girls and distributing the pictures does indeed require consent, however Austin never did that so this law does not apply to his actions at all.  Austin never did a single thing that even required anyone's consent, and nothing done in the videos required anyone's consent either since the girls made the videos themselves, so how are age-of-consent laws even relevant here?

@brisipos6191,"Its Jesus that Austin Jones needs. I don't think that it's okay for ppl to be talking down on another human being considering he felt suicidal for all the hate comments. Sure what he did wasn't right but man. All ppl do things that aren't right. Have you ever talked down on a person or made fun of someone for not conforming to society? Well you don't know how deeply your words could've cut their heart. And sadly its legal to talk down on ppl. That's how society is but you have all done wrong regardless of who you are. All humans are twisted all humans have flaws. You don't need to be talking down on another person for doing something wrong or for just being themselves even. Humans can be nasty out of pain. But the bible says as the man thinks so is he. So if someone does wrong and you treat them badly they'll assume they're a bad person and continuously act that way. If a person truly knew they were loved they wouldn't be doing those kinds of things to ppl. Its a shame for society to talk down on ppl for doing one thing wrong. And sure it wasn't right but judging someone like that is bullying. Its Jesus that he needs. Its sad how mean ppl are and how some just upload videos for views and popularity out of making fun of another person. Instead of being so concerned about how others live their lives you should be more concerned about how you live your own instead of being stuck on social media and wasting your lives away on pointless drama. Life is short. Is this how you want to waste it? If a person is in Christ it heals them, mind, soul and body emotions everything. Everyone needs him. If they don't have him they're gonna do things like this, not everyone. But ppl need to know that all ppl were designed with purpose. And the purpose is to be a son of God and change your life around. Anyone can!",7년 전,0,

She will have little time with you, living under the roof and when she will go on her own, with the little phone experience, and she'll be new to all the social media stuff, shere might be no one to fall back at.  Now you could teach her about this things. She will eventually get on this anyway. Just because she's older by age doesn't mean anything.  Age is irrellevant. It's what's in the person head. So why don't you tell her, expain or teach her about all of this things right now?   If she will get mad ebcause she doesn't have mobile phone, and understands that you can afford it, there will be a disconnection between you and her, and once she lives there will be a different vibe between you and her.  Plus technology or mobile phone can be used for good stuff. Such as learning. That's a better focus!   If someone want's her to tweark, they will give her the phone.   But will she do it?   But then it depends on the relationship of you and her, and yes, mobile phones in general, in my opinion are bad, so you could give her some old phone ^^  At the end most young people use mobile phones for texting, playing games and stuff like that - which harms eyes and it's just waste of time.   I remember when I lived with parents, and I study on the computer, I was learning programming and stuff... and they used to at times, take the mouse or the entire computer away.   Just so I can't study?! Of coruse not. For them learning stuff on my own without really giving a shit for a paper is like.... word doesn't work that way... etc... so yeah...   Now I do this anyway, and I don't give a shit about them, micoromanagment manipulative people.  I'm just saying to be careful with the 'no no' and if you do micro manage and stuff like that.

He has homegrown fame. Nobody teaches you how to deal with that. Look at what happened to Justin Bieber. Hell, Michael Jackson got really fucked up. That type of fame and noteriety is hard to deal with and very few celebrities take it well. Again, what he did is wrong but how much damage has he done? If the videos are now deleted and no longer available. With the appropriate reparations and therapy for him and maybe a very severe demand of community service including imprisonment for the duration of his theraputical treatment, in my opinion he should be free to go. What this kid did was very bad but it is not something completely psychopatic. I would never do anything similar like this but in his shoes, I can absolutely imagine how fame would get to my head.

@PoshestHyena,"Now, the fire was a horrible thing. I was in the area at the time, and I could see the smoke no matter where I was. When I saw the fire, and what people were doing out of desperation to get out or get their children out, to save them from the fire or hope they'd live, I kind of just went numb.   I had seen the post beforehand, and I recall thinking that the situation, while so graphic and devastating, was the perfect example of irony.   I don't think there's any better example of why you always have to make sure you're as safe from a fire as can be. Turning a tragedy into a lesson isn't uncommon, but this is one you really have to note, because I saw children being thrown out from fatal heights. As much as I dislike everyone, I wouldn't wish for this to happen. It's a painful, horrible way to die.   And I have my speculations about how it started, and I doubt it was work to the building. It's connected to something a bit darker than I'd prefer to theorize.",7년 전,0,

We all either steered clear of situations like that in the first place or just NOPEd the f*ck out if the suggestion by an older man came up. But 2 out of the 30 fell for this kind of thing, because it made them feel so powerful to have sex with a 23/30 y.o. at 13. And no, pedophilia wasn't a word any of us had ever heard at that point so of course they were convinced it was because they as a person were special, and it wasn't just some sick f*cks who'd prey upon any young girl. Ofc, both came to severely regret their decision and later struggled with the knowledge of what had happened to them.   If you know better than them, if you ever realize that a girl you know is about to make a similar mistake (be it sending videos over the internet or doing things in person), explain to them how this manipulation works that gets them to do things they are uncomfortable with and that are just NOT RIGHT.

What I'm appalled at is the amount of presumably grown up people in the comment section giving responses such as ""Oh but you ARE smarter than them, sweetie"" and ""I used to be smarter/more intelligent than other girls my age too!"". Seriously? How do you think victims of this pedophile are going to feel when they read your comments? That they're not ""as smart"" or ""as intelligent"" as some other girls their age? And that this is why they're victimized? It's fine to call for others to try and stay safe, it's fine to call for more education on the subject, but it's NOT fine to sit in a comment section and have a god damn circle jerk around how much ""smarter"" you were than other girls when you were a teenager and exclaim shit like oh ""FINALLY someone with common sense"". If anyone of his victims is reading this, please listen: You being victimized has NOTHING to do with how smart or intelligent you are. The amount of education or information you have on a single subject has absolutely nothing to do with your ability to process that information. And no, just because you might've been told ""Don't trust strangers on the internet"", that does not make you ""informed"" on the topic and there is absolutely NO REASON you are to blame for being victimized by this this guy.   And to the rest of you, what the actual fuck? ""Oh if only more girls were as smart then less girls could be taken advantage of."" NO, just fucking NO. If less guys would act like fucking MONSTERS like this one, then less girls would be taken advantage of. That's not to say that girls or women can't take measures to stay safe, and of course it's important that we give that education to young women to guard them best we can, but don't twist the fkin rhetoric here into being about how girls could do better to prevent getting fucked over by men when what we should focus on is why so many men do these things and how to prevent that in the future.

At least thread OP is a child and can lack the understanding of what kind of effect these comments can have on victims, but the goddamn adults taking the opportunity to applaud it is revolting.  The fact that anyone even chooses to go into the comments under a video like this and put the attention to themselves, instead of attacking the perpetrator and offer NOTHING but pure support for these poor girls shows that they're not engaging in this comment section in good faith. Girls putting other girls down, and even worse, grown-ass women putting young girls down, to elevate themselves is one of the ugliest displays of internalised misogyny.

@emily-rainbeetle7856,"And that's why your kids do bad things behind your back.  As a mother, you're not educating your kids, you're teaching them to do things without your knowing. Children are not mindless drones. They have brains and body's just like you. Imagine your brain and mind inside your child's body. Teach them that. But all of it. Not just what you think they should have, because they will then need to find out for themselves. And that's why those girls did this. They wanted to know about thing's that had been kept from them their whole lives. If you had simply told them everything, they would never feel the need to learn. Sad, that people can't understand that children are only a little different than you. Simply, they are younger with less developed brains. They are not innocent lambs their entire lives, and the sooner parents realize that, the better. Treat your kid like their on your level. They will never try to do things before they're ready, because they're already on par with the adults.  I've noticed from the many younger people I've spoken to that its always the ""good"" kids who have real problems. The kid who's parents sheltered them ends up trying drugs and sex. The kid who was told to always have good grades ends up partying to rebel and release stress.  My mother never pressured me, and I'm an 18 year old virgin (surrounded by non-virgins, let me tell you. High school is not what you want to think it is. It's not innocent, hell no. Parents are blind to this.) I've never drunken alcohol, even when a parent allowed me one drink if I wished. This is because I was not forced to bend to my parents will, and I was instead educated on why alcohol is not good for the human body.",7년 전,1,

We know the consequences of our actions! And 14! C'mon! I know 10 year olds who know better! Why does everyone act like if I do something inappropriate the day before my 18th birthday, I am suddenly a victim and I can't think for myself. If I do something inappropriate a day after my 18th birthday, it's totally fine. That is stupid. If the victims fully consented, what is there to go on about? I do not condone his actions, and I think pedophilia is wrong. However, we need better education about the consequences of our actions. We are generally too sheltered by society and our parents to talk about these taboo issues. If we don't talk about it, how are we going to know what to do? I do realize I am contradicting myself, but it is simply because I think that if people of my age group are really so impressionable, then there is something wrong with them, society, and parents. I again reiterate my point that I do not think that the offender should not be blamed, and I am disgusted by pedophilia. However, I hope that everyone will stop acting as if we are a robot that listens to everything we are told to do or that we do not have a mind of our own. I think that people of my age need to start showing maturity in their actions, so that adults will not think that we are so helpless. Guys, don't let the testosterone and dopamine get to your head. Girls, don't let the estrogen and dopamine get to your head.  I will end this by saying that in my honest opinion, these girls would not have sent the inappropriate clips if they had higher self-esteem. They were looking for approval because they had little/none to begin with.

@intj1434,"+NaCl3 Their propaganda is quite effective, and it's not that overplayed by the media. What they basically tell their people is that the ""Western world"" (eg America) is a source of all evil and is out to get them. Add military power and media manipulation to this, and boom, complete, utter dictatorship. Trump kind of made it worse by firing threats at them, practically confirming their propaganda to the North Korean public, who obviously would have no way of knowing if what their government is telling them is true. All they're told is that this president of America is degrading their leader and saying America can wipe out North Korea if it wanted to. That's why many presidents in the past (including South Korean) have tried to be friendly with North Korea - they wanted to change the skewed view the North Koreans have on the ""outside world"". Their home country is all they've ever known. There are a lucky few who manage to escape to China or South Korea (one guy made it to the news) but this is a huge risk - they're leaving their families behind to be killed for betraying their country, they can get shot on the spot, etc. And they don't get nice looks from others either - some South Koreans are suspicious of them since they could easily be spies who ""escaped"".  The majority of the North Korean public love their dictator. We'd think that they would hate him but nah. To them, he's the only condom that's providing protection against the ""outside world"" from screwing them over. Quite sad. And hella scary.",7년 전,0,

I would have voted for Sanders, he seems to actually care about the people. But in this world it's only the loud ones that get the most attention, which is also why North Korea could get away with so much crap without anyone really noticing. It's even worse that they're not exactly in bad conditions either - imagine South Korea but a lot cheaper, that's what North Korea looks like. If you were born there, you would probably think there was nothing wrong with your country. If you ever felt suspicion against your leader's decisions, you'd first question your sanity rather than your society. Like a really well organised cult.  Also, yeah, I like to mix humour when describing dark crap.

@true7251,"some people are mature at 10, some never mature at all. i agree that 18 year old mark shouldn't mean this much. but legally they needed to stop somewhere. the problem is, people grow up thanks to their reactions to things happening in their lives. underlying issues like mental health can also help person to stay undeveloped socially and be mentally immature despite having a mature body. and about hormones, since i literally have hormonal imbalance that fucks my life everyday, you cannot just ""not let it go to your head"". it's not how it works. I like your point of view, but you are quite young to think it is that simple. teens are too messed up with their self esteem issues etc, to think rationally most of the time. heck, i know 30, 40, 50 year old people, who could act exactly as the victims in the scenario (i can even name few right away lol). people are naive, stupid and want approval, love and attention at any age. and they, most of all, will believe, their naked butts will not get to the internet, it is just ""between you and me"". all generations say about next one ""they are the shitty ones"". it is not a generation thing, really. it is people thing. people are dumb and naive. the younger they are, the more chances they do not know the consequences. older people can be equally stupid (and even worse), but they may at least can know by now few examples, how things can go south in situations they can willingly put themselves into. also, showing maturity in your actions. lol. teens, who are considered mature, half the time the most immature people in the group. like, the kids who study well and such. what parents consider mature and what you consider mature is different. people get mature after having enough experience in life. you need to vomit after drinking once, to get to know your limits, for example. so, it is okay to act immature, while society treats you like a kid. it is your time to learn. you'll have a whole life being grown up. do not rush into this. just my point of view, as a long time adult, who was really immature for surprisingly long time, even past 18 y o. you may be the mature one for your age, and have smart friends, but do not think that other people your age are the same. half of them will be still immature in their 20s and 30s, and will seem mentally slow, compared to grown up kids like you. and they won't be slow, just not experienced enough to be mature and not socially awkward. people are all different. and stereotypes exist for a reason, really. "" if they had higher self-esteem. They were looking for approval because they had little/none to begin with."" seriously. EXTREME number of women in any age is like that. men are too, but they express it through violence, anger and being stubborn to a fault. god, it just seems like you are growing in a perfect family with perfect friends and do not see how flawed and helpless grown up people can be. it is quite a luck, being this blind to people around you. will make your life easier.",7년 전,3,
@aja8521,"Trystan Raj The way I see your comment is If the adults around us didn't want us to do these things, or be a certain way, they should have taught us .  You are absolutely 100% correct. However. parents of today are not aware that people like the guy in this video want to see their kids butthole.  Where I got lost in your comment is where you said that kids of today have their own mindset and do crazy shit regardless of age. What's the big deal about what you do before your 18 th birthday.  My question is, would you like kids to be able to do whatever, whenever? No rules?  Or, would you like some solid direction, away from sex and porn,  or a direction of enlightenment with education , true art, and music... Something away from the Internet, tv, and video games.

But I think we should consider that as far as we know the victims have been kept anonymous and these actions were only online. If evidence reveals that he has done things physically in person, then massive prison sentences are definitely called for. But ultimately getting someone to send some sexual videos online and if only he viewed them, is disgusting, but not as massive a crime, frankly I think these commenters should realize just how long 30 years is. Most of the people in this comment section probably aren't even 30 years old yet. It absolutely has to stop, it's deplorable, but I really don't think sentencing a 20 year old dude to 30 years in prison can lead to anything good. If he can learn a lesson it won't take 30 years. If anything he'll come out more fucked up because over half his life will have been spent in a way more fucked up reality. More jail time isn't a good answer.

Gender Dysphoria is a serious mental illness (of varying degrees, mind you), making your brain wired as if it was the other sex even though your body is different. It's a fuckup on natures part, just like when some men are born with two penises or a goddamn tail. That's why we have hormone blockers. In case we see evidence of gender dysphoria of the absolute most serious of cases, they would TEEEEEMPOOOOOOORAAAAARIIIIILYYYYYYYY block hormones off, until they and their psychologists would be more certain about certain things, and until the individual could properly decide for themselves WITH THE DOCTORS RECOMMENDATION to finally start hormone treatments. No recommendation = no hormone treatment, regardless of ""personal oppression"" and all that crap. It's a fail safe, so that SJW fuck ups that claim they are gender-fluid and non-gendered won't have an easy way to suddenly make the permanent decision of changing their gender.

Things that basically say that it's okay to feel this way, eventually it will go away.  When is it wrong? That's my question. So having crushes on older guys I get the respouse that it's fine, but when is it not fine? What if I regularly see these older guys and we make each other laugh?

@Zion45005, @jeannedinovo5543  I would reevaluate that whole thought process how can you blame an underage child for doing something someone much older and experienced that her manipulated her into doing. This was someone she put on a pedestal using that platform in the worst way imaginable. She is in no way to blame he clearly pressured and manipulated her. At that age all a girl wants is to be  accepted and to fit in. He was fully aware of that and used it against her. That makes him totally responsible for what happened NOT the victim. And we wonder why it takes years before someone gets the courage to speak out after a sexual crime...because of people like you.,6년 전,2,

Maybe it's because we live in different cultures.

Dude is 23, Girls were 14, which is not only very close to the start of puberty ( so they are almost children, and very naive), but there is also an age difference of almost 10 years. Its pretty much taking advantage of naive teenagers who just hit puberty. which is just not okay.

He said he's tried, but he can't help the attraction. He's attempted suicide on multiple occasions. He hates himself and doesn't understand how anyone could live the way he does and not.

I've actually seen people on Twitter not only saying the Republicans deserved it, but even hoping they suffer for supporting Trump or, in the case with McCain, simply not siding with the ""correct"" side of the debate. I saw one particularly nasty person hoping someone shoots McCain next. I don't understand why we're okay with this kind of shit.  I.. almost don't wanna touch the Austin Jones thing. (also what's up with two videos in a row featuring an AJ?)  Part of me feels the guy is a sick fuck who is praying on naive fans who just want to be accepted or seen as popular, but part of me remembers this is exactly the sort of thing we've seen underage (in America) kids do whenever someone they like interacts with them. Even David Bowie had fans admit to sleeping with him when they were underage and never regretted it a day.   HOWEVER, another huge factor here is that there was also no physical interaction with these girls that Austin Jones spoke to. Also, naive or not these two (especially B) had to have understood to some degree what they were getting into. Making and sending videos to someone over the internet is not something you just go ""whoops"" later on.   I guess I'm just in some sort of weird middle ground. What he did was wrong, and those girls definitely need to understand how stupid what they did was.. but I feel like there's a big gap between physically being in a room and pressuring someone into doing something and talking them into it via online chat. Not to mention the sheer amount of cybering (as it used to be called) that occurred in the 2000s probably makes all this look horribly tame by comparison.  I guess I've just seen enough that's worse to get really worked up over this.

@nikolademitri731,"Dude, calling it hebophilia isn't twisting the narrative. There's a massive difference between a pubescent/post-pubescent individual and a prepubescent individual, and how that relates to sex/sexuality. Seriously, don't talk about logic and reason if you're not willing to differentiate these things and speak scientifically and realistically about them. Is it fucked up either way? Absolutely, but I got news for you, it's A LOT more fucked up to be pursuing/fucking/attracted to/etc a prepubescent child, and yeah, it's pedophilia. If someone needs to describe to you why that's more fucked up and wrong than the same attraction or activity with a teenager who has sexually matured, well, I'm not sure what to tell you man. You need to really reflect on this more.   I'm not saying physical/sexual maturity makes what dude did okay, absolutely not. These were still essentially kids, mentally, in the sense that they clearly aren't psychologically mature enough to understand the weight of their actions, or that they are being taken advantage of, and in that sense it's disgusting. I'm merely saying, it's much more disgusting and considered psychologically more significant, to be attracted to children who are not sexually mature at all.   I don't believe in retributive justice, however, so I strongly disagree with 30 years of prison. What he needs is psychological evaluations and severe mental help, and rehabilitation. When it can be proven that he has been rehabilitated, he can be put back in society, but should be forced to at least a year minimum of social/community services of some kind, and have to pay a fine, most of which should go to organizations to help victims of sexual abuse. Such a punishment is much more useful to society, than just throwing him behind bars to rot and take up thousands in our tax dollars every year. Cheers 🍻✌🏼",8년 전,0,

@91hamod,I think awareness should be spread between all those young kids online and more supervision should be considered..  for this particular situation i think therapy would do more than a punishment would. Punishment can be used as a part of the therapy but we have to leave that to the specialized people.  Awareness is the key really cause kids are in true danger online this case is just broad day light most cases aren't even discovered for 5-10 years and it usually shows as mental illness symptoms.,8년 전,0,

This doesn't redeem the act, but I do believe in giving people second chances and the ability to reform.

He's a very young adult, talking to pubescent, mature girls. I would base my judgement of what he did solely on how he manipulated the girls into doing what they did, saying ""if you really were my biggest fan you'd do this"" etc. after they were being reluctant. I think the only thing that was wrong about the whole situation was that he pushed girls to do what they did after they were reluctant to do so.

One child, who came to us with his infant brother was a selective mute, due to severe abuse.  One morning I got up from playing with him on the floor and suddenly heard his first words.

@rotarypunch7306,"I think that the casualization of sexuality is largely to blame for scandals like this. We have prominent social media influencers, particularly females, who know that they have an incredibly young following but constantly post highly sexualized photos of themselves and promote it as empowering and a good idea. SuperMaryFace is a prime example of this, and I bring her up because you once featured her on your show. People like her make it seem fun and brave and ""empowering"" to share risque images of yourself with the internet when it is actually a horrible and dangerous idea, and it is nothing short of irresponsible when you know that most of your followers are children and teens. A leaked nude (even an explicit but clothed photo) can ruin somebody's life, and then you have these people with huge platforms encouraging them to do it.  Society needs to stop making sexuality seem like something that should be casually shared with whoever asks for it. The next generation needs a better influence than that.  There will always be predators, and nothing we do will stop that because they already know that they are doing something wrong, they just don't care. That's why I prefer to focus on the people who claim to be the good guys and who may change their ways if they realize that they are harmful, especially somebody like SuperMaryFace who has intentionally crafted a motherly, role-model relationship with her viewers. But whether somebody intends to be a role model or not, they need to be aware of the impact of their influence.  Mary, Tess Holiday, Kylie Jenner, pretty much every Instagram model and a large number of female YouTubers and streamers... People like that are a huge contributor to the sexualization of young people. And they make it that much easier for a predator to come in and convince them to send a nude.  Sex-selling celebrities are nothing new, but platforms like YouTube have introduced an unprecedented sense of closeness between performer and fan, and that brings greater risk. It's no longer just a shiny celebrity on TV. It's a vlogger who calls you her friend, presents videos as if she is talking to you one on one, whose personal life you see every day on her social media, etc.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@E_2the_mma,"1st story: I personally think that it isn't long enough I think he should have 40 years at least and when he gets out he shouldn't have any internet access and if he does he should go back to jail for 10 years 2nd story: On the gun debate they should tighten the gun laws in America and where people say that guns saved them 1 the problem wouldn't have happened if they had tighter gun control and 2 they would still be able to have guns because I think if hey are security or in that sort of job where they are protecting people they should have guns 3rd Story: What happened at Grenfell was completely avoidable as the fire spread so quickly due to the cladding not being fireproof as the government wanted to save money (they saved £300000 by using the non-fireproof cladding) but in fact what they did is now drastically lose money and as all of the 200+ towerblock tested didn't have fireproof cladding. also they didn't have a sprinkler system which lead to the fire spreading more and they didn't have a building fire alarm they were only in the individual flats now those who were affected have been told that after 3 weeks they would all be offered a home in the area only 12 have been moved in because they weren't in the area so the children couldn't get to school or the parents get to work. the insulation inside the building had cyanide in so people also died due to that burning and them breathing it in. I also want to add that one of the reasons why hey couldn't put out the fire quickly is because the equipment was only able to read the first 14 floors so that's 10 floors what could not be reached and they got there so fast was because it was in London (the capital) if it happened somewhere away 1 they wouldn't have equipment to reach even 14 floors and it would have taken longer to get there and there would be a lot fewer services such as the police ambulances and firemen to go there. On my final note on this, they say that they will still be looking for bodies in the tower in 2018 and everyone who lost someone in Grenfell my heart goes out to you. <3And when Phil said that love those who you have when you have them it reminded me of when I found out about Grenfell I woke up to get ready for school and last minute revision for my science GCSE because my dad was in hospital and for something in the background I turned on the news show I watch every morning and here were still alive people trapped inside and there was still a fair bit of fire still left.",8년 전,0,

@silversnake4133,"I'm glad they got this guy and that he'll be doing a lot of hard time for the absolutely disgusting shit he manipulated these girls into doing, but seriously, this is a two way street here, and I really don't think those girls should just be written off as unsuspecting, innocent angels. These two girls are teenagers, therefore I would have hoped that somewhere along the way they would have stopped and at least thought, ""why is he requesting these things?"", ""this seems really weird and strange to me"", or maybe even a ""this feels wrong"" and most importantly ""should I really be doing this?"". After all, these girls had to consciously record, ""perform"" and send these videos to this guy, so they obviously knew what they were doing and they were participating willingly.  If these kids were under the age of 10, I could understand them not really comprehending the gravity of the situation, but in total fairness, I think those two 14 year old girls should get some kind of reprimanding too. I know I'm probably going to get hate for this way of thinking, but honestly unless the victim was completely and totally unaware of what was happening and/or could not in any way/shape/form consent to what was happening to them, both sides of the equation need reprimanding (ban the girls from accessing the Internet at home for a while, take away their phones, do something to bring home the fact that what they contributed to was wrong and that their actions will have consequences). Just because they're ""minors"" should not get them off the hook. They're old enough to know better.",8년 전,0,

You can teach a human anything, including to understand the full effects of their actions and also to love humanity. But over 30% of his life gone? Will rotting really help someone all of a sudden love society? This gives the jury no good option. I wonder if making the punishment the middle ground on what the jury collectively decides and on what the judge decides is a better way to have the system run. Then you can have justice served for just the case at hand, rather than pulling numbers out of their asses so they can cum once the mallet comes down.  Now on to the bigger picture.  You know what? We're using logic to judge emotion. That's fully incorrect. That's not how you think about the pain and suffering of being manipulated, or even the emotions that brought the criminal to do crime. If you haven't noticed, the court system is incapable of judging cases that have to do with the second half of the human mind: emotions. It's an entirely different realm.  There's a term in the software world where the system is created in such a way that its unsustainable and not yet fixed: technical debt. You'd think that a system that deals closely with people would be edited every day until they get it right. These people do not know how to maintain a system. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I'm just saying. Shit's fucked.",8년 전,26,

@candyflossfluff9267,"Paedophiles are opportunistic offenders, They are unlikely to abstain from sex with a minor for their entire lives. Even if they didn't physically harm a child they will most likely view child porn on the internet. This is offending against and supporting the sexual abuse of a child. My cousin sexually abused me in his teenage years and later got arrested and put in jail for possession of child porn when he was twenty one. I was 13 when he got put away. I will never tell my family or the police what he did to me because it would destroy my mum. If he took the opportunity to sexually abuse me in his teenage years, I find it absolutely ridiculous to believe that paedophiles will never directly or indirectly abuse a child over their 70+ years on this earth.",8년 전,1,
@briciolaa,"Okay, you're saying that pedophiles are inherently child molesters because if they act out their sexual urges it's illegal and that makes them immediately a child molester. Now, I would never try to defend abuse, but here is my argument. It's in every human being to act to sexual urges, as you said is unlikely that a pedophile, without any treatment, would be able to restrain themselves all their life, but that doesn't necessarily make them inherent child molesters. The point is, if a pedophile acts out their sexual urges, the way other people would, by watching porn or having sex, it's illegal. I'm not saying the repression of said urges wouldnt lead to molestation, abuse, rape, but not all pedophiles want to hurt people. One can find out about their condition and be terrified because they actually dont want to cause children any harm. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?mcubz=3 I'm linking an article since i don't have much time to talk.

""In popular usage, the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse. This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse, and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors. Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse are sometimes pedophiles, child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, and some pedophiles do not molest children.""",7년 전(수정됨),0,

The internet is a dangerous place would you feel comfortable giving your 14 year old their own phone where they can do whatever they want on it and you’d never find out? At that age kids like to follow trends so they can become popular and some of the trends are disgusting and inappropriate for kids. I’m not saying all kids are like that but most are. This person in particular sounds mature so it’s probably not a problem but there are many out there who are not. Even if teenagers are mature and have good intentions they are still very naive and can be manipulated unknowingly this this disgusting “man” in the video did.,7년 전,0,

This is not only humiliating but also mentally damaging, as a person who was incapable of understanding the lasting impact of her actions trusted someone who groomed that person to get what he wanted out of her. This didn't just happen to one child, but several. If you want to post anything on here, especially when it's concerning child victims, at least educate yourself on neuroscience and the developmental differences between a child and an adult, seeing as though the frontal lobe, the part of the brain in charge of judgement, is not even fully developed until around 25-26 years of age.",8년 전,4,

@nexusclarum8000,"""Estimating Gender Disparities in Federal Criminal Cases""  ""University of Michigan Law and Economics Research Paper, No. 12-018""  ""This paper assesses gender disparities in federal criminal cases. It finds large gender gaps favoring women throughout the sentence length distribution (averaging over 60%), conditional on arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge observables. Female arrestees are also significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions entirely, and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted. Prior studies have reported much smaller sentence gaps because they have ignored the role of charging, plea-bargaining, and sentencing fact-finding in producing sentences. Most studies control for endogenous severity measures that result from these earlier discretionary processes and use samples that have been winnowed by them. I avoid these problems by using a linked dataset tracing cases from arrest through sentencing. Using decomposition methods, I show that most sentence disparity arises from decisions at the earlier stages, and use the rich data to investigate causal theories for these gender gaps. """,8년 전,2,

If I think about myself when I was 14, I think that with the right amount of manipulation and adoration for a public figure I could have fallen for it as well. It's something that could happen to a lot of girls (and boys for that matter) and it's important to note that the victims in these cases are not to blame for anything.   Now about the women thing. I do agree female pedophilia is often more neglected and taken less seriously than male pedophilia. However, I think to bring that up in this context is not right.

The reason we've chosen to outlaw this kind of activity has most to do with the fact that generally females are simply not emotionally prepared for sexual activity at ages of fifteen and younger.

Because its only 8 years, and im a kid so i shouldnt be punished. No. Wrong. No one should have child porn. In fact, when teens are found to have it, they get in trouble.

The teens arent trying to get 10 year olds to snapchat their pussies, most teens want to see nude teens or older.  I fully support his sentence.

It was the impact that they have. Our life is a rock that we throw into a lake and the impact those have are those ripples and those ripples, of course, for all of us will go away and this death reminds me that the most you can really hope for is to get a big fucking rock and David did.

VH1 had nothing but praise for Jimmy Page—the guitarist of Led Zeppelin—who showed Cassandra Peterson his penis at a hotel in Colorado when Jimmy was older than Austin is today and Cassandra was no older than 15. She was not of the age of consent in that state.  Page was still with the Yardbirds and the very last time that band ever played anywhere near Colorado Springs—where Cassandra, who would later become famous as the buxom ""Elvira"", was attending high school—was in July of 1967. Cassandra wouldn't turn 16 until that September.  —>> ""VH1's Let's Spend The Night Together"" (YouTube search)  So again: What's with the hatred for Austin Jones?

He's a piece of shit for manipulating them and regardless of them sending him stuff or not he should go to jail. But the fact that they sent the material to him there has to be some sort of dialogue between school officials and 12-15 year olds about what an adult can or cannot ask them to do and they have to make it abundantly clear that it's wrong and when it happens they must tell someone.

But you really can't be more clear. It's sad that people will try to twist that into him doing nothing wrong and what's worse is most likely the girls won't think it's wrong for a while either. What people don't understand is THIS is what most rape and sexual abuse looks like. No one is forcing​, they are decieving. To those normalizing their age, you have an iffy case if they are 16/17 but it's not about a number it's about knowledge and maturity. He told one girl she was lucky because they shouldn't be talking because of how young she was. You really can't be more blatant. Those 2 will probably believe it's their fault for a long time and worse have other people tell them that too. I hate to give a monster like this credit but at least he's not a coward like my abuser. He's directly admitting to this crime but take it right back because if said this that easily I bet he is trying to make it sound normal and like he did nothing wrong as well. Mature girls may. come out but probably not. The sad part is, A sexual abusers most dedicated defender is usually the victim though over time they can accept what's wrong and where the fault lies. This is disgusting but I also hope it's a kind of wake up call. At least they were old enough to know about sex. Just not mature enough to recognize the manipulation.

@skittlesmash,"14-year-olds are extremely easily manipulated. Extremely. When I was 14, I used to go on this site Bebo with friends, it was kind of nerdy, we were roleplaying and having fun with it. But the place was full of pedos. So many 20+-year-old guys. I ended up dating a guy who was 21 at the time, and we dated for 5 months. Within that 5 months, he had asked for nudes. I at first said no...But then he would use the good old lines "" if you loved me you would"" "" don't you trust me?"" the conversations would get hostile, aggressive, I feared him dumping me because I thought this guy was the love of my life and when I was 18 I would move to where he lived ( Scotland) and live happily ever after. So... I gave him what he wanted. The relationship was full of mind games, attacking me for the mistakes I made - mistakes every teenager makes in their life. I finally broke up with him, but he logged into my account ( he got my password out of me as well) and was jealous of the guys talking to me so he made a fake account of me, added all of the friends and family from my REAL account ( I had a role play one and real one and he had both). Posted them on my one. My brother saw....I haven o idea if my cousins or other family members saw as they never spoke to me about it. It was horrible. I was only 14. I felt like my life, my reputation was over. I am now almost 24, when I was 21 I fully realised the extent of what happened to me. That I was a victim of a pedophile...because when I look at 14-year-olds, I don't see them in any sexual way, they are too young, they are children in comparison, they are more immature. I remember in my later adolescence I was talking to people younger than me, but then when I turned 18 I felt wrong to talk to them, so I stopped. So when people try to claim that 14-year-olds are old enough to decide who they can date, regardless of age. I strongly disagree, the person you are at 14 is completely different from the person you are when you reach 15, 16, 17, 20, 25 - between these years I saw myself completely change in attitude every year. I changed my mind and opinions a billion times. I was highly emotional, impressionable - AND I WAS CONSIDERED MATURE FOR MY AGE. To date an adult, who already has set beliefs, opinions, they know who they are, they are set in their mind, to date an impressionable kid who is still learning, still trying to understand things in their own way, already influenced my so many adults trying to mold them, I think that is wrong. I think it's about power and control, it turns them on to be able to control and manipulate these girls because they are the easiest to manipulate. I hope what I say and this story helps spread awareness to young girls... Don't let anyone manipulate you. Red flags; if you __(love, trusted) me you would"", threats to dump you, any form of threat, "" you're different to other girls"", any comparison to other girls at all - healthy relationships don't revolve around comparing each other to other people or exes. If you are under the age of consent - any question to ask for nudes is a red flag, especially if they know your age.",8년 전,0,

@KaitharVideo,"Thing is... tower blocks shouldn't EVER burn like this.  They're made of concrete boxes, they're supposed to have fire protection.  That tower, on the other hand, burnt like a candle.  The cladding is not only flammable but actually produced Hydrogen Cyanide gas as it sped up the speed of the fire.  The news is basically that not only will we probably have not have a real fatality count by the end of the year (it's currently at something like 80 people) but testing has found more of these lethal tower blocks around the country... a lot more.  Given that they were at 97 last I heard, and that's after only a few days of testing, I'm guessing the number is going to hit 200 without too much effort. Large scale blazes are always terrible events, what makes this one so bad is that it shouldn't have been possible, could easily have been prevented at many points over a period of years, cost such a large percentage of the residents their lives, and happened in a building where housing was prioritised for poor and disabled families.  The reporting of this fire isn't so loud because of bias against Portugal, it's so loud because every time you think it couldn't get more horrifying they announce some new detail.  And at the bottom of this horrible pit is one or more people who made these decisions, such as picking that particular (and known to be highly toxic) material to cover the building, because they were the cheapest and thus most profitable.",8년 전,25,

@katie6384,"Although I agree that the Portuguese fire was also an absolute tragedy, it was not bigger than the London fire. The confirmed death toll for the London fire is so low because the fire burnt for such a long time that there is very little left of many of the bodies. I think the final death toll for the Portuguese fire was mid 60s but for Grenfell it's over 80 and expected to be much higher. The met have said they don't think they will know the true figure by the end of this year because some people are literally just ash now.",8년 전,5,
@maya-lily9514,Some of my family live in Portugal and we're near the fire and the same for those of my family that live in London. It was a difficult day and both have suffered. It's not a competition of who got hurt more. I was so upset that less coverage was shown of Portugal and upset of every bit of footage I saw of London. Same effect different place. The big deal was made in London because it happened soon after the general election and showed the lack of government control in the country,8년 전,5,

@katie6384,"I didn't mean to make it sound like a competition - I've just personally seen a lot of people confused about the true number of casualties of the Grenfell tower. A lot of people have been saying it was 12, I've heard some people say 60s where as the reality is 80s and expected to rise. The reason I think it's significant that people know the true value of deaths is because 1. it's obviously important to remember the true destructiveness of this fire and how many families have been torn apart by this and 2. because it shows how poor the evacuation procedures are in buildings like this. This building, along with thousands of other apartment blocks around the world have a ""stay inside"" fire policy which contributed to many people not evacuating when they had the chance. Many residents also claimed they didn't wake up to fire alarms going off, they were too quiet - they woke up to the smell of smoke, the heat, the sirens outside, etc. The number of people Grenfell fire claimed shows us extreme safety issues around the world right now. I personally don't think the coverage was so intense because of the recent election - I think it has more to do with how easily this could happen again, the potential past failings of the government and regulators, the huge problem it now poses of rehousing people in an area with very little housing anyway as well as the obvious visual dramatic impact.",8년 전,1,
@AlexTheGardner,"Being from the UK I did know about the horrific natural disaster that occurred in Portugal and received information on it from the News as well as via social media. It is tragic and as me and my family visit Portugal pretty much every year, hearing about this definitely hit closer to me than probably most people in the UK. As someone else mentioned the difference is that Grenfell was preventable however loss of life is something that I think should not be compared based on numbers etc. Both should be mourned equally. London is seen as ""more important"" for reasons unknown and tbh from what I've seen most Americans can't even name more than 3 European countries let alone where they are and the news that comes out of them so I suppose we shouldn't expect for them to be broadcasting news from these smaller less populated (beautiful) countries. Hopefully one day all that will change!",8년 전,2,
@MsInesSantos,"garmanoplays coming from a portuguese person, i appreciate the fact you brought attention to my country's matter, but ours is neither more or less important than the UK situation. they're both horrible situations, many lives were lost, many people are still hurting. let's not make a fuss about who hurt more or which tragedy turned out to be the worst because both situations have their own horribly consequences, for the victims and respective countries. (people died, people lost their houses, jobs, their only source of food, all their stuff, people were burn to dust & much more). let's help each other and try to avoid any of this from ever happening again, cause we all know both could be very well avoidable. my condolences for the victims of both tragedies.",8년 전,13,

@julianna4898,"I had to do a research paper on pedophilia once. I remember while researching that some experts believe that it starts in childhood. When your child begins to show signs of unusual sexual behavior you should get them help as soon as possible. The faster they begin therapy, the easier their life will be. There is no cure and many pedophiles are too ashamed to seek help so they suffer on their own. We have to keep in mind that mental illness doesn't excuse the behavior, society runs on morals and rules. However, these people saying these awful things about how he should be raped, their actions are inexcusable. Pedophiles tend to be manipulative and impulsive. Their brains don't work the same way as a person with typical sexual attraction. I do hope Austin Jones serves his time and they find a way to help him cope with his abnormal sexual urges towards prepubescent girls. Those girls didn't deserve what happened to them and I hope they aren't too emotionally damaged by this horrific situation. We all just need to remember that we're all still human. Some humans are just extremely different in the head and right/wrong doesn't register the same in their minds. However, like I said, that doesn't excuse the behavior.",8년 전,5,

Now once again, I am not in anyway defending Austin or any pedophile who has abused children, I'm just pointing out that there is a difference between having urges and acting on them. People who do have those are sick and it's should be treated with the same level that we treat physical illnesses like cancer, colds, stds, etc. We need to focus on getting people help before they do these terrible things rather than continuing this stigma against mental illnesses which only causes the chance of people acting on them to rise. Now I am 18 and have a 15 year old sister. If I found out that someone was pursing her in an inappropriate way I would automatically get authorities involved but hold what humanity and sympathy I have close to my heart and advocate for rehabilitation rather than imprisonment, whereas if someone put their hands on my sister or manipulated her online like the case we are discussing, then yes, they deserve to be punished. In Austin's case he knew exactly what he was doing, never seeked help to my knowledge and used sick forms of manipulation due to his status. That being said, he IS sick and his fame and success probably doesn't help that, changing the way he views himself and the world and while he is 10 years older than his victims, he is 24 and still relatively young and therefore should receive 15 years rather than 30, giving him the opportunity to get out at the age of 39 and be mandated to seek psychological help, rather than getting out at the age of 54 and possibly reverting back to his old ways.",8년 전,13,

I didn't know this had happened, I didn't even know who this guy was but I just wanna chime in to add that I was a victim of this kind of abuse as a child, but I was much younger at only 4 years old. From what I know, regardless of age, abuse leaves a lot of damage in its wake, that children and teens have to deal with for decades afterwards. I know because I have PTSD. This idiot makes me absolutely sick to my stomach. Actually, I probably shouldn't have even watched this but then again, I thought I should speak up for parents out there. My situation didn't take place during the digital age, but I'm horrified to imagine just how much easier it is for predators to get in contact with young girls (and boys) now. Parent's, please take extra precaution with your children's use of the internet, in general. Please encourage open conversation and always listen to what they have to say. If someone had listened to me and validated my feelings, I doubt I would be in half as much trouble as I am in now. Protect your children at all costs.",8년 전,0,

Just because the privilege may have been earned (such as a phone) doesn't mean the child is mature or wise enough to possess the conscious ability to make smart decisions based on the influence they're watching.

That's why they tend to go for older, or the jerk aholes.  Those guys seem more likely to be able to provide and protect, and also seem more mature to match what they want.

A huge part of the reason why children were married off and having kids that young at 12 and 13 back in the day is because human being's life span was over at 35-40 years old, due to poor and/or lack of medications, antibiotics, sanitary everything lol. People wanted to have large families fast and young girls were less likely to die during childbirth. Now the human lifespan is 80-100+ and modern medicine has done wonders, people can wait",8년 전,28,
@pluckyduck11y,"Infant mortality was the main reason the average lifespan was so short historically. Average life spans have almost doubled since the dark ages, but again, this is mainly due to infant mortality rates declining significantly. It's not like the average adult back then would just die around 35-40. Most could make it into 50s or 60s. They just had to survive infancy.  But as for your suggestion that longer lifespans mean ""people can wait"" - GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. lol Horniness isn't waiting for anything, and biological impulse hasn't changed. Our cultural values have shifted a lot, but biology is still at odds with culture. Did you know that studies among men from around the world show that their ""ideal"" age of a female is 15? In many regions of the world, it's 14. And this is just the average. What this means is that billions of men around the world think the ideal range is between 13-17. They don't care about medicine or life spans or sanitation. This is dictated by biology. I know it probably comes as a huge shock to you. It did to me. I find this really bizarre personally, as I would have expected the ideal age to be at least in the early 20s. I like curves, and like many others, I like MILFs, but it is well established that ""teens"" is a huge popular genre in porn. It's usually in the top 5 categories along with ""anal"" - another thing I simply do not prefer. But it is definitely important to understand what is behind guys like this Jones creep. If you take the issue seriously, then it behooves you to learn just how common his urge/interest is. Also, I don't really get why so many people think he should be raped in prison forever for this. Did I miss some part of the story where he raped someone? At the risk of sounding like an apologist for him, I really just don't get the reactions. He's facing more time than he would if he had killed someone. Doesn't this seem kind of weird? People have been convicted of murder and gotten 25 years.  He didn't murder anyone. He didn't commit negligent homicide or manslaughter. He didn't rape anyone. He didn't even touch anyone. He manipulated some fans into showing him their buttholes. There need to be consequences for this, but reading a lot of the comments in here suggests a sickening psychopathy among outrage addicts.  It almost seems like many people here are disappointed he didn't rape those girls, because that's what they really want to justify their own projected prison rape fantasies onto him.  You can call me a bleeding heart liberal, but I don't support the death penalty as so many here evidently do. I don't even believe in an eye for an eye. But for argument's sake, I will grant an eye for an eye as befitting punishment of a rapist. Suppose a perpetrator raped someone, then he should be raped by this reasoning, right? We can see countless comments in here wishing that this guy be raped in prison for 30 years or life. But even by resorting to such a savage stone age law as eye-for-an-eye, this still would unjustifiably draconian, because did he actually rape anyone? He didn't even touch anyone!  What am I missing here?",8년 전,4,

And that is exactly the problem. These teens and young adults are like hey 'no big deal' it's just a good time. The reason it's such a big deal and crime is because it is NOT healthy to treat something, that elicits a huge cascade of hormones towards intimacy, like its a round of football with your mates!! Most kids don't have the maturity to be exposed to sexual material until their mid/late teens (even then it can be a gamble). Their frontal lobes are simply not there yet to understand and take control of the endocrine reaction. But a pedophile would LOVE for your child to be groomed into thinking it's totally no big deal.

You must be from a state where tweens never menstruate and teens under 18 are all mentally unfit for critical thinking and self-control.      If there's nothing wrong with a girl being a slut and getting condoms at school to have ACTUAL SEX with, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with adult men educating such slutty girls at an early age about what horny boys really expect from sluts who like to twerk. It was more than those girls thought it would be and they were surprised. That's called extracurricular sex ed.      Men always demand more from sluts, so girls being taught to be sluts need to learn this when they're young. They need to get used to meeting such demands. Look into gonzo porn!     This was a harmless sexy-dancing class for budding sex puppets. Nothing wrong with it!

@AnarchistHamster,"You seem to be preoccupied with statutory consent & the psychological ability to consent, which is missing the point that irregardless of that, pornographic images of minors cannot exist, & cannot be asked to be made. He solicited them, PRESSURED them, & guilt tripped them. The specific individuals whose messages were read during this video clearly weren't sexually motivated: First they looked up to him, then they had their admiration manipulated into a sexual display. If a girl initiated such & showed her private parts she would be breaking the law, & yes minors have been arrested for this. And if an adult saves such an image they are guilty irregardless of whether they solicited it. This is the order of things; the minors will, agency, & judgment are overruled until they are of age, by governance that pressures more ethical behavior, & requires all adults not to lead them into behavior too unethical.      The 2nd point I take away from what you said is that (if you will allow me to rephrase) ""What is OK for an adult is OK for an adolescent."" IT IS NOT OK FOR AN ADULT. We merely do not ENFORCE morality on adults to the same extent. You brought up this groupie stuff that has no value to exist, but society allows out of a live & let live stance. I do not interfere with you mostly so that you will not interfere with me. This is the way among adults in our culture: we are free to indulge vice. We couldn't be a democracy & pursue a single value system. This isn't Saudi Arabia, and I'm not going to dictate social behavior. But teenagers receive special protection in our system, & I am even bitter about having lived under that protection, but it is what it is. Despicable behavior that is permitted among adults often isn't permitted for minors. Also free condoms aren't a go ahead, they are mitigating the harms of amorality.      The final thing I put off: I am aghast by the phrase ""raised to be sluts."" If such a thing exists then I wish to annihilate it entirely, wipe out all such, exterminate anything like it! It may not exist, that there is any human being who is raised to intentionally have their life oriented around sex, and I don't care how tyrannical I get in opposing it! I say this as an atheist, it is evil to say to a girl that your main value is to sexually serve. All human life should be guided toward more purpose than just sex.

@AnarchistHamster,"@happy stancetwoable @B.E.T. YESWECAN I'm surprised that anyone would try to play copyright into this even the slightest bit. How could someone think copyright is so important, did you grow up from just watching internet videos? This sounds like a kid trying to imagine a superpower to beat another kid's imagined superpower. Rather than react to every angle on which you get copyright wrong, I'm going to focus on it's irrelevance: copyright is a matter of Civil Law, sexual offenses are a matter of Criminal Law (except I think harassment, I believe that's Civil Law.) Criminal Law eclipses Civil Law; mention copyright in a Criminal Court & I won't be surprised if the judge laughs at you. They are separate systems with different case law, precedent, & standards of evidence. That's why you hear about someone getting found not guilty in Criminal Court, but for the same matter they are ordered to pay $100k in a Civil Law suit. Mere possession is a question that will be asked by this Court, & whether he asked for it is a question that will be asked by this court. Even the worst part of this case, coercion, will effect his sentencing, not be questioned for whether he is guilty. Only asking for it & possessing it will be processed. You 2 seem preoccupied with the broader issue of teen sexuality. This bores me. I only want to bother speaking about this case, yet you bring into this preconceptions of what happened in a case where their dialogue is to the contrary. If they were clothed (at least a bikini or normal underwear) then it wouldn't be illegal. If the minors did this without him requesting nudity, or saving the images, then he would have a strong defense. Or if these were voluntary acts of eager horndogs (even though it would be illegal) then I would be too indifferent, call everyone involved trash, & not bother engaging in YouTube comments of all the lame places, that will dead end eventually. That is not this case, Austin pressured their feelings, they were guilt tripped, they felt twisted into doing acts they didn't seek, & afterward didn't feel any status increase but instead felt used, because they were. They didn't mean anything to him aside from interchangeable jack off material. If they were 40 he'd still be amoral, but the law protects adolescents so now he's a criminal, & anyone who would milk a 14 year old for anything they can be made to do deserves the sex offender registry. I think I should clear up some assumptions that may have been made about me. I would only ever use the word pedophile when the subject is prepubescence. That takes a whole other level of condemnation. I have no shame about finding a teen sexy, I'm just comfortable with the fact that I like 20 somethings the most. Embarrassment to strangers sure, but not shame. Less development less interest, more development more interest, that's not zero attraction, that's inferior appeal. Why would anyone get interested in someone that doesn't look full grown? Normally, the answer is because they are peers. Being at a similar place in life, direct relatability makes up for a short fall of sexiness. Give them 5 years & they will only be hotter & have more understanding of life, which adults need to be able to make up for coming from different places in life. There is nothing healthy about an adult preferring in between features. Fetishizing age like Austin did is freaky; he was directly excited by their age. I can part way relate by imagining being excited about 18, but it's still bizarre the way he puts emphasis on it. Perhaps he's excited by the forbidden, underage, taboo quality of it, it doesn't matter, it's how he used them that is the problem.  I don't care about someone else getting away with foal behavior, I don't care about these laws being more weakly enforced in the 70's, & I don't pretend that middle schoolers don't have the same sexual urges. This is about a case where morality which needs to be enforced to protect those new to these urges from unethical behavior that belittles their value as a person, at a time when they are sensitive to internalizing low self worth. Low value such as idolizing another so much that their identity as a fan can be made hostage.",8년 전,0,

For truly safe sex, the quality of the sex partner is even more important than the quality of any latex, diaphragms or pills being handed out to horny teens in the public schools.     If kids are going to have sex anyway, it is disgusting to legally deny them access to the highest quality of sex partners i.e. adults who can bring some maturity, responsibility and safe-sex habits to the hotel room.     If kids need adult partners for a training period when learning to drive or shoot a gun, they need adult sex partners for a training period as well until safe sex habits and safe instincts are developed. Having sex for the first time is no less emotionally discombobulating than shooting a gun for the first time.

@Justicar333,"@ Pampered You have a point, though you could have phrased it much better.  I've never understood why teens who are sexually active should be taboo.  The fact even in our own country the various states have varied ages concerning when it is and is not legal for them to have an adult partner shows the whole thing is subjective despite what the witch hunt tries to pretend.  They are literally trying to force teens to have no chance of a partner who can actually take some responsibility or bring some time won wisdom to the relationship.  I suspect this is more to keep the teens in their status of having no rights here.  A teen can't speak up legally when their pushed around.  But an adult partner could speak up for them in a court.  Can't have the property getting a voice.  That's something that's changed over time.  Used to be teens were not treated this way and could work and take on responsibility far earlier.

I would meet people on different websites(like Neopets) and then chat with them on instant messenger (some of us remember this right?) Well there was this older guy I started talking to who was ""in search for a model"" and he asked me to send him a bunch of pictures of me practically naked. I remember telling him I felt uncomfortable and he said ""what you don't want to be a model? I just want to see what you look like and tell you what you need to work on!"" He was so manipulative and i gave in, thinking that he was actually a nice person. But it escalated from there and he would get mad at me for not going online (when i had HOMEWORK or other 13 year old girl things going on). And he started making me feel bad, he would always ask for photos and then try to ""critique"" them and tell me what i could do to improve my body. It literally disgusts me remembering how I felt and I wish I could go back and help myself.
