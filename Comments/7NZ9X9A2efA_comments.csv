And now I know, you probably dislike America. Which I understand, envy is a natural result of being #1. Number 1 in what, I hear you say? Number 1 in military spending. I think we spent like 800 billion last year or the year before on the military, which amounted to 40% of total global military spending. Now, do I think that's a good thing? No. I think we have other pressing issues to address. That does not negate that the US military is the mightiest in the world. The US military (and economy) is so strong, that we have had to save Europe's dainty ass twice. Even now the US has had to spend billions on Ukraine because Europe alone could not muster the resources required to push back against Russia. Now in Israel, the US has had to spend millions in aid to both Israel and Palestine. So you see my friend, the US is still number 1 in several metrics, and that pisses you off...I'm sorry. Facts are facts. Before you go there, I know the US lags in several other metrics globally, such as literacy, math comprehension, etc. We are probably #1 in obesity. All that may be true, but still, it doesn't negate that if the US truly wanted to, it could obliterate whatever country you're from. It would never happen because we're allies.

@fromnorway643,"The fighter's top speed is far less important than its acceleration in this context as long as its top speed is several times higher than the Bugatti's. Maximum acceleration in level flight or on a runway is limited by the fighter's thrust-to-weight ratio, and that's the following for these fighters, assuming full internal fuel tanks but zero external load:  Eurofighter:   1.13 F-22A:            1.14 F-16C:            1.14 F-15C:            1.14 F-4E:               0.82 F-104G:          0.78  Forget the Phantom and the Starfighter as their initial acceleration would be about 30 % less than that of the Eurofighter. The F-22, F-15 and F-16 are a much better match.",4년 전,0,
@olliebtw9433, @fromnorway643  why? Just why?,4년 전,0,
@fromnorway643," @olliebtw9433   Because of Newton's second law: F = m x a  Rearrange that equation and you get a = F/m where a is the acceleration in metres per second squared, F is the force or thrust in newtons and m is the mass in kg.  If the fighter's thrust measured in kiloponds (= 9.807 N) or pound force (= 4.448 N) is divided by its mass in kg or pound mass respectively, you get its thrust/mass ratio. If opposing forces like air resistance are minimal, the fighter's thrust/mass ratio will equal its maximum acceleration in g's. (I'm talking about linear acceleration here, not the multiple g's pulled in sharp turns)  As you saw in this race, the Bugatti pulled away from the Eurofighter at first because of its higher initial acceleration, but that acceleration slowed down when it was approaching its top speed while the Eurofighter just kept accelerating and overtook the Bugatti.  Any aircraft with a higher top speed would eventually overtake the Bugatti if the race was long enough and in a more or less straight line. However, with a ~30 % lower acceleration than the Eurofighter, it's very unlikely that a Phantom or a Starfighter would be able to overtake the Bugatti in time and turn fast enough to win this race, especially since the Eurofighter didn't exactly win with a gigantic margin. If this race had been only half as long as it was, the Bugatti may well have beaten the Eurofighter.",4년 전,0,
@olliebtw9433, @fromnorway643  they y not just chuck an f-82 to in there? Much faster acceleration cuz… well it’s a prop and a pretty decent top speed and better manoeuvrability because… well it’s a prop.,4년 전,0,
@fromnorway643," @olliebtw9433   A piston-powered aircraft competing with modern jet fighters? I don't think so! The power of a piston engine or turboprop measured in horsepower doesn't really tell us much about its ""thrust"", so I carefully measured the acceleration of this P-51 Mustang during the first part of its take-off, and found that it was slightly less than 0.4 g – about half of the theoretical maximum of a Starfighter and even less compared to the Eurofighter and other modern fighters. https://youtu.be/l4RBBrDsPgg I couldn't find good enough take-off footage of an F-82 Twin Mustang, but it's unlikely that its acceleration would be very different from that of an ordinary Mustang. The acceleration of a Mustang / Twin Mustang is in fact more comparable to that of a lightly loaded Boeing 737 or similar passenger jet. BTW, until your last comment, I didn't even know about the Twin Mustang! 😁",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@ZeljkoSerdar,"It’s finally official. Rimac, the Croatian electric hypercar start-up, will take control of Volkswagen’s Bugatti brand in a deal that cements its position as an established automotive force.  The new company will be called Bugatti Rimac and be led by Mate Rimac, who founded the eponymous group in 2009 in his garage and has grown it to become one of the industry’s most called-upon technology providers.  The company’s electric and battery systems have found their way into cars from Aston Martin and Pininfarina to Jaguar, and the racing arm of VW’s Seat brand.  Being controlled by an electric specialist is also a major departure for Bugatti, which markets its hypercars on 16-cylinder engines and guttural tones.  However, the advent of battery technology has led to speeds that even the most highly-tuned combustion vehicles struggle to match: the upcoming Rimac Nevera is expected to be the fastest model ever built, a title previously held by the Bugatti Chiron.  Both Bugatti and Rimac will continue developing their brands, and while Bugatti’s production will remain in France, all of its research will move into Rimac’s new headquarters in Croatia.",4년 전,1,

For me in conclusion comparing these is like comparing a A-10 vs a SU-27 sure the A-10 would lose every 1 on 1 fight but that dosent make the A-10 a bad Plane it has a different job than the Su-27 and so have the EF-2000 and the F-22.",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@lachyt5247," @lunaticeagle3007  Your assessment of the F22 is hilariously bad. Typhoon is going to get toasted any day of the week, F22 can out rate it, out power it, out alpha it with its vectored thrust, has a far smaller cross section and carries the most advanced high off bore-sight missiles in the world.",4년 전,1,
@joebennett9422," @lachyt5247  At that rate it requires more than just statistics to determine the winner. These vehicles have both only encountered combat against older aircraft. The fight is essentially unwinnable by both aircraft. The Typhoon will need to absolutely blast the engines to kingdom come to utilise it's advantage of speed however the F22 will need to unleash its missile arsenal which due to the Typhoon's ungodly speed, the F22 will have to floor it as well meaning the missile launch will not be possible at that high speed. Another thing about the speed is that to win the fight, the pilots must essentially commit suicide as all those G-forces would definitely turn them to soup. In order for the Raptor to fire it's awesome missile arsenal, it must kill speed which essentially achieves a loss as the Typhoon would definitely escape in that small window of time. That being said, the Typhoon has 100% chance of winning if it runs away but I'll count that as a forfeit and a draw as both aircraft are intact. Now, what if the Typhoon were to turn around and fight the F22, things would be more unpredictable. Yes, the Typhoon has a great design allowing for tighter turns due to the strange position of the elevators. This seemingly gives the Typhoon the edge but the F22 is trumped statistically in that manner but the F22 can counter this with more gadgets instead of raw engine stats. The F22 has multiple countermeasures and tricks alongside radar resistance so an AIM-7 Sparrow is obsolete. In order for the Typhoon or the F22 to win, again, as I said before, the pilots will experience like 30-50 G's and die nearly instantly. You do make a solid point but simply put, Neither can win for sure. It's all blind luck, circumstance and chance",4년 전,1,

@Ozzy.1881," @martinvandenberghe5656  Car brands usually belong to the country they were first established in, not the nationality of who founded it. Bugatti was founded in molsheim, GERMANY in 1909. The fact that that reigon was given to France after WW1 does not change that Bugatti is a German brand found by an Italian. If that doesn’t convince you enough, Bugatti was bought by the Germans and became a brand under the VolksWagen Group, who made the brand into what it is today. Even their best cars like the Chiron are developed in Germany by VolksWagen engineers and made in Molsheim because it was first found there. So Bugatti is German a hell of a lot more than it is French.",3년 전,1,

Where you go wrong is not knowing that the descriptor ""German"" is not about any specific country. These lands did not ""become"" German by the German Empire forming in 1871.  By the same logic the Italian lands of the middle ages were not Italian because they weren’t unified, which is obviously nonsense.",7개월 전,0,
@MN-vz8qm," @Icetea-2000  Look, your issue once more is that you are switching from a national to a cultural view at will. Here the debate was about french vs german in this case. Being French there doesn't mean was you think clearly, when French can mean corsican, breton, alsacian, occitan or basque (all of whom had their own language separate from French).

If you refuse to accept what the German cultural region is and try to splinter it into merely being Germanic, you’re disingenuously obfuscating reality.  Alsace was NOT merely Germanic. Why do you think Prussia was able to unite Germany how they did? German nationalism did not start under Prussia, and the German language did not have its origin in Prussia. The dialect that was decided as the ""standard German"" pronunciation came out of Hanover, a land which was directly opposed to Prussia in the German war of 1866.

@ioliteable,"He didn't say it was the most advanced plane. He said the most advanced strike fighter, the F-22 is not a strike fighter it is an air superiority fighter with a few other capabilities.",5년 전,0,
@Yabuddy53,"ioliteable well I get what you mean but if I’m not mistaken, the typhoon is intended for use as an interceptor, but the f22 has been used as a strike fighter many times against ground targets in the Middle East, all you have to do is reprogram the computers and change out the missiles and you’re good to go. However I will state I’m of course no expert of fighters, only the designers and pilots are, but I had read an article stating that was the typhoons intended purpose",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@ioliteable," @Yabuddy53  Yeah the Typhoon was designed and built as an air superiority fighter. I don't know why Hammond referred to it the way he did I'm guessing that's probably just what he was told by the pilot or air wing he was with, the people using them probably refer to them by the role they use them in as opposed the role they were designed for. The Typhoon is used much more often as a multi-role fighter as opposed to the F-22 because the US has large numbers of dedicated strike fighters. Whereas the RAF and other Typhoon operators have far fewer fighters (of any kind) than the US so they are more likely to re-purpose those they do have. You're right that the F-22 has been used for air-to-ground strikes, from my understanding of things it is still predominantly used for air-to-air operations whereas the Typhoon is (or used to be the F-35 is taking over in Britain at least) used equally for both and thus while designed as an air superiority fighter it has evolved into a multi-role fighter. Whilst the F-22 is still intended by the USAF to be primarily for air superiority but in a pinch can function for air-to-ground strikes.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@ioliteable," @Yabuddy53  Also I'm not saying he was correct the most advanced strike fighter more than 10 years ago is a fairly arguable topic, I was just being pedantic about your comparison.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@Yabuddy53,"ioliteable yes as a true multi role fighter as the typhoon appears to be used as, it was perhaps the most advanced until the f35 came out. Nice to have a discussion without name calling by the way haha. Hammond probably just said that to make it sound cooler if anything",5년 전,0,
@Sedna063,"„All you have to do is reprogram the computers and use different missiles“. Easier said than done. It costs several millions and takes years to implement new weaponry into an aircraft. The F22 is quite limited with ammunition unlike the EF.   Then, the EF has comparable or better flight stats than the F22. The F22 has probably a better avionics suite and the stealth aspect.",5년 전,0,
@Yabuddy53,"Sedna063 yes but the programming has already been done. Thrust vectoring for extreme agility and stealth is what will win, you can’t hit what you can’t see. I’m not hating on the typhoon, but if it were me, I’d rather take my chances in the plane with the radar signature of a marble if I had missiles flying at me.",5년 전,0,
@Sedna063,"Nelson Thrust vectoring does not mean much at high speeds, it actually can be bad because it reduces available engine power. The Eurofighter is extremely manoeuvrable without TV.   And then, the F22 has to hit the EF as well. Kinda hard aircraft to hit though.",5년 전,0,

@nikolicrastko9281,"Gentlemen, i sorry but i you are all wrong here, your speed assumptions are wrong. mach 2 is about 2400kph and that cannot be reached in such a short time especially in a 90 degree vertical climb but it was maybe going faster when it was going down, also if you didn't know what mach is, it is basically a counter for speed of sound, 1 mach is 1234 kph, 2 mach is double that. And all those comments about the X-15 i am gonna address, so basically the X-15 is a purpose made aircraft it cannot be used for anything else other than reaching its top speed, take the bloodhound for example the fastest land vehicle, it cannot be used for racing or anything else just for one thing going on a straight line and reaching its top speed at setting a world record, so that is the same case for the X-15 it cannot do such maneuvers like the eurofighter, it cannot be armed too, so the x-15 in practice it basically useless. Now to address the Sr-71 blackbird comments as well, basically Sr-71 is one of the fastest or the fastest planes that cannot be only used for setting speed records and are actually useful for some things, so in the cold war the Sr-71 played a big role in spying mission in Asia which leads us to the vietnam war and other things, sr-71 used its speed to outmaneuver guided missiles by going on a high altitude and then the missile would run out of fuel it'd miss the plane, so USA gathered a lot of information about bases in Asia.And eurofighter isn't the fastest, best or anything, it's basically just a normal fighter jet from the modern era like all others so it doesn't really matter if it's german, russian, british or american simply they all have one purpose and that is to leave nothing behind them.",4년 전,3,

@timothyparrucci809,"They don't exactly describe the Eurofighter accurately here. It is a pretty decent plane, but it's not a strike fighter, it's a multi-role fighter. The F22, for example, is a strike fighter. The Eurofighter lacks vectoring engines, which would allow it to do some insane manuevering. As for the most high-tech and advanced, that's just bullshit. That trophy belongs to the F22 and F35. The Eurofighter is the fastest between the aforementioned aircraft, but the F16 beats it in engine power, being able to break the sound barrier with just the afterburner and no help from diving. It's also extremely fast getting up to that speed. Also the Eurofighter's design of using unstable flight to it's advantage is both very smart and extremely retarded at the same time, seeing as how if it's hit by enemy fire, or one of its flight systems malfunctions, there's no saving it, whilst on other aircraft like the F35, F16, F/A-18, and especially A10, they have not only have designs that allow stable flight, they have countermeasures should those systems fail. The A10 and F35 being the most notable, with the A10 having one digital surface and flight control system, and having not one, but three backup surface and flight control systems that are all manual, and the F35 having similar. There's no doubt that the Eurofighter is a great aircraft, it's easily outclassed by other fighters",8년 전,0,

You can't fly any of these planes without the help of a flight control computer. The flight control computer in the Eurofighter has quadruple redundancy. If in either of these planes the flight control computer should totaly fail, they are lost. There is no way to save the aircraft because the pilots controls aren't conected to any mechanical system to control the plane. And by the way, the combined thrust of the engines the Eurofighter uses is considerably higher than the thrust values a F16E Block 60 can achieve.",8년 전,0,

The Veyron, with 1000hp & massive tire grip, is an absolute monster in ground hugging acceleration & breaking & turning.

Flares and IR-masking is getting less effective.  At some point, planes might be replaced entirely by missiles.

The Veyron has a combustion engine, and can be driven on the roads. The bloodhound due to its immense thrust would accelerate faster, but in relative standards the Veyron would be accelerate faster in terms of its size.

@predator-mx7zf,"Although a Royal Air Force Typhoon took part to the daily air display, the most interesting thing at Farnborough International Airshow 2012 was the opportunity to get some more details about the recent participation of the German Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons to the Red Flag.  In fact the last Red Flag-Alaska saw the first attendance by both the U.S. Air Force’s F-22 Raptors and German Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons.  As we have already reported, the Typhoons and the Raptor had the opportunity engage each other in dissimilar air combat training but only a part of the story about the outcome of the mock engagements has been reported so far: the one about the German commander saying that the F-22’s capabilities are “overwhelming,” a statement that, according to Eurofighter sources, was taken out of context.  Indeed, Typhoon pilots at Farnborough said that, when flying without their external fuel tanks, in the WVR (Within Visual Range) arena, the Eurofighter not only held its own, but proved to be better than the Raptor",9년 전,3,

@xfatsx1991,"+FS2K4Pilot I agree and like I said in my previous comments, I'm not stating the Typhoon is better but there has been some occasions where RAF pilots have locked onto Raptors 50+km away due to the engines heat source.  The Raptor is overhyped. No doubt it's the best jet around but it's not 100% stealthy as people think it is",10년 전,1,
@FS2K4Pilot,"+xfatsx1991 Nothing's 100% stealthy.  But bear in mind that Raptor pilots know that even Allied forces will attempt to get real data on its stealth characteristics and will take measures to obfuscate things.  They have deployable radar reflectors that deliberately screw up their stealthiness for precisely that purpose.  It would not be out of the question for them to come driving in with one or two stages of reheat engaged to augment its IR signature, and the speed brakes slightly deployed.  Also, for all we know, those tracks were acquired from behind the Raptor.  Also, I don't know anything for sure, but some time right around the Raptor's first Red Flag, the Aggressors started carrying CATM-9Xs and JHMCSs.  I know there are a number of other missiles with seekers just as advanced as the 9X, but if, and I stress IF, even the 9X couldn't see the F-22 from within visual range, then if I were a Raptor pilot, I'd be willing to take my chances (although it is discouraging to hear German Typhoon pilots talking about 'Raptor salad' being served up by their HOB-capable IRIS-Ts).  But then again, at 50 km, in a real war, the Raptors would already have put Slammers in the air.  Those shots could be cued using radar data from AWACS, other F-22s, the Raptor's own APG-77 (which some sources say can put out 12kW of radiated power if it has to.  Compare that to the 10kW from the fabled AWG-9/APG-71 used on the F-14 Tomcat.  If that figure is accurate, then the F-22 can detect another fighter at ranges well over 100nm/180km), or even its ALE-94 RWR.But this is all supposition.  You are 100% right that the Raptor isn't invincible, but it's better than most.",10년 전,0,
@irquy2488,"what to compare ? As the Russian SU-30 outmaches the eurofighter in terms such as speed, thrust, maneuverability, avionics and the abiliy to handle more stress. Exercise  Red flag proves that where the Indian Air Force using the SU-30MKI had a 9:1 kill ratio on RAFs Typhoons. As even some American simulations prove that a fleet of SU-30 family aircraft shot down an entire fleet of F-22s, F-18s and F-35s, but with some casualties. As new Russian fighters such as the SU-30, SU-35, SU-50 PAK FA and MIG-35 all having 3D TVC as even some old ones like the MIG-29 and the SU-27 have 3D TVC.

F22 would get decimated by Su35 in a dogfight, and possibly in missile combat as well, considering that Stealth technology is far from perfect. Remember how the state of the art F117 was downed by an ancient Soviet Surface to Air missile (the one that Soviet Union replaced with a more advanced one back in the 70s).

The F-35 isn't anything special just because of the VTOL it's capable of. The Harrier Jump Jet could do that and how old is that plane? In fact the Harrier can actually take off and land faster than the Eurofighter, F-22 and the F-35.",10년 전,1,
@FS2K4Pilot,"1 V 1 my a$$.  It never happens.  The F-22 will still see the Su-35 first.  It will be able to dictate the conditions of the engagement.  And if a Sidewinder II couldn't see it from a few miles right in front of the seeker head, the Archer has no chance.  The F-22 pilot will also be better trained, and more experienced.  The F-22's cockpit and computers are also more advanced, so the F-22 pilot will be better able to fly and fight his aircraft to the ragged edge of the envelope.  And forget that F-117.  That was a fluke due to Coalition air planners getting lazy and routing them down the same air corridor night after night after night.  The missile crew parked right in the middle of that corridor and fired point blank into it.  They knew pretty much exactly where to look and shoot.  The Su-35, or the SA-20 or whatever, will not have that advantage.  And the F-117's stealth shaping was hardly state of the art, even then.  The F-22's shaping and stealth coatings are AT LEAST two generations more advanced than the 117.  The F-117's faceting was vulnerable to detection by long-wave radars like the one used on the SA-2.  The F-22's compound curvature provides far better protection against a much wider frequency range.  And in what world are the Su-35's engines more advanced than the F-119?  Number one, the F-119 has 3200 pounds more thrust per engine (if not more, and it WILL get more powerful as it develops), Number 2, it's most likely self-tuning, meaning it will tune itself to make even more power in flight, and three, its combat weight is about four thousand pounds lighter than the Su-35 with both aircraft carrying full internal fuel.  And Garrett, if the Typhoon is so advanced, how is it only now getting the CAPTOR-E radar?  In fact how is CAPTOR-E only in development and testing?  Why has no one even ordered any yet?  And all while the F-22 has had the APG-77 AESA right from the start?  Doesn't the fact that the CAPTOR-M radar is still mechanically scanned kind of preempt any claim that the Eurofighter is more advanced?  Oh, and don't waste your breath mentioning how the German Typhoons were able to beat the F-22 in dogfights at Red Flag Alaska 2012.  Once the F-22 pilots digested the after-action reviews and tightened up their tactics and techniques, the Eurofighters got thrashed the next time around.",10년 전,0,
@FS2K4Pilot,"DeJulius Caesar It isn't asinine.  Here's what happened. @2007 The aircraft was spotted briefly on long wave radar when it opened its weapons bay doors, a known period of vulnerability, and its presence was confirmed by reports of a target on the ground exploding.  It was tracked by a network of spotters on the ground, and targeted using IR sensors and laser designators.  There was no radar lock on the aircraft.  Furthermore, your bat-guano psychotic claim about Russian SAMs being more advanced and able to destroy American stealth aircraft doesn't hold water, because of the hundreds of SAMs and AAA fire being fired over Baghdad like fireworks on the Fourth of July, and yet not a single F-117 received so much as a scratch in that conflict. No, this was an obsolete weapon system with one single, useful eccentricity (the ability to use long wave radar search) deployed and used smartly by a cunning battery commander, not a systematic vulnerability of US stealth technology.  If other US radars can't see the thing even well within visual range, and US radars are ten to fifteen years more advanced than anything Russia has, then I'd say the B-2 and the F-22 are pretty safe.  A few years ago, an F-22 intercepted an Iranian F-4 sixteen miles off the coast of Iran, presumably well within the range of Iranian radars and air defenses (using Russian systems at least as advanced as what the Serbians had), and yet the first clue that the F-4 crew had that the F-22 was even there was when the F-22 pulled into formation next to them and radioed them, gently suggesting that they pack it in and head home.  They had no warning at all from anyone, least of all the SAM crews that you continue to claim are able to see and destroy American stealth aircraft at will.  Stop it with this 'American stealth planes are dog food' horse manure.  Just stop.  Please.",10년 전,0,
@DeJulius_Caesar,"Siege of Baghdad was mostly done using tomahawk missiles and predator missile strikes. Besides, Iraqi army deployed flaks as opposed to actual missile systems. Their equipment wasn't just obsolete, it was also very downgraded (think of their T-72s, which had nothing in common with Soviet T-72s except for the looks). So your claim also doesn't hold very well.  As for the Stealth, we'll never know. Even if Soviet SAM was able to find a weakspot in the Stealth technology, the US will never admit to that. Remember how one of our spy planes was shot over the Soviet territory while on a spying mission and our government never admitted to it until the Soviets showcased the pilot on television and he admitted to everything? Same story here, unless another ""Stealthy"" aircraft gets shot down, and our government has no other choice but to admit the uselessness of Stealth technology, we'll never know the truth.",10년 전,0,

@FS2K4Pilot,"DeJulius Caesar The effects of long wave VHF radar and interactions with radio and TV signals have been known to stealth designers for at least two decades, and is also known to be more effective against faceted shapes than against modern compound curvature designs.  As I understand it, if the radar wavelength matches the size of a faceted surface on the aircraft, this causes a much larger return.  Compound curvature defeats this by minimizing the number of faceted surfaces on the aircraft.   In order for long wave radar to detect it, the wavelength of the radar would need to be about the length of the edge of one of the Raptor's control surfaces, which would make it extremely imprecise and unsuited to actually tracking the F-22. And the F-117 was the only manned strike aircraft cleared to overfly Baghdad during the war, because at the time it was possibly the most heavily defended cities on Earth.",10년 전,0,

@DeJulius_Caesar,"FS2K4Pilot​​ I just explained to you that the nations of middle east received extremely downgraded tech from the SU. Just like Egyptian Abrams tanks are nothing like American ones (armor is thinner and not as advanced, all the tech in the tank is of much lower quality, and basically it looks like abrams on the outside, but is nothing like it on the inside), so were Iraqi toys, very cheap, very much useless. Think of their t72s, majority of them didn't even have IR sights (while on Soviet models, IR sights are installed on all models), and the ones that did have them had a much shorter range of sight (which is why Iraqi troops couldn't engage with their 125mm cannons at 5 km neither during the day nor during the night, which is operational range for both t72, and t90). ﻿",10년 전,0,

It was not superior technology that brought down that F-117.  It was ancient tech with one useful eccentricity employed smartly by a savvy battery commander.  How ancient doesn't matter.",10년 전,0,
@DeJulius_Caesar,"Actually, it's debatable. Serbia was one of USSR's closest allies, it's army definitely received the same, or close to the same level of training as Soviet troops, and though Serbian tech was inferior it was not as bad as the tech exported to the Middle East. The reason for that was the fact that Soviets often times bribed other nations with presents such as free or very cheap arms in exchange for pledge of allegiance. That being said, there was a much higher chance that Iraq, Syria, Egypt etc. would be bribed and converted by the US than there was for Serbia's conversion. Therefore, the tech that was supplied to these nations was extremely downgraded in case of change of allegiance, so that neither the US nor NATO would get their hands on Soviet secrets.  That being said, I now proceed to my next argument, if Serbs were able to shoot down a jet from 80s with a SAM from 60's, we can assume (not 100%, but very likely) that Soviet, now Russian AA battalions are just as capable. Now, imagine what they can do if they deploy their S300 or S400 missiles, you know the ones that are actually technologically on par with the F22 and F35 jets, instead of utilizing a technology that is 20+ years older and had been decommissioned (in the USSR) back in the 70s.",10년 전,0,
@FS2K4Pilot,"DeJulius Caesar Except that the S-300 and S-400 are not technologically on a par with the F-22 and F-35.  Russian computer tech is consistently ten years behind any contemporary Western tech, sometimes more.  The AWG-9 was able to track 24 and kill 6 in the early seventies, whereas the Zaslon-M and the Zhuk-F couldn't do that until the early eighties at least.  The APG-73, which was introduced in 1992, was capable of tracking 80 and killing 12, when installed in a Super Hornet.  Neither Russian radar is yet capable of such a feat.Also, your argument is invalid because the shootdown of the F-117 was only possible due to the specific circumstances of the shootdown.  The 117 was DETECTED (not tracked) only when it opened its weapons bay, and contact was lost as soon as the bay door closed.  The F-117 kept flying straight and level, and its flightpath was reported by observers on the ground, most likely from its engine noise.  It was then acquired and engaged using visual and infrared sensors.  The F-22 will not keep chugging along fat, dumb, and happy like that, and its ECM and RWR systems are light-years more advanced than those on the 117.  The F-22's stealth features are also two generations more advanced, with an eye specifically towards reducing the aircraft's vulnerability to long-wave radar.  The F-22 will also be maneuvering aggressively, unlike the F-117, especially if it ever gets painted by the missile beforehand.",10년 전,0,

We were there in Bosnia and Kosovo under the authority of the United Nations with the SOLE PURPOSE of separating all the warring parties.  When the peace treaties were signed, and the responsible parties were brought to justice, we went home.  We did not take sides, and we did not seek to take life in anger, or conquer anyone or anything.  But of course we sent the military.  Who else COULD we send?  The Salvation Army?  Blackwater?  Don't be silly, and don't for a minute think that all the military can do is killkillKILL!!!  How many rescue missions has the US Military been on in this century alone?  There was the tsunami rescue in 2004, plus the rescue missions after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the earthquake in Haiti.  Not to mention all the times when the National Guard gets called out to help with search and rescue and cleanup after a tornado wipes out some town in Arkansas.  In the case of a tsunami, sending in a Carrier Strike Group (a Carrier and its escorts) and an Amphibious Ready Group (three amphibious landing ships and their escorts) is basically the very best thing you can do, because they bring with them a fully functional airport, three fully functional heliports, and numerous smaller helipads, with the ability to operate well over one hundred cargo/search and rescue helicopters (replacing the carrier's normal complement of aircraft) and fixed-wing cargo planes (C-2 CODs), with both VERTREP and UNREP from US Navy supply ships.  They bring four fully-staffed and equipped hospitals with 300 beds apiece (each including a fifty bed ICU), they bring dozens of trucks, AMTRACs, conventional landing craft, and hovercraft that can all be used for land and water rescue, in addition to all the ships' 33' RHIBs.  If you can get the Carrier plumbed and wired into whatever may be left of the island's infrastructure, the Carrier's nuclear reactors and nuclear-powered desalination plants can provide enough electricity and fresh water to meet the needs of the entire island.  They can provide temporary housing for thousands upon thousands of refugees, with food, water, hygiene and medical care aplenty.  But most importantly, the CVSG and ARG bring with them upwards of TWENTY THOUSAND able-bodied sailors and Marines who can be put ashore in search and rescue and working parties, and that does include a contingent of Seabees and combat engineers, and all their gear, and they can help restore vital infrastructure ashore.  And if they can put together an expeditionary airfield somewhere ashore, then the Air Force can start doing their thing, including bringing in the Army Corps of Engineers and all their gear as well.  I can't think of a civilian agency anywhere on Earth that can muster, organize, deploy, and support that much manpower and equipment that quickly.  Oh, and don't even start about the Russians accomplishments in space.  So they did all that stuff first.  So what?  When we tried all those things, we did them better (although we didn't send a woman up until Sally Ride went up on the Shuttle, so you got us there), we stayed up longer, and we were able to accomplish more on each flight.  We also accomplished the first orbital rendezvous between two manned spacecraft, and the first orbital docking of two spacecraft.  But the big prize was to put a human being on the moon.  Yes, perhaps if Glenn or Shepard had beaten their Russian counterparts into space, maybe that would have been the end of it, but that didn't happen, so yes, we went double or nothing.  AND WE WON.  WE put a human being on the Moon first.  That trumps everything else.  99 out of 100 people have never even heard of the Lunokhod rover, and most of those who have don't care because it was only a robot.  It had no emotional impact.  'Lunokhod?  Whoopee fizz!'  If you showed someone from any country a picture taken by Lunokhod, and then you show them a picture of Neil sticking Old Glory into the lunar regolith, and then stepping back and saluting, which one do you think they'll respond to?  Neil and Buzz provided a HUMAN story of HUMANS landing on the Moon and taking a look around.  As Gus Grissom said, in the end, only man can explain the Moon in terms that are understandable to other men.  No one cares whether and American of Russian bucket of bolts did it first. ",10년 전,0,

@FS2K4Pilot,"+DeJulius Caesar Buran could fly unmanned.  So what?  The fact that the Soviet Union regarded its cosmonauts as little more than guinea pigs and propaganda tools isn't something to be proud of.  Our astronauts don't just fly in space, they take active roles throughout our manned spaceflight program, even when on the ground.  They don't just subject themselves to experiments, they help design them.And nice try, but I didn't say easy.  Next time you say you're using my exact words, you'd better actually be using my exact words.  I said, 'a simple matter of rocketry (simple, at least in terms of rocket science).'  Simple doesn't mean easy.  Yes, rockets are hideously complex things, and hardly easy to build.  But once you get the rocket built and working reliably, using it to put a space station in orbit is a straightforward affair.  Stack the rocket, launch it into orbit, and separate the payload.  The launch vehicle is a simple use-it-and-lose-it affair.  it only has to run for a little while, and each engine and system only needs to last for a few hours until they fail.  They don't have to be able to run, shut down, and run again several times in one mission.  And as I said, we gave up on Skylab because the Space Shuttle was capable of doing everything that we had hoped to do with Skylab.Yes, we blew up a bunch of rockets before we got the Pioneer satellite into orbit.  Yes, we blew up a bunch more Atlases too.  As Sergei Korolev once said, 'Do you think only American rockets explode?'  Several R-7s blew up before that type had a successful launch.  And once we got the bugs worked out, by and large, they stayed worked out, save for Apollo 1, Challenger, and Columbia, and only the Challenger was lost due to a glitch in the rockets themselves.  Apollo 1 and Columbia were both faults with the spacecraft itself.  But I digress.  The Saturn V worked perfectly.  In thirteen launches, it never lost a payload, whereas the N1 blew up four times, and never successfully launched a payload.  And one of those explosions even succeeded in flattening one of the launch complexes at Baikonur.  Congratulations, that was unofficially the largest man-made non-nuclear explosion ever recorded.And again, congratulations, you landed a lunar rover on the moon in '58, drove it (and others) around a little, picked up a few samples, took some pictures, and now you dare to claim that that insignificant bit of exploration somehow taught you guys all there is to know about the moon.  Decency prevents me from appropriately responding to such a claim.  We sent a number of probes and fifteen men (twelve of whom actually landed and walked around, including a trained field geologist, Harrison Schmitt), and we found the Genesis Rock (Lunar sample 15145), BTW, and we're still only at the stage of realizing just how much we don't know about the Moon.And to hell with practicality.  That's just an excuse for failing to land a Russian on the Moon.  No one climbs mountains or crosses oceans for practicality.  They do it because it's there, and they want to see what's on top of it, or on the other side of it with their (our) own two eyes.  Sending rovers and probes doesn't satisfy our curiosity.  As Gus said, 'Ultimately, only [a human] is capable of describing the Moon in terms understandable to other [humans]'.  Was it compensation to make up for previous failures, and to save face?  Absolutely.  But it's also arguably the single greatest accomplishment in human history, and definitely one of the very, very hardest.Edit: editing test",10년 전,0,

Perhaps you would not see it that way, but in my opinion, it is better to put them to work and make them truly earn their freedom, rather than have them on free healthcare, food, and entertainment like they have got it in our, American prisons nowadays. Were the Soviet ""heroes"" such as Gagarin or nuclear physicists involved in the Chernobyl disaster notified of all the details? Absolutely, but back then, as I pointed out before, a lot was still unknown, so they were informed to the best knowledge of that time, which frankly and quite unfortunately was not enough for some.",10년 전,0,
@FS2K4Pilot,"+DeJulius Caesar Am I okay with it?  Not really, but I can appreciate the quandary faced by those who had to do it.  Was it a shitty thing to do?  Certainly.  But telling right from wrong is easy.  The hard part is figuring out which wrong is more right in situations where there is NO right answer.  There was no other way to study what they needed to study.  No computer simulations or anything like that.  They needed to know how susceptible American cities were to a sneak attack with biological weapons, so that they could make valid plans for response and treatment.  But what would have been worse would have been to have been insufficiently prepared for such an attack, and to suffer tens of thousands of dead Americans as a result.  And were someone (I doubt it would be the FBI), somehow injecting me secretly, without waking me, or leaving visible injection marks, or any of the lingering physical signs of an injection, I would have to congratulate them.  And then sue them.And I categorically reject any claim that the wholesale slaughter of Russian citizens was in any way justified by any benefit whatsoever that came of it, if any.  Stalin was never concerned with ""the glory of the proletariat state,"" as you put it.  He was only concerned with being the boss, and staying the boss.  Nothing more.  And I categorically reject the claim that anything America has ever done compares in any way with such a bloodbath.  What's more, each of those people that were killed or imprisoned were deprived of their lives and livelihoods without the slightest semblance of due process of law.  Kangaroo courts simply do not count, and when the USSR was so busy slaughtering a thousand people a day on average, how could there even be time for a trial?  Human rights are not privileges.  This is not the book or movie ""Starship Troopers"".  Human beings, whether or not they are American citizens, are at all times entitled to all the protections of the Bill of Rights, as well as food, healthcare, and shelter, as indicated in the UN Charter, from the moment they are born, or even earlier.",10년 전,0,

@DeJulius_Caesar,"Geez, this post is dead. Leave it alone.",10년 전,0,
@FS2K4Pilot,"+Marvirt Bajao It means that while the Russians have fielded radars with Active Electronically Scanned Arrays, and they've been putting glass cockpits in their planes for a while now, the computers that process the information from the radar and process it for display just aren't anywhere near as good as ours.  The Russian Zhuk radar family only attained the ability to track thirty targets and guide missiles out to kill any six of them with simultaneous missile shots within the last ten or fifteen years.  And that all depends on raw computing power, having enough power to run numbers and predict flight paths for thirty targets, and compute intercept geometries for six missiles.  By comparison, the AWG-9 radar used on the F-14 (which was a 1970's-era modernization of 1960's-era radar tech) was able to track 24 targets and kill any six of them with simultaneous missile shots FORTY YEARS AGO.Granted, the Zhuk has other advantages over the AWG-9, such as being able to scan a larger volume of sky in a much shorter time, since the AWG-9 used mechanical scanning, and it can probably see smaller targets at longer ranges than the AWG-9, but without having the raw computing power behind the antenna, A LOT of the targets that the radar can physically 'see' will get squelched from what's being displayed to the pilot.  It's like driving in rush hour traffic looking through a pair of soda straws.  By comparison,  a Super Hornet pilot that I talked to about 12 years ago told me that the APG-73 radar in his plane was able to track EIGHTY targets, and guide missiles out to any twelve of them.So, if it doesn't have enough onboard computing power to process ALL the information that is taken in by both the onboard sensors (the radar or radars, IRSTS, and radar warning receiver), offboard sensors (target information distribution networks, AWACS, and ground-based radar, ELINT, and SIGINT systems), and satellite and inertial navigation systems, and interpret all that into one streamlined battle display for the pilot to look at, then the T-50 is not a fifth or sixth generation fighter, regardless of whether or not it is stealthy, can supercruise, or has super maneuverability.",10년 전,0,

@ufReitter,"Fanboys or Trolls. Always hard to separate for me. But let me explain anyway. The F-22 is build to super cruse and sneak in. This results in some major drawbacks of the (stable) airframe regarding dogfight wich are partially compensated by a (heavy) thrust vectoring system. The Eurofighter is build to win dogfights, so to say to win such a race. Also the most current Russian fighters dominate the whole american arsenal and the Eurofighter dominates the Russians in dogfight. So far there is no doubt in the whole aircraft industry. The 4 current superpowers (US, Europa, China and hopefully Russia) are simply not equipped to run up against each other. Each is specialized on tasks to make earth a saver place. The F-22 is superior against 2nd grade radar and for long range missions. Against the Eurofighters radar it is a baby seal. The F-35 (often misunderstood as a total fail) is great for invasions or homeland guerrilla defense. The next world war might be initiated by jews and arabs or by global climate change, so the superpowers arsenals might save some asses some day (If you are a superpower citizen)",10년 전,0,

This means that it is capable of exceptionally tight turns and high speed maneuvers. And on top of that, the F-22 has a reported G rating of OVER 16 G's. this means that the F-22 would be a hyper deadly fighter if it was a drone instead. The pilot keeps the jet from performing at its maximum level. ",10년 전,80,

@staggabob,"Why is supercruise relevant here? The Typhoon also has that ability. Come to think of it so did the English Electric Lightning of the 1950s. And it's of no use whatsoever in this race. The F-22 has thrust vectoring and LEX but it's a very heavy aircraft. The Typhoon has a much lower weight, lower wing loading and vortex generators on the fuselage to create high lift at low speeds and high AOA. In other words it equals or possibly betters the F-22's manoeuvrability. So does the Dassault Rafale. ",10년 전,41,
@LegendaryAce73,"That isn't possible. The Lightning couldn't have supercruise, as FTS travel was just being discovered. In fact, if I remember correctly not even the F-86 could not breach Mach 1 in level flight. And before you argue, you said in the 50's, which is the Korean War era. No plane had breached the sound barrier until Chuck Yeager did. And the problem with the Lightning was its extremely low endurance. At maximum fuel levels, it could stay in a combat zone for at most 50 minutes.   And to address the higher weight, that's true, however that doesn't quite matter here. The F-22's unique diamond wing shape allows it to perform exceedingly right turns while distributing G-loads across the surface efficiently. The shape also has an extremely low drag coefficient which equates to higher airspeeds and lower parasitic drag. The F-22 is also the ONLY Western fighter capable of executing a Kulbit Turn (a complete loop in which the distance traveled is approximately equal to two lengths of the aircraft) and the Pugachev's Cobra (the aircraft is able to reach exceedingly high AoA [70 or more degrees] while still maintaining forward movement). The Typhoon is incapable of performing such a maneuver due to its lack of thrust vectoring, rendering its agility less than that of the F-22.   And the final decisive factor in the Typhoon vs. the F-22 is survivability. The F-22's ""first look, first shoot, first kill"" capability is unrivaled. Sure the Typhoon may have similar capabilities, but it lacks one crucial feature that the F-22 does have. Stealth. The F-22's radar cross section is measured to be equivalent to that of a small bird, which means that if you wanted to find it on radar, you would have to tune your radar to obscenely sensitive settings. But in doing so, you would pick up many aberrations and false hits on birds and other objects. So the F-22's stealth renders it completely invisible to radar, meaning its AIM-120C AMRAAM's could take the Typhoon down from 150km off and be long gone by the time it hit.  I'm not trying to put the Typhoon down. It's a beautiful bird and an even more gorgeous sight to see in the air, but I'm an F-22 fan. I'm just captivated by its striking looks and sheer beauty and technological prowess. I fell in love with it the moment I saw it, and I've always loved seeing the F-22 squadrons performing out of Nellis AFB during the airshows. ",10년 전,0,
@LegendaryAce73,"I already said that the F-22 could perform more than 15G's. did you not read my first comment?  That's kind of a moot point here. The Pratt & Whitney F-119-PW-100 engines that the F-22 has produce over 35,000 pounds of thrust each. If the Raptor was flying on afterburners, there's little doubt it could push upwards of 100,000 pounds of thrust. There is no other turbofan in the world like it.   Actually, you are wrong. You say that the F-22's lift comes from it's body? That's strange, considering that according to Bernoulli's Principle, in order for an object to produce lift it must have a flat bottom surface and a specially curved upper surface. If that was the case on the Raptor, then it's stealth capabilities would be compromised. It's the diamond shaped wings that give it outstanding lift and maneuverability. And before you say I'm wrong again, I know what I'm talking about because I've seen it up close from barely 10 feet away, I've talked to Colonels who fly it, and I've written numerous reports about it in my aeronautical engineering classes.

@staggabob,"Aric Anderson The EE Lightning was the first aircraft in the world to have supercruise ability- it first flew in 1954. You could have simply looked that up instead of making stupid comments based solely on your opinion.  By the way the sound barrier was broken in 1947, a real aeronautical engineering student would know that -_- And why are you talking about F-22 versus Typhoon survivability? Nobody was arguing that point. Again what relevance does that have in a stupid race against a hyper car? Have they fitted the Veyron with SAMs? ",10년 전,10,
@LegendaryAce73,"Oh, sorry. That was my mistake. I thought we were talking about modern fighters. No, supercruise with a turbofan is much easier, given the higher compression available in the turbines and the reheat ability of turbofans. Supercruise with turbojets was exceedingly rare, due to the overly complicated moving components. No, the Lightning was a great aircraft, but had drawbacks due to fuel consumption.   And yes, I know it was 1947. I wrote a 10 page report on Chuck Yeager in high school. I just wasn't counting his flight as a ""jet"". Sure he broke the sound barrier first, but that plane was technically a rocket, as it required no outside air to drive internal combustion. The first ""jet"" to break the sound barrier IMO was the North American F-86 Sabre in a steep dive. However, such reports are unconfirmed.   And to address your questioning of my knowledge of Korean War era planes, I do apologize. Korean War and before doesn't quite interest me. From the 1970's onwards is what I study. Korean War jets weren't scrutinized for maximum performance. If I remember correctly, most countries were just trying to find out the maximum wing sweep efficiency. Hence why the Lightning had an absurd 60 degree or so wing sweep.   To address your survivability question, I thought you were asking how the F-22 is better than the Typhoon, in which I responded in such a way. That's why I said that.   And finally, a Bugatti with a SAM launcher? Holy shit! That would be badass to see. Of course, it'd be impractical as hell, given the fact that there's no room to fit the radar guidance sensors.

I can see you're not giving me the benefit of the doubt when it comes to aerodynamic knowledge. Of course aircraft are more manueverable at lower airspeeds. At the lower altitudes where slower flight take place, there more air molecules available for the elevators and ailerons to deflect, and less stress is induced on the airframe at lower speeds. Plus, at high speeds, a sharp turn leads to higher angles of attack, which without thrust vectoring, can lead to an aerodynamic stall. ",10년 전,0,

@zipscool,"Aric Anderson Not trying to rag on you or the F-22, but I swear I read somewhere that the stealth design of most modern fighters isn't actually all that aerodynamic. I also remember reading that the F-22's design fixed some of those issues, but not all of them, and furthermore, that thrust vectoring won't actually help it win any dogfight because it bleeds off too much energy, and unless it's up against someone who doesn't know what he's doing, can potentially leave it high and dry. In a joint exercise between German Typhoons and F-22s it appeared that in a close-quarter fight the Typhoon's inherent instability actually grants it higher agility, while the F-22 was markedly more effective once some distance was gained, no doubt in some part to its tremendous stealth capacity I'm sure.  I think the general consensus is that the Typhoon is the better dogfighter, but considering that one of the F-22's most touted features is its stealth then I think the more crucial question in these sorts of arguments is ""why is dogfighting really necessary when most modern armaments are capable of engaging enemies from hundreds of miles away?"" I love the Typhoon and think it's sex on wings but I'm under no illusions that if it really came down to a war then our Typhoon fleet would be swatted from the sky because (and by all means, correct me if I'm wrong) unless you're right on top of it there's no way to really detect an F-22 via radar. The Typhoon's a more than capable BVR fighter too but it doesn't have stealth. All the F-22 pilot really needs to do to win is find its target, lock on, fire away and bug out to rearm and refuel for another go, which isn't to say it's not a capable dogfighter because it clearly is, but I don't think dogfighting is what it was designed for.",10년 전,1,

@LegendaryAce73,"***** That's very true. The Blackbird is built for speed, and speed alone. Rumors and claims from former Blackbird pilots state that at high speed, if you started a 180 degree turn over the state of Texas, you'd come out of the turn over Nebraska. Sure it may be overly exaggerated, but it does adequately describe the Blackbird's horrible turn radius.  As for rate of climb, it's not meant to climb vertically. Sure, the SR-71 has the most powerful jet engines on the planet, but that means nothing if the aerodynamics prevent you from climbing vertically. It's modified delta wing and absurdly long LERX's are amazing for lift, but are atrocious for vertical climbs.  Oh, here's a fun fact. Did you know that on takeoff, the SR-71 had gaps in its ceramic panels at least an inch wide, allowing fuel to leak out during takeoff, which required mid-air refueling just after takeoff. The reason is that at high speed at 150,000 feet, the panels on the Blackbird would heat up to temperatures of over 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, thus sealing all the panels. Pretty crazy right?   Honestly, the SR-71 is one of my all time favorite aircraft. My grandfather worked for Lockheed's SkunkWorks program on the propulsion system for it. Apparently he worked at NASA's JPL facility to test them, and at Area 51 to watch them. He told me about the tests he saw at Area 51 days before he died, so there wasn't any repercussion really. Apparently that's why the base has the world's longest runway, to accommodate aircraft such as that.",10년 전,0,

@ancaplanaoriginal5303,"Javier Gularte Javier, el F-22 puede efectuar la maniobra del principio en mucha menos distancia y volando a 4 metros del suelo, es más, podría hacer la maniobra del principio y quedarse estático en vertical a esa altura y después acelerar y comenzar un ascenso. Al hacer maniobras pierde mucha velocidad como todos los aviones, a no ser que haya algún gilipollas que se atreva a hacer un yo-yo con su avión a Mach 1'7. Y el peso del F-22 poco importa teniendo en cuenta que sus alas solo proporcionan el 30% de sustentación del aparato (el cuerpo principal proporciona el 70%), eso significa que no hay peso muerto. Los Cannards no aportan maniobrabilidad ninguna, ya que son timones de profundidad re-ubicados, es como si cogemos un F-22, le quitamos los timones de profundidad y se los ponemos en el morro a un FB-22. En el caso del sukhoi estamos hablando de un avión muy maniobrable, pero no gracias a los cannards, si no gracias a su empuje vectorial, del que también dispone el Raptor, que aún así es muchísimo más maniobrable debido a las alas en forma de diamante que reducen y distribuyen mucho mejor la carga aerodinámica en las maniobras.",10년 전,0,

I'm 20 minutes away from Nellis too, and I know that Michael Bay didn't get access to Nellis because that looked nothing like it.  As for the cost, they're prohibitively expensive, so they better be good. If I remember, each one costs over $137 million, so something is very wrong if they're not the ""preemptive 5th Gen fighter"" that the military said they are. One thing is for sure though.

@LegendaryAce73,"Okay, I just have to add my two cents here. Are people honestly trying to say that street legal cars are capable of performing fighter jet turns? I have a bit of science to prove that such claims are completely outlandish. The amount of G's experienced during a turn or maneuver is proportional to the direction of acceleration in relation to gravity. That means that an object would experience more G-load if moving in a direction parallel to the force of gravity than if it were moving perpendicular. The reason that an F1 can ONLY pull about 5-6 G's in a lateral turn is due to the vector sum of all the forces acting on it. The force of acceleration on a Top Fuel dragster maxes out at 5.6G's due to the fact that its linear acceleration along a perpendicular axis to gravity. Velocity also plays a factor in measuring G's. A fighter jet traveling at high speeds usually pulls 9G's due to the abrupt change in direction and movement. Cars don't travel nearly fast enough to be able to exceed 6.5G's. It's just simple physics. ",10년 전,0,
@pascalmpower7944,"Aric Anderson The amount of G related to the amount of speed transfer. The amount of speed->amount of speed transfer->gravity=G force. and a F1 car can pull same amount of G at a lower speed. At 280kph, a F1 car can pull 7G depands on the degrees of the corner. Underbraking, a F1 can do 6.1-7G (2000-2013 model) a plane needs loads and loads of air friction to do the same performance as cars. Which means at lower speed, like 200kph, a jet can pull only 3-4G then it'll stall. Also a jet can't produce as mech braking force as cars unless the pilot eject at the speed of sound.",10년 전,0,

I even got to talk to Antron Brown and Tony Schumacher and got insider details on what goes on during a drag.   And fighter jets can decelerate at fast rates. Supermanueverable aircraft can use the Kulbit and Cobra on top of using bleed air and the is reversers to slow down. However, you can't compare stopping power between the two.

As far as I'm concerned, stellar core collapse black holes are the fastest accelerating things. The cores of stars 20x the mass of the Sun collapse from the size of the sun to the size of the Earth in a 10th-1000th of a second, at about 1/3rd the speed of light.

Since you apparently don't know how a mass driver would work, I'll explain it as clearly and concisely as possible. Mass drivers utilize magnetic energy to propel an SSTO(Single Stage To Orbit) shuttle to speeds that would allow it to use a single rocket to escape the Earth's pull. Simply put, mass drivers use chains of positive and negative polarity magnets in a very precise sequence to accelerate the SSTO. If you've heard to MagLev trains, than you know how it works. Mass drivers work on a much larger scale, and if you look into it, mass drivers can achieve ridiculous acceleration rates. The only problem is the massive amounts of energy needed to power them.

@AdeptPaladin,"***** Actually... China (and Russia) can see the F-22 easily.  Just because it is less resistant to one form of radar (aka modern versions), older WW2 versions (which they still use!) networked into a half decent C3 system can spot it right away.  And yes, both countries can and do have such systems available.  Stealth is a misconception.  Reduced visibility is more accurate, and even then it isn't as great a benefit as it used to be anymore.",11년 전,1,
@GSpotOperator,AdeptPaladin Sure it's easy to see... every radar can detect it when up close.. yet the F-22 can't be killed by another plane.

@AdeptPaladin,"***** I thought you had said that it would kill 3 fighters at BVR with a 99% success rate - which is a very amazing feat. Survive an encounter at BVR against 3 fighters isn't too hard, however, the reduced radar signature really only benefits against ground defences (which, as I said, can easily overpower it by looking at it from different angles and using longer wavelength systems).  The Raptor IS a solid fighter in terms of performance, far more so than the sodden cow that is the F-35 however.",11년 전,0,
@GSpotOperator,AdeptPaladin No.. the reduced radar signature benifits even more so from air to air combat. It would most likely win vs 6 EUrofighters BVR .. Well it was dominating over the F-15 in every way and the F-15 never ever got shot down by the enemy 104 to 0 KD. Somepeople say the EUrofighter would win against the F22 in a dogfight.. and it did.. but the chance is very low.,11년 전,0,
@AdeptPaladin,"***** The F-15 is some 15 years older than the F-22, so that isn't surprising.  The Typhoon, however is about as old as the F-22 (and could easily be classified as a 5th gen fighter given how 'new' it is).  No aircraft would win 6 on 1, even if the engagement started at BVR. While the F-22's hardware is superior there, the weapons they use are absolutely rubbish at that distance (the AIM-120 has a Pk of 46% against non-maneuvering, no countermeasures, type targets. A Typhoon WOULD be aware of the lock/missile, would begin evasive measures and deploy countermeasures - making it even less likely that the AIM-120 would be a successful strike).  Let's be more realistic.. 3:1, which is what most experts agree is the best case scenario for the F-22's superiority.  The F-22 has 6 AIM-120 missiles, let's be generous and say it can have a Pk of 50% (well above real world performance) and it starts with the drop (which is likely). Firing 1 missile only has a 1:2 chance to kill, so the Raptor doubles up (as they tend to now anyways) - giving it a 75% chance to kill a single Typhoon.  The odds of it killing all 3? 40% - not terrible, but still not great.  Odds are at least 1-2 will survive.. at which point the F-22 can close to WVR (there the Typhoon's superior agility will come into play and this has been the F-22's greatest weakness).  Realistically, however, two AIM-120's will have a ~37% chance of scoring a kill, meaning that the once the AIMs are gone the Raptor is up against a perfect storm of hurt.  The USAF WANTS to adopt a BVR tactic and has been pushing for it since the F-4, and it hasn't been successful yet.  Experienced pilots of all nations realize the necessity of dogfighting and WVR capability, of which stealth is less of an asset.  ",11년 전,1,

For example (not the actual numbers), let's say a 100hp engine produces 100kJ which makes you reach a max speed of 100mph. If you add a second engine, they will produce 200kJ but let you reach less than 200mph since it takes more energy to go from 0-100 than 100-200.",11년 전,0,

BVR tactics are not viable now, as even with missiles capable of it, combat rules of engagement do not lend themselves readily to such scenarios.  Most kills within the last 2 decades have been WVR, even when using missiles with greater standoff distance.  To put it simply.. switching to a BVR tactic would be like replacing every rifleman with a sniper armed with a rifle that will only hit the target 1000yds out, 25% of the time, then shoving them into a dense CQB environment.

The original F/A-18 was made by McDonnell Douglas and was put into service in 1983. When Boeing showed they could make it a lot better they had theirs put into service in 1999 and Douglas lost their contract to it.

The F22 is definetly more superior to the typhoon cuz the typhoon is a 4th generation fighter and the F22 is a 5th generation fighter. And yes American jets are develpoed in the 80s and 70s but they kept ugrading their jets. The F18 for example, The F18A is the oldest modle and its not a good airplane anymore VErY OUTDATED.

@Killerpixel11,"zszs100 And you know why it kicked the F22's ass? Because they put chains on it. Silly RoE's that took away the Raptors advantages, just like all the other times it's been beaten by other jets. Stuff like putting the radar into training mode to avoid giving away the signatures, restricting BVR engagement (where the combination of the F22 radar and the AMRAAM would just blow pretty much everything else out of the sky) and kinds of stuff like that.  It all doesn't matter tho. Nobody is going to NEED these types of jets, why do you think the F22 production was cancelled? Because nobody needs a dedicated dogfighter/interceptor anymore, they are useless, because there aren't gonna be any more ""major"" wars. The design of the F22 was started during the cold war...if that would've gone ""hot"" then yes, the F22 would've been a major asset (presuming it wass actually DONE and combat ready)  But it didn't, and the kind of enemies NATO would go up against these days, fly outdated soviet designs, you could dust off a few F-14s and win, you don't need Raptors because Eagles, Falcons and Hornets will do the job in any conceivable modern war. That's why the USAF is putting their focus on the F35 and that's why the Euros are spending a tremendous amount of money to force the Typhoon into a strike role, because at the moment it's doing just as much good as the F22...NONE. All the ""heavy lifting"" is still done by Tornados, until they got the Typhoon upgraded to carry and use the latest in Air-to-Ground ordenance.",11년 전,1,

@2millionlightyears,The Bugatti Veyron and F22 Raptor have a lot in common. Both are engineering milestones in their field of engineering. And both are made for things that rarely excist (anymore). The Bugatti is made for roads without speed limits. And the F22 was made for the cold war instead of fighting terrorism. And both are way too expensive to purchase. Even the US cant afford more than 187 of F22 and has to rely mainly on the cheaper F35 for its defense. And the Bugatti's tyres and maintenance costsare as much as the purchase price of an ordinary car. But the technology of both the Bugatti and the F22 is impressive. Really. If I could choose between them I would go for the Bugatti Veyron tough.,11년 전,0,

@isengard1500,"The Typhoons are advancing, obviously the Squadrons of F-22s or Lightning IIs would be better! On a comprehensive study, I'd rate the English Electric Lighting better than all of them because of it's history in the Cold War and pure speed",11년 전,0,
@krashd,"Isen gard F-22's and F-35's would be better?  One is grounded and relies solely on being unseen (very easy to do seeing as they are all in hangers at the moment), the other has a myriad of technical issues that at best make it unreliable and at worst can kill it's own pilot at crusing altitude.  Also Captmiller1995 is one very weird person because the systems in a Typhoon are second only to the F22, the F22 has the best electronics on earth, it is an ECW bird after all whereas the Typhoon is a complete dogfighter and has 70 systems designed simply to calculate how best to pull off whatever the pilot pulls on the stick without killing him or her.   In a modern 4th gen jet you are taught what you and your jet can handle, in a Typhoon you are only taught what the jet can handle because it's computers will translate any extreme stick adjustment to move the jet in a manner that reaches a human extreme but does not go beyond it.  In short the jet is designed to keep you alive, even against your own actions, so you don't have to hesitate when pulling off a climb in order to avoid losing consciousness, you just yank the stick backwards and the computers adjust the pitch to the maximum a human can safely handle.  This is why videos of a Typhoon show them pirouetting, barrelling, nose diving and generally making the sky look like it's made of a vacuum.  It is the most advanced dogfighter ever constructed, and those that detract from it always say ""well we don't need dogfighters, we have stealth"".  Yeah, use the same excuse when the enemy has weapons that can see through your stealth like the Russians did in the 1980's with their SAMs.  When that happens your F22 and F35 pilots will wish they were in F16's.  When the US made jets to be agile instead of unseen.",11년 전,0,

Sure it doesn't look great but the project was to create the world's fastest road car (it didn't say it had to be a super car but we classify it as one because of its power.) At the time that Veyron was created, that objective was achieved. The project was to see if you could build a car engine that could develop 1000 bhp (which was never done before, I believe?). The Veyron was an engineering feat, not an artistic one. ",12년 전,0,
@RoyalSwish,"A plane's ability to overcome gravity is due to the fact that it can overcome acceleration due to gravity with an acceleration provided by the force provided by the engines which is more than the acceleration due to gravity. You can do simple vector arithmetic to prove that's the case. It also overcomes gravity by the use of aerodynamics. Gravity still always affects the plane, but the plane can work against gravity, which is different from saying gravity doesn't affect planes.",12년 전,0,
@RoyalSwish,"No, it doesn't. Mass doesn't affect the acceleration of an object due to gravity because the acceleration for all objects by virtue of gravity is the same value of 9.81 m/s^2. The only reason why a feather seemingly falls ""slower"" than a rock is because of air resistance, which has nothing to do with gravity but aerodynamics.  And gravity does affect planes, gravity affects all of objects with mass (no matter how big or small the mass is)...",12년 전,0,

@xXNoNameShinobiXx,i never said it was just gravity i said gravity was a MAIN factor in this whole situation and the greatest factor in the victory because if the jet was falling on its own it would already be at a speed of 72000m/s2 coupled with the say about 400lbs of additional thrust would go to about 84000m/s2 after only about 5000m so yea GRAVITY is the main deciding factor where the bugatti doesn't have that additional boost of speed so you're argument has been rendered invalid by the courts!,12년 전,0,
@AQColors,"Doesn't require any math... You don't get the point, the sheer force required to accelerate that fast against gravity to the speeds it did to get 1 mile horizontally and who knows how much vertically is pretty damn great considering the mass and acceleration speeds. Only then could he ""fall"" and apply force downwards/horizontally to accelerate fast enough to beat the car. So no, it wasn't just gravity that helped the jet win, it was the thrust of the engines. Really fucking simple.",12년 전,0,

@Retrosicotte,"The F22's ""HOBS"" is just a quickfix, it doesn't have the same proper helmet mounted firing solution yet at all.  Furthermore, it's not on me to state the F22's sprint speed. The Typhoon has shown it's a winner there through the mathematics. Unless you can prove the F22 is has a faster sprint time with a source behind it?",12년 전,0,

@Retrosicotte,"It's also worth noting that presentation was from the same group that lied for months about the asphyxia problems and put them back in the air without fixing it in order to try and secure additional funding by pretending it was all fine. Until two pilots abstained and went public that is. I wouldn't regard it particularly good unbiased ""fact"" unless it was from a measured group rather than the folks trying to lobby money from it.",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"The SHornet and Falcon are also immeasurably below the capability of more modern planes like the Tiffy and Rafale.  Overspecialised is a bad thing in that its purpose is one that is designed for a war that never happened. You can have a deterrent without throwing money away that much. UK, Germany and France have deterrent without needing that sort of thing. Stealth fighters are a good idea but the F22 is just too much money for too little purpose other than deterrent from a non-existant enemy",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"As I said, I base things in fact, not in the silly things like the rain thing. General Jumper said it best actually though. That they are simply two different aircraft for two different purposes and both the best at what they do. I've never said anything other than that really.  Simply repeating ""much"" a lot of times doesn't really count as a counterarguement. I'll assume that's what you do when you have no comeback. As I said, insults get you no-where in respect for discussion.",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"There's a difference between upgrading existing capability and lacking technological standards entirely. For an A2A fighter, lacking a HOBS is pretty much a design disaster.  Read my post again, I said a whole variety of factors, size is only one of them. Typhoon can go from sitting on runway to Mach1.5 in 150 seconds, that is beyond the F-22's capability on any form of practical takeoff. Not by much, but it's there. As I said, typhoon's a sprinter, but the Raptor will outrun it in the long run.",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"Given the Typhoon is the only of the two to actually make any bangs for real, it hardly helps the Raptor being an overspecialised and cripplingly over expensive plane. It costs more to do one rarely occuring purpose only, while a Typhoon can do so much more -and- some of it even better. I think you just need to check currency rates for my estimate, it's the same when its converted to what is being said here. You're also not taking into account the absurd maintenance costs for F-22.",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"Simply looking at wikistats isn't enough to cover the capabilities here. The typhoon is a much smaller plane that can take off in a much shorter time (so short, it was often considered for carrier use). Furthermore, it's also down to the engine power build time, the takeoff lift required and numerous other things. Raptor is definitely the faster aircraft, but in terms of the ""get off the ground"" sprint, the Typhoon is one of  fastest. It's the Russians that hold the ""best"" for that one though",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"All I do is state facts you continue to overlook and not respond to, using your post to instead insult. Now, given it performed both no-fly interceptions, was ready to go A2A and was still taking out multiple tanks per mission with long times on station all in one mission, that's definitely multipurpose. It acquires its full Paveway IV support in 2013, not 2018. The last thing is anti-shipping in 2017. The Raptor lacks things itself, it -still- doesn't have a HOBS installed for A2A.",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"Perhaps you should read up on what costs are. 150 for F-22 is the -flyaway- cost, that's just enough to get it off the ground. That's before avionics, ground control maintenance, crew kit and all that other expensive stuff. 118 for the typhoon is the -System- cost, which includes all that. Furthermore, the Raptor production line would need restarting which would cost a lot more, as opposed to the Typhoon which is still being produced, costs will only go down with Oman and maybe seen even UAE in.",12년 전,0,

@Retrosicotte,"BVR means Beyond Visual Range. Air2Air sniping basically. Raptor's the best at it, but it's not the best in the world at say, within visual range dogfighting. That goes to the Typhoon. There is a rather large difference though between them. Raptor only does air2air with occasional ground strikes, Typhoon does loads of other jobs too better than Raptor does (like dogfighting and close air support). Both great, both different. Ta for the polite reply, too much arguement around here about planes :p",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"It may surprise folks, but the Typhoon by all knowledge would win. The F-22 definitely has a higher -max- speed, but in this type of race, which is effectively a sprint, the Typhoon would pull ahead. It's designed for this sort of rapid ascent and acceleration while the heavier Raptor is meant to build its speed before engaging from a high altitude.  Simply put. At a sprint? Typhoon. In a marathon? Raptor.",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"As ever, it depends on what you want the plane to do. Aside from the Raptor, the Typhoon is widely considered the best combat aircraft on the planet. Even then, the Raptor is a BVR superiority air to air fighter and it's streamlined into this one specialised role. The Typhoon is more multipurpose and designed to be damn good at dogfighting, swingrole strikes and a few other tasks. The Raptor and Typhoon do different jobs. Each the best at what they do.",12년 전,0,
@Retrosicotte,"Depends on what you want the plane to do. The Typhoon is by far the best in the world at doing pretty much any job you ask it to, the F-22 is a specialised plane that is the best at what it does...but what it does is pretty specific and very rarely needed.   Plus, cost is a part of what makes one good as well. If the plane costs too damn much to even own it's hardly a very good plane for the purpose.",12년 전,0,

@Owlyghost,They said the most manoeuvrable strikefighter not fighter ! The F22 you're thinking about is an interceptor. The european was not developed to be fast but to do it's job. The F14 was made so that it can cross distances and attack the Eurofighter  is a defense.strike fighter. Comparing the two is as pointless as comparng the Spitfire and the Mustang ! Spitfire had less range because it was not intended to cover range just to defend britain ! Same here on another scale ! ,13년 전,0,

It's a grand exhibition that pays tribute to the car: for more than just transporation but also being one of man's greatest acheivements. Top Gear makes us know this acheivement.",13년 전,0,

The F-22 has the TV nozzles, which allow rapid changes of direction, but they make it lose energy very fast, and it needs to recover speed after it turns. In this time, a Typhoon can close in. It also has an IRST, which allows it to detect the F-22s heat from 50 miles. And it has the helmet mounted missile lock system, something yet to be seen on the F-22. ",13년 전,0,

@MRrHaCkZ,@Riles07 The F35 is absolute rubbish   The Euro fighter pilot wouldn't know the plane was in the airspace but the radar would pick up any missile fired and they are relatively easy to defeat with a plane as agile as the euro fighter.   The problem with the F35 is that it has the same problem as the F105 did during Vietnam. which was too much weight and not enough wing area.

The Eurofighter is currently using a pulse doppler radar and will not recieve AESA until later.. but anyway thats just speed and radar. now i will say havnt flown either of them :p",14년 전,0,

The US Navy imposes a 7.5 G limit to do what you say (for the F/A-18 and the F-35), and prolong the aircraft's useful life because of its more rigid standards for maintenance.

A normal person will black out at 5 G, without training or a G-suit.  A modern fighter pilot is trained and equipped for 9 G.",14년 전,0,
@DevilTakeMe,"@em745aa That said, it's quite likely that modern jet fighters can withstand higher tolerances than they did years ago.  Like, say, the MiG-25.

@DevilTakeMe,"@em745aa Most Acrobatic planes are designed with up to 12 Gs in mind, like those in those Red Bull races, and the pilots of those particular planes wear even more complicated water-based G-racing suits.

There's been some recorded incidents of fighter pilots pulling through as much as 11 Gs, but most research attests that repeated or prolonged G-loads above 12 Gs can cause serious injury or even death.",14년 전,0,
@DevilTakeMe,"@em745aa Thank you for that.  It's nice to know you missed where I said ""LIKE the F-22"" and simply assumed I was saying only the F-22 had such restrictions.  That said, modern jet fighters (LIKE the F-22 and the Typhoon) are rated to withstand up to 9 Gs at maximum, their absolute limits a bit higher than that, and their failure rates a bit higher still.  Jet fighter pilots are expected to take up to 9gs themselves without blacking out.  Beyond that is a wild card.",14년 전,0,

@Fortatus,It hurts to see the eurofighter being disgraced by this race. It probably flew something like 10 miles. You only have to look at the speed it passes at the beginning. Most likely the eurofighter passed the 1 mile mark before the pilot was fast enough to go straight up. And every turn was 10 times as large as the Bugatti's.  Just make a 2 mile race without turns and both machines stay straight on/above the ground. The Typhoon will win with 1 minute in advance.,14년 전,0,

@darkembassymusic,"Respond to this video... An F22 will never be able to defeat a Eurofighter in any dogfight because Eurofighter is too agile and renders F22 stealth useless. Using thrust to weight ratio, the Eurofighter is faster than an F22 both with afterburners. The Super J-10 is faster than both the Eurofighter and the F22 so don't be too impressed with a F22 because of speed. mach 2.1 doesn't do much to evade a Eurofighter. So in conclusion - Eurofighter is faster, more agile and detects F22s with ease.",14년 전,0,
@darkembassymusic,@whitesox889 Stealth does limit speed!! The F22 travels at maximum Mach 1.8 without afterburners. To travel at top speed it needs afterburners. Afterburners give off heat. Radar detects heat dumbass!!! You see how logic stops you talking like an idiot?  Infrared isn't radar but makes an F22 clearly visible. Once visible guess what!?! - manual lock! -Again requires logic to understand.  The speed of the F22 is confirmed at mach 2.1 - Lockheed stated 2.2 but was never confirmed.   ,14년 전,0,

@GiaIsTheBest,"There are some factors that mess with the drag race: When the plane gets airborne, the force of the engines push the car back and it gets slower. Gravity pulls the pplane down when it gets up making it slower, but gravity helps the plane when it gets down, making it almost 4 times as fast as when gravity wouldný help. gravity makes the car slower because gravity wants the car not to move that fast and pulls it down, without gravity interfering, the car would definitly win!

As long as you have the power you could make a semi go faster then 250MPH. You just need the power to do so, and need to reinforce the body so it doesnt blow apart. In the late 1960's Chevy made a car named the Cheetah, that achieved 220MPH and that was in the late 60's. That engine didnt have more then 700NHP I believe. But they only produced like 5 of them b4 money ran out",16년 전,0,

So in other words, all he had to do for the second half of the race was fall. He could have cut his engines and still would have won purely from gravity. They even said this plane was designed to be unaerodynamic to make it more agile, and it'd just fall from the sky without computer aid.

@STKS1991,"yeah, what these morons dont understand is that stealth in air to air terms doesnt work. the ground reflects radar so the spot where the plane is absorbs radar, its like a black hole. its piss easy to program a missile to folow that. besides in a dogfight they use IR ( heat seaking ) missiles and no mater how good ur ""stealth"" is it doent make your engines cold. america wastes its money becouse they are easyly impressed by anything shiney when they dont understand the science behind it !",16년 전,0,
