I Remember when the first touch screen phone came out and most people didn't want to spend 500£ on a phone but I have always been into my new tech and it would be laughable compared to modern phones it was massively over priced janky the screen would fail and it was hard taking calls without switching it off because the sensors were so basic it couldn't differentiate between a ear and a finger.

@rafaw6867,"Humanoid robots always make me smile with a touch of pity. They remind me of the early attempts to build flying machines with flapping wings that imitated birds - and usually crashed before even taking off. It’s exactly the same situation - humanoid robots are simply stupid. We already have plenty of “robots” in our homes that look nothing like humans, and that’s precisely why they work so well. It’s as if someone tried to build a washing machine that mimics people scrubbing clothes in a river, or a vacuum cleaner with arms sweeping the floor, not to mention a dishwasher that uses a sponge and dish soap and then dries the plates with a cloth. Yes - I understand the idea is to make a home assistant with broader functionality than any of the devices I mentioned, but it would probably be far more efficient, stable, and faster if it moved on wheels and had, instead of a five-fingered hand, an arm with a suction surface for handling small and delicate objects, plus grippers for heavier ones.

@Smarttechsolutionllc,That’s the part most people miss. They let fear and skepticism cloud logic. It’s easy to call it marketing hype when you don’t understand the cognitive process behind innovation. These robots have to learn in the wild in real homes with real human behavior not sterile labs. The early buyers aren’t being fooled they’re helping shape the evolution of true autonomy. Fear always ridicules what it doesn’t understand.,6일 전,0,
@Smarttechsolutionllc,"People need to understand that if nobody buys these humanoid robots early, they’ll never get finished. The only way to make them fully autonomous is by learning from real-world use. You can’t perfect human-like intelligence in a lab homes, people, and daily life are the real training grounds. Buying them early isn’t wasting money, it’s contributing to the evolution of the technology itself.",6일 전,0,
@Smarttechsolutionllc,"People keep saying these humanoid robots are being sold “too early,” but that’s literally the only way they’ll ever get smarter. You can’t train real-world autonomy in a lab or simulator homes and human environments are way too unpredictable. They need to be exposed to the chaos, the variables, the noise. Just like how self-driving cars learned from millions of real miles, humanoid robots have to learn from living in real homes. Selling early isn’t marketing hype, it’s a necessary phase of evolution. Without real data, they’ll never reach the level of true intelligence people expect. This person's perspective has nuances to it that people should take into consideration. People should get use to buying them before they are finished because if they do not how are they going to finish them to be fully autonomous?",6일 전,0,

At best we can have one that can pick up your laundry and put them into the washing machine and press the start button or app control the washing machine to start washing. To pick up and wash dishes? That's gonna take another decade. Even longer for cooking and other delicate stuffs. For basic cleaning, the current vacuum and mopping robots are still the more optimal and efficient choice. You don't need humanoid robots for everything. Self driving cars don't need robots, even cooking can be done by automatic cooking machines, probably built together with refrigerator so it can acquire ingredients from the fridge automatically, making the process more autonomous. Humanoid robots are better with transportation tasks, like picking up clothes, clearing the trash, or collecting mail and parcels etc. Or act as companions if it can be advance enough to play soccer or basketball with you, or have sex.

Fake robots that might imminently replace all workers is the same vibes as actual businesses firing real workers for the false promises of AI (actually just LLMs) that can 'do anything and everything'.

@subhadip826,"Hello Sir, I've been a long-time viewer of your excellent content and always thought my comments would get lost in the sea of messages. But, after gathering some courage, I'm finally reaching out in hopes of getting some personalized advice. From next year, I'll be starting college, and I need a reliable phone. This is going to be my very first phone ever, which makes the decision even more significant! My budget is strictly around ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, though I could potentially stretch it to ₹30,000 if there's an exceptional offer worth considering.  Here are my main requirements:  Performance: No high-end gaming or heavy video editing. Normal, everyday usage with occasional moderate use is fine. Most modern phones in this range seem to handle this well enough.  Camera: A good camera for everyday photos is important.  Storage: Decent storage performance (better than UFS 2.0).  Crucial Need: Seamless Multitasking: This is the most important factor. I have a Samsung Book 2 laptop (bought in 2024), and since I'm going for CSE in college (coding, projects, etc.), the ability to multitask effortlessly between my phone and laptop is a major priority.  I'm focused more on my laptop's performance than my phone's, which is why I've already invested heavily in upgrades for my laptop (a Samsung 990 EVO Plus 2TB SSD and 8GB Crucial RAM upgrade, totaling around ₹15,000—almost half my phone budget!). I know you might instinctively suggest a Samsung phone, and while they're good, I feel their models in the ₹20k-₹30k range fall short compared to brands like Vivo or iQOO in terms of specs. For instance, the rumored S24 FE with its Exynos chip is a concern due to potential heating and lower Antutu scores compared to something like an iQOO Neo 10R or a Moto Edge Pro in the ₹25k range. I've also seen issues firsthand; my father's F55 started lagging within just six months. I'm looking for the perfect balance of performance, features, and crucially, that robust ecosystem connectivity for my college journey. Any guidance you could offer would be truly appreciated!

@mrmosk2011,"I agree with most of your points. But I want to argue a little on the opposite side or at least raise some points so we can think about where we are going with this technology.  I think 1X Neo is different from the Rabbit and Humane pin, from a product definition point of view. People never asked for devices like Rabbit and Humane pin, and they can't replace phones since many functions of a phone requires a nice screen. Humanoid robot is something people have been dreamed about for decades if not hundreds of years. If it does what it promises, I want it. I can't say the same for the Rabbit and Humane pin. Even if they do well what they are advertised for, I don't see myself using them. But again, I am with you on how far Neo is from our expectations, or the expectation 1X is trying to sell.  I totally understand the privacy concern, especially when there may be a real person remotely controlling it. I would not want such a thing in my house, or at most limit it to a very small part of my house. And the limit has to be physical, not some virtual fence. On the flip side, Neo may help in a commercial or industrial world. Even if they are only remote controlled, the advantage is to reduce travel time of human. This thing can be planted or shipped to many locations where a human expert can't be at fast enough. But your question of why it has to be in a human shape is valid, because if I want a remote plumber to inspect or fix something, it may be even better for it to be small and with extendable cameras. The only advantage of a humanoid robot is it can fit into a world we designed for human, e.g. stairs, furnitures, even tools. Rather than have many specialized robot, a humanoid robot can take advantage of all the conveniences we already designed for human.  I don't like a company over promise on a product. However, I think the reality is that these new techs cost a lot of money to perfect. Unless there are investors that are willing to put their own money into such companies, they need some products to get some attention to the technology itself. I agree Neo is probably far from reality and very likely to fail, but deep down I want it to success. It is a similar feeling I had when I saw the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004. I knew self driving is possible and we will have it after see that one team completed the course. 20 more years later, we are not completely there, but I think most people would agree it is possible and what's needed now is perfection, ethical and legal discussions. So for me, whether Neo will become a practical product or not is less important. The important thing is that companies feel they are close to create such a product. Similar type of robots are being designed and built in China as well. With AI advancing so fast in the last few years, having the intelligent required is reachable. But before Neo or similar products can be just another appliance in our homes, we definitely have to solve the privacy and safety concerns. That may still be 20 or 50 years from us.  Actually, for the remote control part of the task, I think it is quite valuable. Rather than a caretaker or nurse walking to each senior's room, they can in one place simply switch to different robots close to the patient or resident. It may not be able to do all the things a nurse can do in person, but checking and reminding an elderly to take medicine is very reasonable in VR. I hope such applications can bridge the gap now and our dreamed robot. I think your analogy of Tesla's self-driving strategy applies here.  Again, I enjoy your videos. Not only you shared the tech but made me think or dream.",10일 전(수정됨),0,

@clockwardkailleach,"I appreciate the mention of disabled people. I'm more interested in a remote-operated assistant so an agency can remotely fill in for an absent carer than in trusting an AI corporation to accommodate for my specific needs (which is absolutely not going to happen). I can't speak for other disabled people, but I certainly don't need it to have an able-shaped humanoid form-factor, a cute face or a pair of five-fingered hands. After all, I am privileged to have all of those already; they're wonderful, but they're not what get the job done.  Of course, even in a best-case scenario, it could never replace a carer who's there in the room. I'm obviously a huge proponent of remote working because, y'know, disabled, but that's not a job you can do without the rapport and mutual trust that comes from a single person who can solve problems in the moment. They'd also have to increase care budgets to the point that I can trust the technology and the substitute carer; without a bond of trust it needs to be worth their time to help me, and not worth the potential loss of the job to take advantage of my privacy or otherwise abuse or neglect me.   I'm not paranoid and I quite like people, but I'm eventually going to come across the rare bad egg and that rare bad egg could end my life very easily, and I say that as one of the harder-to-kill disabled people. After all, oversight can only go so far, and that involves living with even less privacy. Good pay isn't a sufficient solution either, and honestly my main motivation for better-paid carers is that they've more than earned it, but much of my life already relies on someone working just above minimum wage and I'm going to have trouble with that if they're not also a person I can trust.  AI, again, isn't a solution. They are not going to have my specific experiences in their training data, much less someone with even more complex issues than I do. We can't train assistance dogs in factories and even my actual human carers come to me having to learn everything about my specific needs over the course of months. Even as a fill-in, I'm not trusting an AI with my medication, and, again, I'm pretty privileged with the ability to see and operate a pill container for myself. If people are going to be reliant on this technology, there needs to be human involvement at every level; even if hell freezes over and AI is all it's cracked up to be a month from now, the LLM craze has destroyed understanding and trust in intelligent technology, both of which are necessary for disabled people to rely on technology.  Of course, the real danger is that these decisions end up being made for disabled people. It not always willingly that we use the technology available to us, and this may be no different. I would suggest a high level of caution when talking about this technology for that reason; if they decide to pivot to talking to our governments without our involvement, things could get very dangerous, very fast.  I can only speak for myself, but this sort of thing worries me.  Thank you for reading.",11일 전,0,

And when you're shooting for a really ambitious product maybe you do a scaled down version first that only requires testing more limited use cases and then if that product does well enough you can take what you learned developing it, as well as whatever money that it makes, and plow that into making the more fully-featured product.   Companies have just gotten way too comfortable offloading their product development onto consumers so that they can make their shareholders more short term profits.",11일 전,0,

Plus it simply won't have enough utility even if it does ALL the tasks they demonstrated, for $20k.  Not a chance almost anyone would pay that.  You could literally hire a maid to come to your house every week and do those chores and clean the home with expert precision, for years and years before it would have added up to $20k.  Imagine it turns the gas on the hob on and then just freezes until the house explodes...  Or any number of other seriously dangerous 'glitch' moments.  The Tesla comparison is a good one, which has itself been hard and arduous a challenge enough for their team to develop good models for that are now useful.

This is not really that huge news. Don't get too hyped. It's not even that advanced. It's not even that articulated. If anything, this should be worked on more before releasing this officially. It's too early. We'll just have to wait and see. I want to see an offline, no Wi-fi robot, with massive memory capabilities and can work more than five hours duration. This video says it basically, but maybe you should cover about the Wi-Fi issue and and some cognition limits. Recall, this is not quantum computing but basic classic computing. So, the reality is far from it. This feels more like a stop motion doll than anything. Maybe if you like that aesthetic and slowness. For me, it's still much too noise from the media.

I would presume that a person would be needed 100% initially, then the reliance begins to decrease as operations become part of the systems routine.   When I worked as an Autonomous Driving Trainer, we would sit in the car and let it drive us around for hours. Much of the time initially we would have to take over, note bugs, verify it's behaviors and so on. Each evening the data was sent to the Engineers who would use it to advance the programming, correct issues, etc.   This is likely going to be no different than putting autonomous vehicles on the road, where there need to be trainers present through the maturation process. Over time the trainers will be needed less and less.   None of that should be a surprise, but they do need to be far far more clear about that aspect of it's utility.",2주 전,0,

@goomyman23,"this is the problem with all humanoid robots - what are they going to do for you?  The humanoid form if a general form - you want to min / max - especially at cost.   Need to vacuum your house?  Get a roomba.   Need to cook?  Buy pre-made dinners.  Need to get a drink from the fridge - get up and get your own drink - seriously.   How lazy are you.    Need to do the dishes - we have dishwashers.  Laundry - well one day they might have a useful sorting device.  The point is - that the humanoid robot just serves no function that cant be better done by something else - carrying things and following you around is not a worth 20k.   The only obvious usecase that makes it worth it is companionship... and this doesnt just mean the kind we are all thinking of.    But seriously - it has no function worth even the cost of electricity and maintenance and until AI becomes sentient it never will.  We need to start having a serious conversation about CEOs and companies mismarketing their products - we had this with so many products that end up with billion dollar evaluations off of lies.   Remember Magic Leap... it doesnt matter if you label something as ""demo"" or whatever if you heavily imply - ""this is what this is capable of"" as the magic leap demo videos were followed up with and this is what people are playing in the office today.   Of course if they were it was something 100x less impressive.   And this is what Elon has done to build an empire - ""you will be able to add your car to a robotaxi network - next year!"" or ""we will fly to mars"" or ""we will build 10k humanoid robots this year!""... everyones been taking notes - Jeff Bezo - ""we will have a million people living in space at the end of the decade"" or all the fusion reactors that will supposedly have fusion power to the grid in a couple of years but have shown nothing operational that would imply that they could.  Its all IMO scams... maybe one day the technology can get us there,  I have no doubt that we will be capable of producing self driving cars.  But you should not be allowed to sell a product that doesnt exist at least to public investors.   If you go out and say that your going to build 10,000 humanoid robots by the end of 2025 - you need to show that when you made that statement that you had the capability to do so and that those robots had some sort of utility worth buying... because it certainly feels like lying.",2주 전(수정됨),0,

At least if it could be immediately useful, they could proceed rolling out updates for other tasks. This would be the correct way to do this instead of having a robot that's terrible at everything.

@samhurton9308,"At the end of this video - ""..... I look like an ..""  well, maybe in fact you are, not insult intended. All your video is about gap between possible expectations of real autonomy and actual capabilities which will be delivered next year. As legitimate as this concern is, it's the least important problem which we, humans will face with this technology.  Does anyone have any doubts that these systems will improve and learn?  And they will do it fast, arguably much faster than some folks may think.  That MINOR issue, the gap, will close if not in 2026, then 2028, 2030 or even a bit later, but it will.  That's what is really important. Now let's start thinking WHERE is it going?  It clearly can deliver a lot of advantages to humans, but how about not so good, or in fact completely undesirable?  Or, may I say, outright dangerous?   I would dare to state that risks are as enormous and as fundamental as one can get, on zillion of different parameters being so psychological or physical.  And ultimately, if Super Intelligent AI in fact will come to life, then all bets are off.  And I mean ALL  As one famous prof said the extinction of humanity maybe not the ultimate worst case.  Next level is using humans as an objects to learn from, that AI will improve itself even faster.  Torture any one?  Then torture coupled with life extension technologies?   When you will dream and pray to die and not being allowed?   We need to start to think about really serious stuff while it's not too late.

Answering the door? Smart lock and motorized hinge attachment. Vacuuming? Roombas have been a thing for over 20 years. Laundry? While not total automation, 2-in-1 washer/dryers exist. What something like this would be good for, item retrieval/transportation, cooking, cleaning counters and tables, while not nothing, are, as you said, clearly something the 'AI' won't be fully capable of for a while, and most intelligent people wouldn't trust it to do it right for a while longer.   Honestly, the most likely avenue I see for this tech, especially as the VR interface improves, is something like a telecommuting live-in housekeeper service sort of thing. Which isn't necessarily a bad route for it to go down. Zero risk of disease communication, no commute time or having to live somewhere else, having the robot only call for a pilot when something is requested would allow for more efficient use of human resources than having one person on call per house at all times, minimized risk of staff being physically abused, etc. It would almost certainly still be a luxury service, but a much more practical one.",2주 전(수정됨),0,

@EStrade2174,"While I agree with your main concern about the large gap between Neo's current capability vs. his ideal/final stage, it does feel  some of your concerns are somewhat biased and/or influenced by fear of the unknown. In particular, you mentioned the need for Neo getting the right medicine(s) right for an elderly person. Common sense should rule here. That is, I personally would not fully delegate this task to Neo, or not even a helper/human for that matter (We all know humans definitely make mistakes too!). I might instead dispense said medicines in a ready to serve pill container. A simpler task I may be more comfortable w/ a robot (or human maid) doing. Teleoperation training: This is not an open ended event. That is, a teleoperated Neo does not get to roam endlessly around the house. And you do get to decide if & when you want such training for Neo, then schedule it, and eventually approve for such event to start. Once done, teleoperation is done. I could see maybe ~5 training sessions for complex tasks like doing a full laundry cycle. The AI should be smart enough to take it from there. Similarly for other tasks around the house. From what I've seen how fast AI learns, I think this is more realistic than expecting Neo to endlessly roam around not knowing how to do things. Weight/sturdiness: Neo's light weight is definitely intentional. While true that Neo has strength limitations, his abilities are actually on-par with what is needed for daily house chores. from a safety perspective, I personally wouldn't want a much heavier robot with Terminator like strength. The chances for real, more serious, accidents exponentially increases the heavier and stronger the robot gets. Cost: I agree, $20K sounds like a lot, but cost analysis vs. human labor quickly shows Neo's cost effectiveness. For instance, here in CA, even at a base wage of $25/hr. this translates to ~$4300/mo. ($51,600/yr.). So, Neo would quickly pay for itself in less than 6 months! But personally and practically speaking, I would opt for the monthly subscription which is basically a 6 mo. lease. I'm definitely willing/able to afford 6 months of Neo, and see how useful it would be for me and my elderly mother at home.

In terms of working out how far away we are from these aspirations becoming reality and how the various competitors are doing it would be very interesting to know just how much of that Tesla/Optimus event was using telepresence and how things have progressed since then.  And of course can anyone forget the initial reveal of Optimus when the robot that Musk bought on stage was some guy dancing in a knitted Optimus costume? That was truly bizarre.,2주 전,0,

My Husqavarna 315x mows my lawn, not a humanoid robot filling gas into my mower, priming, starting and pushing the mower around my yard.  A self driving car is not ""driven"" by a humanoid robot sitting in the drivers seat.  Our clothes dryer is not a humanoid robot taking the clothes out of the washer, taking them outside and hanging them on a clothes line.  The example shows a humanoid robot opening the door, why?  Everyone has door bell cameras, so when you want the door opened just tell your smart device to open the front door.   Every where we go doors automatically open for us.  So maybe the hinges on your door need to be replaced by some kind of powered hinges to automatically open your door for you.  Our trash/recycle pick up was done by a truck driver and a couple of guys hanging off the back.  But now its just the driver, he pulls up to your cans, pushes a button and a huge arm spins around, grabs your cans and dumps into the truck.  How long before that is an AI based truck?  There are obviously thousands of scenarios and I cant cover them all.  Laundry?  Well maybe that's a smart hamper.  When it gets to a certain weight then it drives itself into a ""machine"" that pulls/sucks out all the clothes, washes, dries and folds them?  Dunno.

We just use what we have. Robots don't need the same appendages. Why do you think we invented forklifts? A robot should have some sort of lever that can carry heavy boxes with ease. I guess being human shaped is to try to put some kind of humanity into the tech to make it less off putting? But to me it looks uncanny and just plain inefficient.

If they have a million robots in 1000 different factories that training data plus the car data will give them a significant advantage in a home environment. 3.

@lyondhur,"Generational shifting products are simply NOT built by incrementation.   There was a Blackberry.. then there was an iPhone. No transition, just a solid shift. A new paradigm that obliterates the old one.   There are too many Agile coaches around tech now, where deep-thinking designers should be.   This is what I call a Investor-Customer 2-Narratives Project -- which is basically now how the Valley, VC groups or other tech hubs worldwide hype each other and invest like they were born to interbreed. :)   This class of project fundamentally sells to Investors* the idea that it is feasible to ""just start somewhere, and then iterate"" but, conversely, it sells to Consumers* that this very low functionality/feature bar IS the new paradigm, the new shift.   It is not. It is just a start. In fact, more like a ""premature Swiss-knife prototype"" turned into a commercial offer. Not truly good for anything. Not ready. Not solving any real issues. Just sufficiently story-told to grab the early adopter's brain.    If early adopters jump, investors and speculators put more money down, in the hopes the story earns another chapter now in the hands of the regular consumer. It doesn't REALLY need to be finished, ready or actually do anything meaningfully right or completely. It just needs to fly... because the consumer says so.   So far as we can see, the consumer does NOT really want robots. Founders do. Hence this cash-fest of small increment building nothing, for nobody, with no real immediate purpose or solution, but with a magnanimous dream-like offer.. for some day in the future.   @Mkbhd is right on the money when he says ""why not unlock my door with a voice-based app?"" for the consumer. However, if he said that to the other side (investors, speculators, bs product founders and other wave-riders), he would be a ""hater of innovation"" or someone without any real vision.    This building practice got us all used to the idea that an unfinished future-promising (but not delivering) prototype should be enough to make capital hungry speculators cash huge on ""early adopters"".

@Carlos-ym4og,"Well, to the CEO's credit, he was transparent and didn't lie. From the beginning, he said that behind the robot, there could be a person for certain tasks, those that are more complicated for an AI, and that this would serve to train the AI so that at some point it can perform these tasks on its own. On the other hand, there is another approach that can be taken with this, and that is remote work. It will be possible to hire people who live in other places or even in other countries without those people needing to be in the countries where they do the work, provided there is a good internet signal, and specialized on both sides. This will be perfectly possible with top-quality Starlink antennas (ideally more powerful than those used in homes) on both sides (where the robot is located and where the operator is). This could lead to job creation in developing countries, eliminating the need for migration. This applies not only to domestic work but especially to factories, construction, livestock farming, and agriculture. The point is, AIs are still a ways off from achieving the same dexterity and precision as humans. Of course, they will already be able to perform some tasks, but they will be more rudimentary, such as vacuuming (they will struggle with a broom). AIs can move parts from one shelf to another, but inserting a bolt is much more difficult.",2주 전,0,

It should maybe be less human shaped, optimized for stability and strength, but then this device could be in homes helping people who need in home care. Having this device to help lift someone, or even call 911, or help elderly people with tasks, while tapping into remote possibilities. Time zones are no longer an issue, physical limitations are no longer an issue, language barriers can be overcome easily. You could have someone on the other side of the world controlling this device to help people 24/7. This isn't a robot, and doesn't need to be.

@zroku123,"its just like teaching a child how to do house chores. yes at the moment its not capable to do all the things yet. but over time as it ""overviews"" a person controlling it. it will eventually be able to achieve it. i believe it should have been advertised more as a training data product and open to participants over calling it a product. however in 10 or 15 years of training data. this robot could potentially be a full fledged housekeeper, but it needs time to be trained for this.  also i want to mention.  most ultra high tech things are advertised to the ultra rich before the tech becomes cheaper to make and therefore available for the average person. take HD TV and OLED TV, when it was created it was extremely expensive. now you can find them in walmart. basically, people have too much high hopes for products like this without realizing where in the R&D process its at. NEO is in the early bata stage, a prototype has been created and many tasks are possible. but now all thats left is AI training and refining the product. after these steps you could easily see NEO in walmart for everyone to own",2주 전,0,

@benjamincastle3469,"The internet is a bizarre place.  Especially YouTube.  We finally have a product that can start to deliver the future that had been thought to be so, so, so much farther off in the future. Until 8 years only those following AI and working in the field had any idea what the future MIGHT hold (it was just starting to take shape in the greatest minds in AI on the planet).  But the world didn't notice a thing.  Then one fateful day, November 30th 2022, Open AI released, free, ChatGPT upon the world. Nothing would ever be the same again because the future was here and we had NO IDEA HOW IT WORKED!  It's like the social isolation from social media terrified everyone so badly it made everyone completely incapable of celebrating  ever again. And even a sudden concept like legit AI (I prefer AR; Artificial Reasoning) performing miracles every 3 months, then month, then 2-weeks, then week, then days, then day.......  Then suddenly one day it happened. AI was making advances so quickly that no one could keep up anymore. We had known by the concept of recursion that it would be fast, but we still weren't ready. Just 3 years after that day in 2022 we have gone from a model that can do a decent rhyme, to the models we see today. Global priorities have changed forever. The moto; Win at all costs. Politics has changed forever. The moto; again, Win at all costs.  And somehow we see all of this once in a life-time insanity and, against all odds and logic, people, who are too afraid to do anything but repeat what every other ""EdgeLord69: Negative Comment Master Edition - Now with extra nasally sarcasm AND Lifetime Loneliness +12 and Dissatisfaction + 10 buffs,  are making jokes about the greatest technological period this planet will ever see.  Let me explain what made everyone so utterly out of touch with reality. Its fairly simple. But only if you were a computer and tech nerd in 1989. Which, by the way, was fucking no-one in this comment section right now, except for maybe 3 geriatric cunts. In 1993 no one alive bragged about having a PC except to their very, very best of friends. The reason: If you talked about PC's in high school in '93, you know what happened?..   Goodbye anus virginity at lunch break.  1 - None talked about computers. Ever.  But a change was coming. Computer games were getting amazingly fun. Popular kids suddenly had no option to admit - Consoles were pretty cool; Bye virtue of the Arcade Games that came before them.  Respect Achievement: UNLOCKED!  Then came the Bulletin Boards (nerd city). Then came the Early Internet in 98 or whenever. This is something that even me, a junior network administrator barely noticed. The public; they didnt understand it for years. With it came free music and video... at 1 pixel per minute. But that sped up and suddenly free music and eventually free movies became possible. Again the Nerds had done it. They had made the impossible - possible.  Cool Achievement: UNLOCKED!  But alas, Big Business was getting involved. Metallica sued for copyright. They wanted us to pay for shit again. The problem was, they couldn't enforce it. The wealthy trembled and plotted for ways to make money and tried* (Tried: [past tense] To attempt do a thing and fail like a little b*tch) to bring back wealth inequality.   Technology Is Cool Achievement: UNLOCKED!  Then came Microsoft. Google. PayPal. Adobe. Fruity loops etc, etc, and we pirated everything we could. And it was good.  But Google. Microsoft. Intel. IBM etc had started laying the ground work for something big... and were biding their time.  Then a new guy showed up out of nowhere. It was called The Facebook. We didn't know it then but things were about to change forever. The now 'Facebook' burst onto the scene, along with Instagram and eventually Twitter. Life was about to change forever. You see: It was becoming obvious  to business' around the world that you HAD to be online to stand a chance of surviving. And thats what the world did, it went online where 'the kids' were. And humanity paid a heavy price. Socialising - Gone. Friends - Gone. Casual sex - Gone. House parties - On life support. Pubs/Clubs - On life support. Doing 'random fun shit' with mates - gone. Hanging out at the servo on Friday night simply because you could - Gone... and Feminism - Blowing up but lacking any purpose, like a Gen-Z penis on Saturday night.  Finally, TikTok entered the chat. And all was ""officially"" lost.  But then the stirrings of a miracle. You see that brief window of ""Cool + Respect"" got some brilliant minds thinking about the next big thing. They had read about it in Sci-Fi books and magazines for their entire lives. It was of course the idiotic concept of Artificial Intelligence (the general concept that is, not what we incorrectly call AI today) had seemed like a total pipe dream for 40 years. It still seemed 100 years away in 2000. But now those brilliant minds were starting to say insane things like ""Maybe it wasn't idiotic?"". So they started thinking.  It was hard, slow and they had little to show for its efforts. But they carried on in the darkness unperturbed. Every now and then it made a small headline for an improved spelling option or a language translator. Nothing much. 'Watson' won Jeopardy. No one cared.. or even knew what was happening. Something called Alexnet in 2012 that no one but the most hardened machine learning enthusiasts knew about was born.  Then one day in 2016 Google's behemoth narrow AI called AlphaGo beat probably the best Go player, and 9-dan champion Lee Sedol. This had been considered impossible. Humans had spent probably millennia playing Go and most pro players dedicated their entire lives to mastering it. It was a huge moment that birthed 'move 37' which was studied ad nauseum. And so a gentle rumble started.  The very next year Google released an unassuming paper called ""attention is all you need"" and it opened the flood gates. Open AI, a start-up funded by Elon Musk took the paper and ran with it. Meanwhile DOTA 2 fell to The Open AI 5. Then Googles 'Alpha Star' beat a group of top Starcraft 2 players. As a lifetime fan of the game I shed a tear that day... even though it wasn't seen as a fair win. It demonstrated that an AI could outperform the best in the world at real-time decision making. What was worse; they had to restrict the AI's 'thoughts' (measured in APM - Actions Per Minute) to that of the best pro StartCraft 2 player.. and it still destroyed them with its un-Godly Blink Stalker 'micro' alone.  Beating humans at their games had gone from impossible to inevitable in a decade. AI won Texas Hold-em but nerds dont care about poker, so no one cared much. Finally ChatGPT was released in 2022 and the rest we know.  So my point is simple..  Oh wait, Alpha fold predicted the 3D shape of all 200 million known protein shapes with 95% accuracy. No big deal.  Anyway.. my point is simple.. I had to watch and wait for a decade as those things lost to AI. Now things like that happen every single day but on levels that are far, far more impressive. In fact they are so many and so impressive that we cant even keep up, let alone explain anything.  We live in a time when unthinkable miracles happen nearly every day. And it is only getting faster. Yet already it seems like the unquenchable pessimism and glazed with boredom eyes, of the internet can barely bring itself to give a sarcastic slow-clap to. THE MOST INSANE SHIT THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED. And will continue to do EVERYDAY, possibly FOREVER.  If an AI robot with God-like knowledge, is running around your house doing whatever you tell it to do, and you still arent impressed. ""Zen zher ish no pleeshing you"". Ever I suspect.",2주 전,0,

I've been thinking for a while that we really need to get our definitions down for AIs that deserve ethical consideration versus those that do not because they are essentially a more advanced screwdriver. It's ok to enslave a screwdriver, but not a 'near human' whatever that means. We can agree here is a line *somewhere*. And when we get into the territory of making one device/intelligence that is responsible for a wide variety of very different complex tasks, and especially of learning, understanding and integrating with a social unit (the family), I think we are approaching the danger zone for accidentally creating something that it would be unethical to enslave. Even if version 1.0 is nothing to worry about, the quest for performance will drive us closer and closer to the line as we make these household servants more capable. Compare this to a Roomba, which is more like the very advanced screwdriver. It has one job that it's specialised for and so its 'AI', if it needs any, can be relatively simple.

@ToddMikosh,"I suspect that these robots will have local AI, so that they are learning about your house and training just that one instance of the AI program to know about your house.  Sure, the company's teleoperator will be able to memorize your house while he or she is training the robot's AI, but the extent of what that local AI will need to learn is YOUR house.  And each robot will have different training data which is unique to the individual house that it's in, and none of the other robots will have that data because they are in different houses. The AI in Tesla cars have to be trained on the roads for everybody--but you have to remember that the roads that we all travel, and the traffic situations that we all confront, are the same for everybody.  Each state has unique laws, but all the roads are public to all the cars.  That one robot that you buy will be trained on YOUR house because that's all it needs to know about.

@gerbialkerbial6153,I think the most sucsessful AI companies are ones that create a product that serves a useful purpose other than it's AI abilities. i.e Tesla. Yes those that opt in to self driving and pay the money for it are allowed to reap the benefits of a growing technology but those that would rather not spend the extra money also get a product that just works. Which is what allows these companies to stay afloat while devolping their technologies. No one cares that Tesla FSD and Apple Intelegence aren't perfect yet because their products also serve a purpose that the everyday person can use. Companies like 1X and The Humaine Pin sturggle in the market becuase their products only pertain to the early adopters who are okay with purchasing a half-finished product; Which signifactly limits their funding and leads to their ultimate bankruptcy.,2주 전,0,

@DifficultName,"Honestly the biggest thing holding bad humanoid robotics right now may be the lack of sensory perception. It's not enough to stick some cameras and microphones on a mannequin head and then use state estimation to figure out where each rigid body part is. It needs to be able to feel if something is touching it. It needs to be able to distinguish between the tactile properties of something sticky versus something smooth. It needs to be constantly aware of itself as a whole. Without that, you just can't get the refined adaptive behavior that you need to make sure it can handle things carefully or avoid knocking things over or avoid falling over. That means it has to be weak and slow just to do a fraction of the things you would want, and even that is assuming it has fine motor abilities (which this thing clearly does not).

@thelostminerllc,I could be wrong but I could see janitorial services companies being early adopters for this robot or be really good candidates to early adopt. One of the top services that companies complain about is their janitorial service provider; beta testing this thing working along side human cleaners would really give good training data for this robot. Clients of janitorial service providers would probably have to pay a premium at first during the training stage and benefit from the savings later but many large companies with deep pockets may be willing to pay for this service because its so difficult to get consistency in a cleaning service. I agree the early adoption phase will have its challenges but I think there is big demand for this service as well and it will succeed long term. I'm sure we will see tons of content on these humanoid robots as they are rolled out next year. Exciting times. Great video!,2주 전,0,

That doesn’t make them any less impressive but you can imagine how someone might walk away from these videos thinking that the company has developed a set of fully autonomous humanoid robots when the reality is that these are very much just R&D projects.

But home assistance can be trained in non-public environments that do not require public consensus where no risks can take place for any human. They need to arrange various indoor testing environments like with various washing machines, rooms structures and stuff, but all can be done behind closed doors.

@JaapvanderVelde,"Here's a different perspective: if you could pay $500 to have an autonomous robot do all your chores, and whenever it couldn't, someone from an Indian call centre teleports into your house to do the chores instead and you can geofence them and be guaranteed they can't see certain things - that sounds like an OK deal already. If over time the teleporting needs to happen less and less, that's even better.

They got customers already ... many people will buy from them just because they are established. And by the time other robots will come , they will catch up and be as good.

A machine that is almost okay at turning on the machine that always gets the dishes washed correctly and quickly is stupid. If you are the agent, your dishwasher was your immediate-most subagent, but now you've needlessly added an intermediate subagent. Also these models are data-hungry where your brain isn't.

This kind of product just externalizes a whole lot of environmental harm and results in new e-waste...

That kind of optimization is usually one you'd see like a stupid undergrad in an intro comp sci class doing, and is sometimes called premature optimization.

And because it doesn't need an extended arm with someone/something attached to that arm means it can get under things without the obstruction s caused by the 'human shaped' way of doing it. And why would a robot need to use a smartphone? Wouldn't it be able to interact through Bluetooth or some kind of similar adaptive device. It is a computer, it can interface with computers without touching it?   I think we keep trying to find a one fits all solution when specific chore devices (like  the Roomba) end up b ing just a new way to do an old chore once you disconnect the idea of the old way it was shaped. I also think 2 legs vs wheels or a more balanced ""lower"" is what makes most of these humanoid robots so prone to falling over.",2주 전,0,

The idea of this robot is to have just one sinlge robot that can do all the task in the already existing human home. And for this kind of robot the question is: human shape or not human shaped? For this kind of robot I think having a shape that is instantly compatibe with ALL the tools is the most usefull approach. Edit: About the smartphone thing:  why? because it just works, no matter what. Imagine you want him to do something inside an app for you. when he can use a smartphone it works. is the app using bluetooth? maybe not?

@DawnofNerdlife," @HolidayAtHome You really think by the time this technology works, an advanced robot will have bluetooth barriers.   And yes, I do think dedicated objects work better around the home in many cases. Like the roomba is decent as what it does because it doesn’t need to be designed to do anything else. My pets auto feeder is good at what it does, because that’s all it does. Deliver Food to animal at a times interval I set.   And what’s mostly been happening with a lot of smart devices is they are extensions of a single controller (often your phone). But the design of the actual device that does the work (the roomba and auto feeder for example) doesn’t need to do extra things, making it better designed for the task its doing instead of over complicating it with stuff you don’t need it to do.   Also, under what world would I need a robot to use my phone? There are already accessibility devices, so it doesn’t even help those folks out. I see smart devices filling the gap already upon which a robot is either an unneeded redundancy or filler for lazyness.",13일 전,0,
@HolidayAtHome," @DawnofNerdlife  ok then you are the guy with a backpack filled with an mp3 player, a camera, a phone, a internet communicator, a GPS device, a card reader, a video game console and a flashlight and I'm the guy that just has a smartphone in his pocket ;)  Of course your devices are better doing their own jobs,  but what are people carrying around in the end? The one single thing that does everything good enough . Of couse,  some have a dedicated camera or video game console, but noone wants to buy the full backpack anymore or skip having a smartphone because they have a dedicated camera. MP3 player and internet communicator even vanished because the smartphone just did it good enough because their own task was too easy to perform with a general purpose device. I guess feeding your pets will also be a task too easy to perform by a general purpose robot.  Imagine people starting their own household in 10-20 years when that robot tech is really matured. Will they really buy 20 different robots that just can do one task that takes just minutes or even seconds and do nothing all day long? Or one robot that can do it all and potentially do additional thing in the future with just a software update because the physical robot is build for general purpose?  I guess you won't convince them with your 20 robot approach just because your feeding robot is so unbelievable hyper great at feeding your pets...putting food from one container into another while doing absolutely nothing for 23 hours and 59 minutes a day.

@DawnofNerdlife," @HolidayAtHome As a person who camps, yes in certain situations it has been useful to have an actual flashlight over a phone, because a camping torch is better than a phone flashlight in pitch dark camping grounds. Most cameras are in phones, but legit photographers and cinematographers still prefer and use dedicated pro cameras.   Also on rural roads while camping I did keep a gps in the glove bocks because when the phone couldn’t connect, it often got me safely to a main highway where then the smartphone would take over. The robot isn’t replacing the vacuum (unless it suddenly gets attachments) it still needs to use it. Its not becoming the dishwasher, its loading it, its not being the water dispenser, its using it. And right now some of these devices are already growing more smart independently and being switched out to smart devices as there predecessors die out. With smart home controls tbat don’t require a metal being navigating your home. And the smartphone already exist as a controller for  multiple smart devices that are having their own natural tech improvements of which a robot would be an add, not a  replace anyway. I think there will be a place for robots, but I don’t know that place is ‘consumer home servants’ (Especially not this wobbly thing).   But yes, the future will define itself and its often show to not be what we think.",12일 전,0,

@Aisaaax,"Yeah, I wouldn't trust a company that claims that ""it just needs more data"" but can't show even the simplest autonomous demonstrations. I mean, sure, OK, you need more data. Couldn't you make 1 room for a demo and train the robot to recognize all objects in THAT room? Because you don't need a ton of data to recognize 1 type of cup or 1 green sweater that's always the same. The fact that they don't have even that minimal example tells me that they don't HAVE an actual autonomous algorithm finished even. If they have it at all. This will be another expensive gadget that cashes in on 1000 fools worldwide who have 20K for a cool toy - and then goes out of business most likely.  The business strategy here is probably to hire some workers in India for extremely low wages and have them clean your house in America. And not even bother developing the actual AI or collecting data.  Also, what about the maintenance? One of the MAJOR factors in making a commercial consumer-grade bipedal robot is that those joint motors wear out REALLY fast. We're talking weeks and months. I don't expect this robot to have solved that - otherwise it'd be front and center in their marketing. So the danger here is yes, it will work (as much as you can call the current state working) for a few months, and then it will need $800 knee replacement. And then a month later $1000 hip replacement. And it will basically keep wearing out on a loop every few months, most likely.",2주 전,0,

And how well does it actually work in the real world? Even though autonomous driving is a huge technical challenge, it’s still probably a lot simpler than getting a humanoid robot to move safely through someone’s home and perform a bunch of different household tasks. If a product like that ever truly worked, I’d expect the entry price to be somewhere in the six-figure range. So my prediction: this thing’s going to flop. The Juicero Press of 2026.

Mental illness?   There are different tools for all of these it's not one size fits all like this. Some tools need strength to support a human being and others need to be light and portable.

@keaswaran0,"If there were going to be one tool that could help many different people with many different tasks, then very likely this tool would have to be human-shaped. The tasks that a person used to be able to do by themself can, pretty much by definition, be done by a skilled-enough being that is human shaped. It's very unlikely that a non-human-shaped tool is going to be able to be as broadly helpful as a hypothetical effective human-shaped robot.  But precisely because a human-shaped robot would have to be able to do so many different things, so safely, on the basis of the kinds of tactile information that we've never gathered into recordings for training data, it's very unlikely that anything like this will be available soon.  It's a bold move for this company to try to get an army of tele-operated robots in people's homes, so that human operators can practice doing these tasks with a robot body, to generate the training data that some hypothetical future robots might be able to learn from to do these tasks on their own.

@EstranhoMundodeEstrela,"Outras preocupações (além das clássicas dos ""robôs dominarem o mundo"", que é bem possível devido não aos robôs em sim, mas a IA... ) são, será que os humanos estão prontos para isso? Mesmo com toda a ""segurança"" (burlável, principalmente com hackers...), não seria possível usar esses robôs para fazerem mal aos outros? De alguma forma? Será que vão pensar em todo tipo de maldade que o humano é capaz de fazer para impedir/bloquear que os robôs façam? E minha questão, será que as próprias pessoas não fariam maldades com esses robôs? Poxa, já vi vídeos de pessoas/crianças com apoio dos pais destruíndo robôs só porque sim, só porque para eles é legal... quase no estilo do filme AI: Inteligência Artificial... bem doentio, como pessoas cruéis, muitas delas psicopatas, fazendo suas maldades com os robôs ""porque não sentem nada""... cadeirantes também não sentem e nem por isso se deve fazer algo ruim/danoso contra eles... ""ah, mas robôs não têm sentimentos""... são muitos ""argumentos"" que percebo ainda mais a doença da maldade do ser humano... tenho dó da humanidade no futuro próximo e tenho dó dos robôs nas mãos de pessoas ruins também, pois pra mim, indifere fazer maldade com algo ou alguém, isso diz sobre a essência, caráter... das pessoas... se faz maldades com um ser inanimado, fará com um ser vivo. E uma questão bônus, a frase ""você sempre estará no controle"" é o que as pessoas querem ouvir, mas sabemos que isso não é verdade, cada vez mais arrumam jeitos de colocarem espiões dentro das casas das pessoas e roubarem seus dados e sua privacidade em troca de ""conforto"", ""praticidade""... e outros adjetivos preferidos... e terem total controle sobre sua vida e o que faz... é bem parecido com vender a alma para o demônio, não vejo diferença...

For example: as a lad of 14, I was sent off to a military school where there was a very specific way to fold clothes, make beds, etc. Most of the training was done before it started: I knew what a bed was, what sheets were, what it means to fold things, what a shelf was. Also, the process was explained to me procedurally by my more experienced peers, and finally, by correcting my first attempts.

NEO has kept the human in the loop, which is the key to success with early stage AI products.  With V1’s capabilities, they can outsource the tele-operation to locations with labour supply and achieve massive scale.  Using that same principle, NEO can use teleoperation to train the robot on each unique house it operates in, learning where the fridge, dishwasher, washing machine and cupboards are. Keep doing that until the software learns to do it with little to no human control — just like Tesla self driving, Waymo, SpaceX Starship, etc.  This is a great vision of the future which is not too distant.

The robot correctly identified the spice bottle as Cayenne pepper. Then the guy asks ""where are my glasses?"", Neo tells him they're hanging off his shirt collar/pocket. Then guy asks him ""can i use this in my chilli"", Neo tells him sure, just be careful how much as it can make it really spicy. Now...how long before some dummy puts his glasses in some chilli cause Neo told him to, then turns around and sues the company into oblivion for trying to poison/kill him? 2. You're gonna end up with a bunch of clueless ""operators"" in India somewhere, that'll be controlling these robots in your house. They'll have access to their remote camers, mics, and be able to physically touch and move objects around. How long before the f-ckery starts? Stolen personal info, various pranks, retaliation against annoying customers, or other malicious behavior? 3. What if I want to train the robot to pleasure me? That means an operator most likely has to take over and manually perform that activity? If I'm a guy...and the operator is a dude...does that make me gay? Or is it like schrodingers box...as long as I don't know who the operator is it, all possibilities remain open? 4. You own the robots here in the US. Labor laws don't apply to them.

Tesla’s car technology is going to end up correctly into their robots. Tesla is way ahead of the game on everything in these personal home robots I pretty much guarantee and they’ll be the first one to make it work. This project is great that you’re looking at, but I think it is over promising that you are describing me in your video. I do not think it will ever have a true AI. It will be taught program algorithms that are done at the appropriate times. It will be able to mimic and watch humans and mildew algorithms to follow what they’re doing our program remotely from a 3-D visor and controllers. I think Tesla is the only one that’s working on a true AI you need to go look at each AI trying to have a normal conversation with it, tested on its knowledge and when it screws up, ask why it made the mistake. I’ve been doing this over the AIS for years and the difference between the AI is night and day between the different versions. Nothing works as they say most of them be able to scan or listen to what you’re saying, running against their database and then give you an appropriate response I think you won’t. It’s not really thinking is taking what you say. It matched it to an algorithm.. I think when you’ll do that you’ll find Grok way ahead of the other ones in the ways it would count for home automatio   Personal care or nursing aids will be the thing that all of these products will be targeting to meet because $20,000 versus a salary for somebody for you 5 to 10 years yeah Insurance‘s gonna pay for the robot and to maintenance instead of human labor, the cost it will save will be tremendous and will rework Home healthcare. But I think we’re 5 to 10 years away from that still. I think Tesla will be number one on that the others will copy and steal from Tesla to improve theirs as China usually does. But even if a company had a bank of 100 of these robots and 10 or 20 people to operate them remotely could be viable in the next year or two especially in home health cause the problem right now is a lot of these people need help small spurts throughout the day but the way Insurance pays for it. They only get two or three hours a day so insurance companies have to pick when they’re gonna have somebody there when there’s the biggest leak having this robot there even remotely operated would give a lot better coverage.

@Solarclip16,"Lowkey hilarious because there's a reason why most robots are not humanoid. Making humanoid robots to do multiple tasks is inefficient when you can make a robot that does everything with better placement of things like its optics. Also we already did this sort of robot cleaner thing with roombas. And those were terrible. This is just a larger roomba.  A larger, clumsier, possibly more destructive, roomba. I mean think about the battery for example. We already have scooters that have the possibility of combusting and being a fire hazard. This could really be a danger. Not to mention like in the video, this robot already does what we all can do- but worse. And it's remote controlled? Might as well hire a nanny at that point. They'd do a much better job of actually cleaning the house and stuff. We, well more like the tech companies as a whole, are WAY too into making tech appear as human as possible. I want my robots to stay looking like robots. I don't need to make an emotional connection to it- it's already easy enough. Robots are appealing through their robotness and I am tired of the idea that robots should look human. What was that thing about like, the uncanny valley? That started with robots iirc.",2주 전,0,

It’s ridiculous. We have to remember that england produced 4Terawatts of energy in one year which was a record high and if everyone currently owning a driving licence in England decided they want an electric vehicle, the country would need over 25terawatts of power a year to run them all. So adding a robot to the mix is just insane. Let’s not forget that batteries are put straight into landfill when they are dead. This is worse than co2 emissions.

The first one randomly navigated a room - no intelligence except to turn when it bumped into an object, and I suppose it also knew how to find the dock.  Next one was better.  It mapped rooms and was more methodical in how it vacuumed.  Third one added in lidar, and was better at avoiding cables and ""biological deposits"" (aka dog poop) - but not perfect!  This was probably in a span of 8 years or so?  I still spend time each week assisting the robots - they get stuck, remove clogs, fill water tank, etc.  I think vacuuming is a much simpler task and see plenty of room for improvement.  Now, the Neo robot looks cool in the video - but when you find out it does not really do anything without a human behind it, I think a useful robot is years in the future (maybe 10-20??)",2주 전,0,

If I were to design a tool, I would design it to do the things my bodily limitations cannot. Making robots human shaped, is building in the same inherent weaknesses that our form already suffers from. There is only 1 reason to make humanoid robots, and that is to replace humans; whether it is for subterfuge or for sex, there is ZERO other sensible reason to make them that way.

Everyone would just have their own docking station at home, like a robot vacuum, and whenever someone needs a service, they just order it and a real person connects to this robot to get the job done.

@alaxt.6215,"6:13   This approach represents the most effective path toward developing fully autonomous AI companions. Artificial intelligence learns through repetition and exposure, not theory. By designing a human-guided training program where AI consistently learns from real interactions, it can eventually perform complex actions independently—and in a convincingly human-like way.  Waiting for other AI systems to “catch up” through passive training—like video datasets or controlled simulations—will only create brittle intelligence. Those environments lack the unpredictable variables of real life: kids interfering, pets reacting, or older family members interacting differently. It’s precisely these unpredictable factors that make real-world learning invaluable.  Training in genuine household settings offers a long-term advantage. It cultivates adaptability, empathy, and nuance that controlled environments can’t replicate. In essence, this is how you raise an AI capable of understanding life as it is lived, not just as it is modeled.  AI development mirrors human development—especially in its early stages. Like a toddler, it learns best through immersion, trial, and error until it eventually surpasses its teachers in that domain. These are the baby steps toward an AI capable of fulfilling the promises often exaggerated by marketing. Current AI isn’t anywhere near the sci-fi portrayals we imagine—or even something as practical as autonomous dishwashing—but this method lays the foundation for getting there.",2주 전,0,

The result is that Tesla account for 75+ percent of deaths caused by level 2 self-driving systems in the USA. People are beta testing for Tesla, yes. But they are doing that at the risk of other peoples lives. This robot is at least intentionally designed to be light and have human level maximum hand strength . That being said humanoid robots are a dumb idea, and trying. Especially at this level of technological readiness.",2주 전(수정됨),0,

These are all flash-in-the-pan TESCREAL fantasies for the end times (collapse, degrowth, ecocide, genocide on a planet with limited resources). We are training the supercomputers and datacenters that put money in the pockets of the 0.001% so they can prepare for the inevitable Great Simplification as we run out of fossil fuels and material resources. Sorry, the replicator and too cheap to meter energy will not happen. Our sun's supernova will. In the meantime, we will destroy living systems, people's health, and modern techno-industrial civilization because we are all addicts who can't see or admit that we have a problem.

It clearly also is not meant for mass consumers, hence the extremely steep price. Sure, your point about not buying based on future claims is true. But it also is great that companies make the technology of tomorrow available today. Especially in this case, I think it is clearly all about enthusiasts and not the masses. Your video frames it as bad. You are at danger of a phenomenon widely spread over most professions, that the deeper you are into the matter, the more pessimistic you are about the developments in this field. You begin to see only the downsides of the technology in your field and aren’t excited about new developments. This is in part due to your bubble, where you are always kept up to date, through the reporting of even small development steps, so when the product is announced, it disappoints you because of a perceived lack of innovation. See it this way: You could have focused your video more on how exciting it is to be able to buy a remote-controlled humanoid robot into your home to even help them get better. But you only focused on the part where it doesn’t match the expectations of being the perfect surprise innovation of a fully autonomous home assistant. I hope you will reflect on this, so future videos are again more about how exciting technology can be (while also highlighting the rough edges), instead of basically a consumer warning video with the information attached.",2주 전(수정됨),1,

Imagine if you not only have to contact the company to organise a teleoperation appointment, you then have to have a 'stranger' you can't see essentially in your home and they still may well have problems doing the job that you may have to interfere to explain or help with. Realistically, it's just not going to work.

Its not hard for any academic who studied physics, electrical engineering or similar that you simply can not create an autonomous robot right now due to limits in computational power and energy density of batteries. All you can do is try to make simply things really good, and wait for the hardware to develop another 5-10 years. Material science aint there. We cant produce Angstrom size Silicons yet. We dont have 1000kWh/kg chemistries yet. We cant mass produce Graphene to lighten up the structure cus humans are made of carbon, a pretty light material compared to metals like Magnesium or Aluminum...

It makes far more sense to have multiple specialized devices, one that opens your door, another that washes and folds clothes, another that does the dishes or cooks meals, each built to handle specific environments and expectations. Current general purpose AI systems, especially cloud based ones, can already manage these kinds of repeatable, structured tasks. This is still an open market because these kinds of practical, everyday robots don’t yet exist. Eventually, true general purpose robots that can do everything will arrive. The big companies are pushing toward that, and they certainly have the resources. The question is whether it will take one year or a hundred. The things you mentioned are often underestimated. Most people don’t realize how hard it is to make a robot on legs navigate a changing environment and remember what it learns.

Hell, on the mining front the time savings would be worth buying them alone. Instead of the transit time for the miners to get from the surface to the mining site, one miner finishing their shift can just hand the headset off to the next miner.

@lemster101,"I think that this may in some ways be an easier problem to solve than self driving cars. Robot vacuums are pretty commonplace nowadays and do okay navigating around the house. AI is also well suited for object recognition and navigation. I also think the robot deliberately doesn't have that much strength so it can't cause as much damage when something does go wrong.  I also understand the concept of inviting an expert in your house to complete a task, but my expectation would be that they would do the task a couple of times and after that the robot would've learnt how to do things on its own. That would have to be the idea, because the solution just isn't scalable otherwise. I get that that's not ideal, but it's a good way to solve the problem of helping it find its way around a home and the specifics of each home.  It would be ideal if there was an option to train it yourself. Seeing as the company just uses regular Meta Quest hardware, I don't see how that would be a problem.  The much bigger challenge I think is utility. Is there really that much to do around the house? This is competing against a cleaner. A good cleaner is say $80 an hour. This is $500 per month. So it's this or a good cleaner for 1.5 hours a week. Or if you buy it outright, it's 1.5 hours per week for 3 years to break even. It feels like it makes more sense as a commercial solution. Cleaning large offices for example isn't difficult, just very time consuming and there are specific problems with that industry that this would be uniquely positioned to fix.",2주 전,0,

@PiefacePete46,"True story:  Three nights ago my wife awoke at 3am.  She could hear soft, stealthy noises, and after a short time, flickering light.  She quietly woke me to investigate. By the time I got out of bed, our robot vacuum cleaner bumbled through the door, turned hard left, and disappeared under the dresser... it was very reluctant to come out! I soon discovered that we had an electricity outage.  For some reason it had triggered a 'Cleaning Cycle' for the vac.  It had done a lovely job of the living room, where it lives under the TV cabinet.  Eventually the battery got low, and as it could not detect the powered-down base, it went into its alternative 'Home-search mode' of following walls until it finds base, or goes flat!

@Inter-stelar,"Totally get the criticism, most of what we saw is teleop, not full autonomy. But that doesn’t make it fake; it makes it a bridge. Teleoperation lets you ship something useful now, earn money, and collect the real-world demos that actually teach the robot to be autonomous later.  We’ve already seen this work: stores have run shelf-stocking robots with people driving in VR, delivery bots use human takeover on the weird edge cases, and there are cafés in Japan where home-based/disabled workers teleoperate service robots and get paid. So yes, “operate a robot, get paid” isn’t sci-fi.  My angle: what’s wrong with remote control if it creates jobs today? People in lower-income regions could freelance as robot operators for homes and businesses in richer markets. In elder care, a remote caregiver could “be there” through a robot when staffing is tight. Just be transparent about what’s autonomous vs. teleop, lock down privacy, and measure progress by how fast the autonomy improves. Teleop isn’t the con—it’s the on-ramp.",2주 전,0,

Human-in-the-loop lets teams ship useful capability now, earn revenue, and collect the demonstrations that train the model toward autonomy, exactly how complex systems mature.  My take: what’s actually wrong with remote control? It can open a new labor market, people in developing countries could freelance as robot operators for homes and businesses in wealthier markets and get paid. In elder care, a remote caregiver could “be there” through a robot instead of importing labor. It’s a smart interim stage: be transparent about what’s autonomous vs. teleop, enforce strict privacy/geo-fencing, and use Expert Mode to build the data flywheel.

@ValevLaube,"The thing is, this isn’t an independent humanoid robot—it’s essentially a remote-controlled human assistant. A low-cost-per-hour maid for wealthy individuals, operated from across the globe through a robotic interface. It’s dystopian, it’s disturbing, but it’s undeniably capitalistic: imagine having a domestic worker you don’t have to pay like a “real” human, because their labor is outsourced to countries with lower wages. This is the trajectory of extreme capitalism, and it genuinely saddens me. Just like Facebook exploiting low-income regions for their ""censorship detection"", or ChatGPT relying on undervalued labor for data training, this model will inevitably expand. They only say AI because it is trendy right now, but it's little to do with the realistic expectations that anyone should put on these products, instead we should criticize them for the path they're moving towards.

@chrisstephan4520,"Great take on this. I often struggle, with the reality of where we are vs the promise. AI products are definitely full tilt improving, but I just don’t see the predicted jumps being made by the industry. Having even a moderate understanding of how the various models work in ML/AI an hour playing with products pretty quickly shows how non-iterative they are. It becomes quite apparent that the scale or power, efficiency, or full stop technological breakthrough required to get beyond the plateau we’ve arrived at is pretty monumental. Yes Vision models have improved in accuracy for classification and short videos can be quite impressive, even the uncanny responses in LLMs are very impressive as long as long as the post model memory doesn’t get too deep… The context depth just doesn’t scale for complexities we take for granted. I have hope, but I think 2030 is a pipe-dream for complexities problems and there has to be some tangible ROI that makes these products really useful before the industry snd its investments may begin to implode before we get there. I’m hopeful but this brings me to my point.  Knowing a lot of people over the years in startups, I wouldn’t doubt that preordering for these AI driven products is more than beta testing. It provides some level of reassurance to investors. Could even be a way to de-risk or in extreme cases recover a bad investment. This specific instance we are effectively investing on an emotional level by being an early adopter and at the price point you would be very invested for even the wealthier middle class worldwide. Look how much investment capital was pumped into Tesla and for how long. Will that investment ever be recovered? And people there is a preexisting use-case that makes buying a tesla an easy adoption for an expensive product. Those users provide the refinement of the models the car uses to In this case in order to have enough users. How does the producers of neo attract enough people to purchase this product to refine the training data so that some point it will be autonomous. Let along a humanoid is probably the most complicated style of robot to do this with. I just don’t see it. To your point, I’d love to be wrong, but I don’t have 20k I’d be wiling to throw away at the possibility of it flopping.",2주 전,0,
@navynood,"other than being surveillance equipment in your house, I see a good few upsides.  1/ if they make available to third party VR users then you essentially have remote workforce. Make them sign forms, security agreements, etc. and give them special certified licenses to operate remotes robots. Give these to those that are to disabled to walk or able to leave their own home, to work remotely from home. Those that still want to work but can't will have a chance to work again or do things outside their own home. A young or old physically handicapped persons can do chores in their homes easier then log on to be paid to clean someone else's home etc.  2/ give these to remote nurses and doctors to help patients too far away with aftercare and home assistance. Use it for yourself to help care for your pets from work or out of state.  3/ Have this go so horrible wrong.

@HouseHoldAdventures,"This isn't a product launch. It's a show for venture capitalists that you pay $20,000 for.  This is a crucial piece of reporting. The Wall Street Journal has meticulously documented what this $20,000 ""consumer"" robot actually is.  The summary: it's a non-autonomous, remotely operated device that performs tasks with agonizing slowness (five minutes to load three items into a dishwasher). Critically, its utility is directly dependent on the buyer signing a ""social contract""—essentially agreeing to turn their home into a test lab and sacrifice their privacy for data collection.  This report brilliantly shows the ""What."" But it doesn't state the ""Why.""  And the ""Why"" is that this entire endeavor does not appear to be a consumer product strategy. It is an investment strategy, and the difference is fundamental.  No viable business model can be built on selling an inefficient, $20,000 surveillance device to a handful of enthusiasts. The ""robotics slop"" concept mentioned in the video isn't a new paradigm; it's just an attempt to manage expectations for a non-functional product in advance.  The real customer here isn't the person paying $20,000.  The real customer is a Venture Capital fund.  This ""launch"" is nothing more than expensive theater designed to prove two things to investors:  1. ""A market exists"": ""Look, people are willing to pay $20,000! We've created demand!""   2. ""We have a data pipeline"": ""Look, we have a 'social contract' to get the data that will someday let us build the real product.""    These pre-orders aren't profit. They are leverage for negotiating the next, much larger, funding round. 1X isn't selling robots to consumers; they are selling equity to investors, using this raw prototype and its first customers as the primary argument for an inflated valuation.",2주 전,487,

Yeah, you could release a product that's functional OR you could hype it a lot to get funding. I believe that's what both the Pin and the R1 tried to do. Maybe they got so overwhelmed in debt because of the product they're trying to release than they expected the hype to be enough for them not to have to worry about getting a finished product to the market. It's trying to cut your losses and hoping people will defend you for a mediocre product (which they will, surprisingly or unsurprisingly so) and hoping for the best. Because yeah, let's be honest, research and development for a new product/service costs A LOT, so maybe you want to start competing and getting the money you invested back right away, but it's just not a real possibility. I'm not saying that the HUGE corporations like Apple or Google aren't losing money when they screw-up, the difference is that they have such a variety or other products and services (and even fans) that will continue to support them when they do screw-up. And this guys are just trying, I'd say, to get the money they invested back ASAP since they don't have any other product or service that will act as a safety net for them.

Hear me out: my first instinct when we saw someone remote controlling the device i thought „well maybe it cant do everything on it‘s own but you could control it from a remote location, like a remote maid“ this could already be a huge advantage because the maid wouldn’t habe to come to your house, have her own keys and then go back home by the end of the day. She could just do that in „homeoffice“. She saves time cuz she doesn’t have to commute and that saves everybody money.  The second time I watched the Video the medical care part really stuck to me. This could be a huge thing for home nurses that usually have to drive from home to home witch takes a lot of time. Sure its expensive but the Time you save cuz you dont have to drive from home to home (especially in remote locations) you just put on your vr and you r in mr. …s house, give him his medicine and make him food.

After which you set it to ""Validate"", and it repeats the action, to confirm it is to your satisfaction.

If you get good engagement from preorders, you know you're on to something, but if not, don't spend more resources on a completely finished product that nobody is going to use. The bottom line is: create an Minimum Viable Product, showcase it, allow preorders, and choose to continue or not depending on engagement.

@marietailor3100,"So, I’m not the biggest tech defender here, but after watching the WSJ video, I really think that this is probably the most ethical way you could go about making something like this work at all.  If you’re ever going to make a humanoid robot that can autonomously do chores around the house, it’s going to need training data. And a lot of it. Across various different situations.   So, given that that’s a necessity and no investor is going to approve build a 100 of these and paying people to have them in their houses, telling early adopters up front “Look, pay for the hardware, give us the training data, and we’ll continue to improve the product over time,” is kind of the only reasonable way to attempt to do this, no?  Like, I genuinely can’t think of any other way to develop something like this. To me, it feels like is being marketed like a Kickstarter project which it kind of is and that’s… fine?  I dunno. I’ll want to buy one I’m sure when they’re cheaper and more useful so why be upset that they’re trying to get the data to make that happen now?",2주 전,0,

The idea of a robot like this ""helper"" is ridiculous because we dont even have a vision system capable of recognizing things to the degree of detail in real time that this actions would need.

Data and visuals from users’ homes should never be collected without full, optional consent, and should remain local.   At its current speed, NEO is far too slow to be useful for decluttering or organizing.   Using homes as a training ground might only be fair if the robot were free or symbolic in price.

@LuizSiqueira,"The Artificial Intelligence (AI) dilemma mirrors the chicken and egg paradox: for AI to evolve, it needs training data, yet without that initial training, it cannot progress. Elon Musk and Tesla have already demonstrated the invaluable nature of this process. However, widespread suspicion of AI, while partially valid, could carry a high cost. While the West debates and hesitates, China is developing at full speed, as evidenced by their superior robotics. Our aversion and slowness risk losing the technological lead to them. Here in Brazil, we are accustomed to a long-term teaching process, similar to the years it takes to train a domestic worker to become reliable—an analogy that partly resembles the time and effort needed to train AI. The crucial question is: are we willing to make the sacrifice to embrace and train AI, or will we allow China to fully dominate robotics technology? If nothing is done, the ultimate irony is that we will end up with Chinese robots inside our homes, and the public's suspicion will remain just as strong. Consider the consequences of inaction.",2주 전,0,

@ozvoid1245,"While we can all agree that AI itself is not quite there yet; you have to admit, the advances in non-autonomous robotics has been incredible. We're reaching a point where likely the first humans on Mars will likely still never actually go outside for regular tasks but instead remote-control various robots instead, Underwater welding could very easily become a remotely controlled task, and potentially no one will ever have to step foot in a diving bell ever again. Nuclear powerplants and hazardous laboratory environments can be operated by remote controlled avatars, etc etc, and from what I've seen, a decent amount of that is already here. The problem is people are far too focused on the autonamous nature of robots,  because they want an automated servant, but we're really over-looking the potential of remote-controlled robotics.

@apkgams8530,"16:02 Off-topic but, when you said ""Peace."" it clicked for me how many times I've heard people say that, religious or not, saying it with its full meaning or not. You are genuinely saying ""Peace"" to all of your watchers, meaning it to its fullest extent and you have made it a regular saying for yourself almost unknowingly and I honestly respect it so much since you, more or less, mean it literally ""Peace to you (the Viewer): Peace from me, between you and I. Peace that I wish for you, the Viewer"".  Unknowingly or not, people from all kinds of cultures seem to have kept the saying ""Peace to you."" alive. And I just find a kind of, poetic beauty in that. I believe it stems mostly from religions like Christianity in the past when it was more popular. And then surprisingly the religion of Islam is the one (till this day) where saying ""Peace to you."" is very very common and they say it every time they meet one another.  So I say to you (with gratitude), Peace upon you too.  Quran 4:86 And when you are greeted, respond with a better greeting or at least similarly. Surely Allah is a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner of all things.  Quran 24:61 ...--However, when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting ˹of peace˺ from Allah, blessed and good. --...

@Anim3Gamer,"From what I gathered - the whole point of even selling this robot IS to get from having to be teleoperated by a Human to becoming automated by learning from the Human Operator how to do those tasks. Buying this robot is basically signing up to be a Beta Tester for this robot. It's not going to do what it shows in the video out of the box. It's going to - at least - take 5 years of it operating to get to that level. So basically, this thing as it's shown to do in the video isn't to come until around 2030 and beyond.  Also, very curious if 1x sends a Neo to Vedal - the creator of the AI VTuber Neuro. If Neuro takes over the operations of the Human Teleoperator - it can lead to Virtual AIs entering to Physical Bodies and becoming their own Sentient Beings in the future. Neuro has already learned how to operate in 3D space - just watch her Minecraft streams - and I'd imagine given enough time, Neuro would be good enough to pilot Neo as well as Human Operator can and be a AI leading another AI.",2주 전(수정됨),0,

But in their fantasy world of what they claim and their starry-eyed and gullible customers expect? Sure... it would be well worth it. You could probably sell such a machine next year for $80k or $100k.   In ten years or so they will be common, I think, and all cost maybe a few grand. But I could be wrong about all this...

And better yet - the chips have a lifetime expectancy of 3 continuous years. <- this is already for a ""small"" model.   There's always the hope of being able to make a cheaper to run AI - but as proven by LLMs, Image generators, and video generators - the smaller the model, the significantly worse it gets. and for ""carrying glass"" you can't accept a 30% success rate. even the $40k will only hit a success rate of 90% for the first few years. (so every 10th time they carry glass it breaks?).   They can claim it will run via the cloud - but that changes literally nothing in terms of chip costs and only makes it stop working if the internet ever blanks out. (meaning they'll just ""discontinue"" the robot after a few years - since running it will either be trash or too expensive.) - A machine learning engineer      More numbers:   this requires about 16000tflops and 400gb vram to operate.   teslas first original ""full self driving"" had 0.6tflops built into their car - which is why it was phenomenally too weak to process the data.",2주 전,0,

@houdin654jeff,"""...theoretically this is what we want AI to do, right?  It's not just AI generated videos and slop... we want it to be doing actually productive stuff...""  Theoretically, yes, agreed.  However, the issue is that someone is going to be making either $500/month per robot or a lump sum of $20k each on these things without proving they can actually do anything productive while consumers do the beta testing they should be doing before releasing it, or proving that the business will last long enough for the machines to 'learn' how to do what they're selling.  The promise of an all automated future, in my eyes, is that things will get less expensive as we scale these up, not easier on humans or less onerous, I focus almost exclusively on price.  The price of nothing is going down lately.  It's all going up, which you could argue has more to do with other factors, but I've yet to see someone actually be able to make their products cheaper when incorporating this exciting new technology... it just feels like something else to spend billions on instead of, well, people.

@Lord_zeel,Interestingly what it actually is is quite impressive and if they marketed it as a sort of remote operation safety device that would be really cool. It's also very impressive Robotics and while I don't love the look of the cloth exterior I think it's much more approachable than the shiny plastic and metal robots we've seen from other companies. All in all the hardware seems pretty great and I can actually come up with useful potential applications even for remote controlling it. I suspect that the remote operation is currently being used for training purposes if they are training a model to emulate these human movements they would need the training data from having actual humans inputting that movement so that actually makes a whole lot of sense it's just a question of whether or not they can actually deliver on that anytime in a reasonable future and with her not it makes any sense to give them your money now for that promise. Much like Tesla's self-driving technology it is necessary to have an immense amount of data on actual human operation in order to train an artificial intelligence and I don't actually think that there's a better way to do that than this sort of remote operation or perhaps motion capture but either one would require an actual human to perform these actions over and over and over. But also much like Tesla it seems very unlikely that they will have a fully operational housekeeping model in a realistic time period and any promise of such is dubious at best.,2주 전,0,

Your concern about not enough adoptions to close the training data gap feels short-sighted, and as you said yourself, you hope to be proven wrong - I do too! 😁😁As you also mentioned, people said the same about Tesla’s FSD, that it would stall without millions of users, yet look how far that’s come. Once Neo starts logging household hours across thousands of homes, the data curve will rise fast. Every spilled drink, misplaced sock and burnt toast becomes another lesson.  People love tech. It will sell, I’m certain. And unlike a human maid, it doesn’t need sleep, holidays or the occasional “mental health day.” It definitely won’t steal your AirPods either.",2주 전,0,

For clothing - not only has the robot to touch and hold the fabric but if it wants to do it at a reasonable pace, it needs to run a cloth simulation within, to predict how the fabric is going to move, to then inform the control systems that run its motors. It adds a huge computational cost into the feedback loop that a robotics system is and it is an even harder challenge to do that in a mobile platform with limited battery life.   I‘m curious if for rich people, it’s becoming a common thing to have a DGX200 Rack in their basement, a wifi that is capable of handling multiple high resolution camera streams to do the simulation, path planning, object recognition, … externally so the battery of the robot can be used to do mechanical labor, not computation.",2주 전,0,

We've already outsourced so much of our movement as a culture: we no longer have to grow our own food, retrieve our own water, walk to get places, etc. And sure, that is wonderful on a lot of levels. Division of labor is great and technology has allowed a lot of advancements to happen with science. But unless you have a solid plan for how you're going to get your mobility and movement needs daily, you'll likely lose even more mobility than you have now. I mean, just look at already how many of us have chronic pain earlier and earlier in life from lack of movement and spending too much time on screens.   I'm not trying to be pessimistic.

You look quite silly complaining about this teleoperated humanoid, calling it fake. This company is open and clear about how its robot works and that training robots for full AI autonomy(a certain eventuality) is difficult, and actually the data to do so doesn't even exist.  So, this is just basically the same thing Tesla did with their 'full self-driving'. They put out cars that could kind of do it, that had the hardware, and let the people drive their cars around with all the cameras collecting all the data. It's literally no different than this(aside from cars can kill people, and robots invade our privacy). This would be like calling Tesla auto driving cars fake, love them or hate them, they're not, really.   I mean, I get it. it's a hard sell.. ""Help us train our robots please"".. But, seriously this is a revolutionary technology and it's going to change many people's lives like mine. I'm quadriplegic and I 'have to' hire caregivers.

The smartphones weren’t that much in 1995, it took till about 2015 before they became really good. The early adopters and companies can start taking out the problems 1 by 1 for all of us. The early masses will start buying basic workable versions of this in 15 years and the main masses in 20 years. I think this is great. If these systems never come into houses they will always remain decades away just like Fusion energy. To me this is perfect. AI also keeps progressing quickly which will work in harmony with this advancement.   Meanwhile we as the masses can start saving up. Anyone under 60 will likely have huge exposure to this in their life’s. Not least for the aging population and the massive needs for more hands in healthcare. Excellent development. This is what many of us have been dreaming of since watching the first Star Wars and futuristic movies and series and reading the great books. This is the start. I am so excited.

@EVANHIRSCHMANN97,"1. Compatibility with the human world  Our entire environment — tools, buildings, stairs, cars, door handles, keyboards — is designed for human bodies. A robot that’s roughly our shape (two arms, two legs, similar height) can:  Use the same tools and machines we use  Walk through human-designed spaces  Drive vehicles, carry boxes, open doors, etc. This makes humanoid robots more universally useful than machines designed for a single task.  🤝 2. Ease of social interaction  Humans instinctively read body language, facial expressions, and gestures. A human-shaped robot can:  Communicate naturally (through facial expressions, hand motions, posture)  Build trust more easily  Work better as a helper, teacher, caregiver, or companion That’s why robots designed for social or service roles — like hospital assistants or customer greeters — are often made to look and move somewhat human-like.  🧩 3. Research into intelligence and embodiment  Building human-like robots helps scientists understand us. When researchers try to make machines walk, balance, perceive, and manipulate like humans, they uncover new insights into:  Neuroscience and motor control  Perception and coordination  Learning and cognition  Humanoid robotics is as much a scientific experiment about human intelligence and body design as it is about practical applications.  💡 4. Cultural and emotional appeal  Humans are storytellers — we’ve dreamed about mechanical people for centuries (from ancient myths to modern sci-fi). Making robots that resemble us satisfies a deep creative and philosophical urge to “mirror ourselves” in our inventions.",2주 전,0,

@cutsio,"TL;DR 🤖   The NEO humanoid robot is heavily hyped but currently relies on remote human control, showing a large gap between promise and reality common in early AI products.  🤖 Key Points   - NEO promises to autonomously handle chores but is mostly teleoperated today.   - Pre-orders start at $20,000 or $500/month, with limited real autonomous features.   - There is a significant gap between current capabilities and marketing hype, a common AI product issue.   - True autonomy needs extensive AI training and real-world data, similar to Tesla's gradual self-driving rollout.   - Early adopters will serve as beta testers, facing privacy concerns and imperfect performance as the tech evolves.

@TFDusk,"Watched a really good video by another dude that summed up the current issues with ""AI"" perfectly; the current bet is spending a lot on increasing memory, but not really spending more on ""AI"" actually learning things.   If anyone's paid attention to the space, AI as it exists today is only really powerful as the the quality and the amount of data that you provide over to it. Your models out in ChatGPT or whatever that aren't local will generally perform better than anything you can get locally because they're just feeding more powerful hardware along with more data to generate better results to whatever you prompt over to it. If we're talking about getting better AI long term though, it also should be able to operate with a limited memory to learn what it needs to know then perform based on what it learns.  A giant robot like this is never going to have infinite memory. That is objectively impossible to achieve, no matter whos backing the project. For it to function in the way you're showing, it would have to be able to have some capacity to be able to learn so it can perform whatever tasks your asking it to do. If it's not a scam, then I'm almost certain this is likely going to be a giant waste of metal, and would bankrupt the company if it actually did exist because it'd need to be fed continuous data by said company that likely cannot afford that data.",2주 전,0,

You don't even have to think so far as to misreading medication for harm a robot can do.

It can take 5 minutes to process a task, a car needs to be processing instantly. A household is relatively static, there’s only so much that dynamically changes short of people or pets, whereas a road is constantly dynamic.

@seba5167," @benstanfill363  Regarding the risks, it could potentially... ... burn your house to the ground by e.g. knocking a candle over, leaving the oven on, etc. ... kill or disable a toddler by stepping onto him, giving him access to dangerous things, etc. ... poke someone's eye out with its fingers, stab them (accidentally) when handling a knife, etc. ... and more. One thing you learn when programming is to not assume that a machine has the situational awareness an adult has and if it hasn't been told to not put a bowling ball on a shelf over a newborn baby, chances are that it eventually will.  Now to the implementation part: I'm not an expert on these things either but a car essentially can turn left and right, brake and accelerate. Sure, the environment can do lots of unpredictable things very fast but the amount of possible reactions of the car is rather small. My understanding is that full self driving is mainly limited by ethics (giving a machine that kind of power) and sensory issues/edge cases (the car can't see a threat or doesn't know how to respond to it). Computers these days are extremely fast compared to humans at such things so time shouldn't be an issue once it sees something, afaik. Now compare that to the immense amount of movements a human hand (or its robotic knock-off) has to be able to perform to extreme levels of precision just to pick up, say, a CD vs a mug vs a pillow vs a cat vs a chair and I can absolutely see how it is more difficult to do that than to teach a car how to drive safely. But, again, this is just what my limited knowledge of the matter leads me to conclude.",2주 전,1,
@slothologist4780," @seba5167  Yes, you are correct in your points. Another point i would like to highlight is computation. All these fancy AI stuff needs massive amounts of compute. you can either do all this in the cloud (then you are dependent on wifi and support, and data security is a nightmare) or you can do it on the robot/car itself. but a capable gpu is heavy and sucks a LOT of energy, especially on an entity that needs energy to move around or even stand (such as an humanoid robot). a car has a bigger battery and weighs a ton anyway, so it does not matter too much (although heavy gpu workloads will have a noticeable impact on milage), but for a robot thats a whole other problem.",2주 전,1,

@E1line-r6d,"Roads are easier IMO because there's a smaller range of variables and ultimately a much more restricted ""goal"" - what a car has to do in normal operation is very well defined and where it has to do it is usually fairly well defined (within an area, even an entire country, most roads are quite standardised - personally I think it'll be quite a while, if ever, before driverless cars can operate reliably on e.g. unmarked dirt tracks but ""main"" roads all have a lot more in common).   Every house is different though (and I don't agree they're as static in functional terms as you suggest - bags/shoes/toys on the floor, pets/kids/adults moving around, drawers and doors open/closed/ajar etc. It's arguably less dynamic, sure BUT in more potential ways during normal operation. Obstructions ""just appearing"" in a house is the norm rather than the exception in other words). Plus, a car ""only"" has to avoid ALL collisions - road itself aside, you basically never want a car to physically interact with anything - whereas a household robot actually must ""collide"" with numerous objects - doors, drawers, dishes etc. - in order to work BUT in a controlled way and crucially also never collide with other objects like pets, kids etc. Which is inherently more complex.",2주 전,0,

And then you can let do the machine the rest. You just have to repeat operation on each specific house env when one day you can train a generic model that capable to be deployed massively.,2주 전,0,

While it's true that full autonomy in unstructured environments is very much on going research and an open problem, (1) we are making tremendous steps in that direction, (2) AI for robotics is ALREADY capable of achieving full autonomous behavior in ONE PARTICULAR TASK AND SETTING WITH JUST 5-10 DEMONSTRATIONS OF THAT TASK. Let that sink in. This really means that you could have it teleoperated for a week or two, and then it'll be adapting already to whatever chores and house you have.

@Echolonious,"Capitalizing off what you said about Tesla; It's actually much more important than that. A 2020 Tesla Model 3 has HW3 self-driving, with a supposed HW4 upgrade if HW3 can't reach the expectations of the future that Tesla promised. It would absolutely impale them if they went back on that promise, so it's almost a sure thing that if you buy the car, you'll get the full FSD experience someday.  The difference between this 1X robot, and a car, is that even without the AI features.. The Tesla still works. And they both cost about the same price; $20,000. This alone makes the robot just not warrantable; you're solely dependent off experimental variables instead of having a backup reliable experience anyways to make it still kinda worth it.   I can see the struggles for 1X considering they're competing in a market that strictly involves data to be acquired to tune the best robot. It's like Tesla dominating the self-driving market since they're one of the few (especially in the US and UK) that actually have their foot in the door.  They won't be able to compete if another competitor starts shipping quicker than they do.. especially at a similar or cheaper price.",2주 전,0,

Also as a software developer working with machine learning algorithms statements like ""its ai gets smarter the more you interact with it"" seem very unlikely. If you want intelligent responses in a short time frame you would need a cutting edge GPU minimum. This robot is most likely connected to the internet and uses pre learned models. I doubt that they constantly retrain your specific robot for you. If at all that wouldnt happen with the robots hardware.",2주 전(수정됨),0,
@ShitpostGiga,Companies have been focused on simplicity for so long and that's why they're having a hard time with the complexity of programming an ai to do tasks for them because they've become too reliant and comfortable with simplicity.

@ericwright8592,"14:05 exactly. Why even make them humanoid? It's needlessly complex and one day will be pointless anyway. Imagine every house has one, suddenly humans don't need to operate vacuums. The reason vacuums are shaped and function the way they do is because they're meant for humans to use. But in the future it'll be only robots operating them. So why make vacuums human friendly shapes? Then there's no need to make either the vacuum or robot human shaped eventually. Fun fact, we already have roombas. It'll come full circle.

@HexParte,"To answer your question @13:00, I doubt it. How many people that CAN spend $20K on a robot to do laundry, that consider their time more lucrative if spent doing other things, don't already have someone they pay to do this in their home, much faster, and better? would 4 hours of uptime (and however long it takes it to charge) even be enough time to do all the things they need it to do? Would they have to buy multiple to get the same amount of work done? I just don't see the problem this is actually solving without raising a ton of questions that it can't answer. For example, they say NEO won't through paper on the stove, but what actually stops it from doing that?

For humanoid robots, I think it's probably a good 5 or 10 years behind that timeline, but it could be quicker, it depends how well this one goes. By 2030 they are a thing that some people have, 2035 everyone is kind of half in the market for them, 2040 people plan around buying them, and by 2045 they are pretty common. Ironically (if that's the right term here), self-driving cars will probably change how we even own cars, with either only one per household, or none for most people, and so the money people traditionally would put towards car ownership will go towards Household Humanoid Robots (H3Rs?).",2주 전,0,

@SohamBakshi,"Humanoid robot companies focussing on the ""household industry"" is quite challenging due to, as Marques mentioned, various nuanced differences between chores, between house layout, between items in the house. This is why many robotic startups (which has raised tons of $ and have very high valuations) such as Figure AI, Apptronik, Agility Robotics are focussing at the automotive/manufacturing industry as one of the primary use cases due to high-repeatability of tasks and tasks of various complexities. Also, the fact that many blue-collared workers are retiring, and younger people are not interested in the blue collared environment as much as they used to years ago. Our population is ageing, and its a perfect area for humanoids, but that will probably come later.  Though Figure AI is also focussing on household work, they have a big partnership with BMW, and they have deployed robots in their Chattanooga manufacturing plant. Same with Apptronik, a big partnership with Mercedes-Benz. UBTech has deployed humanoids in Zeekr plant in China (China is a lot ahead in this area that USA is).",2주 전,0,

In other words, two cameras in a human-like fashion is super limiting, humans have a ridiculously small field of view and positional awareness, blame the evolution. Robots do not have the evolutionary limitation, and how self-driving cars, they can use more data to make decisions.

Maybe you think “cool, maybe,” but a few hours later you’re over it. And rightfully so… we want living things to have their own personality and will, and we want machines to look like machines. It’s unnatural, and even sociopathic, to what a machine that looks like a human that does whatever you tell it… No human should feel comfortable around something that loosely resembles a living being, especially a human one, but is enslaved to you in a lifeless way. That should be against everyone’s nature… And even if this is still interesting to you, do you really want a robot that can shake your baby to death, or accidentally crush your skull, existing in your house? What if this thing kills my dog, cat, bird, whatever pet? What if this thing falls into the pool when my kids are in it? What if it knocks over expensive furniture and decor? Just think of all the havoc your not-so-perfect Roomba can have on your home. Now multiply that by “has trigger pulling hands and gorilla strength grip.” Yeah, no fucking thank you.

@MH-kj9hh,"The simple answer behind all of this is ... they need money and a leg up.  On the money front, their series B fundraising round raised $100M - compare that to their leading US rivals: Figure, who most recently raised $1B or Tesla, which can throw money at it all day.  Cybertruck had 2M preorders, if they got even 5% of that they would have an additional $20M (a full 1/6th of their funds coming from that preorder funds) of capital to throw at AI training and manufacturing. More importantly it would increase their valuation for a series C round.  Figure is primarily focused on industry (with long term goals for in home) and already has commercial customers (hence $1B series C at a $39B valuation) but 1X is focusing solely on the home with no plans for industry - so they have to acquire some retail customers going into their series C if they're going to raise the kind of capital they need.  On the leg up aspect, Tesla has huge amounts of self-driving data they're basing their AI on, they've repeatedly said ""Optimus thinks its a car"". Figure is collecting industrial data at BMW and (likely) UPS. They also recently announced that their inhouse AI implementation (helix) is improving much faster than their previous version (an Openai based implementation) and they are moving up their timeline for in home applications by 2 years - to facilitate this they've entered into a partnership with Brookfield to utilize their portfolio of 100,000 residential units to get a large diverse data set of training environments.  1X only started limited testing in a few employee's homes this year - that's the entirety of their training data. They need to get the robot out there to collect more data or they're going to get scooped on the home market by Figure.   TLDR: Its shitty that their promo video overhypes what the robot can currently do and undersells just how often you will likely be using ""expert mode"" in the first few years of ownership - but if the company wants to survive, the landscape is moving quickly enough that this really is their only viable path foreword (unless they pivoted to commercial/industry which would likely require significant redesign to make the robot stronger/ more precise).",2주 전(수정됨),1,

It may seem far fetch, but the reason this is closer than never is that it has been developed a AI that allows robots to simulate tasks, so it basically can dream it's doing the chores from its own perspective, and the more AI video generation physics improves, more realistic it becomes, so when it does it for real, it actually succeeds. For the first time ever, we don't need to train robots in real time, they can train themselves in a pace faster than reality, without actual physical interaction. The experiments started from making AI learn how to play Minecraft by imagining it, so it has a bit of actual training, but it learns to react to many different scenarios by just 'imagining' it beforehand.

@superidiocy,"I’m gonna hazard a few guesses here so hear me out.  First is this aims to replace housekeepers with robots that are controlled remotely by cheap remote housekeepers, allowing them to do multiple 4 hour (battery life) robots a day. Probably in call center type facilities. These control centers (con centers if you will) will also be a way to gather data, from the people working there about how humans move and solve these problems. Also just for a second picture what those centers would likely look like, warehouses of cubicles of people in vr doing housework remotely. A job that currently would face little to no oversight or regulation.  Additionally, think of the security issues, anyone who can afford this is unlikely to want to let an unknowable stranger or faceless mass of strangers learn the ins and outs of their properties, security, and life schedule, not even to mention any private conversations, meetings, or documents.  From a social and economic point of view, if the workers are paid very little (which is almost always the case in these matters) but they have incredibly valuable information about successful wealthy people (security vulnerabilities, blackmail, or even insider trading info) then they are gonna sell it. And that’s not even to say they can’t be paid to fabricate incriminating or damaging material with their access.  I think it’s worth noting that the company is actually pretty transparent about the purpose of their robots being data gathering and building a big ol database of homes and actions etc. Which they claim is to build a better product. But who knows if they will utilise that data to let companies advertise ultra specifically, or let insurers gain unfettered access to your life, or any other number of things. And hell even if 1x tech don’t do that, what happens if they go bust? That data won’t just disappear.",2주 전,1,

Maybe the remote operator is from Guatemala but it’s still remote. They’re not actually inside my house so I don’t give a shit if they see all my mess. It feels safer to me personally than some foreign immigrant. I’m dying in dust and shit everywhere. I have depression. This would greatly improve my quality of life. 100X. I just wish it could cook.

@xyster7,"buying a product on the future promise?  Short answer: usually no—unless the “promise” is nailed down in writing.  Quick checklist:  Contract, not vibes: future features, dates, and remedies spelled out in the order or SLA.  Escape hatch: clear refund/return policy if the promise slips.  Teeth: penalties, discounts, or extended warranty if deadlines are missed.  Proof: public roadmap with dated milestones + a track record of shipping on time.  Custody of cash: pay on delivery or milestone-based; avoid paying 100% upfront.  Ownership now: is the product useful today without the future stuff? If not, it’s a preorder/crowdfund risk.  Support & updates: who maintains it, how long, and what happens if the company folds?  Red flags: “coming soon” for >12 months, shifting ETAs, no demo, no references, aggressive urgency/discounts.  Simple rule: If the promise is critical → require dates + remedies in writing. If the promise is nice-to-have → buy only if today’s version already delivers value.  “Before purchasing, please confirm in writing: (1) the specific features coming, (2) delivery dates, (3) what I’m entitled to if dates slip (refund/credit/extended warranty), and (4) whether updates are included in the price. Thanks.”  When in doubt, treat it like a preorder: cap your risk, pay later, or wait until it ships.",2주 전,0,

Now granted, this will probably be someone in India or Mexico and not in your city, but someone has to notice how dystopian/ cyberpunky that is?

We aren't the best shape for anything really, they could've made a way better version robot that could do things in different manners and would be better. For all the things they have shown, I'd have prefer to see a robot that is a literal rectangle box (like an xbox) with a very precise arm on the top and sensors.

@johanslabbert2869,"I have a robot that cleans my home. Had it for years now, I call her Milly.   She has a voice but I disabled that shortly after buying. It’s mainly for informing me of any issues she might run into while cleaning. Like if she tripped down the stairs and need help or when she needs cleaning done to herself.   She can contact me via an app on my phone but I disabled her internet connection right at the start.  She has sufficient eyesight to distinguish light from dark and can roughly identify certain shapes. But she mostly navigates by touch and reflected infrared, using a memorised map of the interior layout of my apartment.  She probably knows my schedule because she only works when I’m not home, but I don’t think she really understands what a schedule is nor can she sense whether I’m home or not, as she cannot distinguish between a human leg and a table leg.   She can become quite territorial if I’m in her way when she’s cleaning, but she doesn’t weigh very much and is mostly plastic, so a swift kick in the face is all it takes to overpower her.   She looks nothing like any human I’ve ever seen. Small, flat, round, with 2 large outboard rubber wheels on suspension and a single front wheel on a free rotating caster.   She mostly require no special care. Just a few filters every now and then a proper cleaning about every second month.  And only cleans floors. Vacuum, sweep, dust. She has extra mopping attachments but I couldn’t be bothered to fit them.   I’m disappointed to see this new much more advanced robot is less capable than my old basic one.

And you brought up Tesla, with over a decade of experience. It's true that, at the moment, the robot can't do much independently. But since the beginnings of Tesla, there's been a huge leap in IT development: LLMs and VLMs. If you ask Google Lens what it sees, it practically makes no mistakes. It recognizes a crumpled sock on the floor. And if you ask an LLM where the sock belongs, it definitely won't suggest the refrigerator, but the washing machine. A robot can now know very precisely what it needs to do. And that's the point where we are today. It was completely different two years ago. The only (and huge) gap is still the robot's movement and proper grasping, etc. But worldwide, hundreds of companies and research groups are working on exactly this problem, so it won't take many more years. So if Neo has excellent hardware, including sensors and computing power, and the company guarantees years of updates, then I’d happily watch him grow up. And those are the real questions you should be asking the developers.",2주 전,0,

Say, for example, one robot in one day learn that  when it opens the door, if the knob looks round it has to turn it clockwise and if it is like a handle it has to hold it differently and do another motion. Something so small. This knowledge will be instantly uploaded the next day for all the robots who didn't have the experience. In other words, each robot, in 1 day will learn 10 thousand days of experience (collectively, all experiences in 1 day for 10 thousand robots). In one single day they will each have collective knowledge of 27 years of knowledge.  The gap will close so fast you wouldn't even realize it. They will be only limited by hardware.",2주 전(수정됨),2,

The problem is, the tech isn’t quite there yet — the robot doesn’t fully understand what not to do, and there are still a lot of safety protocols to figure out.

Based on what I saw back then, it would take a miracle to have that robot commercially ready within the next couple of years, heck even by the next decade and I am not exaggerating.

The cost price of the robot is around $600 (that's because it includes a LiFePO4 battery). The only justifiable cost is the subscription and AI updates, like in true neo-feudalism.

Also: AI that contains code that is ""hand written"" and not trained is bad. That's why Tesla is removing hand written code from their Self-Driving autonomous AI, because it is crippling the AI big time.

And if you don’t agree, think about how many of the inventions we have today were created through public funding or military projects.",2주 전,0,

@extentialist,"Things that could go wrong with a humanoid home-maker robot — covering technical, ethical, and social risks:  🧠 1. Technical & Operational Failures Software glitches or bugs – could cause incorrect or unpredictable actions (e.g., spilling boiling water or misplacing objects). Hardware malfunction – motors, sensors, or joints may fail, leading to accidents or fire hazards. Navigation errors – poor obstacle detection could make it bump into furniture, pets, or humans. Connectivity issues – Wi-Fi or cloud disruptions might halt its operations or make it unresponsive. Battery or power failure – could leave it stuck mid-task or cause electrical hazards.   🔐 2. Privacy & Security Risks Data breaches – cameras and microphones might record private moments, making homes vulnerable to hacking or surveillance. Unauthorized access – hackers could remotely control the robot to spy, steal data, or cause harm. Voice command hijacking – false or spoofed commands could trick the robot into unsafe actions.   ⚙ 3. Safety & Physical Harm Injury risks – if a robot misinterprets gestures or proximity, it might unintentionally hurt someone. Fire or gas leaks – errors in handling appliances could lead to dangerous accidents. Failure to distinguish humans or pets – could cause harm while cleaning or carrying objects.   🧩 4. Ethical & Social Concerns Job displacement – widespread use might replace human domestic workers. Over-dependence – people may lose essential life skills or motivation for chores. Emotional attachment – users might form unhealthy relationships or expectations toward robots. Bias in algorithms – if trained on flawed data, the robot may make unfair or inappropriate decisions.   🧰 5. Maintenance & Cost Issues High repair and upgrade costs – specialized parts and technicians may be expensive. Obsolescence – rapid tech evolution could render the robot outdated quickly. Software subscription locks – companies might charge recurring fees to keep the robot functional.   ⚖ 6. Legal & Liability Issues Unclear accountability – if the robot causes damage or injury, it’s uncertain who bears responsibility — manufacturer, owner, or developer. Regulatory gaps – laws may not yet cover autonomous domestic robots adequately.",2주 전,0,

@listerdave1240,I think the way this should work is that the early adopters are heavily subsidized by investor funding rather than paying the full price. The training is part of the development so it is only fair that the investors pay for it and start getting their return on investment once the robot is actually capable of doing what it's meant to.     The way they are doing it instead is making the early adopters essentially fund the development and not get anything in return.  Even if they were paying only the cost of the hardware they are still funding the development in kind even if not paying an extra dollar. They are essentially providing the company with a very valuable and essential service free of charge.,2주 전,0,

It’s kind of like an Uber model, where the company acts as an intermediary between the worker and the client. Then, eventually, robots might take over these tasks entirely, and the companies will let go of those workers too. We’re already seeing a similar pattern with AI: workers use AI tools long enough to train them, and then the companies replace the workers with the tools.

Far better option is to have just each robot doing its own task and for some task you dont even need an robot like for example sprinkles system in your garden. you mentioned only hiving older people wrong kind of drugs but how dangerous having such a thing unsupervised can be like imagine if you let it plug or unplug even electric stuff(this was shown in video) or imagine seeing robot that broke all of your plate cuz of some malfunction. And I also cant explain why all of those robots needs to have legs like giving them on wheels wont make them inferior less things to brake and better mobility so only pros.

So a smart way to advance this domain would be: 1. Place robots in homes. They can be remotely operated by humans, FOR NOW. 2. Data is collected and robot learns as the human operators move the robot to do specific tasks. That's also called Imitation learning. 3. As the robot keeps receiving more data, it learns more tasks to do, ON ITS OWN. 4. Eventually with enough data experience, a robot can function in a typical home almost autonomously.

Either it will never progress beyond this stage, or it will eventually learn how to - possibly to the point of almost never needing specialist intervention.

When a Tesla messes up, it kills a bunch of people. Putting them both sides by side because of a somewhat similar strategy ignore the VASTLY different outcomes that can occur. Tesla is willing to kill people in order to actually being able to engineer their products and to sell more cars, which is straight up criminal and absolutely unacceptable, whereas neo will mess up a few tacky items in some rich guy's house. It's so dishonest and deceiving to make them both look like the same thing, even though the strategy of selling you stuff that doesn't work applies to both of them and that it's fundamentally wrong in both cases, the outcome changes the perspective that one should have when observing them.",2주 전(수정됨),0,

Instead of spending money on the company and workers to obtain their data they use their own customers and majority of them don’t understand it’s not approved and what a beta even is. They use cameras for full self driving and there’s multiple videos of it not detecting things like a child manakin and it running it straight over, due to it relying so heavily on the cameras instead of sensors and scanners. GM’s supercruise and fords bluecruise is a much safer and approved self driving, yes it is only on highways and or verified satellite imaged roads but that’s because they don’t want to use their customers or put anybody at risk. They use lidar and loads of different sensors and it’s much much safer.

It may have a context window allowing it to “remember” for a little while, but that always has a limit. Sure it could save sets of tasks it can repeat,so long as new variables are not introduced. You get a new set of dishes that look a lot different from the old ones and maybe you are keeping the old ones and now the robot has to be trained a bunch to add that to it’s dataset. And what happens if the dog stops in front of it and barks, or that cat jumps onto its shoulder or things like that?

@pacisking,I assume it's cheaper in many countries long term. In my country a maid is like $40/hour and to do all stuff at home I probably need the service for lets say 2 hours each day during the week.. lets say 250 days a year (no weekends and no vacation days). Thats 250*2*40 which is.. exactly $20'000 a year. Each year. So yeah the robot will be cheaper after year 1. Or maybe after 1.5 years if you include electrcity and maintenance costs.

@missoats8731," @pffyespff  Not a math person, but this is what I got from ChatGPT: Short answer: Maybe — but not just by squeezing.  A “154 lb lift / 55 lb carry” spec means about 686 N of steady force, which is below the ~1,500 N usually needed to break a finger bone. So a slow push probably wouldn’t fracture anything.  But if the robot moves fast and hits you, it’s different — even a 5 kg arm swinging at 3 m/s can deliver over 4,000 N, easily enough to break bones. The lift rating tells you static strength, not impact force.  So: safe to work near only if it has proper speed, force, and contact-safety limits (like cobots under ISO 10218 / 15066). Otherwise, a fast strike could definitely injure you.",2주 전,3,

@Derp_Wolf,"I'm actually going to massively disagree that roads are inherently less complicated, than a house. While it's true that every house will be different, even in apartment complexes where all the units are the same, the furniture will differ in placement and type. It's also true that the house the robot operates in will mostly not change, but that isn't true for roads. Sure, the actual road stays largely the same for relatively long stretches of time, but traffic changes, kids run out into the road, trees fall, construction happens, weather changes, EMS/police can disturb the flow of traffic, etc. The self driving problem is hard because no road is the exact same two days in a row.  However, a house is. The residents of a home don't change that often, pets don't get swapped for new ones all the time, the dishes stay the same, the layout essentially never changes, etc. Don't get me wrong, houses aren't static, but they certainly vary dramatically less, than do roads.   I would argue a bot figuring out household chores is an order of magnitude easier, than self driving. Mostly because the vast majority of household tasks aren't life or death. If the clanker hangs up your boxers in the closet and folds up your blazer, then that's annoying, but not ultimately harmful. Sure, you mentioned meds for the elderly. That could well be life or death. There are tasks like that. Cooking or letting the dogs out the wrong door. Disposing of a project because the bot thought it was trash. Lots of things are high stakes, but there are far more  very low stakes tasks where a bot could mess up and everything would be fine.",2주 전,0,

Most likely working side by side with a human, and probably remote controlled from a van outside the house, and with the robot transported in the van between assignments.   Buying one outright makes no sense, for those that subscribe, they can be fairly confident, that they will be among the first to have a household robot, even if it is remote controlled a lot of  the time, and at some point another company may be able to build one that is less reliant on remote controlled actions.   Regarding the humanoid shape. Unless you have several of specialized robots, the humanoid shape makes most sense. We have designed our life around humans, thus that makes the most sense as a general use robot. There is possibly an argument that having several of specialized robots would be cheaper, and more efficient than trying to design a humanoid shaped robot that can actually to all the tasks you want from it.

They didn't hide anything, and they were UPFRONT and honest about what it can and cannot do. People want robots and they want them yesterday and these people got a bright idea and figured out the best way to deliver NOW. The fact that they are ready to put this into people's homes means they beat everyone to market and everybody's sad that it wasn't tesla or apple or any of those people that everyone worships. No. This is the right idea and the right time. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH TELEOPERATION, I would argue that's the future. The fact is these other companies are dragging their feet and China already has these things all over the place and Americans want that too. AND ITS CHEAP. And, they're also going to include teleoperation for the CHEAP price of the robot, no brainer. Plus, they made the robot ACCESSIBLE and on top of that, the fact that it's accessible to everyday people is even more BONKERS. This is the dream though, and all these companies are suffering severely from analysis paralysis. Cars weren't perfect and people hopped into those because we NEEDED them. And also, the fact that this robot is tendril operated means that production is absolutely achievable. And these operators get paid 23-32 dollars PER HOUR. TO WASH DISHES and they get to play with robots. I'm fine with that. They did the SMART move, the RIGHT move, and nobody's sad it wasn't your favorite technocrat. Watch them deliver and be THE FIRST. Boo-hoo for your stock options buddy. Sorry u lost the bet, and u didn't become a trillionaire. That's what y'all are really whining about. K-scale is already delivering robots too btw, and they didn't make any promises, but if they added teleoperation, it would essentially be the same thing. Robots are coming, they're here, and u can wait for the iPhone of robots. But people are gonna buy the motorlas and nokias of the world until the lord of your stock price makes one. Because we need them. And if we need to manually operate them the way we did the phone lines a hundred years ago so be it. The more data, the faster, the better. This is excellent for the world, and the industry. This is why I am confident this is about your stock options because daddy musk or huang, ellison or gates didnt come out with the irobot and made u all rich. By the time they build these world models it's going to be another 3-4 years until they are ready for primetime. I will take my robot now. This data that they are going to produce will be the first of its kind and INVALUABLE to researchers on the front lines. What a weird take. Way to put down your peers. I'm not buying that. This is a giant leap forward. For $200 bucks that is FULLY REFUNDABLE? It's FULLY refundable. Give me a break. There's something else going on with you that made u post this video.

Tesla has been forced to cut its price in China as well as Europe.   The issue is Musk has a tendency of overpromising and under delivering. He comes out with what we in marketing call ""putting the man on mars strategy"" everytime he has to sell anything. Chinese companies dont, neithe to the Japanese.  Musk came out in 2016 promising people ""fully autonomous cars"". People paid for that. Tesla engineers resigned coz they new that tech is dicey. Thhey wanted to call it ""copilot"" not ""autopilot"". But must fake advertised a tech he didnt have.  Its been 10 years. All those years people paid for that Futuristic feature. That's not going to be mainstream for probably anither half a decade.  Musk and his team faked the self driving demo ads. Their employees have under oath confessed that.  When people buy tesla they are not buying a car, they are buying the fiction that Musk is.  As for Model Y...wait two years and see what sells say about how good it is relatively based on what it costs.  Mind you tesla has lost major market share in both Europe and China. Cybertruck is a disaster. Musk claimed they would sell 250,000 trucks annually. They sell less than 50000. And the sales are falling.  So yeah the scams keep piling.

@pillya6246,"Subject: Unveiling the Ancient Mystery: Could Soma from the Rigveda Be the Sacred Magic Mushroom?  Dear Madam/Sir,  I hope this email finds you in a state of curious wonder, much like the ancient sages who pondered the enigmas of the universe. I've been delving deep into the intersections of mythology, history, science, and spirituality, and I felt compelled to share a fascinating hypothesis that weaves together threads from ancient texts, modern research, and cross-cultural traditions. What if the legendary Soma—often hailed as the nectar of the gods in the Rigveda—was not some mythical elixir, but rather the humble yet profound magic mushroom? Allow me to guide you through this intriguing exploration, connecting ideas that span millennia and continents, revealing how this psychedelic fungus might hold the key to understanding divine experiences and human evolution. Let's begin at the source: the Rigveda, one of the oldest sacred texts in human history, mentions Soma an astonishing number of times—over a thousand references across its hymns. Described as a divine plant pressed into a potent drink, Soma is extolled for granting immortality, heightened awareness, and ecstatic visions to the gods and seers alike. It's portrayed as the ""drink of the gods,"" a nectar that bestows youthfulness and boundless energy, fueling rituals and inspiring profound poetic insights. This reverence isn't fleeting; it's a central pillar of Vedic spirituality, suggesting Soma was no ordinary substance but a gateway to transcendent states. Intriguingly, the pioneering ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson, in his groundbreaking research during the mid-20th century, proposed that Soma could be identified with a magic mushroom—specifically, the psychedelic Amanita muscaria. Wasson's theory, born from years of studying indigenous shamanic practices, challenged conventional views by linking this ancient elixir to fungi known for inducing altered states of consciousness. His work opened the door to seeing Soma not as a lost herb, but as a mushroom that has quietly influenced human spirituality for ages. This idea gains even more traction when we look to our closest animal relatives. Bonobos, often regarded as the smartest apes next to humans due to their complex social structures, empathy, and problem-solving abilities, have been observed consuming magic mushrooms in the wild. These primates, sharing over 98% of our DNA, forage for psychedelic fungi, perhaps instinctively seeking the cognitive and emotional enhancements they provide. If bonobos, with their near-human intelligence, incorporate these mushrooms into their lives, it hints at an evolutionary thread where such substances could have played a role in the development of human consciousness itself. Yet, amid the Rigveda's lavish praise for Soma, there's a curious absence: Lord Shiva, the destroyer and transformer in Hindu mythology, is not mentioned at all in this ancient text. This omission is striking, given Shiva's later prominence in Hindu traditions. However, the descriptions of Shiva—his blue throat (Nilkantha), his ascetic pose standing on one leg, the serpents coiled around his neck, his mount the bull Nandi, and the mystical third eye—bear an uncanny resemblance to the physical and symbolic attributes of the Psilocybe mushroom, a potent psychedelic species. Psilocybe mushrooms oxidize to a striking blue when exposed to air, much like Shiva's blue throat symbolizing the poison he swallowed to save the world. They often grow in clusters that evoke writhing snakes, and crucially, they thrive in cow dung, linking directly to the sacred bull. This fungal form, emerging from the earth's humble offerings, mirrors Shiva's role as a yogi who transcends the mundane. These cow dung-grown mushrooms, edible and rich in psilocybin, are renowned for their psychedelic properties. They dissolve the ego's barriers, opening a ""third eye"" of perception that allows one to see the world in its raw, interconnected glory—free from self-centered illusions. This ego-dissolving effect aligns perfectly with spiritual enlightenment, transforming ordinary consciousness into a divine vista. On a molecular level, the intrigue deepens: psilocybin's chemical structure shares striking similarities with serotonin, the neurotransmitter regulating mood and perception, and dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the ""spirit molecule"" found in ayahuasca and endogenous to the human brain. These resemblances explain why psilocybin can mimic profound neurological shifts, fostering experiences of unity and bliss that echo ancient mystical states. Such experiences often mirror the teachings of the Mandukya Upanishad, which expounds on the realization of ""Aham Brahmasmi""—I am Brahman, the ultimate reality. Mushroom journeys frequently lead to this same epiphany: a dissolution of the self into the cosmic whole, where the experiencer feels one with the divine essence, just as the Upanishad describes the awakening from illusion to truth. Remarkably, many who partake in mushroom or DMT trips report visions of Hindu gods—Shiva dancing in cosmic ecstasy, Vishnu preserving the universe, or Kali embodying fierce transformation. These encounters suggest that psychedelics might tap into archetypal realms, resurfacing cultural symbols embedded in our collective unconscious. This isn't isolated to India; mushrooms are etched into human history worldwide. From the intricate carvings in Egypt's temples depicting fungal motifs symbolizing rebirth, to the erotic and spiritual sculptures at Khajuraho in India where mushrooms appear alongside divine figures, these fungi have been revered as sacred across civilizations. Shamans from Siberia to Mexico have long forged spiritual bonds with magic mushrooms, using them in rituals to commune with ancestors, heal the sick, and navigate otherworldly realms. Siberian shamans, for instance, consume Amanita muscaria to enter trance states, while Mexican Mazatec healers employ Psilocybe species in veladas—ceremonial nights of vision and insight. Even Christianity harbors subtle echoes: the iconic Santa Claus, with his red-and-white suit, mirrors the appearance of Amanita muscaria, a red-capped mushroom with white spots. Traditionally, these mushrooms grow under pine trees in northern forests, and the custom of placing gifts beneath a Christmas pine tree evokes the image of these ""presents"" from nature, symbolizing abundance and mystery in winter's depths. Modern science bolsters these ancient intuitions. Numerous studies demonstrate that psilocybin mushrooms can extend lifespan by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, enhance intelligence through neuroplasticity, forge new brain connections via increased synaptic activity, and cultivate greater compassion and love for life by diminishing fear and ego-driven behaviors. In therapeutic settings, they've shown promise in treating depression, anxiety, and addiction, reaffirming their role as a ""nectar"" for the mind and soul. Piecing it all together, it seems inescapable: the mushrooms sprouting from cow dung—those very Psilocybe species—must be the true identity of Soma from the Rigveda. This ""drink of the gods,"" pressed and consumed for its immortalizing effects, aligns perfectly with the psychedelic fungi that grant youthfulness through renewed perspectives, immortality via ego transcendence, and divine communion. What was once veiled in myth now emerges as a profound natural ally, connecting our primate past, spiritual heritage, and scientific future.

Now we are making humanoid robots to do physical labour such as house work and simple gardening.

Now im not saying its the same, i mean for starters we know AI is an artificially created algorithm, and the way we treat them is significantly less ethically wrong than the original treatment of enslaved people of colour back many years ago. But hell we really are treating them concerningly similar, as soon as we found an acceptable alternative to slavery, we fell right back into old habits of the same ways of living and the same language.

It's impossible to develop these types of technologies without shipping to customers. Particularly true for a startup like 1X. Apple was only ever able to do it because they had a predictable user base and knew at minimum how much they could sell.

@AndreVictorGoncalves,"​​ @FornasaOG  Again, a maid is $30 an hour, meaning you pay $500 in Just 16 hours. Also, maybe it Just open The door autonomously, but it can do everything a maid can if it gets remotely operated. Sure, this robot is remotely operated, but a maid can also record your house, copy The Keys and give it to a thief, or worse. A maid isnt a safer option. There is a lot of advantages tô this robot",2주 전(수정됨),0,

If this product actually did everything it was listed to do, sure $500 a month would be worth it..   But it doesn't.",2주 전,0,
@Met4lhe4d216, @AndreVictorGoncalves  Bro if you need a maid for 16 hours you got other problems. Said dude is afraid of technology but you're obviously afraid of people. The person on the other end of the robot could just as easily record your house or open the door for a bad actor so nice strawman's argument there. What dude is arguing is that this robot does not make sense economically. Most folks just need a maid for a few hours a month. L troll honestly.

@blaneysiktube,"Well said 👏🏻   Way too much hype around this on X, suspiciously so. Seems like there's a lot of paid shills and people who are already early investors completely over-hyping what it is.  The company themselves IMO have also used a very deceptive marketing strategy, much like in the video they released over a year ago where they hinted at everything being autonomous, even though it was all extremely scripted and teleoperated.   There's many red flags with this company IMO. No real proof of concept, no track record of scaling manufacturing. As you said, no huge data centre of training data.   This is effectively a Unitree wearing a jumper with limited teleoperation abilities.  I get that they need to raise funds, but deception is not the way. And honestly, I think the money required to be able to compete with companies like Tesla, who have immense amounts of compute and data, and a proven ability to scale mass manufacturing in record time, is not going to come from a few early adopters, not within 5 years.   Look at Rivian, Lucid, Ford, GM, VW etc, they all tried to jump onto the EV wagon 10 years behind Tesla, and not a single one of them is anywhere near making a profitable product. The same will apply in the humanoid robot space. There will be a few big players, companies like this will unfortunately be too far behind.",2주 전,0,

To fold something well, or do dishes. The robot will need to be built differently as it quote learns. Which means not finished. I think people who order this, will end up losing $20k.

The type of capabilities this requires will never happen given the way ai is built today and that might be a practical limit for creating ai through computing.

Laundry, dishes, and vacuum. Everything else can come next .   I'd argue a home is easier than a car. Homes don't charge that much, and nothing is moving as fast .  $500 dollars a month for daily house keeping is cheap.   All the other issues you brought up are well stated and I agree.

I was imagining what future can be and i thought that like india or whatever is going to become a ""sleep farm"" like somehow those chips scientists are planning to install in our brains are going to ""offload"" stuff into a global network of people. You'll be forced to 24/7 labor and pass away at 45 evening out the population and somewhere in the world some people will just hibernate for you under an IV drip. So it'd become a common practice in lower class families to just have one person sleeping forever generating money for the rest of them while having low food requirements. But i guess i was wrong.

From technical view the Tesla car is Way more safer/efficient since it's designed for one task.

Privacy is more ways than one is one of those things. There’s no physical kill switch… which id say should be on every self automated product… is there a mute button to kill the mics?

The only thing good I guess about this is if you do the $500 a month maybe you'll get it and then like a year or two later a newer model comes out or another brand comes out with a better robot.  But also I would wait a while before I would be getting one I wouldn't jump in right away because there's going to be some issues at the beginning and it needs to do a lot of that AI human real-world training to get better. Cuz as of right now they're having people on the back end control these robots.  Now for me though I would love to see a gig app for these robots where people can sit in the privacy of their own home and control the robots and do these tasks for people and get paid. That would be pretty awesome even more so for people that have disabilities where they don't even have to walk they're just using their hands to control it like say maybe someone's in a wheelchair and they can't do everyday activities but they could sit at home controlling this device and using their arms and doing tasks for other people in the world and earning an income.  Heck I would do that.",2주 전,6,

THIS makes sense to THAT person but the problem is that person or persons are as far removed from the average citizen & their experiences as can be & the gap between their reality & reality reality is as wide as humanoids being anything more than a ""look what I wasted money on!"" conversation starter & actually useful.  This isn't a personal attack on anyone of them, I just don't think they understand how goofy the idea of spending $20k on a robot that will take 7-10y before it can do tasks as good as the individual robots it's meant to replace is & that 99% of Americans aren't really striving for a Rosie when the Roomba works better than ""just fine"" for 20x less money.",2주 전,0,

@ArthurWolf,"Ok so, your argument stands and makes sense, *BUT* (butt :) ). If you want to go devil's advocate, here's a way: by far the most important thing to get to a successful AI (and that's particularly true for embodied/robot AI) is training data.  Whoever has the most training data the earliest/fastest, is who is most likely to get to a ""real"" AI robot that can actually do all these things. How do you get to have that data? By having tele-operators remotely control robots in people's homes, and recording the actions. That's your training dataset. SO, it actually makes sense (if you have enough runway), to ship a few thousands of these robots into the world, then have for the first few months MOST operations be done by an army of a few hundred tele-operators, THEN use all that recorded data to train a kick-ass model, and IN THEORY, this gets you the fastest to a ""general"" model that can adapt to all kinds of situations and do all kinds of things. If I was doing a robots company, this would be my business plan. You can't really skip this step, not today at least, you can't ""simulate"" thousands of random houses, it has to be real data. This means for the first few months (ideally), people won't have robots, they'll have remote-controlled maids, where a lot of the most complex tasks will be done by humans. BUT, if they do the training/model part of things right, then this is going to get them to a fully autonomous machine faster than any other method could. Think about it, $500/month (or the equivalent ""taken out"" of the 20k) pays for quite a bit of tele-operator salary (5-50$/hour depending on wheret he operator is), that's best case scenario 100 hours a month of tele-operator you can pay with just the subscription. I think this makes *some* sense as a temporary business plan. Then once they get a fully trained model, they stop having to pay the operators, and it's full profit, all into their pockets (well, minus the inference costs). I think this makes sense. But as a customer, you ABSOLUTELY ARE taking the risk that they might never figure out how to train the model, in which case your robot will stop working as soon as they run out of runway money (or maybe they'll have a plan where you can pay more than $500/month for human operators to control it, I guess). ACTUALLY, this makes sense as a business model even without the AI going into it. Like, this is uber for maids, where you're paying somebody to remotely operate a robot to clean up your house. Plenty of people have enough money to pay for a maid, and would maybe prefer a remote operator to an actual human coming into their house.  So even without AI this might make sense, at least for some people.  And then *at some point* in the future, they in theory should be able to train a model on all that data. The more I think about it the more it makes sense, but again, this is definitely a risk for customers, because there is no guarantee it'll work long-term, at least the AI part isn't guaranteed to work, the remote-operation part it seems like they have somewhat sorted that out.",2주 전,0,

It takes a human child seeing laundry get folded 2 or 3 times and then practicing it a dozen times to be 50% as competent as humanly possible at the task. It would take a current AI years to train on tens of thousands of images and videos to accomplish similar competence. But what if AIs were as smart as a human child? What if they could ACTUALLY learn instead of just brute-force extrapolative mimicry? It could see you fold your laundry a few times and then learn on its own feom there.

If tesla can't ship a driving ML model when they train it by selling a car that does function as a car. Claiming it'll come out ""next year"" since at least 2017...  Then these guys won't get anywhere with a robot that does jack shit today... Even if you buy into the hype, you can't ""drive"" it so there's no data to train on for them. Even if they hire all of india as teleoperators they won't get the amount of data that drivers generate on the road for any one car company.  So even if I didn't think that humanoid robots are a bs solution this particular approach will never be real. The only way to do this is probably to do virtual simulation training to get 90% there. And do quantization on the customers' real home on delivery. And it'll still be worse at doing the floors than a roomba...",2주 전(수정됨),0,

@joshuarosen465,The huge difference between this and FSD was that Tesla put FSD hardware into every car not just the cars of people who bought FSD. Those millions of cars were all phoning home with video that could be used for training. Tesla was able to sell those millions of cars because they were great cars even without working FSD. There is zero reason for anyone to buy this robot until it works and it's not going to work for many years. If they are to survive they need to pivot away from home robots to some specialized robot that has an immediate application. Tesla's robots will be going into their own factories first. To be useful they only need to be able to a limited number of functions. Over time they will be able to do more and more.

I would have expected them to be further along than this.  Aside from that, what's your opinion on K-Scale labs?  Different approach, potentially a lot better I would think.  Also, humanoids.  I hear this question a lot.  Why does it have to be humanoid/we have google/this other design is so much better!!!!  Yeah.  In an ideal world?  Some sort of Fifth Element style swarm of household micro robots would potentially work better.  The thing is, we don't live in that world.  Setting up google home equipment to do even half of what a humanoid could do would cost a fortune, and for a fair number of basic chores like laundry and dishes, there is no home automation tech that's even capable of it.  A humanoid robot is a drop in system.  Specialized robots might work better for the specific function they're built for, yes.... but the humanoid will do the job WITHOUT REBUILDING OUR LIVING SPACES AROUND THEM.  That rebuilding would cost a fortune even assuming we were in a position where we were allowed to do it in the first place, which given how many of us rent our living spaces (and how many will continue to do so with the housing market the way it is) is a staggering number of people who would benefit from this kind of automation that can't, because some purist decided that humanoids were inefficient.....  I'll agree.  I do not need for my robot to look like a person.  I don't even particularly WANT my robot to look like a person.  I do need for it to be able to function like one, at least at a basic, low level.  It needs to be able to use the cleaning tools I have available.  Which were designed for humans.

This is just speculation but the value of that 'real world data' could even be factored into the current price to make Neo cheaper. This is a common Silicon Valley strategy.

If you make $1000 a week from tele-operating it as a job for the company (Getting the job is the hard bit because the tele-operators are trained specialists, but in theory its possible).  While working for them you spend most of that time cleaning your own house.. specifically! I'm not sure how you would arrange that.  From there you make Pay($1000) - Hire($125) = Profit($875) per week for cleaning your own house.  So there are some pretty big assumptions in there: 1 - Getting the job, 2 - Cleaning your own house. But in 'theory' it could happen.  But considering that if you did land one of these rare 'tele-operator' jobs, you would most likely be making a ton of money anyway. This is because tele-operation is quite specialised, require advanced training etc so it would most likely pay very well.  So ultimately it doesnt make much sense to bother hiring a Neo as well just to make the 'con' work out.",2주 전,0,

But this goes way beyond that. I’m not trying to defend this humanoid robot company either, but someone had to take the first step. It wasn’t going to be the usual suspects — Bill Gates, Musk, Zuckerberg, etc. — the ones who, once again, will dominate another industry simply because they already have the money and don’t need to ask for a $20,000 deposit to improve their product while delivering a finished, yet not fully finished, version.  After all, it’s one you can continue to improve over time, even if that means giving up a ton of privacy and data. But that’s the point — the greatness of the market lies in competition, and not all development should revolve around the same people as always. If companies like this don’t offer early products like that, how else would innovation move forward?  Then there’s the other side — people who review products but have absolutely no idea how they work. No clue about programming, robotics, electronics, or electromechanics. Just a ton of arrogance, criticizing those who are actually giving their best with what they’ve learned in universities or wherever they gained their knowledge.",2주 전,0,

@LiamDilley,"With all the A.I stuff out there be in the pin, apps, robots and so on is the fact that current A.I is not A.I AT ALL! That is the key problem. Chat GPT can appear to do and think out amazing things but everything today is ultimately learning models which try to do what based on the data it has is the right response to something.  Take the Moderation A.I systems like on Instagram banning people for what they accuse is really serious but completely wrong. Like no question wrong. Yet they cant sort it, not willing to and have no legal recourse to do so. Why is it failing so hard though? Because it can not properly look at a photo and the rules governing it and make a decision on when it is not sure so at the end of the day it is still 1 or 0 Yes or NO. A human just knows things, it can me a decision and it can adapt to fast changing use cases.  The one thing with ""A.I"" in terms of robotics that is actually booming is the core learning of basic elements. Boston Dynamics spent years and years both with the hardware and the coding to just even get walking right and then all the needed calculations where you do not have a total flat surface. (Which is most of the time). Where what we actually have today ""Machine Learning"" is REALLY good is having your robot virtually in the computer. Giving it tasks like climbing stairs and let it fail over and over trying different things till it gets it right and then knowing that is a success. Feeding it terrain to walk over and everything else so it just knows and doing so quickly. Then putting that into the actual robot. The problem is you still have to govern what it is doing. ""Wash the dishes"" means nothing and is totally fake because what is dirty, where are they, how to look for them, then the actual gathering and loading in a real world environment they simply can not do yet. Every time you see say a Tesla bot in the office and just a few people walk around it it freaks out and all but crashes its ""brain"" as it is too much.  The hardware has jumped a huge amount because of ""A.I"" as well and that has been cool. Feeding data into models and coming up with better ways to create hardware, smaller motors, better materials, better x and y... Basically what humans could do but in a much faster pace.  BUT In reality with the real world we do not have actual A.I yet and there needs to be a key jump where this is actually closer, where it can actually make proper judgement calls and decisions based on the data and not just acting on best process.",2주 전,0,

But all in all that's dumb...   If a secondary system is sophisticated enough to detect and act when the main system is rogue by turning a led red, then it should be able to disable the main system entirely...  There's really no reason why the entire robot can't be turned off if it has any system at all that allows us to know that it is rogue...

Many early customers are unable to get updates because their hardware is too old. 2. Unreliable Timeline: Elon Musk repeatedly overpromised, claiming Level 3 or higher autonomy by 2020, then 2021, and various years since. While they've made progress, the timeline has been consistently missed. 3. Safety Concerns: FSD requires constant driver supervision and is known for dangerous errors like sudden, unprompted ""phantom braking"" (often near overpasses or bright light) and disregarding traffic signals, which is fatiguing and risky. I personally had a close call where FSD v13 in a Highland Model 3 made an unsafe left turn into the path of a school bus, and I couldn't react in time to prevent a near-accident. 4. Autopilot Deterioration: After subscribing to FSD, I found that Tesla's regular Autopilot is now significantly worse than competitors' systems, suggesting a lack of investment. The key difference here is the lack of a remote human intervening in FSD's case. My experience with FSD's dangerous phantom braking and that left turn that almost killed or severely injured my daughter has completely eroded my trust in Elon Musk's claims and the product, leading me to never buy a Tesla again.",2주 전,0,

@VanisherXP," @JDSileo  If you contract random people that are anonymous, then you are setting yourself up, same as by buying this robot, and doing such is not the norm in most parts of the world. Also, dropping hidden cameras in someone's home would get found out eventually, and make the news, and that is something that doesn't commonly happen anywhere. You are more likely to find hidden cameras when going into someone else's property like an Airbnb.   Recording the employee behavior would increase security, and discourage them from doing things like opening the door from the inside to a would-be thief, but it's a very ""trust me bro"" situation from the company, since you don't know how they're managing your data or their employees. Furthermore, you can't really prevent those employees from silently selling your information to thieves, and the employer has no way to control that besides doing the regular background checks on the people they hire. There is no guarantee that you won't be sold out just for the fact that you bought a 20k robot to begin with.  I guess someone could argue that the robot operator could be barred from accessing location information, and thus, doesn't know where your home is or who the owner of the robot is... but for a robot that can operate for many hours a day while you are away, and listen to conversations, it's hardly a challenge to find the location with the available information.
