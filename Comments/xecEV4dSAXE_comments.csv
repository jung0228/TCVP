@VictoriaMartinez-hg5tt,"I had been reflecting on our self-extinction as a species as a result of our lack of reality testing. We are taught in the Western world that beliefs  as a way to deal with reality are as valuable as reason.  We are taught that man is intrinsically sinful and that there is a God, the only one, who sent his son to earth born of a virgin to be crucified to redeem our sins. In my public high school in the developing world, I learned about the specific logical fallacy behind every argument for the existence of God. But lack of blind faith in pre-scientific Christian beliefs is regarded as a sin in the religious world.   Our lack of reality  testing is  what sent  a man convicted of 34 felonies for tax evasion, with six bankruptcies and two convictions for sexual abuse, with to a fraudulent university;   With Epstein as his best friend for ten years to the presidency.",5일 전,0,

These attacks include a $1.1 billion cut in public broadcasting funds to NPR and PBS stations, as well as a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal. attacks aimed at the Free Press earlier this year.  These attacks included a $1.1 billion cut in public broadcasting funds to NPR and PBS stations, as well a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Wall Strength et Journal.  From funding cuts and executive orders to billion-dollar lawsuits, the Trump administration is mounting a historic assault on independent journalism and press freedom.  Despite this win for freedom of speech and the press, the administration has broken from centuries of precedent by restricting press coverage. The White House Correspondents’ Association announced that — after more than a hundred years — it would no longer control the White House press pool in February. By ceding control of that power to the TRUMP🌮🤮administration, the White House now decides which journalists and news organizations are part of the press pool. Similarly, the Pentagon removed longstanding officesfor legacy media outlets such as The New York Times, NPR, and Politico for new media outlets, the majority of which lean conservative in their coverage.   In one of the administration’s earliest moves against the press, TRUMP🌮🤮 signed an executive order in February banning The Associated Press from the White House press pool for not using TRUMP’S 🌮🤮new name for the Gulf of Mexico. A federal judge ordered the White House to restore the newsroom’s access in April on the grounds that the ban violated the First Amendment. However, that decision was temporarily reversed after T is now RT ÿ in the process and it is not expected for the t and it has not happened since t is a t and the company will be in charge t try you out for next to the t so please take a seat in this matter and tt to things like thety and get your own business done so that t will țyqewp be resolved in wqdelayed by the D.C. Circuit with an appeal currently pending.  Similarly, the Pentagon removed longstanding officesfor legacy media outlets such as The New York Times, NPR, and Politico for new media outlets, the majority of which lean conservative in their coverage.  The federal government’s blatant attack on the media is unprecedented in recent history, but not unexpected from a president who has exhibited hostility toward the press for almost a decade.  From banning The Associated Press from the White House press pool to suing media companies over their reporting, TRUMP’S🌮🤮 personal and official track record with the media has proven that his administration is willing to dismantle our free press and violate the Constitution. 🌮🤮 inserted by yours truly‼️ ‘Nuff said‼️ 🔱",9일 전,0,

It was a mass casualty event and it has caused us all to become traumatized and vulnerable to a con artist like trump. To all kinds of grifters. It’s a global issue!,1개월 전,2,

@Tomschueller-j7q,"Trump did not earn his first money.  His dad gave it to him.  With that he got Trump Tower which pretty much runs itself with no intervention by him.  HIs own wife doesn't want to with him?  He is NOT a good person Trump has been a failure at pretty much all of his endeavors.  In my 67 years I had never heard the word tariff until Trump.  Slapping them on an island that only had penguins on it?  THAT is a STUPID extreme..  When he holds up his stupid tariff board, also hold up FAILURE board also with these:  Wikipedia states that ""..Born into a wealthy family in New York City..""  Donald Trump's wealth primarily stems from real estate holdings, including properties in New York City and other national and international locations. He also earned significant income through licensing his name for use on various properties. Additionally, his father, Fred Trump, provided substantial financial support, including loans and gifts, which contributed to his early wealth and business ventures.  He acquired Trump Towers with money from his dad and that is something that can just run by itself not needing him at all.   He didn't make the money he has, it was GIVEN TO HIM.  Donald Trump's wealth originates from a combination of inheritance, aggressive real estate expansion, branding and licensing his name, and media ventures. His financial success has been marked by periods of major gains and significant setbacks, including multiple bankruptcies for his companies.  Inheritance and real estate development Family fortune: The foundation of Trump's wealth is his father's real estate empire. His father, Fred Trump, was a successful builder of residential properties in New York's outer boroughs. A New York Times investigation found that Donald Trump and his siblings received over $413 million in gifts and loans from their father over decades, including methods that tax experts called ""improper or possibly illegal"".  Shifting to Manhattan: In the 1970s, Donald Trump took control of his father's company and renamed it the Trump Organization. He shifted its focus from residential units to glitzy Manhattan projects, including the Grand Hyatt Hotel and the iconic Trump Tower. Strategic bankruptcies: During financial downturns, Trump's companies filed for corporate bankruptcy multiple times, which allowed him to restructure debt and preserve his assets. This included several of his Atlantic City casinos in the 1990s.  He can't run a business without it failing what's bad for the US,  HE CAN'T RUN A COUNTRY EITHER.  When managing Trump Towers and when needing work done there he would contact people to do the work and then when they were done he would tell them he wasn't satisfied and wouldn't pay them.  He is making the US the laughing stock of the world and most detested country also.  He's the only president on my 67 years of living who is trying to make even more money for himself.  He is not an acting president he is MAKING HIMSELF A DICTATOR.  He is not an AMERICAN INDIAN SO HE HIMSELF IS AB IMMIGRANT.  This country was built by IMMIGRANTS   Making America Great again my butt.  Opening a golf course in Scotland is Making America great again?  Plus he traveled to Scotland on the Americans dime,  They even held signs up while he was there saying convicted felon. For $5,000.000 you can get a Trump Gold disk and get special privileges from him.  He put these stupid Tariffs cost the US minimally $50,000.000 because of his tariffs against China.  They were going to order 50 passenger jets from Boeing but with the tariffs against them they decided to get them from a European company Airbus  instead costing not only the money for the jets but the income taxes from their employees.  He had tariffs against an island that only has penguins on it.  BRILLIANT!  Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China are expected to cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 per year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank.of the   His tariffs also cost the US hosting the World Cup Soccer Games which would have gotten the US a lot of revenue from the World Wide fan base but instead that honor will be hosted in Canada.   Can't serve in the Federal Government of violations of things would fail of which Trump would be eliminated because of the listings:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-jvD0SgPY&t=36s  He has dementia. Complained about the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and how he sucked since Biden appointed him when it was he who appointed him a few years ago.  Going somewhere for your own business, you should pay the bill for air fare, room and board and the cost of the security personnel that went for your protection.  25th Amendment should be exercised.   He should be removed from office. He is going to go down as THE WORST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY  It is against the law to use the military in a policing entity in the US by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 which Trump has violated that more than one time.

I'D LIKE TO ASK HIM ABOUT THESE DURING ONE OF HIS PRESS CONFERENCES.  When he is holding up his data sheet on his tariffs he should also show a board of his failures.

Well, it only gets worse. Now, he has the USA under siege, tariffs have been waged against every country in the world… he has destabilized the entire geopolitical situation in global terms.   The USA is now a fascist authoritarian state, he’s capitulated to Russia… (there is a war in Ukraine after a russian invasion)… folks, please pray for us. The future is NOT friendly, and if you have tickets to mars, you best be on your way.   Ps. Elon is an evil elephant. He is how he won the election a second time.

The rest of the world is not applauding like MAGA rallies do. Outside your borders, people are watching with concern, even disbelief. And unlike the crowds chanting slogans, they happen to have an education that allows them to see the consequences of reckless diplomacy. For allies, this is not entertainment – it is destabilization. For rivals, it is opportunity. And for America, it is a slow erosion of the credibility and respect that took generations to build. In short: when you elect chaos, you export chaos.

@victoriageisser,"When I was a kid my family took a destination camping boating trip to Southern California. On the journey  home I was riding in the back of the pick-up truck with the dog (I know, but it was legal way back then and we were simple folk) as we were traveling we came across a road closure by the CHP. There were a half dozen cars already stacked in the line so naturally we thought it was simply an unfortunate accident (we'd seen a few on this trip already) or maybe a cigarette fire but after a few minutes the officer walked the line to inform the waiting drivers what the hold up was and to stay in their cars. There was a migration passing through. Being a kid and it being the early eighties, as I said before, I had been riding in bed of the truck and was able to ask the CHiPy what kind migration was passing through. As it turned out, the officer and his partner were among the first to come across the crawling mass, a matt of orange and black fur crossing the highway and they nearly crashed after squishing several of the unfortunate creatures. This of course prompted an emergency road closure. While we sat for about an hour waiting the swarm expanded and I looked down from the bed of our battered old blue Chevrolet to see that they had crawled around our truck, thousands of them harmlessly crossing the road. There was a biker who climbed onto the hood of the CHP cruiser, next to the officers while his three riding partners requested to sit in the boat we were towing. It's important to say here, that this was not a horror movie, not one tarantula climbed a car or in through the vents they didn't even try to climb the tires. The whole thing was hiss of rustling dry grasses and passed without further incident. I often thought I had dreamt the i this had happened, but a few years ago my mom confirmed to me, while we were relieving memories of my dad, that it had indeed happened. It  happened, it passed and there was no lasting sign it ever had. Surreal.",2개월 전,0,

He cheats at everything he does in life rather than do things the right way.. He pretends to be a brave human being yet he  dodged the draft three times in his own nation..He pleads innocent when he is guilty in spite of evidence.He lies as easy as he breathes even when there is no benefit to him personally  and absolutely no reason to serial lie. his way through life.,3개월 전,1,

@BruceBerube,"Sadly, many of our American neighbors begged for freedom and voted for chains.  Seniors slit their own throats by gutting the last thread keeping them from poverty. Men sealed the fate of their wives and daughters by turning miscarriages into criminal evidence. Immigrants begged for opportunity, then checked the box that summoned their own deportation squad.  Families stood in food bank lines and cheered while billionaires bought another yacht. Women screamed for equality, then voted for the men writing their shackles into law. Police, funded by taxpayers to uphold justice, pledged loyalty to a convicted felon like soldiers in a cult.  This is mass delusion.  People sold their futures to billionaires for the cheap thrill of knowing someone they resent might suffer more. They clung to a flag while their rights were stolen in daylight. A staggering portion of the working class didn’t just vote against themselves, they engineered the guillotine, climbed the steps, and pulled the damn lever.  This isn’t left or right. This is collective self-destruction.  And still, most would rather scroll, argue, escape, or distract themselves than face the fire. They talk big at family dinners, shout opinions in comment sections, cheer for millionaires on fields and stages, but freeze when it’s time to act. They wait for a leader while the country suffers around them.  This is not a wait-and-see moment. This is a become-your-own-hero moment.  (For all of us Canadians capable of critical thinking, we realize that there are far more decent, reasonable Americans than the loud, hateful minority fueling this movement.  We don't judge an entire village, city, state, or country by the worst people within it. We look for and admire who resists, who speaks out, who stands up when it matters.

These are the 2 words that to be fair, many people, especially those who read very little or are illiterate, or just not interested in clarity (details matter, words matter we think in words yet are very lazy and often quite irrational a skill that requires hard work and interest in being clear and understood and not jumping to hasty conclusions which is just one item in a list of what are fallacies, and are so named as such, with use of syllogisms to try to understand and is all mental pursuits. Posterity vs propriety wouldn't interest Trump, he tends to prefer superlatives that putws himself as the best rehgardless and it's clear he rarely sees others, if he does he sees stick figures, how else could he see himself above everyone else?

@whoever_81,"Apparently Curtis Yarvin and ""Dark Enlightenment"" is the whole philosophical framework behind the Trump administration.  Perplexity (Deep Research): ""Who is Curtis Yarvin and what is his vision and values""  Curtis Yarvin, born in 1973, has emerged as one of the most controversial political thinkers in American discourse, known for founding the neo-reactionary movement and advocating for the replacement of democracy with monarchical governance. Also writing under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin has cultivated significant influence among right-wing intellectuals, Silicon Valley technologists, and certain political figures within Republican circles. His ideas represent a radical departure from mainstream conservative thought, combining techno-utopianism with authoritarian governance models.  Yarvin is most prominently known for founding, along with philosopher Nick Land, the anti-egalitarian and anti-democratic philosophical movement known as the Dark Enlightenment or neo-reactionary movement (NRx). This philosophy fundamentally challenges the liberal democratic order that has dominated Western political thought since the Enlightenment.  The core of Yarvin's political vision centers on the rejection of democracy as a failed experiment. Through his blog Unqualified Reservations (2007-2014) and later newsletter Gray Mirror (started in 2020), he has consistently argued that American democracy is inherently flawed and should be replaced with an ""accountable monarchy"" that would function with governance structures similar to those of corporations. This vision represents a complete rethinking of modern governance based on hierarchical principles rather than democratic ones.  One of Yarvin's most influential concepts is what he terms ""the Cathedral"" – his framework for understanding how power operates in liberal democratic societies. According to critics of his work, Yarvin incorrectly characterizes modern progressive institutions as ""uncoordinated, decentralized, emergent"" when evidence suggests they are actually ""coordinated, centralized, purposeful"". This concept has nonetheless been widely adopted within certain right-wing intellectual circles.  Yarvin's political values represent a radical departure from mainstream conservatism, embracing positions that many consider deeply problematic. He has been described variously as a ""neo-reactionary,"" ""neo-monarchist,"" and ""neo-feudalist"" who ""sees liberalism as creating a Matrix-like totalitarian system, and who wants to replace American democracy with a sort of techno-monarchy"".  His positions on race and civil rights have drawn particular criticism. Yarvin has:  Defended the institution of slavery  Suggested that certain races may be naturally inclined toward servitude  Claimed that whites have higher IQs than black people (while maintaining he is not a white nationalist)  Criticized U.S. civil rights programs and described the civil rights movement as a ""black-rage industry""  In terms of governance, Yarvin has written extensively about how America needs to overcome what he calls ""dictator-phobia,"" arguing that authoritarian or monarchical systems represent the only viable path for right-wing political agendas. He praises China's political system for understanding that ""unitary executive control is necessary for strong governance"" and has criticized the First Amendment as ""one of the biggest barriers to the right wing agenda"".  His main influences: Thomas Carlyle, Niccolò Machiavelli, Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Hans-Hermann Hoppe.",7개월 전,0,

Monotheism has been a ""totalizing discourse"", often co-opting all aspects of a social belief system, resulting in the exclusion of ""others"".

@adalbertoruize,"The righteousness of the subconscious truth (father) is the truth of the subconscious (son): unconditional love (Holy Spirit)  “No man can come to Me (the truth of the subconscious: unconditional love) unless the Father (subconscious truth) who hath sent Me draw him; and I will raise him up at the Last Day.”   The reason for limiting heavens migration is based on the ratio for producing wisdom; who live from the subconscious truth: unconditional-love (honest: full: :sincere: of the heart: spirit-man:wise: truly intelligent) and the narcissists (fake: :empty: natural: religious: animal-man: believes solely on their perceived intelligence), this man/women, father/son, ying/yang temporal symbiosis is the way of eternal life (YHWH)   I.e. love your enemies   “Anyone with a giving persona, and a desire to help others, attracts narcissists. You give, they take. It’s a match made in heaven  hell. It’s an utterly confusing dynamic, not least because it’s so surreal. One of the keys to sanity is understanding that, when it comes to love, narcissists come from a completely different place.”   Therefore, unconditional (Holy) love (Spirit) is not narcissistic, but narcissists tend to have conditional love (conscience living)  Narcissists may show love, but it's often conditional on what they can get in return (false: hypocritical: religious). Their relationships are often transactional (trumpism = Nazism)   Eternal life is in the everlasting reasoning of the subconscious truth: unconditional love   Hence, it is for fears sake and thus for reason of hypocrisy that the conscience perception attempts to usurp the subconscious truth, this constant terrorism is the way of the unchanging progenitor of deception: conscience living  Eternal life (Jesus Christ) is the everlasting (perfect) reasoning (love) of the subconscious (father), whose truth (son) is unconditional (Holy)  Therefore, it is for fears sake and thus for reason of hypocrisy that the conscience-conscious (weak-women: constant-variable: everlasting-whore) attempts to usurp the subconscious-truth (strong-man: constant-constant: Holy-God), this constant-terrorism (holy-war) is the way of the unchanging progenitor of deception (father of lies): conscience living (sons of perdition)  Because when you judge you do it out of fear, that is to say apart from the courage of the subconscious/father truth/son, (whose love/truth/reasoning: Spirit, is unconditional/everlasting: Holy)  This hypocrisy comes by the deception of conscience living which leads to the everlasting terrorism of the subconscious truth (slavery to sin against the unconditional/Holy/eternal-love/Spirit/life)  Therefore, capitalism first (conscience living) is the deception (narcissist progenitor) of a paramount (true/eternal) democracy (subconscious/father-truth/son: holy/unconditional life/love: Jesus Christ)  Hence, you can be conscience conscious (which believe leads to terrorism by hypocrisy) or conscious of the subconscious truth: unconditional love (which believe leads to the new creation)  Because the truth (son) of the subconscious (father) is unconditional (holy)  Therefore, true life/love is without end (unconditional/perfect-reasoning/God)  In summation, we are not our subconscious (father) nor are we his truth (son), we are His conscious perception (ego) or do we consider our logic to to be on par with that of the beast of the field; in which we abide?  Eternal rest/life (sabbath) is the Holy Spirit (love/life from the truth of the subconscious: unconditional love/life)  The Conscience is the devil/weak-women (the law apart from the subconscious truth)  Conscience living is hypocrisy; extended hypocrisy leads to terrorism and terrorism is the eternal death of the subconscious truth  I.e. love your enemies",1년 전,0,

@bbanos,"Twilight Zone. We are living it. For 2 years  I've said it's literally impossible for this election to be close. One out of two American voters simply are not going to vote to close schools,  close libraries, end social security,, end totally women's rights to their bodies, end childhood Head Start.   We are a stupid nation yes, A living breathing idiocracy.... But once these one out of two see they're ending their own social security they're not going to vote for Trump.   So this election cannot be close and the polls are  Snapshots of  Low information, uninformed voters.   If you have a candidate who is reasonably articulate, knows the issues but disagrees with you then that's one thing. But even to the stupid this Trump - Convicted felon, About to be convicted 3 more times felon-in-waiting can get the votes of his bobble-head base.. But that's 1 in 4. Not 2 in 4 voters.  So this cannot Possibly be a ""Close Election"". The low-bar poor American media - both print and TV - have for 8 years normalized this egregious, contumacious bully and serial lier. And so here we are.   You too are in the trap treating a very psychotic empty suit as if he's an equal and could pull off victories in swing states. If ALL voters are informed,  then there ARE no swing states.  Every one of you, Times Radio,  WSJ,  NYT, REUTERS, CNN, MSNBC got everything wrong about  Ukrainians,  Their war and the paper-mache tiger Putin - a bully like Trump.

@johnmanigaulte1556,"Trump is suffering from ""spiritual illness,"" but so too are those who complain about him and who make fun of him and his misguided followers.

But what about the ""motivated ignorance"" that has the American public (and the rest of the world) watch a video of Derek Chauvin murdering George Floyd (for NINE MINUTES!!!), then we ALL have to suspend our ""knowledge of the murder"" and imagine that Chauvin is somehow ""innocent until proven guilty""? Our ""system"" (as interpreted in these modern days) asks us ALL to accept wholeheartedly a form of ""motivated ignorance.""  There is something dramatically WRONG with how we ""moderns"" apply Constitutional law?   In George Washington's day, there was a bounty on the head of Benedict Arnold.

Here's what the Christ in the word ""Christian"" actually said about such ones now as he said about the religious leaders of Judean Palestine then:  ""You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father.  That one was a MURDERER when he began,  and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is NOT in him.  When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, BECAUSE HE IS A LIAR AND THE FATHER OF THE LIE.""  (John 8:44)  And why do so many believe such a pathological liar?  Again, quoting Jesus Christ, who these same people also claim to follow:  ""Because I, on the other hand, tell you the truth, you do NOT believe me.""

@ZyrusSmith,"This video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix myself a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm a really shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I could introduce myself. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she had a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I wanted the best for her and I harbored no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seemed happy with her boyfriend, so I didn't bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it. I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already since I first saw her. Besides, I am quite happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wanted to live some other life without me in it, so I said, ""Okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness."" My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally couldn''t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, ""you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get myself a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got so distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video."" She said, ""You know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer."" So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.",1년 전,1,

The term weather refers to the very small scale version of it, like whether it is raining, snowing, whether it’s hot and dry or hot and humid. Climate is the aggregation of it over time. Weather changes much more frequently than climate, as in if it goes from raining to no longer raining, the weather has changed, but the climate would require a rainy season to become a dry season to represent the same degree of change.

@koobabe1,"Why I will NEVER Vote for Donald Trump. Let me say that I think Biden has done a terrible job in several areas. First, with regards to Immigration and securing the US border with Mexico. You cannot allow all these illegal immigrants to just walk into the United States. We do not have the opportunity to properly check these people out and to make sure that they are not terrorists or criminals.   As we have seen in the news, illegal immigrants have beaten up our police in New York and have murdered innocent people in this country. I just do not understand why the Democrats and Biden are allowing this situation to happen. I am an immigrant and I applied through legal channels to study in the US and become a US Citizen. I am very proud of the United States.  Now let’s talk about why I will never vote for Donald Trump. I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican. I vote for a person whom I think is going to best serve my country, but right now if Biden and Trump are the only two choices, we do not have a good option. Between these two terrible options, I will still vote AGINTS Trump.  As a Christian, I cannot vote for someone who puts down women and the handicapped, is an adulterer, lies, cheats on his Taxes and steals, is a murder by supporting the Saudi King and murder of Koshaghi, supports North Korea in killing and ruling his people with an iron fist, and worse than all supports PUTIN in murdering innocent people in Ukraine. I cannot support a person who thinks our soldiers who have given up their lives for our freedom are stupid and said that John McCain was not a hero for being caught. This is from a man who has NEVER served in the military or served his country.   I cannot support a man who picks on Gold Star Parents and insults the family of a Muslim American soldiers who served our country. I cannot support a person who is trying to destroy the NATO alliance because this is what Putin wants. He is Putin’s puppet. He supports PUTIN and Russia and Kim Jung un and North Korea. How many of our soldiers fought and died in Korea and Vietnam against communism? Today Trump bows to them. I cannot support a man who encourages Americans to invade the U.S. Capital just so that he can continue his rule as a dictator! He hugs a flag and yet, he has never served this country. I guess, Trump was right by saying that he could walk in downtown New York and shots and kills a person, and no one will touch him! This is what a dictator says.  I cannot support a person who has promoted hate in this country by calling ALL Mexicans and Muslims criminals while saying that the right wing NAZIZ are good people. People tend to forget what he did during the four years he was the president. Just about EVERY person who worked for him called him a Moron and a danger to this country. I cannot vote for a person who has broken laws and has 96 federal charges against him. I cannot vote for a person who tried to steal people’s votes in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.  Finally, as a Christian I cannot vote for a person who holds up the bible upside down and claims to be a Christian and yet he NEVER went to Church when he was the president. I will bet you that he cannot quote two verses from the Bible.  However, I will say that Trump is very smart! I call him Teflon DON! He knows how to cheat people by taking them to court, so he does not have to pay what they are owed. By threatening the Polish workers whom he brough over from Poland and then decided to only pay them about ½ of what they were owed.    I am really shocked at my Christian brothers and sisters and my friends who are educated, who continue to support this Criminal and Dictator!   But Trump chose the right type of people to target as his supporters. Trump figured that by running as a Republican he would get the Evangelical Christians votes, even though he committed adultery on his first wife with his second, on his second wife with his third and then on his third wife, Melania with a prostitute! He then figured that by cutting taxes for the wealthy, he would get their votes. Then he figured that many of the blue color workers who supported the democrats, and the uneducated Bubbas had one thing in common. Hate for Mexican, foreigners, and blacks. So, on the very first day, he called all Mexican’s criminals.   To my friends who want to vote for Trump, I don’t know which category you fall into, but I know my values does not allow me to vote for a person who has broken just about all of the Ten Commandments. You need to decide your own values! Which category do you fall into?",1년 전,2,

Then you basically left comment saying, “um actually the left doesn’t tell the truth”  That is Whataboutism.   This conversation isn’t about “the left” it is about Trump just read the title of the video dude.   I am not saying that you claim is wrong, but that is a different conversation that can be discussed on a video about “the left”.

And you want to jump on the bandwagon and ride that train with her? Just like the documents that the president has every piece of authority to walk away from the presidency with them. Because as a president he can declassify a document by word or deed at any time. And there his case law that supports that exact conclusion. Not only that, there is direct case law about the presidential records act, that under federal law the president can decide whether the documents belong to him as his personal records, or belong to anybody else. And only the president in question, has the ability to make that decision.

No constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it.""    Evelyn Waugh said something similar. ""Civilisation has no force of its own beyond what is given from within. It's under constant assault, and takes most of the energies of civilized men to keep it going.""  American society's soul has withered to ensure there is a total dearth of civilized men (and women).

That would be the 33% who are acolytes and the proportion of the 33% of agnostics he can sway on any given day. * What can we possibly do about it? Legislate psychoanalytical bars to public office.

Any updates on how BigBiden and MamaKamala are handling the border?  You know, the place with all those people ignoring the policies of legal entry passed by Clinton and Obama.  Strange how that was constantly plastered all over western media in the lead up to Biden's record breaking victory, only to disappear quicker than the crack in Hunter's pipe.  Biden claims that he's reduced unemployment to near all-time lows, boosted the US economy to near all-time highs, pulled all troops out of [insert M.E country] or that he and his son had absolutely no connection with Ukraine whatsoever.  Not much coverage on these topics.  Topics that many would consider to be somewhat important, especially given the...... highly excitable nature of the media whenever Biden's predecessor did or said anything and their insatiable desire to analyse it for days if not weeks on end whilst doomsaying their viewers into a constant state of fear, sorrow and rage which unlike in Dubya's terror fighting heyday, is now directed purely towards yourselves, your family, your neighbours, your fellow countrymen.   My point is that there are plenty of examples across the entire political spectrum of politicians who scheme, flip flop, bend the truth so hard it'd make even a russian contortionist blush with envy or even just straight up lie to our faces, be it to line their own pockets and/or push an agenda, which until recently, was achieved solely via the ""mainstream/legacy"" media.   A media that's keenly overseen by the very same people who oversee the politicians.  People who decide what the latest distraction, pardon, I mean what the news will be.   This is nothing new btw.  Leaders have been using the ""media"" of their time to shamelessly spread propaganda favourable to them and their benefactors, with ""persuasive"" zeal increasing the further back in time you go.   To sit here and imply that [insert politician you like] isn't a liar like [insert politician you don't like], is as fantastically ignorant as it is hilarious and depressing.    Here's a tip: whilst perusing your daily newsfeed, play ""The Why Game"" with yourself: with gems such as ""Why are they reporting on this?""  ""Why are they reporting on it in this way?""  ""Why aren't they reporting on [different topic of importance] instead?""  Don't forget to add ""How"" and ""Who"" as super fun bonus rounds.  ""How does this report compare with other outlets/journos, live witness accounts or raw unedited videos online""   ""How does this particular journo/outlet compare when relaying similar content regarding [insert figure/topic of interest]?""    ""Who benefits from the topic being presented?"" ""Who pays the people presenting this topic?""    Be skeptical, be critical.  There are no stupid questions, only stupid people.  It's better to appear foolish for a moment than to remain silent and forever be one.  character  I had more to add but it's food o'clock and I'm almost certain I'm close to derailing myself  :D",2년 전,0,

@VitaeLibra,"Communist? Look up America's political spectrum. Biden is just as capitalistic as trump. Jesus was a socialist/communist which you are mocking yet below you say we mock jesus  If trump didn't make mistakes and drained the swamp then shouldn't the democrats have only the good guys left? Meaning Biden is a good guy?  You claim everyone else supports pedophiles but you support the guy who said ""grab em by the pussy"" and apparently is still of that mindset? Shouldn't both be bad then? Why are you okay with one of them?  Crimes against humanity? Didn't reps storm the capitol and yell about killing all the politicians? So they could put trump in power?  ""In the meantime, when so many thousands of the people had gathered together that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops. “I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do. But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him! ...""  Luke 12:1-59  It's almost like the bible tried warn us about the capitol riot? All politicians keep secrets but you don't see the left trying to overthrow democracy. damn this is a spot on comparison to that day  “Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”   On the topic of religion trump has been to church 14 times in his presidency. Biden goes every sunday. Sometimes conservatives even get mad that he doesn't show up elsewhere while he's at church. Let's see if god wants to bless trump:  ""For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.""  - 2 corinthians 11:13-15  You yourself just compared him to Jesus and said he was here to save people  ""Everyone who is arrogant in heart is an abomination to the Lord; be assured, he will not go unpunished.""  -Proverbs 16:5  So is trump winning all the time or not?  ""When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom. The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them. Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.""  -John 18:36  Is he richer than the media says or not?  ""Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker; he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished.""  What was his solution to homeless people again?  ""Let brotherly love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body. Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous. Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” ...""  - Hebrews 13:1-25  trump and his many wives seem to disagree  ""But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.""  - Matthew 5:32  Woops....  Should I keep going? I'm only 1/4th of the way through the list   Americans claim to live in ""the land of the free"" yet their country has the most laws on earth and is also pumping out more each year   God doesn't want you to keep your inheritance though. He'd prefer if you gave to the poor and those who come to you for help. That is if you want to get into heaven   ""He is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.""  - 1 Timothy 6:4-5  This is refering to you. What you are doing. You want to claim the left are underlings while you sit here and thank trump for going against every sentence, every word in the bible. Even if you are so simpleminded that you still don't get it, don't turn on God",3년 전,0,

Because looking to blame Presidents (or Vice Presidents) who have limited power in things when there are plenty of other attributes to the events is pretty much brainwashed nonsense.   Same reason I don't give most of the credit or hate to them for things that Congress passes without their input like some uneducated munchkins do, especially when something passes with a veto-proof majority.  In this particular case I'll blame Trump, not Biden because Biden wasn't the one spending the years leading up to this literally trying to redirect Russia's actions onto Ukraine and weakening their defenses, likely things that were planned for this invasion in hopes of making things easier. Hell, Trump being President would have made things easier, or did you not notice the fact that he literally supports Russia's actions?",3년 전,1,

Science and those in the scientific community have accepted Darwin's theory of Evolution as fact, and evolution cannot be reconciled with their little black book. Their solution to this is to start America dow the trail thst leads back to the 13th century. But it's not new, they've just been emboldened by the election of Orange Jesus. They already had mostly conservative cops in every precinct who understand their job is to kill black people when possible and defend White Christians. Their ""Faith"" is supposed to trump justice and the rights of others. Their values allow them to commit heinous crimes in the name of God. That's right people. Religion is the biggest problem, followed by the biased courts, corrupt political system, and they have trickled down into the financial system, the workplace, the schools, everywhere. The ignorant, less intelligent people are dictating to us all with their faith.",2년 전,0,

@invader_jim2837," @Shorty_Lickens  I just returned from a near 3 month MSM/news/social media cleansing a couple weeks ago so I haven't caught up, meaning I'm genuinely curious as to which war Biden ended and the figures behind the alleged increase of employment.    It'd be nice to have the numbers of permanently closed small/family/local businesses and other domestically based companies that moved their homebase/production overseas, among whichever jobs were generally outsourced to more competitive international interests so I can compare them with their respective opposites then finally with the employment rate.     Also, how does the US define employment?  In Australia, we have had numerous PM's and MP's claim responsibility with amazingly quick increases in employment over the years.  Turns out the numbers are not all they seem to be, for example they heavily relied on simple casual/part time jobs being shared by multiple people at the same time, even including telemarketing jobs outsourced overseas ""since the job was offered/created locally"".   I don't think it's too much for us agree that a leaders lack of focus on attaining legitimate full time work for their citizens or giving budding business owners the confidence to invest locally, in favour of artificially boosting some numbers long enough for them to be considered ""accurate"" at the time a victorious 30 sec clip is filmed and released, is a healthy way to run a country.

@kitsunekierein7253,"Why do fascists lie?   By Stephen Kierein   They lie because the image of themselves is not the person they actually are. They need to lie, even to themselves. It is not by accident that politician and liar are widely agreed to be synonymous. A politician's entire career is built around pretending to be whatever others wish them to be and often has very little to do with who they truly are. Trump is a good example. He built a persona that he convinced people was his own. People who knew him privately knew him to be something completely different. His own blood agree he is a psychopathic narcissistic and incompetent megalomaniac. However, he fooled everyone into believing he was a top tier businessman and master negotiator with a godlike intellect never before seen in all the history of the world. Once people believe the lie, they can be controlled.   Fascism is exactly the same. Hitler was not seen as a monster by his own people BECAUSE he controlled the truth. Anyone who wishes to control the truth should never be trusted. A free press is designed to make truth completely separate from the controls of the powerful. So long as the powerful attempt to control the facts for their own ends, we will always be vulnerable to this kind of attack from within. Donald trump, or someone like him, will try to do this again. Do not fool yourself into thinking it could never happen. If the capitol building can be sacked, anything can happen. It is vitally important that we do something immediately to prevent this madness from repeating itself, and a doctorate could well be written on the myriad lessons we can take away from this civilization shaking cataclysm. There is a very good reason we are hardwired to be wary of those who lie. It provides a very real survival (dare I say evolutionary?) Advantage. Where politics is concerned, however, dishonesty is a fact of the game. Why ought the powerful get this kind of imbalance? Why did we build a system on a foundation of accepting the unacceptable?    We as a nation must ask ourselves this question. Unlike every other political issue, we MUST find solutions. The game is built to make solutions temporary and makes conflict the name of the game.    We say, ""you are not to discuss race, religion, and politics in public!"" But this is itself a damning demand. The damnation comes from the unspoken component. It comes from the answer to why you are not to talk about these things: to prevent conflict.   That answer admits to the asker that these beliefs should never be questioned if our civilization is to survive the night. These beliefs, which are not properly rooted in facts and evidence, are easy to disprove. However, the powerful have these beliefs to thank for the very existence of their power. That is why the powerful want exceptions. Without exceptions to the rules, legal or otherwise, the powerful would loose their power by the very act of preserving that power as this insurrection has underlined that point clearly.   The dishonest rely on objectively unethical practices like controlling who can and who cannot vote. We call this voter suppression. They call it election integrity steps. However, regardless what you call it, it is the same thing. You can do whatever mental gymnastics you want, but that fact will still remain after all of it. that fact cannot be overcome with facts, so we are expected to not bring it up. Its the same with most ""political"" issues.    Take abortion rights. The left and the right use different facts as their foundation in the same way that Christianity and Hinduism are founded on mutually exclusive sets of myths. Pointing at that makes the powerful unhappy, but they do not have to be happy; we do.    Please think on this, people. Our future hangs in the balance. Do not let it be cast to ruin by the greedy and the selfish.",4년 전,1,

@GGrey1975,"​ @collateralanimation5254  No, not that at all.  My comment was reflecting on how HBO's parent company (WarnerMedia) has a News Channel (CNN). If I wanted the news/commentary about, I have the option of selecting said. CNN's reporting has become a joke with how little research/follow-up they do on a story unless it fits their view on the News. Most of the ""Talking Points' Mr. Oliver was covering here were from (at that point) ""last week"" which had gotten the LOWEST ratings of CNN's programming,   It's one way that Mr. Turner (major Shareholder of WarnerMedia, & a not quiet beef against Trump) can manipulate public opinion against Donald Trump, by having him painted in a 'bad light' all the time in different medias (as a study's findings discovered 80-99.96% of all media on any subject dealing with Trump/Followers after his bin for the WH has been negative). In Sociology & psychology that is understood as Propaganda-based Manipulation, or psychological warfare on the American Population that is unaware of it happening.   Not unlike how the Nazi Party may have blamed/framed Communists for the Reichstag fire in 1933. Or how the Democrats blamed Trump for the Capital Riots in 2021; though the evidence of preplanning prior by select groups not affiliated with Trump makes the narrow legal definitions for Incitement & Insurrection as false information that is still used as a talking point against.  History is repeating itself, including that the Media will fawn over whom they want as Dictator/Leader (as there is little/no negative local media/press-coverage allowed within a country with a Tyrannical Government). Remember, Hitler was praised for within 5 yrs getting Germany out of a Depression (prior to WW2) - including in the US. Q-Anon being allowed to stay active when other ""Alt-Right"" sites were purged, seems to like USSR's Operation Trust (1908)",4년 전(수정됨),1,

The worst part is is how brainwashed the public has become in believing shit like this because our when you look at everything together, this has been straight engineered. Government privatizing everything instead of actually being a government, schools teaching you to follow instructions and don't question authority while stamping out creativity while at the same time teaching you lies and allowing parents to intrude in education that they have a problem with.

Give your money to the rich they said, and it will better this country. Just FORGET that the middle class is the economic driving force. Cut taxes or millionaires will leave despite history showing us otherwise.   And when smart people rightly pointed out the idiocracy, the rich waged a war on education. ""Go to college and get brainwashed to be a liberal hippy"". That is where we are now, with 75 million idiots voting for a silver spoon trust fund idiot.  Correction, a lot of those who voted for Trump aren't idiots. They knew exactly what they were doing. From the rich elites who wanted more deregulation to the white supremacists who wanted to keep this country white, Donald Trump was their guy. I've given up on the previous generations.

So we see the stupidity clearer. Doesn't mean previous generations didn't have their idiots.  I mainly mean in the sense that everything Republicans stand for seems to be the opposite of the way the world is moving forwards. Kids are growing up in a multicultural world, as Republicans are calling for the defending of their ""American"" culture. Religion is also disappearing which is in line with our separation of church and state. The younger generations are more open to being who you want to be and pushed forward things like gay marriage nationwide only a few years ago against Republican wishes.

There is no deep state, that term was created to deflect from accountability when Trump and the Republicans were caught lying and it's ironic that you are calling other people names while you are so detached from reality!  2. Calling Covid the WU Flu is racist, because the implication is that China is to blame for this virus even though it merely originated there, which is irrelevant.  3. Nobody is gaslighting you or acting like a sociopath for rightfully calling out your bigotry, your response is just deflection and not an actual defense for your awful behaviors!  3. Trump was rightfully impeached twice.  He obstructed justice with regard to the Mueller investigation, and he incited his supporters to commit the Jan 6 insurrection.  Whether or not he is truly held accountable is a separate issue but we know it happened.  4. Trump played a part in helping the vaccines be completed ASAP, but he also royally fucked up the nation's response to Covid, which you would know if you paid attention.  Saying the dems wanted to keep us locked down forever is so objectively false that you look insane for even suggesting that.....  5. Trump is indefensible and you look bad for trying to defend him.  He did so many terrible things over the course of his presidency and thank god he is gone.  The very fact that he repeatedly lied and tried to gaslight anyone calling out his lies really shows just how bad he was, and yet there was so much to criticize him for that it is something to behold!

@GGrey1975," @jonbowman7686  About 3 months later than I would have liked to respond to, though you seem to have gotten my intent wrong, & many things of history as well. Um, did I say that the ""media fawned over trump?"" No, as my statement (emphasis on the CAPS here) was ""that the MEDIA will FAWN OVER WHOm THEY WANT AS A DICTATOR/Leader."" As examples; fawning over Hillary (& had a meltdown with she lost), 98.6% of Mainstream Media about POTUS 45 (no matter the subject) was Negative (per review by Harvard's School of Politics & Public Relations), & won't call-out POTUS 46 for his admittance of a political ""quid pro quo"" during a CFR Q&A as VP to 44.   Minus out if you feel Trump disserved what he has gotten or not, the Media has an over two scores (40 yrs) of history of Anti-Conservative/Republican-&-Pro-Democrat/Progressive bias track-record. With Trump effectively 'flipping the Bird' to Mainstream Media and calling them out was a direct questioning of their ""authority""/monopoly of them controlling the flow of truthful information - the negativity and blatant bias against was no longer filtered & was on display for all to see. It's one way that Media Heads (that have a not quiet beef against Trump) can manipulate public opinion against, by having him painted in a 'bad light' all the time in different medias (as a study's findings discovered 80-99.96% of all media on any subject dealing with Trump/Followers after his bin for the WH has been negative). In Sociology & psychology that is understood as Propaganda-based Manipulation, or psychological warfare on the American Population that is unaware of it happening.  The Third Reich was built on mostly believed/emotional propaganda, like what the Democrats/Media push today. The NAZIs were (Far-Left) Socialist first & foremost - not conservatives or Far-Right. Though totalitarianism seems the same at the two extremes of control (Communism for the Socialist ideas & Fascism for Liberal ideology).  Like the Democrats, the NAZIs of Germany promised (& delivered, at a cost); access/free to all education levels (& anything outside of government approved lessons were not allowed, & could face penalties if brought up or taught), medical treatments (including for LGBTQ+, & not following what the state feels is best had repercussions against the individual), fair/minimum earnings (subsidized by the Government to help business/individuals, only if they follow/qualify to standards set by).  They were supported by the State ran Media (much like how NPR downplayed/denounce POTUS 45 & Republicans in general, though promote 44/46 & will usually not state a Democrats party affiliation if something ""bad"" is about them) & any independent 'news' publications (as risks of fines, or nationalization of company to force compliance).  If there are any similarities for Q-Anon in history, Operation Trust by the Russians/Soviets in 1921-26.  Much like the deplatforming/silencing of Alt-Right Media in the modern day, Operation Trust also did so to all but one publicly visible (& gullible) Group (like Q-Anon was allowed to become large in the manufactured vacuum of Alt-Right sites being purged). This was to lure in direct followers & shame anyone that might remotely share values when the demonization of (in case of Q-Anon, Jan 6) happens.  It was (arguably) a 'successful' psychological operation in the lead up to the Jan 6 events; except that the long lasting effect (silencing opposition that Q-Anon may have had even a slight resonation with) did not occur & addition Demonization (now referred to as Call-out/Cancel Culture) is having less/no effect in helping sway public opinion/polling against ""Far-Right"" positions.

@GGrey1975," @CasualKing21  On you comment of ""it's a religion/cult at this point,"" which side of the argument/debate are you referring to? For you've got self-prophesizing sycophants both sides full believing the bull crap coming out of their mouths, wither that is what's actually the stance of their side or not. The real rub is which are the ones who tell the factual truth & not care who it burns, and ones who are just giving enough facts to stir-up emotional outrage (including using sound-clipping out-of-context from the opposing-side to make said seem not to care) - while both claim they've got the 'moral high-ground' authority to do so?   Some old saying about opposing views on an event, somewhere in the middle is the actual truth.  Another is ""Front page - Accusations, page 6 - acquittals & retractions,"" which is in line with ""a Lie will be around the World before the full Truth has its pants on.""  And while the telling/viewing of a Truth is subjective; the Facts that back up that point of view may not be enough for it to stand up to another Truth that uses the same base Facts with other supporting Facts to make another (sometimes opposing) Truthful point of view on a matter.  This usually leads into one of two groupings; a group saying that the first presentation of Factual truth is enough & should not be wavered from (like an election results), and another having facts to questing that point of view of events (questioning the legitimacy of an election) as first presented.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@mwernli2886," @livewiiiiire  Well, thank you for your kindness and nice words. You know, to a certain (however very small degree) I can understand why people voted for Trump. He was no politician before becoming president in 2016 and kind of managed to convince the fellow Americans (although I don’t understand at all how) that under his watch, the so called swamp could be drained. What he didn’t say and people obviously didn’t realize was, that Trump was and still is a part of the swamp himself. And even worse: Trump was able to fool two parties: Foreign Dictators and Governments, that he wanted to establish a friendship in between the two countries and on the other hand his own country and approximately half of its inhabitants, by saying that America would always come first.   Especially the second point was, what his fans wanted to hear and from this moment on, they have been supporting him blindly.   It’s not extraordinary that there are certain people who are able to speak in a way that just resonates with the normal people. But, and that is what I have difficulties understanding, after everything that happened in Germany less than a century ago, I would have thought that the American voters would discover the similarities between then and the past five years. But that didn’t happen. And this remains the dangerous point to this very day. If there’s anybody who claims to be able to solve everything, as well as to know everything or ( being a „stable genius“, that is the point to pay attention. And that didn’t happen either among the followers of Trump and even his Republican Party. America walks on a dangerous path and I can only hope that in 2022 the majorities in the House and Senate won’t change, because if they do, then everything could from the new. What the USA needs imo, is continuity. This doesn’t happen if there’s a change in the leading party every eight years. This would be the first step on the way out of the mess caused by Trump. I really hope that America is capable of overcoming the the deep split in the society and act again as it states in the country‘s name: United.",4년 전,1,

@GGrey1975," @Dr-Mantis-Tobogan  If I knew better as to what you're asking, I could give a better answer - though with historical patterns as a guide, I'm not surprised at the situation as a whole. In an outside looking in POV with all information weighted equally & possible emotional motivations accounted for, the ""insurrection"" was one of the latest 'false flags' actions. How Biden spoke of the ""attack on democracy"" of Jan. 6 & the Democrats beating the drum for making ""those responsible pay"" mirror the emotional tenor of Hitler's call to hunt down Communist Party members in Germany & punish them after the burning of the Reichstag in 1933.   As there is circumstantial evidence that both were aggravated by the powers that be, that then are those calling for punishment of those ""responsible for"" are the ones that had gained power during/from and the media in both cases denounced any view other than the leadership party, then I say history is following that pattern still - with those that might have been involved still jailed without formal charges (aka ""Political"" prisoners) & more rounded up over a year after the fact.  Though old & a bit juvenile of a saying with all of this name-calling out there, ""It takes one to Know one"", or a person that want to accuse someone of being a closed-minded biased bigot due to some form of --ist, -ism &/or -phobic are most likely themselves and makes such claims to distract from their own nature/short-coming & make those they are attacking go on the defense about (even if that name-calling is not related to the matter at hand).  History is cold & hard on the factual tallies, we can either accept that we may not know all those factors, especially the emotional ones...

That sounds to me like someone trolling, on sensational/speculative information that only truth to is that some Media organization stated it. If there was actual Evidence for said that is iron clad, the Raid at Mar-a-lago by the FBI would have been for Trump's arrest & not some data gathering warrant overblown.  No, I would say that the Media & Political fascination on Donald Trump is mostly a distraction, one it seems you have bought into. Even now, those that pursue him (either through potential misuse of the Government, or media stories) have nothing truly positive to say for themselves (or their side) other than they're going after the ""orange man"" that is a (place derogatory name/slander here). If they do it is so infrequent that it's hard to recall when that happened last.  I have a prediction, and though dislike doing so will compare it New Testament text as a pliable philosophical comparison. Like Jesus, Trump was an outsider to the establishment he chose to be a part of & they were persecuted for ""heresies"" towards even though they tried to offer the olive branch. And like its written for the second coming of Jesus, were many sinners think they will be saved but will be judged & put to the flame - All those in D.C. fear a return of Trump because it will most likely not be ""Mr. Nice Guy"" that is willing to be dragged through the swamp, and every tactic that has been used against him will be return with interest.  What I fear is the systems are already in place to squash any dissidents in the US, it will be a di-jinn that has yet to be released from its bottle & I can see it happening soon.  Either by those that will want to stop Trump at any cost, or by Trump for he will not let the cities burn again under his watch & be limited because he's ""being respectful"" to local leaders.

Business Insider spoke with the brother of captured American Luke Denman, the U.S. State Department, and Juan José Rendón, a former advisor to Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaidó, to understand what aspects of this complex story are rooted in fact, and what aspects may have been constructed by the Venezuelan government.  https://www.businessinsider.com/venezuela-coup-green-berets-maduro-guaido-jordan-goudreau-incursion-silvercorp-2020-10  In May, the Venezuelan government released photos and video footage showing a ragtag group of men who appear to have been captured by security forces in a village on the country's northern coast. According to President Nicolás Maduro, eight people were killed and dozens more were captured in what he said was an attempt to kidnap him and remove him from the country. Among the captured men were two American former Green Berets, who were reportedly hired to train men for the operation in Colombia.  In what the Venezuelan government called ""confession videos"" released by state-controlled media, the two Americans said that they were working on behalf of the U.S. government, specifically under the orders of President Donald Trump. However, President Trump, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, flatly denied any American involvement in the plot.  Business Insider spoke with the brother of captured American Luke Denman, who points out red flags raised by the footage. Denman, along with a spokesperson from the U.S. State Department, suggests that the men in the footage were used as pawns in a false flag operation staged by the Venezuelan government.  Along with Mark Denman and the U.S. State Department, Business Insider spoke with other key figures to understand what aspects of this complex story are rooted in fact, and what aspects may have been constructed by the Venezuelan government.  https://youtu.be/QlK5DgS58y0  Some among America's military allies believe Trump deliberately attempted a coup and may have had help from federal law-enforcement officials.  The National Guard, which was deployed heavily to quell the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, did not show up to assist the police until two hours after the action started on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.  Video shows police doing nothing as rioters access the building One video appeared to show some police officers opening a barrier to allow a group of protesters to get closer to the Capitol dome. Another video showed a police officer allowing a rioter to take a selfie with him inside the Capitol while protesters milled around the building unchecked.  Kim Dine, who was the chief of the Capitol Police from 2012 to 2016, told The Washington Post that he was surprised that the Capitol Police allowed demonstrators on the steps of the Capitol. He said he was also mystified that few rioters were arrested on the spot.  Larry Schaefer, who worked for the Capitol Police for more than 30 years, told ProPublica something similar: ""We have a planned, known demonstration that has a propensity for violence in the past and threats to carry weapons — why would you not prepare yourself as we have done in the past?""  https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-attempted-coup-federal-law-enforcement-capitol-police-2021-1  Secret Service experts are speculating in group chats about how Trump might be hauled out of the White House if he won't budge on Inauguration Day  https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-trump-eviction-inauguration-secret-service-white-house-2020-11  California Republican Party Admits It Placed Misleading Ballot Boxes Around State. Government officials say the receptacles are illegal and could lead to election fraud, but the party says it will continue the practice.  Trump's voter fraud lies encouraged a riot. GOP allies are still giving them oxygen.  Republicans, including Sen. Josh Hawley, have condemned violence but haven't backed down from baseless claims of fraud and irregularities.  After a mob stormed the Capitol based on President Donald Trump's election fraud lie, some top Republican allies have called for peace while still leveling the same baseless claims of widespread voter fraud that fanned the flames of violence.  In almost the same breath as he condemned the rioters who temporarily disrupted Congress' normal process of affirming President-elect Joe Biden's win, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, the first Republican to announce his intention to object to the certification, suggested that Biden's victory was illegitimate.  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-s-voter-fraud-lies-encouraged-riot-gop-allies-are-n1253509  https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article248246980.html  https://www.npr.org/2021/01/03/953052950/republican-lawmakers-divided-on-election-certification  https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-senators-reverse-objections-electoral-college-certification-protesters/story?id=75099780",4년 전,0,
@derekflegg2510,"California Republican Party says it will not comply with state's cease and desist order on ballot drop boxes  The California Republican Party has admitted responsibility for placing more than 50 deceptively labeled “official” drop boxes for mail-in ballots in Los Angeles, Fresno and Orange Counties — an action that state officials said was illegal and could lead to election fraud.  The dark gray metal boxes have been popping up over the past two weeks near churches, gun shops and Republican Party offices, mostly in conservative areas of a deep-blue state, affixed with a white paper label identifying them as either an “Official Ballot Drop off Box” or a “Ballot Drop Box.”  Having personal integrity is a fundamental prerequisite for ethical action and for individuals in an institution to sustain a common purpose.

I don’t agree with the looting- it always happens when there are major protests, there’s always opportunists. But that shouldn’t detract from the fact that people in the Insurrection did the same thing. Also, what better alternatives are there? COVID is mutating, businesses that needed the money to stay afloat in the beginning were rejected, Republicans proposed a smaller relief bill the first time around then what the Democrats proposed and the smaller bill passed in the house and congress, and now because of the mismanagement from a Republican lead Capital, we are suffering a recession and more economic hardship than any first world country right now. Plus the states with the highest COVID cases are all Republican led.  You can say the Dems were the ones that caused all of the problems we have right now, and there is a discussion for it, but saying it was all of the Dems fault is way over simplifying the situation.

In Canada we don't have these divisive issues in politics as their are 4 National Parties and not all Conservatives and Republican types are lumped into a single party just like Liberals, Democrats and Enviromentalists aren't lumped into one party either.....it makes it so politics aren't taken so seriously that you hate people who voted for the opposite party or even dislike them or create this urban versus rural and Religious versus non-Religious divides.

@Uncommonlycommoncommoner,"My god, you all talk like you where there when the planning of our government was taking place and even had an active roll……you “educated” people are actually “Ignorant windbags”  Originally the federal government laid out the rules for the presidential election and how it would take place but left who would vote and how they voted voting would take place up to each individual state. Most states made it so that you had to actually own a set amount of land in order to vote. This amount of land varied greatly. Interesting fact is that this was the only real speculation as to who could vote you had to be a man who owned land. This means that they were African-Americans who owned land who could vote before a poor white person that did not own any land in some states. Voting did not become federally regulated until the voter protection act in the 60s. Read a fucking book",3년 전,0,
@clintonweir7609,"I tend to agree, that voting should be a right. The question is, what about edge cases?  Should ex-convicts (people who have served prison time) still have the right to vote? Yes, I think so.  Should convicts (people who are currently serving time in prison) still have the right to vote? Yes, I think so, but I'm less certain.  In the event that someone gets caught committing a crime related to voting, suppose the person knowingly and intentionally voted at a wrong precinct, or voted multiple times, or impersonated someone to cast extra votes, etc? It would seem very reasonable to ban that person from voting, but then it starts to wobble toward being a privilege again.  And that's before we get into the question of ""a right for whom?"" Adult citizens of the states, absolutely, and, for me, even adult citizens of the territories should have the right to vote. (I'm going to set aside the question of what an ""adult"" is).  But what about permanent residents? If they have made America their home, shouldn't they have a say? I say yes, but the thing is, at least IMHO, that's a really hard question that could quite reasonably go the other way. And if we can decide whether to allow permanent residents to vote, it once again starts to feel more like a privilege we can give or take rather than a god-given right.  So, yeah, calling something a right is thorny.",3년 전,0,

The USA is an example of a country that is both a republic and a democracy because we elect our officials (democratic) and they can also exercise political power using that position rather independently of us (republic).

This uses a few sparks of DC current to rotate one large pulley of 33 cm circumference = (about 10 cm in diameter) one single time. By rotating 1 to 3 mini-pulleys, of one-centimeter circumference, = 33 rotations each. If you attach AC generators to each of these mini-pulleys, then you can get a return of 33 to 99 cycles of AC electricity as an output. Which is far more AC electricity output than you will need to return the few sparks of DC input  -  These few sparks of DC are all that is used to start this mechanism running Once all the AC generators + your one DC motor are connected together with a belt You would only need to rotate the large drive pulley a slight ¼ turn And then all the rotations of mini-pulleys would be enough to start your DC drive motor After running your AC electricity through a full-wave bridge rectifier  -  These AC generators run freely, taking practically zero torque. This is because they are just running up massive voltage + need practically no current. The voltage needed to turn over your large pulley the one time + all of these rotations by your many mini-pulleys need only produce the few sparks of current, (what's needed for the one rotation of a DC motor)  -  Knowing that drag or resistance is caused by power = watts = voltage times current This works out great, as you only need high voltage = pressure + practically no current to turn over your DC drive motor the once = a few sparks  -  This is so simple that it is obviously being hidden by evil forces Forces that don’t want us to realize how super simplistic this technology truly is You only have to put one spark of DC electricity into a DC motor With a 33 cm circumference pulley attached to it, Giving you 33 cm of moving belt, strap, rope or even a piece of string Which you very quickly run by one to ten mini-pulleys with AC generators attached. Giving you 33 to 330 cycles of AC electricity = mostly voltage. But guess what you need to drive this large pulley over the one rotation, yes it is voltage or pressure that you need to turn this big pulley over the single turn So now you have a pair of self-powering AC + DC generators.  -  Any man or woman could start experimenting with this tech, by creating their own self-powered tools, devices + appliances. Or producing their own self powering 120-volt power supplies by simply hitching up two 120-volt motors to a large pulley + a mini-pulley=(multiplication factor) to start contributing to the power network, instead of just taking from it  -  This works by using the single rotation of a DC drive motor, (which only uses one spark of DC electricity) which is attached to, and driving a large pulley, (100cm circumference) for one full rotation. A belt/strap/rope or even a length of string in a pinch is used to run around this large drive pulley, and then run by or through one to ten mini-pulleys, with AC motors/generators attached. These one-centimeter circumference mini-pulleys rotate massive amounts of times, =100 times, giving you far more than enough AC voltage, (when you run it through a full-wave bridge rectifier), to give you the one single spark of DC electricity. These mini-pulleys attached to AC motors/generators, run practically free of any torque, as they are just being used to wind up a massive amount of voltage. This massive voltage only needs one spark of current, so they give practically no torque resistance.  -  The only reason that this super simple technology has not been used earlier to create free energy for us, are the millions, if not billions of fallen angels + evil spirits, trying desperately to make sure, that mankind never discovers this super simple technology, which is God’s Gift to mankind, which He laid out for us way back in Ezekiel 1:16 http://free-energy.yolasite.com/ Please don't listen to the evil forces telling you that torque is a problem, as free-running AC electric motors take practically no torque to turn. These are free running AC motors/generators because they are just being used to wind up massive voltages, and need to produce only one single spark of current. -  Please remember, you could add as many mini pulleys as you want Because AC motors are the easiest to rotate X 10 Multiplying your electricity by massive amounts 1000 X Think of how easily mini motors turn It takes practically no effort that is why you could add so many of them (10-100) easily gaining free energy to any amount imagined  -  This is not only free energy from God =(Eze 1:16) DIAGRAM + DESCRIPTION @ http://free-energy.yolasite.com/  Not only can we know free energy as Truth, but it is also good news twice 1) This will take away massive sums of money given to nations growing terrorists + This is info from The Big Guy Himself, so 2) This was found as a description of the workings of a UFO, so we should be able to discover how it gains antigravity, or be able to figure whatever helps these UFO’S levitate + travel so fast  -  (EZE 1:16) “The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.” - As in, a little wheel inside a big wheel, but I could not afford to buy a big wheel with threading on the inside, and a mini wheel with the same threading on its outside. So I did the next best thing, I connected a big wheel to a mini wheel through a belt, strap, rope, or even a piece of string in a pinch to connect the two pulleys with motors attached.  -  I would have built one of these super simple contraptions, but I happened to be disabled + unable to work with my hands, and living on CPP disability, I do not have sufficient funds to hire anyone to build this, so I cannot build this dirt-simple contraption. I was hoping that I could explain how super simple this is, and someone else could build this contraption for me + the rest of mankind. I even have a close brother that could easily build this, but he is an electronic technologist and has fallen for the evil lies about torque being a problem. Satan has him so set in his ways, that I cannot even mention it to him, else he would stop talking to me completely.

This was pre-Covid-19 and the hell that followed on from it due entirely to Trump’s personal denial and refusal to accept any information that didn’t gel with his personal preconceptions, regardless of who was trying to get through to him or the daily statistics piling up on all media.  He simply dug in and continued to spout nonsense, which his devout followers swallowed and parroted back to each other until it became and has continued to become an alternate reality, right up until the elections and after. And the Republican party continues to endorse the bullshit, because no Republican candidate has ever polled as high as Trump: even in defeat, he has won. He has set the bar going forward into 2024 and 2028. Whoever is put forward as a Republican candidate in coming presidential elections will have no choice but to build on the same appeals that got Trump elected, simply because Trump’s current voter base will be expecting nothing less. Once the world’s ills were released from Pandora’s box, there was no putting them back in and so it is with Trump’s followers.

@jordaneggerman4734," @highlightreel8134  ....""got us out of Iraq"".... yeah, then promptly got us back in Iraq, as well as Syria, Yemen, and Libya.

The government, instead, should have bought GM and BoA out of the rubble, rebuilt them, and turned them back over to the public. What happened with the bailouts taught those companies nothing, and will seemingly be more detrimental in the long run, as they can now do an even greater harm to our economy. Businesses fail all the time, and giving hundreds of billions in taxpayer money, in essentially blank checks, shows blatant favoritism to the ultra wealthy corporate heads.  Also, Obama ended No Child Left Behind, which was leaving children behind at a staggering rate. It was that easy to improve education quality.

@realzachfluke1," @Bladeofwar94  boy did you have the right take on Biden. We haven't even passed freaking VOTING RIGHTS at this point, over a year after the 2020 election. And because of Biden's unwillingness to play hardball and do actual, y'know, politics to get the Democratic votes we need in the Senate to do voting rights, the Build Back Better reconciliation bill (which Bernie saw as literally the crowning achievement of his entire career—anddd I just started crying) that he's allowing Manchin and Sinema to kill, I am left with no faith that we will get anything else out of this presidency other than the f#%king CONSTANTLY INCREASING PENTAGON BUDGET that Congress is addicted to throwing more and more money into.  I am sick to my stomach thinking about how badly this one last two year period with Democrats miraculously in control is being squandered. Republicans are WILDLY unpopular, and they have less than nothing positive to run on, or give to the American people, but since this was the gerrymandering year for the next decade, and since Republicans are being allowed to kill voting rights in every state they control with no response from the federal government, I guess our plan is to just HAND THE KEYS OF POWER RIGHT BACK OVER to the fascists that are unquestionably going to finish off what's left of this bleeding and suffocating democracy.

@m15t3r_n8," @beth3531  Better to be a useful idiot than just an idiot...  Also, your flippant usage of the phrase indicates to me that you do not fully comprehend the term, or you've shown your age... The term is a holdover from the 'Red Scare' era of American politics used as an insult to anyone who was deemed 'Not Anti-Communist enough' by the user.  It has been falsely attributed to Lenin; However, it never appears in any of his writings, or transcriptions of his speeches, or any correspondence he ever sent that has been historically documented.  In fact, the phrase appears to be a wholly American Conservative propaganda creation.  Meant to gin up more anti-Soviet fervor from the public, to justify the rampant increases in defense spending for rapid Nuclear Arms proliferation, not that that was entirely unjustified at the time, but I digress. It was also used to push towards a conservative hegemony in the American political system, and the alterations to the balance of power of the 3 branches of Gov't from Nixon onward as purveyors of the 'Unitary Executive Theory' enshrined themselves near the seats of power on every level of Gov't.  There is nothing wrong with being critical of those who wield political power, it is better that there are people like him to combat abuses and malpractices from those who make decisions that dramatically impact other people's lives and livelihoods. In countries that enshrine the Freedom of Speech it is perfectly acceptable and beneficial to engage in such discourse.   To blindly follow what ""The Leader"" says without question or second thought is how you end up in situations like: Stalinist Russia to the present day with the exception of 8 years in the 90's before Putin reinforced the propaganda machine to close the 'Iron Curtain' once again,  Germany under |-|itler,  Italy under Mussolini,  North Korea under the Kim family,  Chinese 1 party democracy (gotta be careful about the auto-delete algorithm there),  Turkmenistan under Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow,  Iraq under Saddam Hussein,  Lebanon under Muammar Gaddafi,  Israel under Benjamin Netanyahu,  Afghanistan under the Tal1ban.... the list can go on, and on, and on.  Only someone who has been fully indoctrinated is unwilling to consider the opposing viewpoint based on the merits presented... and indoctrination breeds idiocy.  Much like what we see from the current conservative movement in America... Great idea time: Let's pass laws that say Transgender athletes have to play with their biological sex; you know because the testosterone therapy a trans boy (bio-female) could be receiving isn't going to give them an edge over the other girls at all, way to protect girls sports there, bravo pat yourselves on the back for thinking that through...   Hey, let's ban all these books because we do not like the uncomfortable truths about history, and we're actually trying to reignite some of the worst aspects of it so it is better that people don't know what happened, or how, so they can't stop us...  BTW's There are mass shootings almost daily, alot of them in schools; should we maybe think about putting in criminal background checks, and/or limit the type and amount of guns a person can have, and/or mandate mental health screenings, and/or institute ""Firearm Control Liscences"" and/or Federal Gun Registry: right, just so we know people can handle their firearms safely and proficiently and also what firearms they own, and we can arrest and jail anyone found with an Unlicensed Firearm/no FAC card, and legally confiscate any guns from a person showing signs of dangerous mental disturbance: could that maybe prevent some of these from happening like it does in every other developed nation on Planet earth?

Around 200 or so miles of 'the wall' have been currently been built, mostly by a right wing political 'charity' group that Drumpf has since openly opposed/disavowed himself from, simply because it failed to build a wall that managed to stand up to the simple forces of nature (something that most competent engineers would account for), all while gathering donations from Drumpf supporters.  Vote for your nominee, but don't blame the other side when Drumpf (most likely) loses massively because of 20,000+ lies in the last 4 years AND don't blame the other side when Drumpf (more less than likely) makes your country even more of a worldwide laughing stock than it already is, because it's more likely a result of a lack of people willing to vote against Drumpf than it is a result of people willing to vote for him....",5년 전,1,

@joemagnets9940,"Look, Ya can't blame the INSANE for what they do, although they too are not above the law, but, they have different results that provide for the INSANE being separated from society as being too dangerous to be allowed to be free to continue to put people's lives in danger, due to the INSANITY of those that have proven to be INSANE.  One example of this insanity is using 'god' as their excuse for the 'sacrifice' of the non-believers for the 'reasons' that the 'god' they invented has stated in their 'holy books' that the insane claim is 'the WORD OF 'god'.  Now don't try to make sense of these dangerous people because THEY ARE INSANE.  The history of those INSANE people proves how dangerous they are.  All their 'explanations' are their reasons that if applied to THEM, would surely make them complain that the world HATES them for just following the laws that THE 'god' THEY INVENTED gave to THEM, but because THEIR 'god' CHOSE ONLY THEM, THEY ARE TO BE ABOVE THE LAW OF MAN.  Need proof?  Just type in the 'search box' that is at the top of this page, THE TALMUD, and chose from the many videos that PROVE that they are INSANE because the talmud is the WRITTEN EXCUSE for the INSANITY of those that are ready to commit CRIMES, but because they were 'chosen' by their 'god', are immune from the laws of common sense.   JUST REALIZE THIS...using 'common sense' when trying to explain THEIR REASONS for their INSANITY, will never make 'sense' because, in the mind of the INSANE, YOU are the one that is INSANE and must be sacrificed with death, as explained in 'the talmud, kaballah and ANY OTHER 'reason' where those that are 'religiously' INSANE use THEIR ""god"" as THEIR EXCUSE that makes members of that CULT immune from the laws of COMMON SENSE.  What is the 'COMMON SENSE' law that the INSANE VIOLATE?  DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU because the SANE will HAVE to DESTROY the INSANE in order to save SANE PEOPLE becoming the VICTIMS of the INSANE and those they corrupt, 'our politicians' that now allow the INSANE to BE OUR KINGS, instead of the American people being protected by the USA Constitution, that if OBEYED, prevents the INSANE from ruling the American people as the slaves and servants of the INSANE PEOPLE that invented the INSANE CLOWN that the cults and their newest JACKASS dONALD dUCK calls 'god'.  So now that you know that there is NO CURE for INSANITY, OBEY THE USA CONSTITUTION and VOTE for those that the continue keeps America the colony of the zion state in the MIDDLE EAST, but instead of using worthless paper ballots, USE THE LEAD BALLOTS that the USA Constitution DEMANDS the sane USE in order to eliminate the INSANE that keep America the colony of ZION STATE in the MIDDLE EAST.

@ish4638,"Trump doesn't believe in climate change. He lifted the ban on drilling oil and gas in the arctic ocean which is unlawful. He rolled back hunting protection for hibernating bears, and the methane pollution rule. He said ""laziness is a trait in blacks"". Idk if you remember ""grab them by the p*ssy"". He retweeted a video of a man shouting ""white power"". He fired a pandemic response team... during a pandemic. Opposes the act of equality which helps stop legal discrimination of LGBT+ people in the USA. He also made it legal for doctors to deny LGBT+ people certain healthcare procedures on a religious basis. He had a rally in the middle of a pandemic and didn't even mandate masks or face coverings. He called white supremacists ""very good people"" He has nearly 45 r*pe allegations, 13 from minors, plus he refuses to give DNA to prove his innocence. Keeps pushing drill on Native American reservations. He doesn't support black lives matter, instead supporting blue lives matter. One tweet included him advocating for increase in the cost of living in the suburbs and pushing low income housing put of the suburbs. Told his fanbase that ""coronavirus is a democratic new hoax"". Encouraged people to inject disinfectant into their blood in order to prevent the virus. Took an untested and later proven dangerous drug, again saying it would prevent coronavirus. To black people: ""you're living in poverty, you're schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed - what do you have to lose?"" Trying to eliminate the NEPA protection to speed up large infrastructure products like highways (bad for the environment). 3000 children and counting have been ""lost"" by ICE, under Trump's rule and support. Took a whole page to call for the death penalty of 5 children of colour who were innocent, and is yet to apologise. Told 3 coloured congresswomen to go back to their country. Said that he would date Ivanka if she wasn't his daughter. Said, about Mexican immigrants, ""They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're r*pists. And some, I assume, are good people."" Spoke in defense of the officer who killed George Floyd. Did nothing to support those affected by the Orlando nightclub shooting. Has said, on multiple occasions, that he doesn't support same-sex marriage. Said ""you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighbourhood"".  His war on Iraq killed two million Iraqi soldiers. The USA is now number 1 in COVID-19 cases and deaths, under Trump's rule.      But yeah, Biden has dementia.",5년 전,1,

@Chunkboi," @rajyavardhansingh4491  Okay, since you clearly do not know what you are talking about, I will provide correct information.  Joe Biden does not demonstrate any of the clinical signs of dementia, despite what the trolls at Fox News, OANN, NewsMax, Breitbart, and Facebook may say.  Speech impediments can and often do occur independent of organic dementia conditions.  The medical term for speech impediment depends on whether the cause is purely neuromuscular (dysarthria) or neurological/cognitive (dysphasia).  Biden has a treated speech impediment.  Trump, on the other hand, has demonstrated signs indicative of either dementia or psychiatric disorder, including confabulation (where the brain automatically ""fills in the blanks"" on missing memories), a lack of self awareness, a lack of empathy, grandiose delusions, and narcissism. I can offer differential diagnoses for neurological, psychological, or cognito-behavioral conditions, but without an actual examination, I would be on thin ice to specify which one Trump has...however, he has at least one of them.  I will not pretend that Biden is a saint, nor will I pretend that he may be able to keep all of his promises (largely because we've seen fascist elements in the Senate GOP who are insistent on hamstringing anything that might be beneficial to the USA...including McConnell and Graham), but I will not ignore the facts as proven by verified evidence.",4년 전,2,

Trump has not addressed this. 2) Bankers are monopolizing corporations, technology and real estate primarily due to endogenous money.  Trump has not addressed this. 3) Trump hired Steve Mnuchin, banks use people’s promissory note and convert it to money.  In a foreclosure the banks get a free house. Steve Mnuchin is known as the foreclosure king. 4) Trump has not done anything to stop surveillance on the public by the NSA (PRISM). 5) Continuity of war per 2002 memo of 7 countries in 5 years agenda.  Trump has dropped more bombs, implemented economic sanctions on countries that have  done nothing to the people of the united states. 6) 9/11 was never properly investigated.  The official findings do not match science as per reason engineering study about WTC7. Three thousand people murdered, countless wars and nothing to determine what really happened.  Trump has not addressed this. 7)  Trump has not released all documents in the JFK assassination, and in the USS Liberty. 8) Trump wants Journalist’s Julian Assange ‘head on a pike’. 9) Trump has not addressed the effect of endogenous money on the national debt, although the national debt is now 25 trillion. 10) Trump was bailed out by the banks. 11) The extreme racist genocidal government of Israel was initiated and backed by the same bankers who are creating most of the money we use.  Trump support this government in Israel. References 1)  Most of the money in our economy is created by banks, in the form of bank deposits – the numbers that appear in your account.

@gilfavor1river,"LastWeekTionight you are the fool that needs to get off the morning media the afternoon media the nighttime media the bullshit media , because you are wrong!!!  I'm reading through a lot of this drivel and it appears that it is full of no explaining, just lefty insult , and John Oliver, who is appearing to look more like a twit.  Every time I kick him someone throws a brick at me, and I come back on to answer, but I won't answer anymore just this one I'll answer.  All the Trump haters when you make comments about him, why not give some real reasons why, I 'd like one of you who ""hate the wall"" types to actually explain why a wall should not be built.  Aren't you and your country men being overwhelmed with illegal immigrants from numerous places in South America. Aren't some who get in, bringing in porno, and drugs and criminal intent, aren't some so desperate that they die trying to cross a river and they die with their dead children in their arms.  Isn't it better to have a controlled entrance where you know who your getting and what they bring to your country. What if some help the richie rich in those states over the border in USA  being illegally employed,  maybe even Democrat southerners, at what type of wages do you reckon they pay hey cheap labor??  Is that why they want a gate left wide open.You really are a pack of self centred drongos.  So Trump gets info about COVID19 late and many people die, well I 'll tell you one day late is enough and if you are not prepared and some Democrat states, one of those was where George Floyd was murdered . Some of those states slammed together 40 % nationwide of their old and frail and ill and those un looked after properly, people.  It sent COVID19 ON A RAMPAGE, YET YOU DILLS BLAME TRUMP.  WHAT SORT OF FOOLS ARE YOU?  YOU WHO HAVE LOTS OF ABUSE AND NO REASON, JUST THIS PATHOLOGICAL HATRED OF YOUR PRESIDENT .  As for him being blamed for everything, including probably you putting money on a useless race horse and losing hah , blaming him for this insidious virus outbreak is as nonsensical as your bets.  Only blind and un thinking individuals rave aloud with no reasoning, you just make crappy statements knocking the bloke, even before he was President.  But this is fascist behavior !! No you don't have to be a right wing wanker, to be a fascist!  The left are full on screaming at opposites, and you can't argue or you become a target and called names?? Yeah we know hey?  .Again in my home town in Australia where I was born and brought up, they have another 2nd wave of corona, and they are closing the city off again, the government is an ALP left wing pack of fools , who had the hardest COVID19 restrictions in the country, THEY ARE THE ONLY STATE  IN AUSTRALIA THAT HAS HAD A 2ND WAVE SO BAD. 175 people were detected with COVID 19 YESTERDAY!They were about torelieve some restrictions, they also allowed , ""listen to this one America"" Black Lives Matter , with something like 10 to 15 thousand people allowed to protest in the open, NO WORRIES WE'VE ONLY GOT A INTERNATIONAL PANDEMIC , what kind of effing idiocy is that!  IT STARTED OUT  WITH ABOUT 6 CASES.   SINCE 5 DAYS IT IS NOW REACHING THE HUNDREDS, SO IF YOU BLAME TRUMP  FOR BEING LATE OR INCOMPETENT , THAT IS ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT,  This Aussie city is the best  example of over kill and underkill ever seen!  THIS VIRUS DOES WHAT IT LIKES, AND TO HEAR THE LIKES OF THAT POMMIE SHITKICKER  OLIVER , blurting and babbling, thinking he's funny, well he is just a fool.  He goes to America  takes HIS ENGLISH COMEDY??? SO CALLED, BRILLIANCE WITH HIM , HAH HAH ,   WELL THE BRITS HAVE THE BEST, CLEVEREST, FUNNIEST COMEDIANS ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.   THIS DILL IS NOT ONE OF THEM !  He's learnt the foul sarcastic put-down style of ""comedy"" you Americans think is so funny, it is not!   Oliver should be ashamed of himself and you dead set ignorant commentators on YouTube need your heads read!  You have got it all arse about, YOU BLAME THE WRONG PERSON THE WRONG POLITICS AND YOU BLABBER , MOST OF YOU ON youTube.  Yet you insult without an argument to put forward. You know who I mean , the ratbags that do one liners!  Those with some sense on here , I leave you out of my comment.  You also know who you are, but the dickheads , well they are not worth speaking about anymore. Unless one comes up with some detailed actualities, that prove their point. Kicking the shit out of the most maligned President ever for no reason is proof that the fools are always wrong, and they are needed to be re-educated, ha ha ha! Now piss off.",5년 전,0,

@joemagnets9940,"""THE REVOLUTION"" has already happened, and you don't even KNOW IT.  The 'right', 'center', 'left', the 'up', the 'down', the 'in', the 'out', ALL BELONG TO THE ZIONISTS and 'our' zionist corrupted 'politicians', loyal only to their bank accounts and the zionsts that keep America the colony of the zionist JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL.  What America NEEDS is a counter REVOLUTION that WE the American people will VOTE FOR, but not with worthless paper ballots, but with REAL LEAD BALLOTS that even the AIPAC lobby cannot CORRUPT.  Just look at the current crop of CRAP that is now running for the Presidency of America...dONALD dUCK the current JACKASS of the zionists that promised to DRAIN THE SWAMP, has instead BECAME THE SWAMP, surrounding himself with the yarmulke wearing PARASITES that will tell you right to your face...THEY ARE ""GOD"" CHOSEN PEOPLE and will ALWAYS BE LOYAL to that LAND that OUR ""GOD"" Gave ONLY TO 'god's' chosen people, even though is from the Khazar region of the Near EAST and NEVER LIVED in the Middle East, but because they call themselves 'god's' chosen people, they have a RIGHT to kill people that never lived anywhere else but IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  That THEY have a RIGHT to corrupt 'our' politicians' that will sell their souls to SATAN as long as the price was correct.  dONALD dUCK the TRAITOR that gives other peoples LAND that he don't own, to the Israelis.  Through corruption and deception the people that 'god' chose, remain the KINGS OF America, not doing what is best for America, but doing what is best for THEIR ""GOD"" (SATAN) and THEMSELVES.  Then ya got THE TRAITOR, jOE bIDEN, that too will tell you right to your face that he's A ZIONIST and ya don't have to be, 'god's chosen, and I add, TO BE INSANE, and bURNIE sANDERS, a 'modified communist' that wants to promise everyone everything for NOTHING, forgetting to mention that the ONLY FREE LUNCH IS IN A TRAP, and that the middle-class tax-paying Americans will be paying for everything bURNIE want's to 'give away for 'FREE'.   Ya think these INSANE 'religious' wars are for FREE?  Who owns the 'fed banking system'?  If I told you, those at YouTUBE will call this comment, 'HATE SPEECH' and delete it, as they already do to anyone that has told the TRUTH about the INSANE that invented the insane clown that chose ONLY THEM, gave land ONLY TO THEM, has a 'covenant' ONLY WITH THEM, but has corrupted 'our' gov't to send OUR SOLDiers to KILL and DIE, waste OUR TAX dollars, while THEY, 'god's' chosen PAY NOTHING WITH THEIR LIVES or THEIR MONEY.  ASK YOURSELVES, WHO ARE REALLY THE INSANE??? Stop being not only insane but stupid too.  Obey the USA Constitution and VOTE with your LEAD BALLOTS, for those we, the American people cannot get RID OF ANY OTHER WAY.  You may vote as many times as lead ballots you have.  VOTE NOW and VOTE OFTEN, it's the ONLY answer to a gov't that has become so DANGEROUS to the American people and the rest of the world, the 'american zionist colony of the JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL, once known as America.

@michaelreborn9656,"I believe that another factor in why it is so difficult for Trumpies to accept reality when it is reported by the media is how much time was spent laying the groundwork for getting the most gullible conservatives to begin mistrusting the media by hacks like InfoWars that spent some years before Trump came into office talking about how the evil overlords control the media and who gets elected etc, and InfoWars was the resistance to all of that, going to fight back vehemently against the corruption going on.   So you can understand my confusion when Trump became president that suddenly Alex Jones is praising Donald Trump as a savior and all when given everything I've just said, how could Trump have been elected if he wasn't part of that same corrupt system?  I believe that InfoWars basically baited and switched their audience into worshipping Trump as their champion of what they still believe is a resistance to the corruption that I mentioned before so they are going to believe what he says no matter what.  They think he is not part of the establishment, that he somehow got one over on the evil overlords and has God-given powers to say and do whatever he wants and they love it.  I think that's why they call him the chosen one.  They think he is the sword to vanquish the evil forces that they believe rule the earth.  So yea, there you go.  Fucking insane shit.

@Enyavar1," @gilfavor1river  Given that Stalin died in 1953, there is little chance of him running - also, he was born in Georgia not in America. Also quite obviously, inanimate objects or animals can't do harmful policies - so a raccoon would be less harmful than Trump if he was president. Humans, naturally, may actually plot nefarious policies in office, as we have seen with the Trump administration. So you shouldn't allow corrupt or fanatical people in office, even after an election. How the entire American people still chooses to accept Trump as their president is beyond me. Nixon had to resign for something that is just another thursday for Trump.",5년 전,1,
@gilfavor1river," @Enyavar1  OK now 's your chance ? Without just vague reports of Trump being brash or committing some misdemeanor or not being part of the political elite and some raving monster totally different to the things Stalin committed against his own people,  (my reference to STALIN I THINK WAS, WHO'D YOU RATHER HAVE I can't remember ) ,  but that you dislike Trump ... what are the actual things he has done as President that make you feel like you do about him,? You see the vitriol flung at this man                 ""is beyond me????""   Nixon raided his opponents , by allowing and knowing about a break and enter, and that's another story?  You equate Trump to Nixon , really in what way? I mean really , are you going to delve into more innuendo about his behaviour as a business man? Or the lies about Russians, better look at Mr Biden,?  What Trump does, IS NOT USE POLLIE SPEAK!   YOU KNOW THE WRITINGS OF SOME SPEECH WRITER THAT APPEARS TO BE THE THING FOR POLITICIANS NOW, ( if your an Australian you'd remember puppet Bill Shorten) , he was switched on like a speaking  machine ,  looked rehearsed and dull. oh and ingenuine!)  TRUMP SPEAKS OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD AND HEART AND SAYS WHAT HE THINKS HE IS AS STRAIGHT AS THE PERSON ON THE STREET, UNLIKE SOME WHO OPPOSE HIM.  Yes, so I too, do feel that also ""it is beyond me""  why this man is hated, but I suspect it is a brain washed propagandised public,  who are influenced by the media who like the Democrats have never left him alone, it has been treacherous from some in that country, it baffles me? Now please , as President , what has he done that makes it so hard for you to like him, or not understand why the quiet voter picks him, hopefully anyway.  So lets here it. Also can you give any things he's done that has been good for the people of the USA, i WONDER IF YOU CAN?",5년 전,0,
@Enyavar1," @gilfavor1river  First of all, it's hard to make sense of anything you write there. Similar to how you think that ""incoherent rambling"" is superior to ""elegant rhetorics"" and ""bland porridge"" beats ""five star menu"". Would you trust ""anyone straight from the street"" to take care of your credit card? No, probably not. But you - if you are an American - trusted an entire nation to some guy based on ""talking like anyone straight from the street"". Has he done any good for the people? Any people? Nope. The Trump has only ever worked for the good of himself. He has proven incapable of believing in win-win situations where nobody loses. And the American people, who were once respected all over the world, have entrusted this man with all their credit cards accounts, and trusted him to manage their funds. Really, they handed all their power to a fraudster, can you believe that.  The Trump has not immediately emptied all these bank accounts, I will say that. He was working a con, trusted not to be elected, and thus had no plan when he came into office. But he has a gang of shady businessmen and crooked politicians who got on the train and soon they all had a plan: enriching themselves beyond any previous standard of ""corrupt politician"". He hires and fires people, turned politics into a reality TV show, to the point that by now, the entire world is glued to the TV screen, fearing what the madman will do next, and if it will affect their lifes in a bad way.  He gets high TV ratings, but that's not because everyone loves him. He gets insulted? Vitriol is flung? He is hated? Yes, all that and more, because there is a FUCKING reason for that, as Mr. Oliver would put it. People died by hundred thousands when he could prevent it. Children were kept in cages because he liked the shock images. He befriended dictators and insulted close allies. Frankly, he belongs in prison for his crimes against mankind and the world is a poorer place as we all know this is unlikely to ever happen.  The man sitting in the White House is not an innocent baby that just came into the world and needs you to protect it, and ""silently vote"" for it. You claim he is cute adorable E.T., not doing any harm, when he has been Predator for four years.  Now why would you vote for Biden, you ask? Maybe because he is not Predator. Granted, he is also not cute E.T., he is just an old moderate politician without any glamour or overblown scandals. He might not even change the country for the better, I doubt he can. But he will do much less harm.",5년 전,1,
@gilfavor1river," @Enyavar1  No , no mate, your too angry, and you didn't read what I said, because if you would have, you would have understood my way of putting things.  But then you do as most who have no idea of looking on both sides of the fence , you get to insulting people.  Where did you get the adorabable E.T. comment from?   Or ""Straight from the street"" its a term used to suggest that he understands the average people you know out there human being land, not in the swamp, and a lot better than Clinton did hey?  ""Turned politics into a reality show"", well there 's an original comment?   Do you actually think he campaigned badly?  I think he knew exactly what he was doing.  Biden, well . I have no idea whether he is good bad or just dropped in for the run. Which he loves doing when heading for a microphone.  What is he going to do,  do you think? Haven't really heard?  He has questions about his son that haven't been answered. So overblown scandals? We'll see.?  But what about Trump everything he does or even doesn't do, his enemies scandalise him. Fearing what the madman will do next?? Are you joking? What are you expecting from this madman   Tell me what you think Biden will actually do?   I see things differentlly I'm Australian I just take an interest in US politics. But all I've seen Trump do before he got blamed by the left , for every COVID 19 case that ever happened there, he confronted China, over lots of things , you know.  He lifted the economy, he cut unemployment he is allied with those dictators, just like all those former presidents who'd already allied with them.  HE CREATED A PATHWAY TO PERHAPS, MAKE THINGS EASIER, WITH A NEW NUCLEAR POWER! NORTH KOREA?  You prefer he nuked them instead?? He is not a war maker, he's a deal maker.  He asked some NATO countries to do a bit more can carrying, financially a bit more, he is withdrawing troops not loading up again. if that's what you mean by insulting allies and befriending dictators? Now mate, your comment ""died by hundreds of thousands"" about children in cages is that a general comment for past things or is it an accusation of mass murder?  People hate him, you say.  Well yes, I see that!!!   I have always asked why? Is it his brashness, his tough style or is it his haircut or because he is abrasive. What the hell did you expect? These people are all hard cases, they all have some steel inside them , they have to!  I see this bloke as someone who is not that attractive in manner, and how he goes about his job which he does well. But I certainly don't see why the hysterics of hatred over this bloke which has been driven by Democrats, left styled people, the media, in fact I am really surprised at the shallowness of people who hate him and actually maybe know nothing about him at all, it's like a schoolyard fight, childish. And it is wrong and bloody stupid. I think that 'll be enough now. Take it easy.",5년 전,0,
@Enyavar1," @gilfavor1river  you're awfully relaxed about people literally destroying the  world we live in. Trump has taken the US out of the Paris climate accords, remember that? He ""loves coal and oil"" he says, to please his billionaire friends in those industries.  He also has no consistent stance on China either. He hates Chinese and their influence, loves the Chinese government for doing a good job, and is neutral on trading with them because deal is deal. Except that tomorrow he blocks trade, hates their government and says the Chinese aren't bad people. He does that with such a simpled-down language that all nuance (if it was ever there) gets lost. And of course there should be nuance in politics.",5년 전,1,
@gilfavor1river," @Enyavar1  Well whether he hates Chinese is something you wouldn't know, nor I either  Do you know if Xi Jinping hates Americans or Australians for that matter?  . When it comes to climate, I'll say this , I am not a denier of climate change , but not because I belong to a cult or political fanatical scare program for political purpose!  That says we're all going extinct or the world is almost at an end and terrify children by having marches and strikes at school. OVER SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME!   You see climate has changed forever , in the history of the cooling of this planet, ice ages heating and cooling and places that were once jungles are deserts and visa versa,  over millions of years, all that sort of stuff.  And  for millions of years went on, way way before we humans ever burnt coal??  You probably don't agree? No matter.   I don't belong to anything, I made up my own mind about climate panic, but before humans existed the climate changed, hell how hot was the planet to melt 1 mile high ice glaciers, and I believe more than once , but you can argue with the scientists over that one? Including Sir David! By the way all life on earth eventually goes extinct hopefully not for a few million years.   China and the comment that Trump hates them , do you ever ask yourself whether they may hate us here in Australia. Good question. THEY BEHAVED PRETTY BADLY TOWARDS US LATELY FOR NO REAL GOOD REASON? Anyway I hope I'm relaxed, I never feel relaxed reading Quora sometimes , I may have to go back to reading history theories.  But Trumps OK so is Xi Jinping maybe??? Can you say?",5년 전,0,

On Jan. 31 The Trump administration declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency, while simultaneously setting the first quarantine order issued by the federal government in more than 50 years. How can this be anywhere near not taking the virus seriously? You stated that ""When people asked Trump to give an opinion of COVID-19, he said “it’s all a hoax.” I'd like to see a link or bare minimum a headline and date so I can find it for myself as it goes completely against his actions and against the 1h 11 minute rally that I watched. But this will not happen because it's an outright lie or just ignorance of how lexicon works, but that's not my fault. Furthermore to even claim that ""Trump also falsely claimed that we have 3.6 billion tests per day."" is moronic in nature as that would be a population larger than China plus the ENTIRE continent of Africa. Also the word HOAX means to deceive. If Democrats and their Main Stream Media stooges said that Trump's travel bans and border closings were racist, and then turn around and said that he didn't act as a ""racist"" fast enough tells anyone with a shred of intelligence that said person is deceptive.  -Feb. 29 Trump holds a campaign rally in Charleston, S.C where the first 12 minutes were about his administrations preparations and response to the coronavirus and how Democrats have been attempting to undermine his administrations efforts by politicizing the coronavirus.  ""Now the democrats are...politicizing...the.....coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus. They're politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs....you say ""How's president Trump doing?"" they go ""Oooh not good, not good"". They have no clue, they don't have any clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa. They can't even count. No they can't. They Can't count Their Votes!!  One of my people came up to me and said ""Mr. President...they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia (hoax)...that didn't work out too well. They couldn't do it. They tried the impeachment hoax""...that was on a perfect conversation. ""They've tried anything...they've tried it over and over, they've been doing it since you got in.""  It's all turning, they lost, it's all turning. Think of it.. think of it...and this is their NEW HOAX. ""But ya know we've done something that's been pretty amazing. We have 15 people (coronavirus cases) in this massive country..... and because of the fact that we went early.... we went early. and we could've had a lot more than that. We're doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified.""  Trump's example: ""A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes..... and the Democrats' single talking point... and you see it... is that... it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right?""",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@rainfl32771,"I love your show and if you can't help me I will still watch it.  I need help paying for my service dog's training. I'm not Trump and I'm not kidding. My ESA (Emotional Support Animal) dog for my PTSD died last Oct 11th. His name was Butters and  Boxer Pitbull mix. Federal Workman's Comp will pay for a new ESA dog (we paid for Butters and his obedience training (2k) but couldn't afford to pay for Service dog training. Butters died at 4 1/2 after we remortgaged the house to pay his vet bills (close to 10k). It might sound silly but I'm 63 and at 42 I was on a business trip for the Federal Govt and as I walked across a street a pickup ran a red light and hit me and screwed up my upper and lower spine and gave me Tramatic Brain Injury and PTSD. I'm lucky to be alive. Getting Butters made me feel safe to be in stores and outside (not right now because of the Covid-19 and cause he died) I'm on a fixed income and can't afford the cost of Service dog training, a step up from ESA. Service Dogs are allowed by law to be with you everywhere but ESA dogs can be denied access to any place that says they won't allow them in. Kind of defeats the purpose of an ESA. I am looking at a potential new dog this week and Federal Workman's Comp will pay for the dog, obedience training, food and vet bills. I feel I should pay for the food and vet bill up to $500.00 because I don't want to be abusing my Federal Workman's Comp benefits but if they won't pay for Service dog training I can't afford to myself. Even if you can't help me if you know of any other way I can get help getting him trained I would appreciate it. Thank you for your time, you, your family and everyone else don't listen to the orange Me Potato Head we have for president and stay healthy and safe. Thanks Ric Armstrong",5년 전,0,

@treverhoughton5043,"3:48 John Oliver: Q1) How did we get a pathological liar in the white house?  Q2) Where are his lies coming from?  Q3) Why do so many people believe him? Q4) What can we possibly do about it? This won't be a short answer but here it goes... For any truth seekers and fact finders, this won't be a problem. S O C I A L N E U R O S C I E N C E Specific neurons and neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine, trigger a defensive state when we feel that our thoughts have to be protected from the influence of others.   If we are then confronted with differences in opinion, the chemicals that are released in the brain are the same ones that try to ensure our survival in dangerous situations.  In this defensive state, the more primitive part of the brain interferes with rational thinking and the limbic system can knock out most of our working memory, physically causing narrowmindedness. 2 We see this in the politics of fear, in the strategy of poker players, or simply when someone is stubborn in a discussion.  No matter how valuable an idea is, the brain has trouble processing it when it is in such a state. 3 On a neural level, it reacts as if we're being threatened, even if this threat comes from harmless opinions or facts that we may otherwise find helpful and could rationally agree with. 4 But when we express ourselves and our views are appreciated, these ""defense chemicals"" decrease in the brain and dopamine neurotransmission activates the reward neurons, making us feel empowered and increasing our self-esteem.  Our beliefs have a profound impact on our body chemistry, this is why placebos are so effective.  pla·ce·bo /pləˈsēbō/ noun  a measure designed merely to calm or please (comfort) someone.     ""it's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled"" ~ Mark Twain   Especially when one knows E=mc2, the neuroscience that controls the system, and the typical behavioral patterns of their fellow human beings.  Measure synonyms: System, Program, Means  NLP stands for Neuro-Linguistic Programming, a name that encompasses the three most influential components involved in producing human experience: neurology, language and programming.  The neurological system regulates how our bodies function, language determines how we interface and communicate with other people and our programming determines the kinds of models of the world we create.  Neuro-Linguistic Programming describes the fundamental dynamics between mind (neuro) and language (linguistic) and how their interplay affects our body and behavior (programming).  You think in the very language designed in order to keep you within a certain parameter.  When you use a language, you are signing a contract that, ""This"" means ""This"" and ""That means ""That"".  When you go outside of that parameter or break that contract by trying to redefine things to best suit your wants or agenda, that's when things get messed up, distorted and essentially starts to effect our natural understanding of existence when the communication no longer works as intended or the way that it should. If you unaware of this, you essentially have no control over how your brain thinks in reaction to your environment since it has been programmed by others to think in the language that you were programmed with.  When I say, ""apple"" (to anyone programmed with English) what is the first thing that comes to your mind?  I bet it wasn't anything relevant to hippopotamus.   This is what is being used to fill peoples heads with pretty pictures so they are distracted from what else is going on.  Turning everything from not being okay, to everything is okay, now go back to sleep.  Comfort breeds weakness, discomfort breeds a stronger mind.  Seek intellectual challenge. Birds of a feather flock together, don't be one of he Do-do's that seeks constant comfort from having to think hard about something.  Self-esteem or self-belief is closely linked to the neurotransmitter serotonin.  When the lack of it takes on severe proportions, it often leads to depression, self-destructive behaviour or even suicide. 5  Social validation increases the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain and allows us to let go emotional fixations and become self-aware more easily  Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or strengthens one's prior personal beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias.  People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way.  The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply entrenched beliefs.  “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time.” ~ Abraham Lincoln e·pis·te·mol·o·gy /əˌpistəˈmäləjē/ noun 1. the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion.   “If you want to know who controls you, look at who you are not allowed to criticize.” ~ Voltaire “Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.” ~ Voltaire Do not commit intellectual suicide. Never stop asking questions, nothing and no one is above scrutiny. Lose the method known as faith, use science, and keep the doubt.   Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence.[92] He describes faith as belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, has no ability to make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.[93]  Philosophy professor Peter Boghossian argues that reason and evidence are the only way to determine which ""claims about the world are likely true"". Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives as an example of the belief held by that Muslims that Muhammad (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that Joseph Smith (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no ""built-in corrective mechanism"". For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate. Boghossian advocates thinking of faith either as ""belief without evidence"" or ""pretending to know things you don't know"".[94]",5년 전(수정됨),1,

I just haven't bothered to go along with your stupid whataboutisms because that's all they are.  But let's start from the top then.  It is true that Mueller didn't find sufficient evidence for a conspiracy charge.  More specifically, he failed to find sufficient evidence to constitute proof of intent.  What that means is h ecouldn't prove that the Trump administration wern't just being useful idiots.  However, not only is being useful idiots pretty damning in and of itself, but the Trump administration also committed 10 counts of obstruction of justice, blocking Mueller from getting the evidence in question.  So that doesn't really support your claim that trump was innocent at all.  Quite frankly, it's the opposite.  Trump illegally colluded with Ukraine?  That isn't something he has ever been accused of to my knowledge lol.  Perhaps you're thinking of the time Trump tried to extort the Ukrainian government into making Biden look bad and got caught and impeached over it?  Yet another example of Trump's corruption and incompetence.  Lol no, Flynn was acting as an unregistered forign agent and lied about it to investigators.  And he got caught.

@striker3," @Anvilman  The day president Trump was announced as the new president the market began its skyrocket up as the obama years were at best stagnant , wages increased during Trumps administration in fact the United States Department of Labor  AND the United States Department of commerce all their numbers prove the point , those are the only official sources and record keeping , in fact unemployment was the lowest than in the last 50 years according to the official government record, (msnbc,cnn,politico, snopes are not official record providers) and YOu clearly did NOT read the transcripts from  dolt Adam Schiff  which includes data from some FBI that they intended to Trap Gen. Mike Flynn. As far as Ukraine goes (extort the Ukrainian) that never happened as the media and democrats blew the entire issue out of context, (as usual) the democrats knew there was ZERO to the claim but let the faulty process continue . In fact from Day one of Trumps administration twits like Maxine Waters, Corey Booker told people to boycott anyone that supported the president and that is out right as unAmerican as it can get.  As far as the Mueller report in fact House Intelligence Committee on Thursday released thousands of pages of declassified interview transcripts from the Russia investigation that show that more than a year into the probe senior FBI and intelligence officials could offer no specific proof of collusion between Donald Trump's campaign and Moscow and instead offered rambling explanations of why the probe had persisted. And its gets worse for democrats as Former DNC chair person said democrats even paid russians to spy..Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier, and it gets worse for democrats from that point on.The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about President Trump's connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin as now being investigated by the DOJ. The economy is Trumps, as the wall street Journal,Forbes, Business week,the economist all say current economic success numbers are a uniquely Trumpian achievement and not owed to policies already set in motion when he took office.""the economy does seem to be on fire, and it’s fairly easy to draw a straight line from Trump’s policies to the current trends.""

Obama, a do nothing president?  Pfffft.  The only reason he even remotely resembles that remark is because Conservatives in congress did everything they could to stonewall everything he did.  Trump isn't a dealmaker.  He has repeatedly failed to accomplish anything via political negotations, starting with the failed attempt to repeal the ACA. He politics like a playground bully; he blisters and spouts bogus, then when nobody goes along with it he just throws another tantrum.  As for how hard he tries, considering the sheer amount of golfing trips and ""executive time"" he's taken, you're obviously full of baloney.  While Trump hasn't actually put us at war with everyone yet, it's not from a lack of trying.  He's already put us on the brink of war with Iran twice now, presumably at the behest of the Saudis who bribe him so handsomely.  Here's a few examples.

I'm finished with this argument, I always have wondered what the hate is about, but he is no war starter,, he deals with people with a large stick, that no one wants to have him use. Instead of finding ways to create the hate, why not try looking on the positive side of Trump, because that would give you some perspective. Before the corona disaster , he had helped the economy, he had lowered unemployment, he had conversed with someone we think is a little wayward in his thinking a dictator called Kim Jong Un, I think he has a reasonable relationship with Putin.  With China? Well we know what they are like, but he will not be pushed by President Xi Jinping!   I'd add to the people who have the hate bug for Trump, that many leaders of nations and W.H.O. as well were caught with their pants down with COVID19.  Your article above, I wonder who put that together, anyway I have no hate nor love for the political elite, they are in the main false.

They know probably no more than you or I or anyone knows,.Its news by opinion, and what you read in print or online or get told on TV, is probably never even close the realities and what actually happened on the inside.  Do you really think governments let stuff like sensitive arrangements with other countries out into the public, so news media can spill it ? They don't, but it looks like the great reporters are onto it.   If the media were allowed to blast open all the secrets of different nations, why on earth do you need spys, Who'd need them? The Media will find out, Set a CIA office in the local news room.  Ask yourself?   Here we are on a forum of maybes and what ifs?  And none of us can know what governments do or don't do.

@gilfavor1river," @Anvilman  Detail his corruption?  Every bit of it, that is absolute, then do the other side in detail too, of how they have handled being a competent political answer to the current government, then check out Biden and his kid, and the Me Too movement that he endorsed and may be facing that situation himself, no one is perfect, not a soul on this earth, Trump isn't a political animal, but the American establishment is and they love their little ivory towers, they are ALL wealthy as hell, they live in another world in their ivory towers, Trump may be wealthy too, but he is not one of them, he takes to things in a layman's terms.   A brilliant example of that difference is that Trump knows his people, and  his audience, where as his opponent Hillary Clinton used the ""deplorable"" word, and killed herself in the process , she put so many people off her, by just showing her privileged colours! Her ignorance and temperament showed up like a giant glowing , look at me I am fabulous, she was not a politicians backside in terms of how to be one of the people!    As I have said no one is perfect and Trump definitely not, because of the world he came from , and his background pretty privileged too, doesn't make him an ogre?   ( oh and don't talk about draft dodging! There is a million stories about the over privileged of the elite set getting a little helping out of things!)   Watching this, I have seen from every little corner of the planet, this overload of hatred for a person mainly for two reasons, he won over HILLARY, her supporters cannot deal with it or get over it. AND ITS MEDIA DRIVEN, WHY????  Then as he took on the job, he can be abrasive in his manner sometimes, but since day one when he announced he'd run, he has been treated like some pariah the butt of jokes and insult, and yet he is part of a massive administration, who advise him and he goes on instinct as to what and how he says things, that's him being straight. It's all from advice, some of the media bait him too, when he makes announcements so he tells them they will be ignored, and as for the media and the celebrity of the place, look at the foul vile mouth of Robert Di Niro, and Alec Baldwin these priveliged nasty individuals play actors , they are nothing except for their wealth and their acting, and wow, that's great? Madonna what ruin that human is, and Streep , really???   All of a sudden they are the ones who know best, and that stupid talk show with the women, seriously never have I heard anything as vile as the hate sessions they run on TV. I wasn't going to say a word again about this topic to you,  but this ridicule of the President borders on mass hysteria and plain ""sore losing nastiness"",  kept going by bias unlike anything I 've ever seen, whatever things Trump does and says is a product of his personality and how he delivers his administrations advice, and he can be brutally frank that's for sure.  But he is, in himself genuine, I ask questions about factual stuff, the Saudi comments I have no idea, but the media is a terrible beast. It gets a set on someone and can lubricate and twist the truth to look like anything! What about the attack on Cavanah the judge, a Trump appointment he was targeted for being a Trump appointment! Then the ruination the Democrats caused , and the terrible undeserved hammering of that mans family, the nonsense he had to go through. So look at Joe Biden and his little maybe act of indecency, he may be innocent as a lamb, but the mud is there now!  And that is what the Democrat and left-led thinking does to or for the media. who follow that side of politics,  it is appalling. And yes I remember bleeding Bill O'Reilly and his blind lying bias too.    From the right! All I do is look for something someone says even when it looks official in the media whether it is gospel or not, how the hell,  with a rabid media, does anyone in the general public know the truth.   Once more, Trump got in, he was not your usual political elite wealthy born to privelige type, in fact he terrified the living you know what out of the Democrats and even some of the Republicans, because??????????????????????? he WASN'T one of them!  not a born to rule like maybe Hillary?   Once more too, he hasn't gone to war, he has to deal with places like Iran, and North Korea ,. which he has done his best he can especially with NK ,  no one else has got close!!!!!   Aslo it wasn't Americans that slammed an explosive little boat into the side of an American destroyer  a few years back or blocked the Straits of Hormuz  ..........was it?   They protect a water way, and they have to now show China that the South China Sea IS NOT THEIRS TO RULE, THE PRESSURE IS AMAZING, AND YET PEOPLE MAKE JOKES ABOUT HIM OR THROW VITRIOL AT HIM, I DON'T LIKE, OR DISLIKE HIM, I DON'T KNOW HIM, BUT I CAN SEE WHAT HE HAS DONE, THAT IS THE ECONOMY, THE UNEMPLOYMENT LOWERING . HE IS REAL BETTER GET USED TO IT.   His disdain for the global warming crews, well they are the ruin of our  world, with exaggerated and false predictions, and no idea of what the future would look like without cheap electricity!   You look properly, at situations and not at a person to bleat your hatred about.     Also now his work is harder because of Coronavirus, I would be thinking very carefully about why you hate, because he may be your only real hope, the other side is full of wanna be's who don't think of the people, and, one thing this President does rich or not, is think like,  and for,  the people.  ( the ridicule he has been given over the disinfectant is a beat up of the most vile and dishonest interpretation of what he said, people who do this are not worth the steam of your breath on a cold morning)    Then check out previous Presidents, and tell me which of those was perfection, NONE!   I think now you and I should finish this, that is all I have to say. It's a gut feeling,  a perception, from a long time of watching, hearing and reading.

It’s two years old, and a lot more examples of his corruption have been uncovered or carried out since then (see the Trump’s “redistribution” of coronavirus medical supplies for a more recent example), but it’s a good start. https://bdnews24.com/world/2018/10/30/trumps-corruption-the-definitive-list  As far as I can tell, the “other side” is just blatantly ignoring it and spewing whataboutisms in a pathetic attempt to justify doing so, much like you did just now with Biden.  Yes, I’m familiar with the Republican party’s pathetic attempts to discredit Biden by inventing a Ukraine scandal (and getting caught in the process lol), as well as the less-then-credible accusation against him.  I don’t particularly support Biden, so I’m not going to waste by time defending him.  Trump is simply much worse then him.  Yes, yes, you like to wank Trump and pretend he isn’t just a pathetic piece of garbage.  Sorry, but it doesn’t change what he is.

@gilfavor1river," @bluntfruntac9981  Then tell me again ?  But before COVID19 Trump had lifted the economy, no miracles but moving in the right direction, he had lowered unemployment, lowered unemployment in the African American community too, maybe not perfect but he was moving in the right direction , what else could he be doing but the right thing, or trying to, even while being hammered with insult and ignorance and accusations from the alternative government party, Democrats behaving in a despicable manner. He had lowered taxes for business with conditions ! That it shared its saving  with employees passed the advantages on to employees as well as the companies! or else,?Yes he did it!  He stood up to China not causing any war. Just letting them know that the USA and its allies were still right smack bang here . He attempted to change the firey situation with North Korea, maybe not as succesaful as he would have liked , where Kim ios now who knows but he moved IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. His connections to Russia are smart , to be able to talk to a potential enemy is better than not knowing what they are up to. Especially if your own nations Democrat party are trying to undermine you ""THE PRESIDENT"" like confederates tried to do nearly 150 years ago? Treasonous almost to me. He is easing out of M/E concentrating on Asia Pacific, he is trying to save as many  American soldiers and their allies lives  the best way he can, and he's asked NATO ...Europe to take some of the load,. BUT!!! He doesn't back down from responsibility when his opponents can only kick him in the head from behind, abuse hIs appointed officials or potentially appointed officers into high ranking  Law positions,,Democrat  behaviour is/was disgraceful , how they paraded innocent people in front of everyone all over the world.  This is the type of horrific behaviour led by a poor example of someone who wants to be the alternative PRESDIENT, GIVE THE WORLD A BREAK AMERICA , PUT HIM IN AGAIN FOR OUR SAKES OUT HERE, to finish the job he tried to start. Stop blaming him for COVID19 mishandling that happened in Democrat states too, as did BLM as does your gun culture make being a cop in America the worst job on earth.

I must be very bad at doing that, unless everyone who answers me has their own hatreds or biases I honestly haven't a clue? So I'll try this last time then I'm off this subject because I think some of you simply cannot grasp my point.   Ameen Younis comments, Trump Lied about the coronavirus ""going away in April"", well no he didn't lie, he made a comment to put across a point at the time, to perhaps, if you ever think along the lines of a person who has to settle and calm down 320 million people when a crisis is arriving. You will understand my meaning when I say "" Trump knows his audience always has and knows what time to say things, and who he will be saying it to"".   I'm not sure if you get this yet, but he makes comments to soothe a situation, or occasionally he oversteps, says something, and the media the ones who loath him, take it and twist it so badly that whoever reads it sees it as gospel when it's not. Look at J. KIMMEL  what a gutless way to pick your target, what a piece of filthy commentary over Pence and empty boxes that weren't, seeing a pattern here yet?    Now Trump does this, and unsettles some, his enemies mainly, because he is not an establishment politician  he is totally different, wealthy or not he knows how to speak to the people, he says what he thinks, and at the time believes it,  but in the main, he is putting some positives to the people at the ""time"".   Politicians do this, most do it in a low-level way that is not all truth, they have a ""way with words?""    Trump doesn't.  Trump speaks what he thinks at a time, but sometimes he speaks to calm .  In the beginning of Corona that was what he did, and as the rest of the world were as frightened and confused, he said something that may have been not totally correct , but when you call a President, a Premier a prime minister, a liar for trying to do and say the right thing, then his media enemies, plant twisted stories that look shocking with a high level of headline bias and propaganda,  then it is the WORDS of the rabid media , on both sides, but its the MEDIA that are the liars, propagandists not NEWS BRINGERS AT ALL!!!    DO YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN?    BACKING UP TRUMP OR NOT BACKING UP TRUMP... HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I HAVE SAID.    ITS HOW MEDIA ALLOW THE MISTRUTH S' THE TWISTINGS TO GET TO THE PUBLIC . The thing about the headline comments!  Some people read the headline and if their politics is strong in one direction they will fiddle through the article or barely even read it, or listen or view and just take it on board as fact, when people who take time from the sidelines to actually look at what was said , THE WORDS, THE MEANING OF SAID WORDS! From all sides.  It is blatantly obvious that bias is everywhere in main stream media, it just is, and slippery delivery of the news is twisted most of the time to suit an opinion, the media become the new fascists, telling but never giving both arguments. And they won't debate, but thats the new left these days.   If you look at the bleeding damned stuff on YouTube the headline stuff down the side column with a headline or a bad photo of someone to make them look bad, and certain words like lied or has been found out, or some bad petty political joke by the John Olivers of the world. It makes me angry because it may decide for some individual who they will put in, with their vote, when they have not heard the real story.   HERE IS AN EXAMPLE if you don't see what I'm talking about. Where I am typing now, on the side column is the headline Trump incoherent Spectacle at G7, it's 8 months ago and to me is bullshit, but also the other side does it with headlines about a republican, politician beating up Pelosi or Clinton or some lawmaker into the ground same rubbish, Trey Gowdy is good at it. Although Hillary Clinton is a fool anyway, with her comments about the ""deplorables"" what a dumb stupid insulting thing for someone who wanted to be President, to say!  But she has an attitude and a temper and you should be glad she is not President.   Trump does not do that, he speaks from the heart what you get is what you see, and at times he may go a bit too far, but that is his honesty at that point of time,, those who can't see it, DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.    John Oliver sees it as a cheap comedy shot, somewhat like Jon Stewart has , although highly intelligent he is a master of ridiculing people.   Trump whatever your bias tells you is no different to any leader in the world who made a mistake about coronavirus, and who tried to be positive in an unknown situation, also remember information from a quite dangerous and rabid government where coronavirus started! How ever iot started it started  in China.   Wouldn't and didn't that, make it easy for anyone in the world to NOT BE SURE or know what and how to deal with this horror,.    Then you probably read the articles by ""experts"" about how Trump talks etc, I've never heard so much garbage on the computers of the world, and I usually get on YouTube to listen to decent music, but  now it is so full of politics and 99% if it is absolute nonsense and twisted truth. And I see it. As a witness to the comments that come on here, and I wonder what the effing hell is going on with the human race, when right now we should be looking positive to fight this rotten crap, and not have people on here taking pleasure out of others misery, and ragging a President or any other leaders for trying to do their best, what do you expect from Trump, but his best! He tries to give it, and then before you go bashing his personality or his meanings when he speaks, have a look at the biggest problem on the earth , like that bleeding Xi Jimping and his non engagement from China about COVID19.  THERE... HAVE A THINK!  SOME PEOPLE NEED TO DO THAT MORE OFTEN AND STOP READING LIES IN THE HEADLINES, and then not being able to see them for what they are, and that is worse! Get behind your leader , you are so misinformed the haters that is, I am still amazed. But finished.",5년 전,1,
@benkelly9529,"gilfavor1river I 100% agree with your comments that the media has a bias from whoever writes the article, it is so hard to find an outlet that gives a simple facts based explanation of the situation without leaving out details to sway the article in a certain direction, we have the same issue in the uk with most of our print news being owned by Rupert Murdoch, it is the job of the reader to find a variety of sources and create their own informed opinion of the topic, because there is nothing out there that is completely impartial. However when people have their own political opinions they will gloss over important information to find evidence to back up their own ideology, which is why you have sources such as breitbart just for an example providing “opinions” that then become misinformed facts, when opinions and slander are consumed as 100% fact then that is very dangerous, and it happens on both sides. I also agree it is important to rally behind your leaders they will be as scared and confused as we all are, this is the first time that they will have encountered this situation as well. However it is imperative to hold them to account for what they are doing, Boris Johnson for example not turning up to cobra meetings to discuss the issue is awful and in the past his government (tories) actively stopped the stockpiling of PPE and have helped cripple the nhs, that is in the past and can’t be changed its a problem we now have to deal with and it has not been dealt with in the best way at all. Our airports had no screening to enter the country at all (I believe as well that we still don’t have that, not even a panflet to advise on what to do) this is just one example of ignorance of the situation. With what you said about Trump calming the populous and knowing who he is talking to he should know that what he says will be taken very seriously and as fact by a certain amount of people, all politicians lie and he is a politician, he is the president that I would say is a very political position, therefore he as with all leaders should only be providing facts, not conjecture and what he thinks, it is also documented numerous times things he has said and done that could cause serious harm to peoples lives, not from outlets but from his mouth or his tweets, yes it is different but it is different in a way that you will converse with an adult and a child, you don’t make up facts to cover up the truth this is a time of crisis and will incur an actual death toll. It is also not time to start a political campaign and create division between people it is a time to stand up and lead the country together, you can’t deny the way he holds himself in his talks to the nation is quite scary, things not going his way so he just walks away so he can’t be held accountable, there are serious and valid questions the he just ignores and spouts off about how bad China is and how media is the problem (very smart of him because his followers will believe it and then be more aligned with him and what he is saying only taking their truths from him). He shouldnt be questioning things from the scientific community and suggesting quite frankly idiotic suggestions to make him look like he is solving issues, trying to take all the glory from different states and the way that they have handled it to gain political purchase, It is not about his standing for the next election or getting the economy back in a world that every economy has fallen apart, that can’t be helped. He needs to remember economies bounce back Human life goes forever, trying to leverage political power from this will only get people to hate him.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@gilfavor1river,", @benkelly9529  I think you totally over react to Trump and his manner,  and never have I seen such blatant hatred and misunderstanding of personalities as I have with this unbelievable vitriol against him , his family and his hair even what a way to hate, for what?,   With Oliver headlining his comment on screen with Trump vs Truth, really ?  All politicians say things and all politicians in any country have those who are affected by comments from leaders,  people suggesting that Trump's comments would have the people injecting themselves with household disinfectant is exactly what you expect from a anti Trump journalistic group to pick out and make it what it was not? Where I first got into this debate, that was when people started saying that Trump had said to inject disinfectant to stop coronavirus, well this is one of thousands of things said in media that is not true, in fact if you want you can twist the words to say anything if your a savvy journo . He was talking about an idea.  How ever people who hate him tried to put it as some massive gaph , he was discussing an idea and more than likely answering some leading question from the floor. I can think of other Presidents , all do things they regret this fellow has of yet to do anything disastrous that I can see. So here is a test , anyone who can be honest with themselves , have a think about good/bad points and good/ bad things, done by this person, compared to other leaders especially Presidents of the USA,  he's been called a misogynist, well check a few others out from the past, he certainly hasn't wanted wars, he hasn't done a George W Bush like Iraq, yet I'd say he is been in the minds of so many a surprise winner , that they can't believe that the old school establishment politicians have had theuir noses put out by only one thing, HE WON! Not anything else the hatred from his opposites the Democrats and the fear from his own side ,  the Republicans who are a bit easier on him now, that has created what I see as treachery in the minds of some. If for one minute an American sees this man as a wrecker rather than a person of difference who does it his way and straight down the line, and does it well, then they have to include themselves in the groupings in America of those misinterpreting  types that pick hatred and rumour and falsehoods as reality, who have the gall to place a personal vendetta against , because Trump picked him as a person to become  a Judge, they set about those foul diggers, trying to ruin this man and his wife and child/children? In a dispicable investigation , those same tried to ram false accusations about Russia against Trump , which is bullshit, they go over board about the people he's sacked and tried to abuse them then use them against him , yet they did wrong AND HE SACKED THEM. PERSONALLY HILLARY DIDN'T MAKE THE GRADE SHE LOST , AND ALL THE KIDDIES (ADULT KIDDIES I MEAN) TOOK THEIR BAT AND BALL AND WENT HOME SULKING LIKE THE IMMATURE FOOLS THEY LOOKED. The celebrity in America also probably had their heads patted by a campaigning Clinton were incensed at the fact that their little heroine Hillary was beaten and said so,  in no uncertiain terms, with foul mouths like DiNiro and stupid comments like Madonna, and I think Madam I am the greatest Streep too, none of these play actors have a right to bleat loss , when they have no idea, but they did , and they set up a vitriolic disease inside the USA, that beggars belief,  So my complaining and ranting on this subject does go further than media beating up stroies and lying, it goes to the fact THAT TRUMP IS NOT THE LIAR, HE IS THE PRESIDENT, AND THE MAD DOG BEHAVING ANTI TRUMP MEDIA , ARE A TERRIBLE DANGER TO AMERICA, BY LYING CONTINUALLY FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS.

The fact that you come out with that sort of rubbish , I have no idea. Why bring up racism, the world right now is in more trouble than just COVID19 , this racial hatred is the thing that will tear the place apart, sensible people know , that racism is something the human race has to put behind it , recognise all races as equal and stop fighting over past horrors, basic humanity knows some things done in history are terrible,  but all types of people and races have committed atrocities , whether they be white yellow black even red, who were wiped from their lands, but fighting now in the modern world when we have COVID19 and complaining because a President makers a comment about a ""chance"" just a chance on a cure , and saying that at the same time he why not try everything.  Then he gets hammered by the media , and pissy little sparrows like Oliver , who I used to watch all the time, but he is just a slime now picking easy targets, and those who have not got the brains to understand what is said to them and the context in which it is said, well you go and be a bleeding leader of a country with all this shit going on in the world, you maybe clutching at straws yourself.  Look at the easing off of restriction around the world then have a look a Brazil and Russia is now copping some more infections .  Now the fellow before you sais Trump lied about the end of corona by April , well maybe his  advisors said  that, China wasn't saying anything initially to anyone, and he may have been trying to hold -calm, in a situation that could explode. And it did. I reckon you'd be trying anything too if you had this killer sliding around your feet and up your goddamned leg.  I reckon  most people the quiet watchers and voters those average citizens trying to do the right thing and trying to stay healthy and trying to keep their economies going , are happy to have a leader that tries to put a positive spin on things, that malaria mix , btw , has worked to a degree, and in other cases has not. Some countries use steroids for people who are in serious trouble and has helped some of them.   I'd reckon you may want to rethink what is happening around you, than bagging this President all the time like the dumb do, without reason, because they don't like his personality. Especially the dumb in some media.  I think the way the overnight reports from around the world last night, we might all be into a second wave and being locked down again. Last night was the most reported new cases for weeks around the world, whether that's from improved testing kits, or just no.2 wave hitting again, wait and see, but there are more important things than animosity because of your goddamned politics!

Do you have any detailed reasons or do you know anything that you can say in detail that makes this President any different to any of the others, they were all human beings and and they all have failings, but they tried to do their jobs, this man has not been let alone by rumour innuendo lies and half truths, thing he says taken out of context, he is joked about by other people in high places , head butted by useless nothings with only celebrity that gives them any credibility, really what the hell does Robert ""Mr Privileged "" DiNiro  know about Trump he swears and calls him names but I'VE YET TO HEAR HIM SAY ACTUALLY WHY? He calls Trump an idiot or fool or what ever preceded with a few F WORDS .  THIS PRETENDER PLAY ACTOR HAS DROPPED INTO THE GUTTER OF HALF WITS, FOR ME,.  GOOD  ACTOR AS HE IS , WELL MAYBE HE IS , JUST GOOD AT PLAYING WOODEN NASTY CHARACTERS MOST OF THE TIME. Now Ameen's friend is calling someone a lickspittle, not sure actually who he means, Trump or people who are impressed with how well he's done while being abused and kicked from behind in the head continually.  So come on details of your particular hate reasons Ameen and Ano, until coronavirus came along America was standing up for itself again America had a lower unemployment rate, Americas's economy was moving upwards, Trump has not taken America to war, therefore his allies haven't had to go to war!  Because he was in the entertainment industry??? Is that it, because he is wealthy , is that it? Big Billy Clinton was extremely wealthy, Obama you reckon he wasn't wealthy?  In the swamp they are all wealthy , Hillary , well wealthy and from the born to rule groups, Why does Trumps wealth matter, I think it is political dislike and point-making by anti  Republicans and those Republicans some of them so well established Trump scared the shit out of them too. But he made it, and I hope he wins the next election, because the other way will land the USA in bullshit territory and in the hands of mad left wing , there's who instuigate violence over terrible misfortunes which do not improve anything, yes BLM is correct but so is WLM YLM RLM THEY ALL MATTER , AND STATISTICS CAN BE USED IN VERY VERY BAD WAYS TO Make things look what they are not.  America's gun culture has got a hell of a lot to do with shootings in America , black and white , get the right numbers too, and remember, I think  that being a cop in the USA would be a nightmare.  But the mongrel that killed George Floyd should be jailed if its found he was directly the cause of Georges death, so he'll go down don't worry.  What you need to dip is be thankful you have a President that is not afraid, and will say it like it is, and say as well whether his advice is correct , what you see with your Presdient is WHAT YOU GET, yOU WILL BE VERY LUCKY THE USA IF THIS FELLOW WINS, AND WITH ALL THE VOCAL ENEMIES HE HJAS, I THINK HE HAS MILLIONS OF QUIET VOTERS, TO GET TERM TWO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@gilfavor1river," JackFrost  You are a bitter person Jack, maybe he'd been told something in the wrong way, but look I am fed up with the hate and bad mouthing of this Presdient who has just tried to do his job in the way he knows, the fact that he comes out sometimes with things that others are too cowardly to say shows to me that perhaps on occasions he is not that well advised but he says what he says, and he did not mean to pick up the disinfectant bottle and inject yourself with it, however you decide to look at the angle or shot of his medical advisor, maybe she told him the wrong way, the point is every hate molecule in all the anti Trump people like yourself pick up and attack him personally , and I'll repeat, this fellow does a magnificent job considering he has been bad mouthed by  losers and hated in a manner I've never seen, , well I just don't know why the hate is so terrible ,  but it is like mass hysteria as  I've said this fellow is very very different  to your usual political elites who think they are born to rule. So I'd believe that the surprise that average people believed what he said, the deplorable I guess you could call them, voted him in, and now can't believe he 's President.

@joemagnets9940,"""The TRUTH'...Don't worry about the TRUTH, our KINGS will decide what the truth is and if they don't agree with the 'TRUTH' they will call it 'hate speech' and delete it no matter where on the internet they own that they have their algorithms looking for ANY COMMENT or discussion that OUR KINGS don't want the American people to know.  America IS TRULY the colony of INSANE PEOPLE that claim the 'god' they invented chose only THEM and gave land ONLY TO THEM and with the corruption of 'our' weak-minded, spineless, GREEDY, traitor bastards, loyal only to their bank accounts and the zionists that BRIBE THEM and BLACKMAIL THEM to keep the American people the slaves and servants of, according to the talmud, their most holy book, those that were chosen by the 'god' they invented.  America prints BILLIONS upon TRILLIONS OF USA CURRENCY, the 'our' zionist corrupted 'government' wastes those TAX DOLLARS to fight 'religious' wars to make sure that 'god's chosen people can keep the land that their 'god' gave only to THEM.  The question is, doesn't Israel have printing presses to print THEIR MONEY to fight THEIR WARS< to KILL THEIR 'enemies' that are 'guilty' of living on land that their 'god' GAVE ONLY TO THEM???  AS long as the American people keep believing that the 'vote' matters, America will remain the colony of Israel and NOTHING WILL CHANGE, because the Israeli lobby of AIPAC has made sure that no matter who the American people 'vote' for, the choice of who we 'vote' for will be made the zionists.  Need proof?  Just look at the past prez's of America, all promising to 'bring the soldiers home, keep America 'first', or make America 'great' again< YET NOTHING CHANGES.  When those that BREAK the Law, the zionists, corrupt those that are supposed to ENFORCE THE Law, 'our' politicians, then NOTHING CHANGES and both keep committing TREASON, both are worthy of the DEATH PENALTY that 'our' government now using against Americans that REVEAL THE TRUTH about American now being the most dangerous gov't the American PEOPLE will have to defeat to keep America a Representative Democracy, instead of what it is, the colony of the zionist JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL. All these 'discussions, dialogs, are just diversions, because as the USA Constitution DEMANDS, when the paper ballots are made as USELESS as the zionists have made the USA Constitution, then THE ONLY RECOURSE is the use of LEAD BALLOTS enforcing the DEATH PENALTY on TRAITORS< whether a 'god' chose them or not.  VOTE NOW< VOTE OFTEN, vote as many times as LEAD BALLOTS you have.  TIME FOR TALK IS OVER when the people you talk to are INSANE.   What with the American people doing the KILLING, DYING and PAYING and the zionists paying NOTHING in their lives or THEIR MONEY, to enforce THEIR 'religious' INSANITY, WHO REALLY ARE THE INSANE?

He can't lay the truth on the line to inform every American that their life is on the line and what they must do, to keep both themselves and the people they may have to come into contact with, safe. This isn't about one country being better than the other. It's not a race to be the one to come up with a solution. All mankind is suffering. This is the most major crisis that will ever happen to every one of us today. So it should be a battle we must all fight together. Where can he get ""oh only 200,000 Americans are expected to die"". Hasn't a clue.  And even if that were a true fact (!!!!!!)  that's 200,000 people who have suffered the most atrocious and painful death. They have died alone without anyone being allowed in. And their families and friends that won't just miss a loved one, and grieve enormously, plus gutted they couldn't be there to hold their hand,  they can't even have a funeral. So he thinks its ok to throw out this number and it's ok for that person and their wider friends and family to suffer. No, it's not!!! At this stage, he is not going to get his act together and speak better. But he needs to learn from all the countries that experienced this before it got to America, take note and do something now. I don't understand all the politics of the US, but again he must get every state to come together on this so that there is a clear and concise plan to follow. And that's the truth of the matter. We see whats going on in Ireland and all we can say is God all those poor People under his authority and no one can stand up against him and his lies. Or if we are talking on FB, WhatsApp, Zoom or  Microsoft Teams to different people (because we can't meet family and friends in person) we mention what's happening in other countries and when we get to America, we bow our heads and shake it side to side and say ""God love them, he hasn't a clue and they are the ones having to suffer."". All I can say is I wish for once he'd hold up his hand and truthfully say ""there isn't a point to me talking on this, I have to defer to the experts and we are working on a better plan. We are all coming together on this. And we will have a plan to help slow it down, which truthfully is the best we can do at the moment. People all over the world are working on this.

@harmenbreedeveld8026," @theodoratorpey1255  The first flaw of the travel ban was that it was TOO LATE. The virus had begun spreading in Washington State and elsewhere in mid-January.  The second flaw was that the travel ban was INCOMPLETE. Returning US citizens and residents could still come in. None were tested or quarantined. Few were even monitored for symptoms. For sure many of them carried the virus with them.  The third flaw - and the biggest one - was that the travel ban alone would never keep out the virus. As became clear in early February.  Had the Administration then focused its effort on finding and isolating initial outbreaks, as South Korea and Taiwan did, then the US would have been in a much better state than it is now.   As it is, Trump pooh-poohed the threat of the virus all the way up to early March.   We all know now that was a grievous underestimation of the threat.

@commissarshepard1442,"​ @theodoratorpey1255  Here's a fun little reddit post that condensed a months worth of stupidity from your President (being the comments he has made) so that you may watch him, over the span of several paragraphs, completely backpedal from his original comments and attempt to re-write history. As he does on a daily basis.  https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fpni2z/trump_campaign_threatens_tv_stations_that_air_ad/flmk47t/  As you've said, be vigilant.

Due to the unique movements and discontinuous appearances of Venus in the sky, mythology surrounding these figures often involved a fall from the heavens to earth or the underworld. Interpretations of a similar term in the Hebrew Bible, translated in the King James Version as ""Lucifer"", led to a Christian tradition of applying the name Lucifer, and its associated stories of a fall from heaven, to Satan.

@gilfavor1river," @Gottenhimfella  Unfortunately that is business, what do you think Banks make their money out of since the Rothschilds became fabulously wealthy???  Yes  O_P_M.......... OTHER PEOPLES MONEY.   It is how the system of finance works, from the beginning, people, saved or tried as time went by to make money. From perhaps a bit before the industrial revolution which would explode into international finance over the next 3 centuries.  They placed their money in a safe holding. What we call banks now ,and those banks began the creation of investment and gain and paid dividends and the world fell into the totaliser agencies of the stock market system, you know have a bet???   But the initial money to do that, (and it took a hell of a long time)  came from investment by people already with money AND of course a bit of financial nous, who created the banking investing, and systems which can make you rich, or make you go broke.  Then those banks investors, mostly everyone wanting advancement, began to lend money , O_P_M of course right from the start, as people allowed their savings to be used as lending for profit?????   The banks are made of other peoples savings . Savings are grown by investments purchases and you if you have a job or a superannuation fund or an investment property(s) or business or anything , even a bloody racehorse, some do,then you are ""Trump himself"" .  If you went broke, even with a start from rich daddie who would have started out from banking loans and investments and business.  Well, you'd have to rebuild using the same foundations for finance, that's Other Peoples Money !   BORROWED FROM SOMEONE IN THE FINANCIAL LENDING AREA, AND ALL OTHER THINGS OF INTEREST THAT FINANCIAL PLACE, MAY MAKE MONEY OUT OF, SO YES WE ARE ALL ""Trump himself"" either reasonably comfortable or slowing or  going Broke , then making a comeback. Or giving up!  If you went down the toilet, well you'd need some guts and determination, to come back. TWICE!  Like President Trump has done...  If you, have the capability you may come back too, if you go broke.   There is a simple answer,  to Daddy's help? It doesn't go on forever unless you are a Royal or a person from the money changers of the world, who nearly control everything, or maybe the Teflon Don, but his demise was forever on the cards!

@robertjones5086,"It is known by most, denied by a few, but understood by the world.  History will forever note that once a very prosperous nation through its own neglect, distraction and inattention stumbled into a democratic free election and negligently elected a president who is dangerous to the well being of that nation.  The 2016 presidential election saw Donald Trump elected president by the smallest of margins.  It was an electoral college victory, not a popular vote win.   Since that election, the Trump presidency has swiftly grown into a deadly cancer that has metastasized itself  to the entire country leaving us all on the brink of death.  It is therefore the duty of all citizens to come together and legally eradicate this cancer without killing ourselves—the patient.  Putting politics and party affiliation aside, lets’ talk seriously about the man called Trump.  In a word, Trump is a fraud, he is by definition a fake president, a hoax and a petty tyrant.  As the expression goes, “If you don’t look like one, you don’t talk like one and don’t act like one you ain’t one.”  Trump ain’t a president of any degree and certainly not deserving to be addressed as Mr. President.  Trump is probably the most knowledgeable person on the planet with regards to fakes and hoax, because he has been both his entire life.  It’s been said that it takes one to knew one—well folks?  Trump is a casebook example of someone who “projects” things upon others to hide and minimize his own defects—being a fake and a hoax.  This is evidenced by the fact that he proudly tells us that he is “smart” and that he knows “big words.”  No person with any smarts at all has the compulsive need to remind others how smart he/she is, or how many big words they know, but Trump can’t help himself.  Seriously, when was the last time anyone repeatedly reminded you how smart they were.   He is an arrogant, in-your-face name calling, vengeful bully, who, when his lips are moving is probably lying about something.  “Big words” like character, responsibility, temperament, tolerance, honesty, integrity, dignity, understanding and compassion are not apart of this mans’ lexicon.  This is the same man who states that he reads the Bible, it’s his favorite book, yet he is unable to recite a single passage.  Trump is simply an obese (fat) figure of a man with a fake tanned face, a bad combover who wears a red baseball cap and cheats at golf.  He is a guy that doesn’t have the emotional, psychological or the intellectual capacity to be president, in a word, he’s a child.  More important, he is morally corrupt and morally bankrupt; he lacks any manner of empathy or compassion for others.  His entire existence is centered around self-promotion, instant gratification, with an insatiable need for attention in order to constantly feed his obsessive narcissistic personality and his self-aggrandizement defect.  However, he was able to find the time to create a documented personal history of racism, bigotry, sexual misconduct and discrimination.   Trump is unable to distinguish between right and wrong, his moral compass is non-existent.  He has been a failure at two marriages, countless business, numerous bankruptcies and he was a draft dodger using a “fake” bone spur injury to avoid service.   Trump’s public pronouncements are replete with half truths, ill-informed babbling, misinformation or out right lies.  But, I will give credit where credit is due—the fact that he became the President of the United States, ranks him as the number one con-artist of the Century.   Far too many Americans are complicit before/after the fact in their support of this cozen of a man who has made a mockery of his office while staining the face of America.  This man has no respect and no understanding of our great institutions of democracy.  He waves the flag in public and burns the flag in private—he is simply a disgrace   Now, more than ever, our country needs a smart, intelligent, serious leader who is committed to the betterment of life, liberty and the pursuit happiness for all Americans, not just his chosen few.   Trump cares (not) about you, he has no compassion for others, he never has and he never will.  He doesn’t even have compassion for animals...he is the first president in more than 120 years not to have had a dog in the White House, no mystery there.    Mr. Trump has a single priority and a single reality—HIMSELF, everything and everyone else be damned.",5년 전,0,

@gilfavor1river,"Again have a think, and ask who is his audience listening to Fox, OK if you can understand what I mean he knows people and what to say, its why others read him as they think exactly , if you can look at any body you knowew or meet, and you spesk with them you generally get an idea if they are good bad or putting one over you. Lots of Americans I don't think do that, you are all locked on. And some of the Aussie comments on here , and Australia is not anywhere near your election most of them wouldn't understand what the hell is happening or who would be better at President than Trump or Biden, yet here and in other Western democracies, most in celebrity and leftish politic all piss on Trump, and out siode of America, how the hell do they even know. Trump is your man USA beware the lady running beside Joe. Fair dinkum  America, the Democrats have been almost treasonous, disruptive they have let your country down by being spoilers not  even trying to be an alternative government, just weckers, Pelosi should be ashamed of herself, and those that wished Trump ill health should hang their heads in shame.The Democrat majority in your upper house what ever you call it, has been used as nothing more than a tool for destroying a new kind of peoples President.  One that is not part of the elite political privileged career politicans, Joe's been there for 47 years, on the public purse,  yeah we got em too here, too long too useless too used to living a privileged life, right now its the Democrats that are the jealous lying losers, like I  said have a closer look.  Voting is not there for people to vote against who they  hate, its about voting in people who will do a good job as Trump was doing until COVID 19 STRUCK THE WORLD, VOTING IS NOT ABOUT ONE PERSON THAT'S IDENTITY POLITICS. Voting is about the betterment of your nation, not getting a good feeling fix out of crazy biased news media on both ends of the argument, to judge who you vote for.  Trump deserves a second term because he is fair dinkum .And that maybe why Americans hate him, he tells them what they have to hear but don't want to hear, and he's an optimist he sends out positive things sometimes he is misread, but Biden is not your man believe it!",5년 전,0,

So I'm not going to lie, seeing this happen is the number one reason I like Trump, and pray he wins again so I can watch it happen all over. The people of the US have grown to take liberty for granted, and as a consequence we stopped being able to tell the difference between what we have the right to do, and what we are merely privileged to. Because of this I've noticed much of our people are so busy demanding privilege we tend to violate individual rights, and our nation has basically sold it's soul for the pleasure of it.

I thought ""You're not 4. What do YOU know about being 4 and turning 5?"" Weeeeeelllllll....... No amount of BELIEF was going to make that TRUTH.
