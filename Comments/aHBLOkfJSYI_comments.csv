@GodLovesYou-np8xe,"Romans 3:23 “For ALL HAVE SINNED and fall short of the glory of God.”  Romans 6:23 (KJV) “For the WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  1 Corinthians 15:3-7 “For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.”  1 Peter 2:24 “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree; so that, having died to sins, we might live for righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.”  John 3:16-17 “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.”  1 John 3:8 “He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”  Acts 3:19 (KJV) “REPENT ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.”  Acts 2:38 Peter replied, “REPENT and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” People consider our Hollywood movie heroes to be powerful, but Jesus is more powerful than them. Amen if you agree.",1년 전,0,

@tomh4301,"Jesus died for our sins so we wouldn’t have to pay for our sins in Hell, but if we reject Him, then WE WILL have to pay for our sins in Hell because there must be payment for sin. Nothing is free. We can either accept Jesus’s payment for our sins or WE will end up paying for our sins on our own in Hell. Either way, someone is going to pay. All we must do to avoid our punishment is repent and believe Jesus died on the cross, was buried, and rose the third day, and follow Him for the rest of our lives. Read the King James Bible, get baptized and fellowship with Born Again Christians who are serious about the faith. Being a “good person” cannot get us to heaven because no matter how much good we do, it will never be good enough because the standard to get into heaven is perfection, which means we must have never sinned. Only Jesus was good enough to get us to heaven because He never sinned. The ONLY way to heaven is THROUGH Him.  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one (Romans 3:10)  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; (Romans 3:23)  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

@williamlee4619," @inovity8796  I'm going to just conclude this thread. When the auction for these drawings was still on, each drawing had the artist's name next to it. The only one that didn't have a name? RDJ's one. I like RDJ, but even the most humble person who might not go around boasting about it, would still leave their name on there. Secondly, as an artist, the time it took was far too short. It's a pretty rough drawing, but the commercial break would have to have been at least an hour for such a drawing. You're telling me that in the span of one hour, all the other actors only got like a circle drawn and made a smiley face? The break was probably like 5 minutes. 5 minutes to sketch out the proportions, figure out the pose, add shading, add highlights, fill in the background, etc. WITH NO REFERENCE PHOTO. You're telling me he can remember every inch his face and the whole Iron Man suit and draw it from memory? It would at least take 30 min for a VERY skilled artist to do that drawing, and I know for sure that commercial breaks aren't 30 min lmao.

And yeah, well RDJ actually has his own album and it's not sold for public but he painted the cover of his album and it's so beautiful bruh it's top artist work if I can say. I think it's easy for him to just drew iron man on commercial break.   Yeah sure I'm a fan of him but if he didn't draw It, I would admit that you're right and yeah well your arguments with these people aren't useless at all, you're just telling the truth.

@manonofzareck7927," @williamlee4619  Rein theoretisch wäre es möglich gewesen. Es gibt durchaus Künstler, die so ein Talent haben, das sie so eine Zeichnung in  2-3 Minuten fertig stellen. Im Übrigen ist es schon etwas merkwürdig, das der Block mit der Iron-Man-Zeichnung ausgerechnet bei RDJ gelandet ist und sich die echt gute Zeichnung auf dem Blatt VOR der winzigen Skizze befindet? Allerdings sieht man auch anfangs, das RDJ das oberste Blatt zusammen mit dem Deckblatt umgeklappt und man die Zeichnung leicht durchschimmern sieht. Also dürfte das vermutlich vorher als Prank abgesprochen worden sein",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@aurarip, @ishvx  your the one who don't get the joke the drawing had used oil crayons which wasnt even on the table first of all so your saying in a 10 min commercial he asked everyone for a oil crayon then with the left like 7 min he drew it and after everything he said to everyone that it wasn't his drawing and everyone believed it even though they know he didn't had oil crayons on the second stickman and it's almost impossible to draw that in 10 min even if he somehow got oil crayon without making any sound,3년 전,0,

@marine_void4643, @azpectgaming5234  no you are just being rude. You cant 'command' someone to delete their comment when it isnt offensive in anyway. The guy made a mistake and I think everyone is being way too harsh about it. One guy needs to tell him hes made a mistake not the whole community.

@426delfin,"It's not actually about how long it takes to draw a ""good sketch"". If someone is good at drawing you can see it from their strokes alone. Way they set it up, what they focus on. If someone draws a lot their pencil strokes are going to look better even if they don't get a lot of time.

@nathanhernandez7333,"Agent Apple read the issues by Stan Lee, Steve Ditko and John Romita Sr.. It’s not nostalgi clouding judgement. It’s plain fact. Tobey Maguire was a Spider-Man / Peter Parker based on those initial comic books and if you read them, you can clearly see the transition from comic book to film. Y’all need to stop riding and hop off the MCU I’m thinking that everything is 100% perfect. Only thing holland nails in terms of Spider-Man is his attitude as Spider-Man himself. Otherwise he’s nothing like classic comic book Spider-Man. The latest issues carry on the movies and end up trying to make the comic book characters more like the film to familiarize audiences. Spider-Man is all about choice and responsibility. about doing the right thing, and not failing his uncle Ben. Not to impress a rich billionaire or prove he’s an avenger. Spider-Man is suppose to become the hero by dawning his suit and webs, not have a high tech suit with a built in AI guiding him into stopping criminals one way or another. Get off the MCU bandwagon and pick up a few comics from the old ages (not the new ones because they dawn to give him traits based on the movies), but pick up the Ditko, Romita Sr, Mcfarlane, And loosely  even some 90s Bagley issues and understand the character and what he represents, stands for, how he works, and also learn the Peter Parker aspects of having typical adult problems. He only spent a little amount of time in high school in the first run of the Amazing Spider-Man so don’t you or anyone of the MCU riders say he is suppose to be a high schooler and remain a high schooler. He remained a high schooler in the ultimate issues but initially didn’t start off that way, so do yOuR hw, read the recommended issues and learn and study the character and you’ll draw the connection and see Tobey being the best interpretation of Spider-Man to date. Sure it might not be 100% spot on due to little things such as webshooters but I rather him skip over a little detail such as webshooters than for his character to overall change in not following the responsibilities and principles in which he stands for and that is the guilt within in to not failing uncle Ben nor those he loves.",7년 전,0,

The thing with Avatar was that it didnt even do THAT amazingly during its first weekend, but then it just kept going and going for MONTHS....I remember that I went to see it again in later April or at start of May in 2010 and it STILL draw people into theaters....I really doubt Infinity War is going to do the same, since Force Awakens couldnt do it either, especially since Avatar didnt have big competition the following months.....no such advantage with Avengers, since Deadpool 2, Solo, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom are all coming up in the following 2 months....None of those movies are going to do even nearly as good as Infinity War, but they WILL eat away viewers and thus income, and you know Im right with this...  I would say that the most Infinity War is going to make is somewhere over 2 billion and beat the total income of Force Awakens....maybe even overtake Titanic on number 2 place, if it does somehow continue to make money week after week, but I would say its going to make somewhere from 1.8 billion to 2.3 billion.
