@aragusea,"Q: What do you mean you devised this recipe? I've seen this before. A: Cool! I haven't seen another recipe that applies the par-boiled roastie technique to a fry shape, but I'm not at all surprised to hear that others exist. There's nothing new under the sun. But I did work out the particulars of this one on my own. Totally possible I just reinvented the wheel. Still good fries, though!  Q: Have you thought about adding baking soda to the water to make the outside more crispy? A: No, but I'm intrigued. Alkalinity helps with browning. I will say, however, that I'm not sure I would want to accelerate the browning process on these. The interior needs a long cooking time in order to get really soft and fluffy, and I wouldn't want the exterior to get overly brown while I'm cooking the interior. Really dark brown on these tastes burned.  Q: Have you thought about roughing up the fries a bit before they go in the oven to get more fluffy exterior that'll go crisp in oil? A: That works great with a more conventional roast potato shape, but these long thin shapes are really delicate when they first go in the roasting tray. That little shake I give them is about all the trauma they can take at that stage.  Q: What's up with that thumbnail? A: I thought it was funny and intriguing! (And yeah, maybe I thought it could draw the ASMR crowd...)  Q: Have you thought about using a slotted pan? A: I'm intrigued, but would't the oil drip out the bottom? We need that oil.  Q: What's up with you having ads now? A: A man has to make a living for his family. Also, Squarespace really is good. http://squarespace.com/ragusea  Q: What's up with two ad breaks per video? A: The particular format of the ads is negotiated on a case-by-case basis with the sponsor. You'll see a different format in next week's recipe. Personally, I like this format, because it discloses the sponsorship arrangement right off the bat, but then gives you some more content before you get to the main ad body.  Q: Why was your first talking-head shot out of focus? A: I shoot by myself, and the talking-head shots are tough. I had my camera on face-tracking autofocus, I could see on the monitor that it had zero'd in on my face, but it's not possible for me to see on a tiny monitor halfway across the room if the shot really is in focus. Between this and my day job, I really don't have time to go back and fix stuff unless it's a real disaster. I'm learning every video, though, and I think it'll all keep getting better. The entire reason I started making cooking videos in the first place was to work on my video skills. I'm still pretty new to the medium.  Q: Why were some of your shots over-exposed? A: I'm still really struggling with how to light and expose for white ingredients. I'm working on it. Everything looks overexposed on the cheap field monitor I'm using, so that's no help. I've tried using the level meter, but the black table and the white plates just seem to throw it off.",6년 전(수정됨),1.6만,

@jmaaloe,"Adam, re: adding baking soda to the pot, I highly encourage you to try it out. I learned about the method from Serious Eats, and it's an absolute game changer. It basically turns the exterior of the potato from ""cracked and fluffy"" to ""covered in a layer of mashed potatoes"", although I don't know if the fry shape will be able to hold together with this; a lot of the mushy exterior is from agitation in the colander, so it's typically used with halved potatoes.",6년 전,4,
@maxmantegna6763,"Adam, I think that if you heat the roasting tray really hot before going in and add a the oil once hot, (as long as all your fries are touching the surface of it) you can get a pretty similar amount of crispiness shaving both time and olive oil by half.

@jasonday5143,"Seeing your videos, I have some advice for that exposure problem. I'm guessing you're on something humble but good. This one's a given, but you should drop your ISO down to the floor if you're worried about over exposing at any moment. If you're worried about the whites showing and appearing white, upping the contrast is a p easy interface in Resolve and Premiere. If that's already done, try reducing the shutter time. If it's still tied to framerates by default, you'll need a nice big card, but it'll be worth it if it rounds out your exposure in editing.  And a big tip that could potentially fix two problems if you have a better setup than I think: if you happen to have a manual aperture, increase the F-stop by a a few notches. Not only will it drop down those bright hot white overexposures, but it'll also make your depth of field bigger, that way your face doesn't go out of focus as often. You can focus to where you'll be standing and it'll typically give you some feet of travel distance before you go out of focus. The tracking autofocus is great for automated shots, but using this technique can make you not have to worry about how the technology processes you, and instead will give you a ""stage"" of room you can move around in.",5년 전,0,

Also jacket potato the British take on the baked potato, are the bomb.  I Americanized mine but turning them into potato footballs by cutting a lace pattern on the topside.  Otherwise just pop them in the oven at 400F for 2 hours.  What you will get is a baked potato with a crispy outside fluffy on the inside.  The best part you will most likely want to the whole potato as the crispy skin now has flavor not unlike a potato skin.  If you want to be fancy grease the tops with butter or cooking spray and sprinkle course salt over the top before cooking.  The salt will stick to the top when done.

@jesusisgod2953,"Matthew 11:15 KJV He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  Are you saved? Where will you go when you die? Heaven or hell?   The Gospel, which means the Good News is the news that God Almighty, the Creator came in the flesh as Jesus Christ to take away the sin of the world. The one God is a trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son came and laid down his own life to save ours.  His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for our redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. Although God's creation was created perfect, having no death, sickness and disease, the creation became corrupted through Adam and Eve in them disobeying God. In this rebellion the creation became fallen through the curse of sin and mankind became separated from God. This world is fallen, but God offers reconciliation to him through his provision at the cross. Ultimately God will restore his creation to perfection when he returns but those that who reject his offer of redemption will remain condemned by their sins and go to hell.   1 Timothy 3:16 KJV And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: GOD WAS MANIFEST IN THE FLESH, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.  John 1:1,14 KJV In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and THE WORD WAS GOD. [14] And THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH, and dwelt among us,  1 John 3:8 KJV He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.  Hebrews 2:14-16 KJV Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; [15] And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. [16] For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.  Isaiah 9:6 KJV For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty GOD, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.  John 1:10 KJV He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and THE WORLD KNEW HIM NOT.  John 20:28-29 KJV And Thomas answered and said unto him, MY LORD AND MY GOD. [29] Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.  Acts 16:30-31 KJV ...what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.  Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.  1 John 1:8-10 KJV If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. [9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. [10] If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.  GOD CREATED THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL PLANTS, ANIMALS AND THE FIRST TWO HUMANS (ADAM AND EVE)  IN SIX LITERAL 24- HOUR DAYS.

Genesis 3.3  ADAM AND EVE EAT THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT Genesis 3.6  ADAM AND EVE'S EYES WERE OPENED. THEY KNEW THEY WERE NAKED AND HID IN SHAME.  Genesis 3.7  ADAM AND EVE ATTEMPTED TO HIDE FROM GOD  Genesis 3.8  GOD CURSES THE DEVIL  Genesis 3.14  GOD PROPHESIES OF HIS REDEMPTION OF MAN AND THE DEFEAT OF THE DEVIL   Genesis 3.15  GOD MULTIPLIES THE WOMAN'S SORROW AND CONCEPTION AND HAS THE HUSBAND RULE OVER HER  Genesis 3.16   GOD CURSED THE GROUND FOR ADAM'S SAKE.

@Iulznazi," @aragusea  Hi Adam, I saw Ethan Chlebowski drop a video that talks about how he ""improves"" your recipe in terms of: taste, texture, time of cooking. Certain things I under stand (ex: not salting water because you prefer heterogeneity having flakes of salt finishing, or using olive oil instead of another oil that may cook faster, but the taste is not as great), but there are other things I'm curious about. Ethan mentions using vinegar to help with the rigidity of fries so they don't crumble.  I know you generally experiment and show several different ways of cooking, and I'm assuming you probably have experimented with doing various things along the way. Is there a reason you don't add vinegar to your boiling water? Or have you never thought of doing that?",3년 전,0,

@thehistoryandbooknerd8979,"I made these! Here are some notes!  - I used a smaller form of potato, and a whole bag of them, cut the same way Adam did his - this is something I wouldn’t fully recommend, as I ended up overcrowding my baking sheet pan. With this cooking method, these fries need space between each other!  - I used WAYYYY too much oil - wouldn’t recommend!!! It prevented the fries from crisping up properly, and the outside of the ones that actually did crisp up became more leathery than crispy, and impossible to chew - use VERY VERY LITTLE OIL! (Everything was incredibly oily, even after using the oil-removing method shown in the video - I didn’t have access to a paper bag to try that, and the fries were far too wet if I had possessed a paper bag)  - while boiling the potatoes, I ended up over boiling them a bit - for this specific potato (I believe Yukon golds? I cannot recall) they can take it a very little bit easier, but it was hard to get them into a single layer (due to overcrowding the pan) and they ended up having a lot of loose potato that sat in the middle  Overall, I wanna try again, following the recipe a lot closer. With this first attempt, I was very disappointed, but I recognize that I made mistakes with it and wanna try again in order to improve!   Any suggestions are welcome ❤",9개월 전,10,

(hassle being : u gotta take out the meat and drip tray to flip your tatoes, put back on and in the end you gotta make sure the meat juices have been either evaporated from the fries or sucked in without making them soggy. so you might have to cook them a little bit more after your roast is ready and resting.)",1년 전,0,

@272arshan,A couple of things:  You DO NOT NEED TO BOIL THEM for so long! Boiling them until they are so soft that they almost fall apart creates a potential hassle/disaster when transferring them to the sheet or flipping them! Boil until you can easily pierce with a fork and then turn them out! The innards will continue to soften and boil as they bake!  Salt the boil water! About a quarter teaspoon per potato. This does a few things: It imparts some basic flavor to them; They seem to soften up more quickly; They bake much more quickly and more consistently! This is the most important part.,1년 전,1,

@1873Winchester,"This is why we just use our deep frier. I honestly don't get your issues with home deep friers. As long as you got a powerful extraction system (in summer we use it outside)... It's been a super easy way to fry things and it's 20 minutes from start to finish for fries better than what you get from McDonalds and the like. And they don't require constant attention, use a timer. The oil is reusable too so we just leave it in until it gets too dark. It does get grimy over time though, so when I swap the oil I clean it with oven cleaner first, then soap and water.  Also tried frying in beef tallow which was different, gonna try lard soon.   Coconut fat too has been tried which was very good, I otherwise use coconut in a cast iron dutch oven to fry stuff like donuts. When done you just let it cool and invert the dutch oven and the solid 'cake' falls out, wrap in plastic and reuse later. That kinda solid fat might actually make a deep frier unneccessary since it makes cleanup so easy with just a cast iron pot. I really should try frying donuts in lard too.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@chrisdaniel1339,"The only thing the could this recipe/method better is cooking them in beef tallow or duck fat. Most do not realize their ovens can go up to 550°F or more which will literally fry anything coated in oil.

@Gallywomack,"If you can be bothered to peel and chop extra, you could try freezing these after the parboiling stage. That's what I sometimes do when doing roasties. Let them steam, then dust with a bit of flour and salt, bash them up in the pan so they'll be extra crunchy, then spread out on a baking tray with a sheet of baking/parchment paper and put them in the freezer. If you just bag them at this stage they'll all clump together. Once frozen they can be bagged up and then you can just chuck them straight into hot oil from the freezer next time you're doing a roast dinner.   Some people think I'm bonkers for doing this, but to my mind if you're peeling and chopping it's better and less wasteful to do a large batch and have some ready to go in future.",1년 전,0,

Fry each batch for about 5 min on 150°C. Toss them in a bowl with paper towels, and toss around to absorb excess fat. Then, let them rest for 30 min. Then fry them again on 185°C until golden brown (usually this means another 5 min, but it can differ between different types of potatoes and cut sizes). After the second frying, put them in a bowl with paper towels, toss them around to absorb most fat and then immediately sprinkle them generously with salt.

But my wedge interiors have not been as fluffy, and exteriors not as crunchy as I'd like, so I'm definitely going to incorporate the boiling step in the next batch. Your crunch sounds like breaking glass, and I am envious.  I've heard, elsewhere, that combining the olive oil with a cooking spray containing lecithin imparts an added crunch, but you can't prove it by me; I may not be doing it right.",2년 전,0,

@clivenorman2314,"Hey Adam, love your stuff. Sorry, this is long winded.  But this is not a critique of your content, but there are a few things that need clearing up. I'm not sure if it was yourself or your compatriot 'PreHome Cooks', or maybe neither of you, but definitely someone from N/America, stated, that GI's first had French fries, in Belgium during one of the wars. And of that I have no doubt. I first had French Fries in Holland when I was 13. And I'm British! How can that be I hear you say? Well in this video YOU have been cooking Chips, NOT French Fries. The GI's would know the difference, as they first landed and prepared for war in Britain. Now whether it was Britain in the Great War or Britain in WW2, the British eat Chips, and had you ever had a British Chip, from a Chip shop, you would definitely know the difference. Chips were a (and to a degree still are) staple for poor people back in the day, and were NEVER cooked in an oven, and the only crunchy bits were the scraps, that would be given away to young kids for nothing. The Chips were and still are to these days, quite soggy, and never crispy, and always large in cross section. So GI's would definitely know about Fish and Chips on Fridays (when the fishing boats returned), hence why, when they got to Belgium they experienced their first French Fries, which are far thinner and far much crisp than British Chips. McDonalds Fries are the nearest thing in the UK we have to French Fries, and they're nothing like Chips. What you refer to as Chips, we call Crisps, as the name describes them perfectly as Chips are not crisp.  Your Jamie Oliver Oven Chips, are a relatively recent innovation, back in the day ALL Chips were deep fried, no, forget back in the day, in fact to the present day, ALL proper Chips are deep fried, and definitely would not be described as crisp.  👍",3년 전,0,

@wlh227,I make them almost like you do.  My Uncle who was in the US Navy in the early 1950's learned how a make them while he was stationed on the General A E Anderson which was a troop transport ship.  Two small differences.  I steam the cut potatoes rather than boiling them and I use a large cast iron skillet with  lard for cooking them also at 450 F.  I will try it with olive oil as that would be a more healthy option.,3년 전,0,
@Lux_Parallax,"Aye brother. Not generally supposed to cook with extra virgin, very low burning point. And produces nasty carcinogens when it does.  Other tip for crunchier better chips/ fries. Soak them in water over night in the fridge with a tablespoon of glucose syrup.  Then boil and then you can dry them in the fridge and then freeze them to store. Or cook straight away like normal. Bit more labour intensive but a much sweeter nicer chip.",3년 전,0,

Time that you can spend on the rest of the meal.

@louisfain,"With an air fryer and an oil spray bottle I was able to get away with using just 1/2 teaspoon oil per potato. I sliced them a little thin so they cook faster but be careful handling them after boiling. The key is time. Find the right temperature on the air fryer so you get the desired in about 40 minutes. You want that long because you want to dehydrate the center. Sooner than 40, the surface will be crispy but the center is still mushy. You also want low fan speed, usually in “bake” mode on most models. Good luck.",3년 전,0,

@ziphy6314,"Hello everyone, I hope your having a great day so far. I just want to let you know that Jesus loves you all so very much, whither you believe that or not. I just want to share the gospel to you all if you don’t mind. But first off, I want you to know that it’s not by being a good person that gets us to heaven, because the Bible says that “for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God”, and that “none is righteous no not one” and that “all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags“. You see, the only way we can be justified and qualified to enter into heaven is through Christ Jesus. The gospel is this, that God out of his great love for you and me sent his only Son Jesus, who came as a man ( who was fully God and fully man) and took the penalty and the punishment of our sins by dying for our sins on the cross. And after his death on the cross, he was buried, and rose from the dead three days later. The gospel is simple to understand . It is of the saving of the soul. So what Jesus requires of you is to simply relay on what he did for you by believing and having faith in the gospel. You must relay on on what Jesus has done for you rather than your own goodness because he lived a sinless perfect life that you and I couldn’t. He was the only one cable of living up to Gods perfect standard of sinfulness, which we ourselves are incapable of. The Bible says that “he(God) is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance”. Repentance means to turn, to have a change of mind. So you must realize that you are a sinner and are in need of a savior and make a continuous decision to turn to God in faith by believing  the gospel and relaying  on what Jesus has done for you. I encourage you today to trust in the finished work of Jesus! And if you do this, then you will be saved and can know for sure that you will have eternal life and be in heaven  some day! There is no room for self righteousness in the context of one being able to enter into heaven, it’s all Jesus! The Bible describes salvation as a gift🎁 from God to you! Accept the gift🎁, it’s free! Make your decision today while your still alive and have breath in your lungs 🫁 , because trust me, many people are dying as of this moment and don’t have the luxury of having a second chance, unlike you. Life is short, but eternity is long! Where will your eternal home be? I hope you have a great rest of your day, God bless you all❤️‍🔥🖤!",3년 전,0,

Also, unlike deep fried fries which only take around 10 - 15 minutes to go from raw to crisp, these uselessly cook for a lot longer, soaking up a lot of that oil.  So, at the end you still end up biting into oily fries that you just spent two hours oven baking, instead of just deep frying them in far less time for the same result.  As a cook, I find this unnecessarily time consuming and not any better than deep fried for the amount of oil you ended up using in the process.",3년 전,0,

@mirshafie,"Okay so first off I'm really glad that you're promoting oven-roasting over deep-frying, and I'm enjoying your content, but I would suggest a quite different approach.  Oven-roasting can be done in 45 minutes flat, no boiling required. The secret is to just use a tiny amount of oil. Roast at 225 C for 40 mins total, and mix the strips twice during the roast: once at 15 mins and once at 35 mins. The result is crispy, golden-brown potato strips that are far superior to deep-frying, in the shortest amount of time and with the minimum amount of work and mess.  Here's the thing: if you don't use any oil at all, your potato strips will be baked instead of roasted, meaning that they swell up and get a smooth surface that doesn't absorb any salt. You get a completely different dish, which is not necessarily bad, but it's just not what we associate with a burger. And if you use too much oil, you get soggy potato strips and you have to cook for a really long time to make up for it. The Goldilocks zone is about 2 tea(!)spoons of oil per 400 grams of potatoes, which is way less than you think. You'll be thinking that you didn't even cover your potatoes with the thinnest film of oil. But trust me, this works.  So: Heat your oven to 225 C. Cut your potatoes into strips (5 mm wide, skins on). Let the strips dissipate some moisture for about 2-3 minutes, but do not let them sit for more than 5 minutes in the cut-up state, as they will start to oxidize and turn gray and disgusting). Add the oil, about 2 teaspoons for 400 g of potatoes, and mix. I think neutral oil is a given, rapeseed is king. Put them in the hot oven, and let them sit for ~15 mins before mixing again -- this is necessary to prevent the strips from sticking to the pan. Getting the first mixing right is crucial, so the first few times you make this recipe you might want to pay some extra attention here, as it's easy to mess up before you get a feeling for it.  At the 35 minute mark, it's time for the second mix. Your potato strips should be golden but not golden-brown. Add powdered salt (just regular salt that you've ground up with mortar and pestle, and not too much), and mix again. The second round of mixing helps with consistency across the batch. Once the strips are starting to turn golden-brown, take them out and serve -- do not let them go beyond this point as the burnt flavor will set in before the strips actually look burnt. If you're not ready to serve, you should turn off/down the heat and let them cook on the residual after the 35 minute mark -- that will allow you some time to finish whatever else you're doing and the potatoes won't suffer markedly for it.   If you try this, let me know what you think.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@injunsun,"@Adam Ragusea , it's funny, you complaining about the smell of frying oil. If they made candles or air fresheners that were French fry scented, I'd buy them. I love the lingering scent of the smells of good food.  As for not being able to cook anything else while deep-frying... I don't understand. If you know how long your frying will take, and you own a stove with more than one burner, and have more than one pan, you can easily time when to throw on something simple that could pair with the fries, such as burgers; even easier if they are the Vegan pre-cooked ones, as those can be toasted or microwaved.you Similarly, when I do oven fries, I just wait till they're mostly done, then throw my faux meat on the same baking sheet to crisp up. I did wonder why you didn't boil your deep fried potatoes, as you did here. I compost my cooking oil after a few uses. It has enough time by the time it's been turned a few times to become just another carbon compound the pill bugs, millipedes, and worms will turn into poop. I do tend to prefer oven roasted, tho. Oven fries do end up less greasy, with less calories, plus, I season them before or during cooking with dried herbs, maybe onion or garlic powder.  Anyway, different strokes, I guess.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@CrimeVid,"There’s a basic misconception involved with your view of chips.  That is that they should be crispy. They should not.  Chips for Fish and Chips should be still be bendy, a light golden colour and taste like the batter on the fish, lightly of beef dripping.  I do not mind crispy chips with a steak but would rather have french bread.   Now then, listen,  the right chip  starts with a good potato King Edward say, peeled yabazza ! put them through a chip cutter ( 1/2”) straight into water with a little white vinegar. they’ll be happy there for hours. When you  want them, just rinse and drain. Deep fry in either beef dripping or mix with some lard. If you are afraid of deep frying, fair enough do something else, but you’ll never have decent chips, Some guys blanch chips in the fat, let them cool until wanted and then go again, I never trusted those fryers, a good fish and chip shop  had to run almost constantly from 12:00 till about 20:30, longer in the bigger towns, No time for messing about !",3년 전,0,

@famshars2389,What do porous exteriors achieve?,3년 전,10,
@billsoo306," @famshars2389  Porosity increases surface area. More surface area means more exposure to hot oil (if deep frying) or air (if baking) to improve the crispness and crunch. The potato loses more water, quicker.",3년 전,78,
@billsoo306," @Mason_M_L  Not exactly....they do similar things, but by totally different methods. Adding baking soda raises the pH and causes the exterior of the fry to break down. You get more surface area which leads to more crunch, especially with oven baking. Vinegar lowers the pH and helps the fry stick together. It holds it's shape better and can be cooked longer especially when deep frying. The longer cook time increases crispiness. When deep frying baking soda fries, there is more risk of the fry disintegrating it's outer layers so you don't cook it as long. This isn't an issue when baking in the oven.  It's crazy that raising and lowering pH can both lead to crispier fries.",3년 전,38,

@crystalanimosity2374,can I still use some vinegar if using baking soda?,2년 전,0,
@billsoo306," @crystalanimosity2374  Yes, assuming you mean for eating the fries after they are cooked. The job of the baking soda is to raise the pH in the water when they boil. Not much (if any) is absorbed into the fries themselves so adding vinegar afterwards will have no effect.  If you meant add vinegar to the boiling water, then no. Some people do that because it does the opposite. It lowers the pH and makes the potato exterior firmer and less porous. This is great if you are making potato chips since the thin slices hold together better. And to be fair, some people like to do this with fries as well. But basically, when cooking, you have to pick one or the other, not both.",2년 전,0,

@billsoo306, @crystalanimosity2374  That is true. Baking soda will break down the fry which is the point. The mushy surfaces then crisp up much better in the oil. Vinegar will prevent it from breaking down so you could could it longer and not worry about overcooking. So just pick which one is better for you.,2년 전,0,

@juliantotriwijaya9208,"I kinda regret makkng this because it simply did not reach my expectation and standard of how fried potatoes should have taste like. It feelt like time wated to me because it took so long to cook, so little, and it's doesn't even taste that good, sure it's crispy but it's too dry, it's bot fluffy enough inside, it felt like eating air with some faint seasoning as even the seasoning does not seep it well, why? Because it's too dry by the time it's done :( There is a balance, you don't want it to be flacid/not crispy, but you also don't want it to be too crispy and dry like the one from this video. Also he said you supposed to eat it with another food as an accompaniment type of dish and not alone right? Well bruh the process took too long, other dishes I made already finish way long before the fry is done, we already started and finished eatinh first, we would starve waiting for this a memere french fry to finish. I mean what? A plate of french fry? Seriously? Just a tray? For that long? Bruh, I have 4 family, one tray of potato is not enough, and the cooking time bing that long only for so little makes it not worth it for all the trouble, the taste is not perfect too, too dry!  Edit: I'm sorry I just have to say it, I have a Huge dissapointment with this recepie/methood of making french fries. It feels like a life and energy waster, when you cook to feed yourself or the family, cook it fast because you are starving, this is too slow.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@ChristianFS1,"I seriously cannot over-emphasize how much a bit of baking soda helps with regards to crispiness, it really does work wonders. Just add a small teaspoon to the water in which you leave the cut potatoes (whichever way you prefer) whilst cutting the rest, and another teaspoon to the water in which you boil them.   Afterwards just give them a good shake in a bowl with some oil until they've been slightly beat up on the surface, such that they are all coated in their own paste. Finally, put them on a baking sheet and into the oven (perhaps 220c/ 420 fahrenheit or more) until they're crispy to your liking.",4년 전(수정됨),5,

The oil is bubbling, easy to monitor without going over. gonna be nice and crispy when I bump everything up at the end for 20 minutes or so. I am excited.

@vin9916,"I suppose this is more of a techniques than a recipe. Take whatever potatoes you want. Peel them, or don't. Cut them into fry-like shapes, being sure to get roughly equal thickness, and cut them maybe twice as thick as you want them — they'll shrink a lot during cooking. I do one large Russet potato per person. Boil them until you're afraid they're going to fall apart — I do about eight minutes. Gently drain them and lay them on a pan wide enough to hold them all in a single layer. Drizzle on enough oil to thoroughly coat all the pieces. Shake the pan to coat the pieces and get the fries evenly distributed.   Roast at 450ºF. Check on them after 45 minutes — add more oil if they look dry, and move around any pieces that seem to be cooking unevenly. Roast them some more until they're brown and crispy, maybe another 45 minutes. Be careful not to overcook them — very brown will taste burned. You can pull them when they're still a little floppy, because they will harden as they cool. The ones I made in the video are just a bit overcooked.  Place kitchen towel or a couple layers of paper towel in a large bowl, and dump the fries in. Let the towel soak up the excess oil, and then whip it out. Season the fries in the bowl and then toss. I use coarse salt, pepper, garlic powder, chopped cilantro and grated parmesan.  MY COOKING PHILOSOPHY: I don't like weighing or measuring things if I don't have to, and I don't like to be constantly checking a recipe as I cook. I don't care that volume is a bad way of measuring things — it's usually easier. I like for a recipe to get me in the ballpark, and then I like to eyeball and improvise the rest. If you're like me, my goal with these videos is to give you a sense of how the food should look and feel as you're cooking it, rather than give you a refined formula to reproduce.  Q: What do you mean you devised this recipe? I've seen this before. A: Cool! I haven't seen another recipe that applies the par-boiled roastie technique to a fry shape, but I'm not at all surprised to hear that others exist. There's nothing new under the sun. But I did work out the particulars of this one on my own. Totally possible I just reinvented the wheel. Still good fries, though!  Q: Have you thought about adding baking soda to the water to make the outside more crispy? A: No, but I'm intrigued. Alkalinity helps with browning. I will say, however, that I'm not sure I would want to accelerate the browning process on these. The interior needs a long cooking time in order to get really soft and fluffy, and I wouldn't want the exterior to get overly brown while I'm cooking the interior. Really dark brown on these tastes burned.  Q: Have you thought about roughing up the fries a bit before they go in the oven to get more fluffy exterior that'll go crisp in oil? A: That works great with a more conventional roast potato shape, but these long thin shapes are really delicate when they first go in the roasting tray. That little shake I give them is about all the trauma they can take at that stage.  Q: What's up with that thumbnail? A: I thought it was funny and intriguing! (And yeah, maybe I thought it could draw the ASMR crowd...)  Q: Have you thought about using a slotted pan? A: I'm intrigued, but would't the oil drip out the bottom? We need that oil.  Q: What's up with you having ads now? A: A man has to make a living for his family. Also, Squarespace really is good. http://squarespace.com/ragusea  Q: What's up with two ad breaks per video? A: The particular format of the ads is negotiated on a case-by-case basis with the sponsor. You'll see a different format in next week's recipe. Personally, I like this format, because it discloses the sponsorship arrangement right off the bat, but then gives you some more content before you get to the main ad body.  Q: Why was your first talking-head shot out of focus? A: I shoot by myself, and the talking-head shots are tough. I had my camera on face-tracking autofocus, I could see on the monitor that it had zero'd in on my face, but it's not possible for me to see on a tiny monitor halfway across the room if the shot really is in focus. Between this and my day job, I really don't have time to go back and fix stuff unless it's a real disaster. I'm learning every video, though, and I think it'll all keep getting better. The entire reason I started making cooking videos in the first place was to work on my video skills. I'm still pretty new to the medium.  Q: Why were some of your shots over-exposed? A: I'm still really struggling with how to light and expose for white ingredients. I'm working on it. Everything looks overexposed on the cheap field monitor I'm using, so that's no help. I've tried using the level meter, but the black table and the white plates just seem to throw it off.",4년 전,0,

@mattandrews8528,"I do something similar, but no boil, still works though, I cut my potatoes into similar thickness and size, but I put my potatoes in a pan with 50/50 vegetable oil to olive oil, not a ton just say around tablespoon past what it takes to coat the pan so once you add and mix the potatoes around their all sufficiently covered and you don’t have a ton of excess unnecessary oil, this is no deep fry method. So I like the taste of the blend of oil and hey it’s cheaper. Now the same company that makes the classic Rooster sriracha saucer also makes this little container of a garlic chili sauce, that’s awesome stuff and is definitely needed here so get that, I put about a half to full teaspoon in with the oil and potatoes. Along with that I add garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, a little cumin, a little ground mustard powder, and a little cayenne pepper, some thyme/oregano/rosemary, and finally add some salt of choice and fresh ground black pepper. Mix that all up with the oil so the potatoes are evenly coated with the seasoning on low-medium heat with the lid covered until they start to get soft and the skin wants to peel away, get your oven preheated to 350-365 and put them in there on a wire rack above a tray to catch the oil and hold that rack until they get crunchy golden brown. When you take them out liberally salt to help act as a desiccant, it only adds to the crunchiness they won’t get too salty as fries, trust me.   Now let’s talk sauce real quick. I use a mix of whatever Mayo you like, Heinz ketchup, and just a small touch several drops of some regular rooster brand sriracha mixed together as a dipping sauce. I honestly never make “home fries” any other way now at home, and there’s no frying these fries either unless you count the pan sautéing, which I don’t. So enjoy some very flavorful fries, they make for a perfect side dish to go with many different main dish proteins of choice. 👍 try em and comment back if you love em as much as I do.",4년 전,0,

@jesusisgod2953,"Matthew 11:15 KJV He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  Are you saved? Where will you go when you die? Heaven or hell?   The Gospel, which means the Good News is the news that God Almighty, the Creator came in the flesh as Jesus Christ to take away the sin of the world. The one God is a trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son came and laid down his own life to save ours.  His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for our redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. Although God's creation was created perfect, having no death, sickness and disease, the creation became corrupted through Adam and Eve in them disobeying God. In this rebellion the creation became fallen through the curse of sin and mankind became separated from God. This world is fallen, but God offers reconciliation to him through his provision at the cross. Ultimately God will restore his creation to perfection when he returns but those that who reject his offer of redemption will remain condemned by their sins and go to hell.   1 Timothy 3:16 KJV And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: GOD WAS MANIFEST IN THE FLESH, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.  John 1:1,14 KJV In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and THE WORD WAS GOD. [14] And THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH, and dwelt among us,  1 John 3:8 KJV He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.  Hebrews 2:14-16 KJV Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; [15] And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. [16] For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.  Isaiah 9:6 KJV For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty GOD, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.  John 1:10 KJV He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and THE WORLD KNEW HIM NOT.  John 20:28-29 KJV And Thomas answered and said unto him, MY LORD AND MY GOD. [29] Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.  Acts 16:30-31 KJV ...what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.  Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.  1 John 1:8-10 KJV If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. [9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. [10] If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.  GOD CREATED THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL PLANTS, ANIMALS AND THE FIRST TWO HUMANS (ADAM AND EVE)  IN SIX LITERAL 24- HOUR DAYS. GOD CREATED THE EARTH AS A GLOBAL PARADISE, THERE WAS NO DEATH, SICKNESS OR DISEASE. MAN LIKE ALL OF THE ANIMALS ATE VEGETATION. ALL WAS PERFECT.  Genesis 1-2  GOD CREATED ADAM, THE FIRST MAN OUT OF DUST  Genesis 2.7,  GOD COMMANDS ADAM NOT TO EAT FROM THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL BECAUSE, THE TREE WILL BRING DEATH  Genesis 2:16-17  GOD MAKES EVE, THE FIRST WOMAN FROM ADAM'S RIB    Genesis 2.18-23  ADAM AND EVE WERE NAKED AND NOT ASHAMED Genesis 2.25    THE DEVIL APPEARS TO EVE AS A SNAKE AND CAUSES HER TO DOUBT GOD'S WORD  Genesis 3:1  THE DEVIL LIES, TO EVE AND SAYS THAT THEY WILL NOT DIE IF THEY TAKE FROM THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT.  Genesis 3.3  ADAM AND EVE EAT THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT Genesis 3.6  ADAM AND EVE'S EYES WERE OPENED. THEY KNEW THEY WERE NAKED AND HID IN SHAME.  Genesis 3.7  ADAM AND EVE ATTEMPTED TO HIDE FROM GOD  Genesis 3.8  GOD CURSES THE DEVIL  Genesis 3.14  GOD PROPHESIES OF HIS REDEMPTION OF MAN AND THE DEFEAT OF THE DEVIL   Genesis 3.15  GOD MULTIPLIES THE WOMAN'S SORROW AND CONCEPTION AND HAS THE HUSBAND RULE OVER HER  Genesis 3.16   GOD CURSED THE GROUND FOR ADAM'S SAKE. THORNS AND THISTLES WERE BROUGHT FORTH  Genesis 3.17   THE HUMAN BODY WILL RETURN TO DUST  Genesis 3.19  GOD CLOTHED ADAM AND EVE  Genesis 3.21   GOD DROVE ADAM AND EVE OUT OF THE GARDEN   Genesis 22-24  THROUGH ADAM, CONDEMNATION CAME UPON ALL MEN AND ALL BECAME SINNERS.  Romans 5.18-19   GOD, THE CREATOR TAKEN ON FLESH AND ENTERED THE WORLD AS JESUS CHRIST  GOD REDEEMS MANKIND  John 10.11, Isaiah 53, Psalm 49.15  John 1.1-14  WHOEVER BELIEVES ON CHRIST HAS ETERNAL LIFE, THOSE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE ARE CONDEMNED ALREADY  John 3:15-20   THOSE THAT DENY THAT GOD CAME IN THE FLESH ARE ANTICHRIST  1 John 4.3, John 1.1-14, John 20.28, 2 John 2.7  THOSE THAT DENY THE FATHER AND SON ARE ANTICHRIST  1 John. 2.22  THE ONE GOD IS A TRINITY OF THE FATHER, THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT  Matthew 28.19, 1 John 5.7  SALVATION IS IN CHRIST ALONE  Acts 4:12, Psalm 45.22",4년 전,0,

@oilybohunk,Here's a tip. You don't have to boil them as long. Just add a teaspoon of baking soda to the water. That will make the water alkaline and it will break down the potato cell walls and get you that fluffy exterior you want without boiling as long and risk them breaking.,4년 전,36,

@Craynz," @Evira8686  didn't find a proper paper talking about it without digging to deep. but acids prevent breakdown of pectin in starch containing vegetables, while bases accelerate the breakdown of the pectin. By accelerating the breakdown of the pectin, you significantly increase the surface area of the starch granule in the potato. The result is a crispy outside with a really fluffy inside (if fried, baking might result in the outside being to dark while the inside isn't done yet). Compare that to an acidic solution. The starch granule is much more intact, giving a firmer interior texture while still maintaining a crispy exterior. It also prevents browning during frying.",3년 전,1,

@mawlakewlz,"Adam, there's an interesting aspect of measuring that you may want to address, not on its own, but just in an appropriate video.  You might describe it as the ""flavor vs chemistry"" aspect of cooking.  I've noticed that people in your comments often so if they can adjust the amount of certain ingredients, and from watching your videos I know your general sheet is ""you do you"", if you want more salt, put more in, is your taste that matters.  But in some recipes certain ratios of ingredients can produce different effects of the ingredients react chemically, like if you're using yeast.  So for certain recipes there more at stake than taste. If you're making a souffle you probably have to have a pretty careful measure of ingredients to make it work right. (Maybe not, just trying to think of examples. You know what I mean I think.)  So maybe you should mention how to tell when adjusting quantities of ingredients could actually affect the success of the result, and when it's just a matter of taste. You do I sometimes you I don't think you explicitly say this.  Just a suggestion.  Thanks, Djent!",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Higher than that & it will start smoking very good if you wanna get cancer. Do people really think ur fancy if using olive oil for everything? Just use proper Colza oil (in glas bottles if u care for environment) or a good sunflower oil. Olive Oil is good for pasta salads or low temperature roasting or as a topping on roasted bread etc. Jamie Oliver is only a TV cook and keeps spreading this Olive oil abuse.

Massage the fries and oil to get them full coated.  You can get away with using 10 grams of oil for four large Russets.  Now, here is the neat trick.

@sunsetorange89,"If you add cold oil to the hot potato, it then soaks in and ends up soggy and oily tasting. Probably why it took an hour and a half to get them crispy.   Always preheat your oil in the roasting pan. When you add the chips/roast potatoes you want to hear a sizzle. Same logic as deep frying, you would never add anything to a cold deep fryer.   You can also flavour your oil with garlic cloves and rosemary for a classic roast potato or just garlic and some chilli flakes works well with chips.   After draining the potatoes. Let them sit on the conter or a cooling rack for 5 minutes. The steam will dry them out. You can carefully pat them dry with kitchen paper too. This means your working with a dry potato before adding to hot oil and you will get extra crispiness and no splatter. Nothing wet crisps up easily.

@TheRM23to25,"Okay, so I just tried this tonight with a few modifications. Here are my thoughts: 1st: Be Careful About Oven Time. The way Adam words the oven time makes it feel like you can go do something else entirely and forget about the fries for a little bit. I got distracted and did just that. The fries needed to be flipped for me at just about 20 minutes. 2nd: I Used Baking Soda. I don't know why, but I did some research on this and found that using baking soda in the boiling water with some salt will really help the inner texture of the fry. I used about 3/4 tsp of baking soda and a fair amount of salt. Overall this recipe is super good. Would totally recommend it 👌",4년 전(수정됨),388,

@jakestewart5899,"I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.   1. What do you think happens to someone after they die? 2. Do you think there is an afterlife?  3. If heaven exists, how do you get there?  4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?   Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person:    1. How many lies have you told in your whole life?  2. Have you ever stolen?  3. Have you ever used God's name in vain? 4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust?  5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day?  6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?   The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell?    2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us.    What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus.    When are you going to do that?

If you ever go to Britain with your family in the future, please get them to try sausages, chips, and beans. We also serve them with fish or calamari rings. They're much better in Britain because they come from Britain. I'm just recommending them to you because they are so good, and as a Brit myself, they are one of my all-time favourite foods.

Just chuck the spuds in the hot oil and leave in the oven, turn occasionally until done. British cooking is often about simplicity (laziness).",5년 전,1,

@user-le8ul4nr5t,"without any particular order: - I do eat just fries as a meal, and tons of people do. Otherwise the fritkot next to my school would have way less success. - You typically fry them at the very last minute, so they stay warm. You prepare the rest of the meal in advance, The only case where this might not be possible is if you want a rare steak, in this case you can ask someone to cook either the stake or the fries, or leave the steak in a warm place so it doesn't cool too much. - True fries are never this roasted. If you look at fries, they have a golden color with only smaller fries being brown. Also most thick cut fries aren't this crunchy, so someone who really likes crunchy fries will probably like this recipe better. - You can easily fry 4 servings worth of potato in a single home sized frier, I do it all the time, sometimes for more than 4 people. The only thing is you might have to do multiple servings, everybody takes some fries and takes some more later. - True fries are cooked twice so the inside is soft and the exterior is crunchy. On top of that, they are made in grease, not oil, this affects the taste of the fries. - If you do use oil (It's way easier to find) don't use olive oil. It's a kind of fancy oil and the taste doesn't go well with fries.",5년 전,0,

@TurtleMC1993,Respect bro but 3 things you can do if you want them even crispier and fluffier inside . 1. Slow boil the potatoes in salted water (salt extracts moisture and the slow boil will get you right to the point where they are nearly falling apart and the potato will be alot softer in the middle) 2. Let the potatoes cool all the way after boiling before putting them into smoking... 3. HOT oil.   Like your seasoning as well,5년 전,0,

@ivetterodriguez1994," @yeright4625  In Christianity the consensus seems to lie between ""don't drink at all"" and ""don't drink too much"" amongst different denominations and congregations.  But the idea is to not get drunk so using it in food where it will evaporate or in bakery goods where it won't be enough to even get you tipsy is arguably fine. The idea is that we should only be filled with the Holy Spirit and that we should always be vigilant and aware of our doings and selves.  But with other Judeo-Christian principles such as pork, circumcision, and shellfish there's much more leeway because it's old testament law given to the jews or rather, hebrews, specifically. It's not as strictly observed if at all in the western world amongst Christians.  Although, it's really interesting to look into the practical reasons of ""God forbids this"" and ""God demands that"". Circumcision is believed to have become a thing because in hot climates there's less access to clean water for hygiene and thus infections can come easy. And pork well, it was really risky to eat slightly raw because pigs eat dirty and there can easily be parasites and bacteria that can lead to serious sickness. Before we could know for sure if the pork was done you either risked it, didn't eat it, or purposely overcooked it by itself or in a sauce.",4년 전,2,

I only got some crispy fries though because because it was my first time cutting potatoes and they where very very very uneven.  I used Yukon Golds  I also didn’t have olive oil. I only had vegetable oil. It worked well though, real tasty!  I watched this one dude with a really cool beard do some things to your recipe that would help, so I added apple cider vinegar to the water and it didn’t fall apart as easily!  Next time I’ll make my fries smaller and more even. I will also try to buy olive oil or peanut oil!  When my dad comes home in a week (he’s in military.

@user-le8ul4nr5t,"Hey dude, really cool to see you getting intrusted in cooking (-; If you ever get the chance to do it, here is one of my favourite recipe, though it might be hard to find some of the ingredients outside of Belgium:  stir together ground beef and pork, finely minced onion, salt, pepper, parsley, 2 eggs, white bread without the crust and mixed with milk (it will make the meatballs extra soft). form the meatballs and place them on a baking sheet, they should be roughly the size of your fists (those are some big meatballs, but that's how they're done) cook at arround 100°c until they are lightly browned.  in the mean time, cook some finely sliced onions with some butter in a large pot. Once the onions are cooked add some ""sirop de Liège"" ( the hard to find ingredient ) and caramelize the onions, once the sirup is liquid, add some vinegar, either some water or some beer ( beer is the traditional option, but I usually go for water ), salt, pepper and raisins.  When the meatballs are cooked, add them to the sauce you just made and cook them for a bit more, making sure they are covered in sauce.  Serve with thick cut fries, mayonaise (on the side) and optionally salad.  This meal is called ""Boulet sauce lapin"" (litterally boulder with rabbit sauce) and it's a specialty from the south of Belgium. The recipe seems kind of weird at first sight, but it's really good ;-) Also use starchy potatoes for your fries, that makes the interior fluffy when you cook them.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

Just cut them up nice & thick. 2..Don't add them to cold water before boiling..boil the water 1st & add plenty of salt. 3..While your spuds are boiling, cover your baking tray with olive oil & add a little garlic salt & pre heat the tray in the oven. Drain your fries, cover for 5 mins to make them sweat. Cook them in the oven on high heat for around 35 mins , then add chopped onion and peppers in the last 7 minutes. Bliss.",5년 전,0,

The best fries were the ones that were the least crispy.  I realized the goal should be to hit the right balance of crispy and fluffy.  Crispy on the outside for the texture, fluffy on the inside for the contrast and the actual potato taste. The fries that are roasted all the way through lack both of those things.

@stevesmith2373,"A good recipe. I made the following alterations. Firstly I boiled the potatoes for 20 minutes in their skins. Then I peeled them using my fingers (search Youtube on how to do this). Then I refrigerated them for about an hour in order for them to get firmer but also to develop resistant starch which has been shown to be vital in gut health. Then cut them into strips and baked them as you described. My total baking time was about an hour after a turn at 45 min. Ideally, I'd increase the time in the fridge--do them a day before.

What worked for us and our oven was to lightly coat the potatoes in EVOO and cook at 425 degrees instead of 450 for only 30 minutes, flip and then cook for an additional 15 minutes.

@simonabbott7323," @yee7849  UK TV signals can be picked by any suitably positioned antenna and relayed to a TV. They are not encoded. There are many commercial TV channels broadcast in the UK, along with BBC channels. The commercial channels pay their way with advertising, but the BBC insists you buy a ""TV Licence"", whatever channels you watch. If you do not watch TV at all you do not need to buy a TV licence, but you are hounded by the company, implying you are breaking the law and they send letters threatening action. You can lawfully own a TV without buying a licence as they are able to receive radio, which you can listen to without having to buy a licence. However, so-called inspectors will visit properties unannounced and try to snoop through windows to see if there is a TV in the house. There is much intimidation and threats, as the company wants to frighten as many people as possible (even those that don't need a licence) to pay for one. Many people consider it extortion and believe the BBC should encode their signals so that IF you want to watch the BBC, you subscribe to it. Much like other products and services. The BBC are terrified that if their traditional funding (ie income from the TV licence) is cut off and people have to subscribe, that their income will plummet and they will have to cut back on their services.",5년 전,76,

The BBC higher-ups do not 'profit' from the TV licenses, they are salaried just like any government employee and revenue is put back into the BBC (those planet earth docs are expensive).    @Simon Abbott is being a bit hyperbolic with the consequences of not paying. I have never had a TV license except the few times it was included in my rent and the worst I've had is 1 or 2 letters over a year telling me if I was using the TV I had to pay. I just ignore the letters and never hear from them again.   I think there probably was a time where this was taken more seriously but now with the sheer number of ways you can use a TV WITHOUT plugging in a satellite cable make it impossible to prove anything by looking through a window or whatever.

The end result is not as crispy as with the oven, though, but it takes a lot less time. I wonder if you could just boil them about half the time, then freeze them and end them in the oven whenever you need them.",5년 전,0,

@bloodypommelstudios7144,"They look amazingly crispy and awesome idea for seasoning! I do a similar thing with a couple of small differences. Chop the potatoes in to thick chips and boil for 11 minutes starting from cold then drain and place in a large mixing bowl.  Add oil, you really don't need much, maybe 2 tablespoons though I never measure  Sometimes I add powdered seasoning here, (smoked paprika or curry powder are two of my favorites), I also add a bit of salt, I think this absorbs water on the surface and helps them crisp. Gently toss until the chips are coated, unlike stirring this rarely breaks the chips if you didn't overboil or cut too finely but will roughen the surface aiding in crisping them up. Bake in the oven like your method. Add any other seasoning you want and serve up, there shouldn't be any left over oil if you didn't use too much earlier..",5년 전,0,

Jamie Oliver is wrong, no matter how loveable you think he is, America.

Another problem is that uncontrolled browning has potential to generate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from fats more so than frying does. I would go for properly fried potatoes. If I would like to avoid all that fat then I would roast the potatoes after coating them with a mixture of gelatinized starch and a table spoonful of oil.

@Aaronn14,"I’ll try my best to help you, here’s my method  Peel (not necessary) , chop your potatoes into whatever French fry shape you desire.  Whilst cutting, preheat your oven to 200°C or 392F. I know it’s quite early but by time we’re ready it will be preheated.  Now when you’ve turned the oven on, start boiling the kettle or boiling water in a saucepan. Then when the kettle is done, pour the water into the saucepan, or if your water is boiled, and add a generous amount of salt, and keep the heat on max (I’m not saying boil water in the kettle and saucepan, I’m just assuming you own a kettle, it’s a lot quicker to heat up water).   Get your French fires, and place them in for 7 minutes exactly. Now, while they’re boiling, get some oil of your choice, I use sunflower spray , and smear it around the tray, then, drain the water via colander or any other method. As soon as they’re drained, place them on the tray straight away, don’t dry them or move them into another bowl, then put more oil on top of them, making sure they can move around  and don’t get stuck Lower the temp down to 180°C or 356°F, and check the chips in cycles of 15 mins, 10mins, 10mins, 5mins. And use oil where you think is necessary. As you don’t have a roasting tray they won’t turn out like the video, but I’ve made them like this for months and I based my recipe around this video, and I’ve tried both and I think the tray way is a lot better : healthier.  Let me know if this helps :)",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@mfimh0901,"Hey, I'm a Brit, and I've worked as a chef. You'll half your cooking time, half the shrinkage, and half the oil used if you put the tray with oil in a hot oven (200-220C) for 5 mins before adding the chips. Dry them on a towel after boiling and toss into hot oil. Turn with a metal slotted spatula (we call them a fish slice, don't know if anyone else does). A cold pan and cold oil and wet chips takes about 30 minutes to get to frying stage, the outside will bake firm before that, and will necessitate long baking to crisp, hence the shrinkage (they will tend to be hollow too). Hot oil looses viscosity and coats much more easily, meaning you need less. Also, traditional British fries (and roast potatoes) are cooked in beef dripping, which is cheaper.",5년 전,0,

On that note I'd also pre heat the oil in the baking tray before actually combining with the ""fries"" This is a similar approach that McDonald's use on their ""fries"" but instead of using the natural starch within the potato they coat it with a glucose solution which chemically is pretty much the same thing as starch.

One thing some people do is put the oil in FIRST, and heat it up until it starts to pop, then, you take out the tray, throw the fries in, quickly rough 'em up, and the jumping oil will soak the fries naturally. If you REALLY wanna make these the absolute dogs bollocks, as we would say, then 10 minutes before it's ready, throw in a few cloves of garlic (peeled or not, no worries) and a big twig of rosemary.

@yyguuyg,"These are most definitely more caloric than deep fried fries. Potatoes submerged into hot fryer oil almost instantly creates a barrier of cooked potato on the outside of the fries that keeps more oil from seeping into the interior of the fries. This method definitely does not quickly form a protective outer layer which means that the potatoes are going to soak up a lot more oil and therefore be greasier and more caloric. I'm not complaining, these look delicious and I will absolutely try this next time I make fries. But saying they are no more caloric than deep fried fries is just plain wrong.",5년 전,0,

@PolarTitan,"There is another recipe I use that makes super crispy fries. Though usually works better with thinner fries which is great when you want to have more of them from a single potato.   So my recipe:  Cut potatos, soak in water for about 15-30 minutes after cutting.  use Olive Oil and Cook on a Pan until some of the fries start to brown just a tiny bit.  Then you take the fries out and then you freeze them for about an hour and a half.  After this you cook them at 8 minute intervals with oven at 425 degrees F. Flipping them every 8 minutes.   After that you can choose what you want to do. You can season them with Garlic salt and Pepper, Just plan Kosher Salt and Pepper, or cover them in cheese and bake them for another couple minutes and have cheesy fries. Any is good.",5년 전,0,
@leftofpunk,"I get you're over 8000 comments deep on this successful video, but America's Test Kitchen just did an episode with oven fries you might be interested in. They cover the raw potatoes in a reduced corn starch slurry (it's a paste at that point) put then in a covered baking sheet with cooking spray and oil at the bottom for about 15 minutes to steam them. They remove the foil cover and do another 15 minutes, turn them once and then another 15 minutes (425 on lowest rack). The corn starch really crisp'd them up and total time was less than an hour.

@ryanbonner25,"key mistakes - drain potatoes in a collender for five to ten mins, to let 'steam-dry'. there was too much moisture in your oven (people also encounter moisture problems when they roast their potatoes with their meat and dont know why they are taking so long to roast, and then wonder why they taste burnt). you really want a hot, dry oven achieve the desired crispiness - even the small crunchy pieces should taste delicious, not burnt.  use less oil [you dont have to pour it all over them to begin with, you're going to be tossing them in it, while they roast anyway, and oil spits and splatters]. you dont want your mouth to be coated in oil.i prefer animal (goose) fat - it works better, is tastier and easier on the guts, especially for certain people.",5년 전,0,

@jeffelliot8064,"With that much oil, youre literally just slow frying them in the oven, which clearly results in a greasy fry. The reason FRIES are FRIED at a high temperature is so the crusting happens quickly after the initial moisture loss (even when double frying as at first the water escaping prevents too much oil from penetrating the food). Cooking slowly in oil just gives the food time to absorb oil through the cooking process. Id wager these are actually less healthy than if you fried them.

@drankclaw2095,"Something I learned in my year and a half of living in london is that the COLANDER IS REALLY IMPORTANT! Because when you dump them out, some of them do break and that's fine because they create a mashed potato-like layer around the other potatoes, it's more of that crispiness. Also I've noticed before they roast them in the oven, in the colander (or you could use your method, but after draining the water) give them a good shake, nto too rough, but just enough that one or two may tumble, you will literally see that mash-like layer forming around them as they gently bump into each other. This helps them get super crispy in less time. I just find it more efficient! And could be worth looking into more. I definitely know it makes them crispier every time I've done it, but I live in Lebanon now where we kinda only have one kind of potato at supermarkets (not counting sweet potato, which is just one other type we find) so I'm not sure how well it works with all potatoes - but it works incredibly well with the potatoes we have here.",5년 전,1,

Add to plastic bag and freeze overnight. Preheat oven, fan forced, to hotter than cake temperature but below pizza temperature. Paper-lined baking sheet, or my personal preference a cast iron pan. Grape seed oil for high smoke point neutral, or canola if you're so inclined. Cook from frozen for 20 mins, turn once, then increase temperature and add flavored oil of your choosing.

@shreddernation1096,I could see all the oil oozing out of the chip you bit into. If anything these are about 3x worse for you than deep fried fries as this method requires them to be cooked at a low heat for long periods of time which allows the fries to soak up all the oil and slowly turn brown after it is no longer able to soak up any more oil (kinda like a crouton) rather than a deep fryer that cooks them in hot oil that quickly forms a protective shell preventing unnecessary oil getting soaked up.,5년 전,0,

Neither did they mention how the ""Brightest Jewel in the Crown"" was ultimately a place where trade men could earn a lot of money (Not nesseceraly ethical), on a ""non-civilised"" nation such as the english empire would say. It is true that they helped them in the industry, India were one of the whealiest nations, The empire was interested in that wealth, since they wanted to sell it to other nations to gain their own benefits. They did help them, create alliances and help them with things such as their reusing their threes to other purposes rather then to let the Japaneese buy them and tear it all down. But those actions, would never justify all the horrible acts that the British Empire did. Ffs guys there was a reason why America declared independent saying ""he history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good."" The empire was so powerful that they could do anything they wanted, which also explained the pochahontas and why Thomas Jefferson was not allowed to mention the ""Slave aspect"" of the colony. I was even doing surveys in Manchester on the british empire and such things, yet nobody except 2 out of 75 said that the empire did any good, which i disagree of, there is the common wealth, but come on at least admit the british empire mostly weren't good.

@peterstevens6630,"@Lenny Roach Actually the Indian subcontinent was more united before the British invaded. The individual states prior to the British colonisation, served the people better as almost each region had its own language, and hence it made sense to be recognised as such. It's kind of like forcing Wales and Scotland to be called England- when the people of those nations only speak Welsh and Scottish. That's what the British did. And when they left, the partition disunited people further, that's why Kolkata is not in present day Bangladesh, even though they share a common language. Any good the Brits did do, like legal systems and infrastructure etc is kind of rendered moot as the Indians were so heavily taxed by the Crown, it was all funded by the Indians anyway. And we can't ignore the fact that in such a short time, India has become an emerging superpower and has had one of the fastest growing economies of the last five years.

@neelashreedey7339,"@Lenny Roach India share of the world economy when Britain arrived on it's shores was 23 per cent, by the time the British left it was down to below 4 per cent. Why? Simply because India had been governed for the benefit of Britain.  Britain's rise for 200 years was financed by it's depredations in India. In fact Britain's industrial revolution was actually premised upon the de-industrialisation of India.  The handloom weaver's for example famed across the world whose products were exported around the world. There were actually these weaver's making fine muslin as light as woven wear, it was said, and Britain came right in, smashed their thumbs, broke their looms, imposed tariffs and duties on their cloth and products and started, of course, taking their raw material from India and shipping back manufactured cloth flooding the world's markets with what became the products of the dark and satanic mills of the Victoria in England  That meant that the weavers in India became beggars and India went from being a world famous exporter of finished cloth into an importer when from having 27 per cent of the world trade to less than 2 per cent.  Meanwhile, colonialists like Robert Clive brought their rotten boroughs in England on the proceeds of their loot in India while taking the Hindi word loot into their dictionary as well as their habits. And the British had the gall to call him Clive of India as if he belonged to the country, when all he really did was to ensure that much of the country belonged to him.  By the end of 19th century, the fact is that India was already Britain's biggest cash cow, the world's biggest purchaser of British goods and exports and the source for highly paid employment for British civil servants. We literally paid for our own oppression. And as has been pointed out, the worthy British Victorian families that made their money out of the slave economy, one fifth of the elites of the wealthy class in Britain in 19th century owed their money to transporting 3 million Africans across the waters. And in fact in 1833 when slavery was abolished and what happened was a compensation of 20 million pounds was paid not as reparations to those who had lost their lives or who had suffered or been oppressed by slavery but to those who had lost their property.  Staying with India between 15-29 million Indians died of starvation in British induced famines. The most famous example was, of course, was the great Bengal famine during the World War II when 4 million people died because Winston Churchill deliberately as a matter of written policy proceeded to divert essential supplies from civilians in Bengal to sturdy tummies and Europeans as reserve stockpiles.  He said that the starvation of anyway underfed Bengalis mattered much less than that of sturdy Greeks' - Churchill's actual quote. And when conscious stricken British officials wrote to him pointing out that people were dying because of this decision, he peevishly wrote in the margins of file, “Why hasn’t Gandhi died yet?""  So, all notions that the British were trying to do their colonial enterprise out of enlightened despotism to try and bring the benefits of colonialism and civilisation to the benighted. Even I am sorry - Churchill's conduct in 1943 is simply one example of many that gave light to this myth.  As others have said on the proposition - violence and racism were the reality of the colonial experience. And no wonder that the sun never set on the British empire because even god couldn’t trust the English in the dark.  Let me take the World War I as a very concrete example since the first speaker Mr. Lee suggested these couldn't be quantified. Let me quantify World War I for you. Again I am sorry from an Indian perspective as others have spoken abut the countries. One-sixth of all the British forces that fought in the war were Indian - 54 000 Indians actually lost their lives in that war, 65 000 were wounded and another 4000 remained missing or in prison.  Indian taxpayers had to cough up a 100 million pounds in that time’s money. India supplied 17 million rounds of ammunition, 6,00,000 rifles and machine guns, 42 million garments were stitched and sent out of India and 1.3 million Indian personnel served in this war. I know all this because the commemoration of the centenary has just taken place.  But not just that, India had to supply 173,000 animals 370 million tonnes of supplies and in the end the total value of everything that was taken out of India and India by the way was suffering from recession at that time and poverty and hunger, was in today's money 8 billion pounds. You want quantification, it’s available.  World War II, it was was even worse - 2.5 million Indians in uniform. I won't believe it to the point but Britain's total war debt of 3 billion pounds in 1945 money, 1.25 billion was owed to India and never actually paid.  the railways and roads were really built to serve British interests and not those of the local people but I might add that many countries have built railways and roads without having had to be colonalised in order to do so.  They were designed to carry raw materials from the hinterland into the ports to be shipped to Britain. And the fact is that the Indian or Jamaican or other colonial public - their needs were incidental. Transportation - there was no attempt made to match supply from demand from as transports, none what so ever.  Instead in fact the Indian railways were built with massive incentives offered by Britain to British investors, guaranteed out of Indian taxes paid by Indians with the result that you actually had one mile of Indian railway costing twice what it cost to built the same mile in Canada or Australia because there was so much money being paid in extravagant returns. Britain made all the profits, controlled the technology, supplied all the equipment and absolutely all these benefits came as British private enterprise at Indian public risk. That was the railways as an accomplishment.  It's been pointed out that for the example dehumanisation of Africans in the Caribbean, the massive psychological damage that has been done, the undermining of social traditions, of the property rights, of the authority structures of the societies - all in the interest of British colonialism and the fact remains that many of today's problems in these countries including the persistence and in some cases the creation of racial, of ethnic, of religious tensions were the direct result of colonialism. So there is a moral debt that needs to be paid.  You cannot to be rich to oppress, enslave, kill, maim, torture people for 200 years and then celebrate the fact that they are democratic at the end of it.  We were denied democracy so we had to snatch it, seize it from you with the greatest of reluctance it was considered in India's case after 150 years of British rule and that too with limited franchise.",5년 전(수정됨),6,

Par-boiling is a great opportunity to add flavour, I’ve taken to adding a dash of soy sauce to get a really savoury taste  2. Steaming is an important part of the cooking process, I usually let them steam in a sieve or colander for 2 or 3 minutes after boiling, the edges rough up even more  3. For me, olive oil is a no-go. I find it can make everything bitter. I use rapeseed oil, and sometimes combine it with a little butter.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

I've always made fries by boiling them first, so this time i only added way more oil than i normally would. While they are really delicious, I don't think adding that much extra oil just for more crunch is really worth it due to being really unhealthy in such large quantities. So i'll be sticking to my variant with much less oil. You delivered on the crunch, not the crisp. And olive oil does taste better than sunflower for example.",5년 전,0,

@StewartW12,"For even better results; A. Add 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1 tbsp of salt (per quart of water) prior to boiling the water. B. Don't add the potatoes until the water is already boiling - we want an 'uneven' boiled potato where the outside is somewhat mushy so it has more surface area to crisp up. C. After boiling (assuming you didn't boil the shit out of them and they still remain intact), rough them up a little - just put and hold the lid on firmly and shake the pot. We want a mushy outside for more surface area to allow a crispier chip D. Take the pot lid off and let the chips cool off - we want the steam to escape because less moisture = easier to crisp up. E. Transfer to something with pre-mixed herbs, spices and fat, I prefer duck fat - Adam uses olive oil which works just as well. Mix well and try not to break the chips.",5년 전,0,

@horsenuts1831,"I'm a Brit. Extra virgin olive oil is completely the wrong oil to use. It is a salad oil and completely unsuited to high temperatures where the impurities in it that give it its good flavor for salad, will give it a horrid bitter-burned taste if it is heated too much. Olive oil has a low smoke point (I know that Jamie Oliver uses it, but he is careful not to exceed 190C/375F). If you are going to use this method, then use a fat with a higher smoke point (peanut oil will do fine, but an animal fat such as lard, duck fat, or goose fat will give them a subtle flavor). I tend to use peanut oil unless it is Christmas.   You could also add an extra stage if you have the space and time. This is to put the parboiled potatoes on a rack after they have cooled and then put them in the fridge overnight. The reason for this is that the fridge is the driest place in the house because cold air doesn't hold moisture. This further dries the surface of potatoes for extra crunch.",5년 전,0,

Instead of just oil, try mixing olive oil and goose fat on an oven tray, and preheating that in the oven. Once that's really hot add your potatoes and cook as normal, they'll taste insane.",6년 전,0,

@bazzatron9482,"This video is a little old now, but hello from England!  You seemed to indicate that your biggest issue with these chips are that they're fragile - and I have a suggestion for dealing with this! When we do a roast potato, we par-boil by putting potatoes into already boiling water. This way you cook and soften the outside of the potato only, leaving the inner for structural integrity. Might not be much help with this shape of potato - but I find it stops my roasties splitting when I rough them up.  Secondly, and I'm not sure of the food science for this part, we cook a roast potato for maybe an hour at 200-220C, and the oil usually goes into the oven for 5mins or so before the potatoes. My thoughts on this is that this stops the potatoes soaking up the oil - but I've never not done this as long as I've lived.  Traditionally the potatoes are cooked underneath a joint of meat, and the meat fat drips down through a rack onto the potatoes. I usually put my spuds on the top of the oven (gas oven!) for extra crisping, so a flip every 20mins usually does the trick.  Finally - some heretics here in England dust their potatoes with flour, or cornstarch, or semolina, or all sorts of weird things. Changes the dish and I'm a bit of a purist. But could be interesting for mixing up this recipe, and if you have a spice that would stand the heat without burning maybe add that to the flour.  Great video!",6년 전,0,

@guri8945, @Jargonfox  thank you for answering. I checked how much 450 farenheit and got 230 celsius. i put my oven at 230 and let it preheat for about 7 or 8 min. do i need to change the temp to about 180 or something else? i agree i had the oven heating too much but im a beginner (14 years old) so i dont know what to do.... please answer back. thank you.,6년 전,0,
@Jargonfox," @guri8945  Yeah I worked with Celsius too, had my oven at 225. You might want to try 200 and see things go, just make sure the tray is around the middle of the oven, not the lower or top sections. Another reason for the burning miiiight be that some of the cut potatoes were too thin, make them about double the size of what you want them to be finally since yeah, they shrink quite a bit. Yet another thing you might try is being more thorough with the oiling part, instead of just pouring oil all over you might wanna do that just a little bit to get some across the tray, but then take some of the oil into a little cup and use a basting brush or something to get oil over all the potatoes, just to make sure that every piece gets atleast some on them.

@beckyjones3254,"Ok - so as a Brit I would  would tweak the method somewhat! Firstly, get the roasting pan, add as much of your preferred oil as you want to use, and get that straight in the oven to preheat the oil as well as the oven - you want that oil nice and hot later. Secondly, get the pan of water boiling while you chop the potatoes - much quicker to cook if added to boiling water. Once your tatties are cooked in the water, drain well (you don't want them at all wet for the next step - hot oil and water don't mix!), and if they aren't too soft you can shake the colander a bit to fluff the edges. Then, at the last moment so the oil is hot, take the roasting pan out of the oven, and add the chips.  They will start to sizzle and crisp immediately, and will cook far faster than adding cold oil to a cold pan.  Shake the pan or use a spoon or spatula to make sure all the chips are coated in the hot fat, and then you'll have crispy chips much faster!   You're welcome!",6년 전,59,

@beckyjones3254," @RM-vd2ih  I can't help it if all your food comes out as crap!  You're getting some tips on how to make it tasty.  When we're roasting the potatoes, we usually have the joint of meat roasting at the same time so the oven is full and being used for several dishes at the same time (same with the chips). Do a big enough roast, and the meat can be stretched across several days - eaten cold or used in other dishes, thereby lessening the overall cost of the cooking.  If you don't eat meat, you can roast veggies - pumpkins, squash, sweet potatoes, carrots, peppers, that can all be used in salads, soups, and stews later on.  Plenty of ways to make it more economical. I also don't stand by the oven for the entire time, as I would do if I was frying the potatoes.  I can go and get on with something for the hour or so that they roast.   And when they come out so tasty everyone in the families eats them all, it's definitely not been a waste of my time/life! Peace!",6년 전,3,
@RM-vd2ih," @beckyjones3254  oh you misunderstood me. I meant ultimately all the food we eat is experienced by the tongue for milliseconds after which it's processed as s*** from the intenstine. I cook well enough, but as a vegetarian I can't relate to what you're saying. Which is why I usually just boil the potatoes and then directly fry it on low heat and then after it's cooked, I make the heat high and brown it. When I eat veggies it's usually as curry or as subjis which is why I really don't roast it or anything cause that's not how Indians eat food. Which is why 2 hours of oven for a few milliseconds of joy and a lighter purse is too uneconomical  for me lol",6년 전,0,

I didn't have a towel to ruin for the draining bit but paper towels in a bowl did the job just fine.

@davidpotter6564,"Brit here, few tips for improving these bad boys. Firstly, make sure the outsides of your chips dry out properly before roasting them otherwise your oven will be putting energy into evaporating water rather than crisping up your chips. Secondly, pre-heat the pan and oil before adding the chips, that avoids them getting greasy and adds maximum crispyness, just spoon the hot oil over them keeping the pan over the hob burners at the same time. Third tip, for best flavour and crispyness try a meat fat like beef dripping or best of all goose fat. Yum.",6년 전,1,

@farfromirrational,Wait what? Is this really a thing?  Where are we supposed to dump boiling water when cooking then?  Why isnt this more common knowledge? And how come none of my pipes have ever seemed to have an issue?,6년 전,3,
@ICELegit," @farfromirrational  Yes this is a real thing, and just found this out last month when i was in trade school. ABS which is typically your pipe drains have a max rating of 170'F.  Thats the plastic's melting point. Your pipes will degrade and break down as it's heated up. If you cut open your P-trap and take a look probably see some plastic break down since some of the hot water will remain there. What we were told your suppose to do is run cold water well you drain your pasta etc,  better yet plug the sink and pour the water into the sink and drain once cooled down. Yes i know ""nothing has happen to my drain"" ... Yet....   My grandmother has lived in the same house for 30 years and has always done this and no issues yet, but there could be something finally starting somewhere in the drain. Anyways just what i learnt, what i know now and you could always google it lol. Ps: It's a test question.",6년 전,5,

@mydogskips2," @1NFERN0HD   Yeah, but when you deep fry french fries they don't absorb as much oil as this.  If you're doing it right and cooking at the right temperature, the moisture in the potato immediately turns to steam and generates outward pressure preventing the oil from being absorbed by the potato fries as they cook.  Normal deep-fried french fries may actually be healthier than this, and they shouldn't take 90 minutes to cook either.  And there are ways to get them super extra crispy too.",6년 전,11,

Causing me to realize that 425 is a good setting for when I want to make things my crisp or crunchy -- rather than simply baking something in the oven.  Sure, 450 will do so even more so, though, it's a bit more of a risk to possibly overcook something.

@fernank017,"I've also tried this recipe! It's very important to cut the fries evenly. I have some tips too:   Make sure that your pot is already boiling before you put in the potatoes. Otherwise, it will take forever for the pot to start boiling. This is especially important if you're using a deep pot. I'd recommend using a wider pot for this so that it heats up faster. 430 F is Extremely hot for olive oil! You can risk oven fires this way if you do not spread the potatoes out evenly to absorb the heat. I strongly suggest using peanut oil if you do it this way. Your house might get a little smokey too with olive oil.  I was finished at around 60 minutes (flipped after 45, and re-coated with oil).   It definitely does become crispy, but this method uses up a LOT of electricity with big ovens. Do not do this in a toaster oven as the oil can (and WILL) splash and likely hit the heating element. I'd recommend a deep fryer. It's faster, and the cleanup won't take as long as waiting for these fries to finish baking/frying in the oven.",6년 전,1,

What I've learned is that you need only to coat the fries in oil before putting them in an oven and they cook much faster in a sheet tray or on a rack over the sheet tray. The lower rim helps the hat air circulate around them better and mine are done in 30-40 minutes (note: more potatoes means more time in the oven).

Then bake like you just did but only add enough oil to coat. I’ve done this before and they came out great. If you want to be really fancy, Infuse olive oil with some fresh herbs or truffle oil!

Thank you so much for this! ^_^   On a similar note, a family trick with at least 3 generations practicing it before me has consistently been to cut the potatoes thick so that they stay fluffy on the inside when fried, but making sure to break them up in the hot oil after they had started forming an outer shell; this results in more than two different textures, as part of the interior gets exposed and cooks differently than both the unexposed interior and the exterior of the potato, and that exposed part is all cracked up from getting broken in the piping hot oil, meaning it has much greater and more uneven surface area and a very different texture because of that.",6년 전,0,

@jamesgoacher2433,"Best to de-startch the potatoes/chip before par boiling. I par-boil for about 5 minutes but I make my chips thinner than you did. The edges are usefulk to include because when those smaller parts start to break up, it is time to stop the boil. I then cool the chips in water for a few minutes to stop the cooking process. Roast Potatoes you would bounce around a little in a covered saucepan but not chips. I saw somewhere once that dusting with semolina crisped them up ( haven't tried that) and I am more sparing with the oil than you were. If they have a slight misting of oil they don't need anymore. And yes, this is an established method. As far as I know it is the only method, even if you intend to deep fry. In my air fryer which has a paddle thing which keeps the chips tumbling about (that's why the boil should not be too long) they cook in about 20-25 minutes.",6년 전,0,

@bartok1378,"If you look at some other recipes for the crispiest baked potatoes, I think they suggest adding a touch of baking soda to the water you boil them in. This has the effect of pitting the surface which increases the surface area. This allows for crispier potatoes. Also they suggest being a bit rough with your potatoes and shaking them around a bit in the bowl to get the edges nice and rough and coated with a little mashed potatoes. Not sure if you could do this with the fries if you are trying to keep them intact, but you might be able to grind up a couple with a fork and then mix the fries gently in them to get the desired texture. After that it's pretty much the same recipe you came up with. Just my thoughts on how to improve this recipe, if anyone tries this feel free to let me know how it went.",6년 전,0,

I do it at home in a dutch oven all the time, and while it requires a little more attention than at the restaurant, it comes out fine. If you use a splatter guard and run your oven fan on high, the smell's not even strong unless you use the wrong kind of oil. Granted, shoestring fries are hard to do at home (generally because people don't often have potato presses at home), but the big thick kind Adam was doing are perfectly easy. If you're making fish and chips for instance, fry your chips, fry your fish, and then redrop the chips for a minute or two while the fish cools down a bit. It's honestly pretty trivial. And if you're making fried chicken, it'll hold perfectly fine in an oven set to 200 for at least 20 minutes.

But the only reason I don't cook at home a lot is because of cleanup. One of my biggest things is cleaning up hot pans, if they are hot, I don't want to warp them, but that is the only time I am motivated enough to actually wash them. If I wait too long while they cool, I just end up forgetting about them and the dishes end up being crusted with food and it is hard to clean them. Idk if kitchen cleanup would be a good idea for a video, but I think it would be a neat idea :)   Cheers! Thanks for all of your videos, you are making home cooking look like a pleasant thing to do.

@aragusea,"Q: What do you mean you devised this recipe? I've seen this before. A: Cool! I haven't seen another recipe that applies the par-boiled roastie technique to a fry shape, but I'm not at all surprised to hear that others exist. There's nothing new under the sun. But I did work out the particulars of this one on my own. Totally possible I just reinvented the wheel. Still good fries, though!  Q: Have you thought about adding baking soda to the water to make the outside more crispy? A: No, but I'm intrigued. Alkalinity helps with browning. I will say, however, that I'm not sure I would want to accelerate the browning process on these. The interior needs a long cooking time in order to get really soft and fluffy, and I wouldn't want the exterior to get overly brown while I'm cooking the interior. Really dark brown on these tastes burned.  Q: Have you thought about roughing up the fries a bit before they go in the oven to get more fluffy exterior that'll go crisp in oil? A: That works great with a more conventional roast potato shape, but these long thin shapes are really delicate when they first go in the roasting tray. That little shake I give them is about all the trauma they can take at that stage.  Q: What's up with that thumbnail? A: I thought it was funny and intriguing! (And yeah, maybe I thought it could draw the ASMR crowd...)  Q: Have you thought about using a slotted pan? A: I'm intrigued, but would't the oil drip out the bottom? We need that oil.  Q: What's up with you having ads now? A: A man has to make a living for his family. Also, Squarespace really is good. http://squarespace.com/ragusea  Q: What's up with two ad breaks per video? A: The particular format of the ads is negotiated on a case-by-case basis with the sponsor. You'll see a different format in next week's recipe. Personally, I like this format, because it discloses the sponsorship arrangement right off the bat, but then gives you some more content before you get to the main ad body.  Q: Why was your first talking-head shot out of focus? A: I shoot by myself, and the talking-head shots are tough. I had my camera on face-tracking autofocus, I could see on the monitor that it had zero'd in on my face, but it's not possible for me to see on a tiny monitor halfway across the room if the shot really is in focus. Between this and my day job, I really don't have time to go back and fix stuff unless it's a real disaster. I'm learning every video, though, and I think it'll all keep getting better. The entire reason I started making cooking videos in the first place was to work on my video skills. I'm still pretty new to the medium.  Q: Why were some of your shots over-exposed? A: I'm still really struggling with how to light and expose for white ingredients. I'm working on it. Everything looks overexposed on the cheap field monitor I'm using, so that's no help. I've tried using the level meter, but the black table and the white plates just seem to throw it off.",6년 전(수정됨),1.6만,

@jmaaloe,"Adam, re: adding baking soda to the pot, I highly encourage you to try it out. I learned about the method from Serious Eats, and it's an absolute game changer. It basically turns the exterior of the potato from ""cracked and fluffy"" to ""covered in a layer of mashed potatoes"", although I don't know if the fry shape will be able to hold together with this; a lot of the mushy exterior is from agitation in the colander, so it's typically used with halved potatoes.",6년 전,4,

This one's a given, but you should drop your ISO down to the floor if you're worried about over exposing at any moment. If you're worried about the whites showing and appearing white, upping the contrast is a p easy interface in Resolve and Premiere. If that's already done, try reducing the shutter time. If it's still tied to framerates by default, you'll need a nice big card, but it'll be worth it if it rounds out your exposure in editing.  And a big tip that could potentially fix two problems if you have a better setup than I think: if you happen to have a manual aperture, increase the F-stop by a a few notches. Not only will it drop down those bright hot white overexposures, but it'll also make your depth of field bigger, that way your face doesn't go out of focus as often. You can focus to where you'll be standing and it'll typically give you some feet of travel distance before you go out of focus. The tracking autofocus is great for automated shots, but using this technique can make you not have to worry about how the technology processes you, and instead will give you a ""stage"" of room you can move around in.",5년 전,0,

Also jacket potato the British take on the baked potato, are the bomb.  I Americanized mine but turning them into potato footballs by cutting a lace pattern on the topside.  Otherwise just pop them in the oven at 400F for 2 hours.  What you will get is a baked potato with a crispy outside fluffy on the inside.  The best part you will most likely want to the whole potato as the crispy skin now has flavor not unlike a potato skin.  If you want to be fancy grease the tops with butter or cooking spray and sprinkle course salt over the top before cooking.  The salt will stick to the top when done.

@jesusisgod2953,"Matthew 11:15 KJV He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  Are you saved? Where will you go when you die? Heaven or hell?   The Gospel, which means the Good News is the news that God Almighty, the Creator came in the flesh as Jesus Christ to take away the sin of the world. The one God is a trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son came and laid down his own life to save ours.  His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for our redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. Although God's creation was created perfect, having no death, sickness and disease, the creation became corrupted through Adam and Eve in them disobeying God. In this rebellion the creation became fallen through the curse of sin and mankind became separated from God. This world is fallen, but God offers reconciliation to him through his provision at the cross. Ultimately God will restore his creation to perfection when he returns but those that who reject his offer of redemption will remain condemned by their sins and go to hell.   1 Timothy 3:16 KJV And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: GOD WAS MANIFEST IN THE FLESH, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.  John 1:1,14 KJV In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and THE WORD WAS GOD. [14] And THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH, and dwelt among us,  1 John 3:8 KJV He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.  Hebrews 2:14-16 KJV Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; [15] And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. [16] For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.  Isaiah 9:6 KJV For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty GOD, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.  John 1:10 KJV He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and THE WORLD KNEW HIM NOT.  John 20:28-29 KJV And Thomas answered and said unto him, MY LORD AND MY GOD. [29] Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.  Acts 16:30-31 KJV ...what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.  Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.  1 John 1:8-10 KJV If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. [9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. [10] If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.  GOD CREATED THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL PLANTS, ANIMALS AND THE FIRST TWO HUMANS (ADAM AND EVE)  IN SIX LITERAL 24- HOUR DAYS.

@Iulznazi," @aragusea  Hi Adam, I saw Ethan Chlebowski drop a video that talks about how he ""improves"" your recipe in terms of: taste, texture, time of cooking. Certain things I under stand (ex: not salting water because you prefer heterogeneity having flakes of salt finishing, or using olive oil instead of another oil that may cook faster, but the taste is not as great), but there are other things I'm curious about. Ethan mentions using vinegar to help with the rigidity of fries so they don't crumble.  I know you generally experiment and show several different ways of cooking, and I'm assuming you probably have experimented with doing various things along the way.

But when they're browned they're still very flimsy, the crust they've built up isn't crispy at all unless they're VERY spread out. They're just... browned okay, I guess. I'm curious how this managed to get so crispy with all the crowding?  Also, I'm a bit novice about the details: I think I'm associating the oil with moisture and I've thought of it as a hamper to browning. This is obviously not true, but why is that? When you have meat with some outer moisture, yeah, you need to pat it so you get a good crust as that water needs to boil away before a sear can form and in that time the water may serve to steam the meat. So what's the big difference I'm missing?  Thanks a lot!",6년 전,0,
