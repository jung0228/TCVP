@pattyhall5060,I've loved and appreciated squirrels for decades.    When I lived in Boston I would walk through the Commons and sit on a bench.  You could see squirrels sizing you up and eventually they come over.  I would feed a peanut to them from my fingers.  Then they would sit next to me and eat the peanut.   Watching their little hands and long nails was a blast.  They would even let me pet their backs.  Of course these are tame city squirrels.   They are such unique and funny creatures   Great video.

Couple times his teeth met my finger, but never bit hard. Come to find out, he’d made friends with 4 other neighbors and helped himself to their homes too😅",7개월 전,0,

It’s so much fun to watch them and the baby takes peanuts from my hand and will stand in front of the door waiting when the house feeder is empty. ❤ Again, thank you for the great obstacle course video.

@ВладимирКанин-ь2л,"Привет из России! Великолепный канал, интересные, веселые, познавательные видео. Хочу рассказать вам один случай. Однажды я с детьми проводил время на диком пляже на нашей реке Вятка. Мы купались и увидели странный живой объект, плывущий на наш берег. Позже оказалось, что это была белка. Она плыла из последних сил. Я взял её за хвост и вытащил на песок. Белка долго фыркала, восстанавливала силы и почти не двигалась. Но когда я решил подойти к ней спустя некоторое время, она вдруг встала в боевую стойку, распушила хвост и застрекотала. Это выглядело очень забавно. Мы с детьми засмеялись. Потом белка побежала по пляжу в лес, а дети пытались её догнать, но у них это не получилось. 😂 Всем мира и добра!",11개월 전,0,

@Stickkyyyy,Okay seriously Gus is a female squirrel you named her a boy she is a girl if you can't see the gigantic balls that the other ones have then sorry but I'm actually not seeing balls on any of your squirrels I think they might actually all be girls but definitely Gus is a girl I feed my squirrels I got 10 of them that I feed and yes there's a clear present case that Gus should be called Cali girl because she is a California gray squirrel!,1년 전,0,

@gabrieljahn5795,"The leaf Bird feeder was the one my nana had, it worked for us for the most part but the Problem was sometimes the Bird feeder would get stuck on things or wouldn't push back up whenever the Squirrels would get on it one time this happen in 2021 one of the squirrels got their toe stuck on the bird feeder we took down the feeder try to get the squirrel toe out of it but the squirrel who push and pull on their foot rip their toe out of it and then ran up the tree their toe nail was still stuck in the bird feed but we were able to get it out.😬",1년 전,0,

@reedgarry229,There is no way to dicorage a squirrel from getting ur bird feeders if they really want to get in the feeders. I like squirrels   I learned if i fed them enough corn they didn' bother my bird feeders as much. So what i'm saying is i give up. Not really i'm working on something that might work. If it does i'll let everyone know.,1년 전,0,

Planted them into the ground away from trees or anything that an animal could potential jump from, usually in the middle of the yard. He then took some stove pipe and hardware cloth, wrapped the stove pipe around the pole about mid way up it and then put the hardware cloth in the middle and top of the stove pipe - usually preventing any animal (squirrels and raccoons) from being able to get to the bird and suit feeders.   It works really well, I still have some that I helped my Dad put up three years ago, using zip ties to attack brackets on to the pole and then the feeders onto the brackets.

@peternemeth1777,Squirrels are so amazing. The speed and the smoothness of their movements are more than impressive. And how they can climb and jump so smooth and so fast. Wow just wow.   Nature has a lot of superlatives. Dragonflies accelerate with up to 30 G force which is about three times as much a human body can tolerate. And when I watch a spider or a fly crawling on the ceiling as if weight doesn't matter even with speed I'm in awe of mother nature. As if the laws of physics wouldn't apply to them.,2년 전,0,

When I noticed the squirrels jumping on the roof and hanging upside down to get into my bird feeder…..I just started putting the same food out for them. Problem solved.

@DavidDeelLoco,"Loved this video. Could watch more of your craziness/geniousness. Same thing happened to me. I put out bird feeders.  Squirrels drove me insane. I finally bought huge bags of peanuts, I mean like 10 bags at a time  Put them out at about 7:00 am. Then I got to watch the squirrels on my deck rails shelling peanuts and feasting on the nuts, (what a mess by the way, but really cute to watch them) and watch the birds on the bird feeders.  That's when I learned how many squirrels live in all those trees around my neighborhood.  More than the fantastic four you had.  LMBO.   Gotta love wildlife. And you are dead on.  Squirrels are smart. I ended up having 2 squirrels run from the tree every time I opened the garage door because they learned 2 things.  One, that's where I keep those bags of nuts and two, I was a sucker and would give them extra peanuts.  They would come to the door, sit there and wait until I handed over the goods.",2년 전,1,

@tylersmallman,I had two large pine trees in my back yard that I spanned a cable between and then put two large circular discs on the cable and hung my bird feeders on the cable between the two circular discs ( picture a pencil with two CDs on it and a bird feeder hung between the two CDs ) anyway. This kept the squirrels at bay for maybe two weeks. Their solution was the climb the tree and throw green pine cones ( the heavy ones ) down onto the bird feeders which would knock the bird seed out of the feeder and then they would go collect it from the ground. Squirrels are no joke.,2년 전,3,

@racegts,MARK!!!! LOVE these videos- I've got side cramps from laughing so hard!! Not only funny but educational- I have a similar battle in our front & back yards with the bird feeders being raided by the squirrels.  Just wondering about the 24hr video surveillance; you mentioned that they were busiest from 6am-10. I'm wondering what's the latest in the afternoon you've seen them out & about- the ones in my yard sleep in and are busy from about 7-11 then disappear for a nap and re-appear for a bit in the afternoon and leave before dusk (probably to avoid predators). Thanks again for GREAT VIDOES and education!!,2년 전,0,

The sensor is set to respond to the weight range of local bird species but will remain closed if the weight of a squirrel lands on it.  All solar powered of course.,2년 전,0,

One's a retired cyclotron physicist and has to really use a lot of brain power to outsmart these cute little one pound smarties.  Maybe Mark and the physicist can get together and come up with a truly squirrel-proof bird feeder.",3년 전,0,

My husband and I always bring the whole walnuts, and the Squirrels secures it in their mouth by turning it rapidly, - so cute- them hop away to burry the nut as food for the winter. Mostly they are well behaved, but on feisty one did run up my husband’s leg (shorts!) in anticipation. ;-D I think it would be a nice place to visit for you and your Family.  Thank you for the great work.

@jewel.e,"LOVED this! I did the same thing… started feeding birds, ended up watching the entertaining squirrels for hours! They are the cutest little things and I especially love when they bury their find! 🥰 They dig a hole really, really fast, place the find inside very tenderly, then cover the hole back up just a fast as it was dug. Now for my favorite part… once it’s covered up, they pat it down quickly, quickly but gently. It’s adorable! But it’s their little hand-like paws that catch your attention. I can’t explain any more than I have, you’ll know exactly what I mean when/if you are able to see this for yourself! 🐿🤭",3년 전,218,

They are smarter and more persistent. There's something otherworldly about squirrels   After buying every birdfeeder on the market to try and keep them out of my birdseed , I finally caved in and bought seed without sunflowers and the squirrel got a walnut or two from me . Bc  I got attached to them haha Besides they knock on my bedroom window when they arrive for breakfast, waking me up at 6AM Wasn't so bad. I discovered mornings are really not so bad  Especially when the birds, squirrels and all my backyard friends are amazing and fun to watch.

@333deerwolf,I totally LOVED this. Here in the UK I also put up a bird feeder and to my dismay saw the squirrels win every time I made adjustments to stop them getting the seeds. Your course was way more complex than my inventions but still it was amazing to see how intelligent the squirrels are and their ninja like acrobatics when I suspended my bird feeder on a horizontal rope.

@amalgasoul,Spidersquirrel!,3년 전,5,
@Tismesue," @effoff1  Doesn't look like a jumper to me; I have kept jumping spiders for years. Yes, jumping spiders have a thing about 'butts in the air' (it's actually a courting thing) but they don't do it before they jump. As I said before, other spiders will throw out a line in the hopes of being picked up by the wind.  Jumping spiders will have their spinnerets to the ground before they jump, anchoring a drag line so that if the jump is unsuccessful, they can get back to the starting point. I have spent many hours watching them.  Jumper spiderlings do use the wind dispersal method but this definitely isn't a spiderling.",3년 전,7,

Maybe, without even realizing it..  could be similar to how our muscles stabilize us during standing or moving, without ever even thinking about the HUMONGOUS amount of subconscious processes involved & everything that's happening that we don't even consciously process or realize.... maybe closer to breathing than a truly intentionally conscious action or movement..  but I think their tails are HUGE!!",3년 전,1,

All three plants grew more than five feet tall, producing tons of beautiful tomatoes.  I never got to eat one.  I never got to harvest one single tomato.  The neighborhood squirrels ate them all.  I spent the entire summer trying everything to save my tomatoes and they beat me every time.  I even trapped them and took them to the park up the street.  After weeks, I realized I wasn't make a dent in the numbers.  Turns out they can find their way back home from up to three miles.  I was simply taking them to the park only for them to come directly back home.  Squirrels will always win.",3년 전,0,

When I went to drive off to leave my friends house where I met him he chased me down the street . I looked behind me and the squirrel was booking it untill I put him in my lap and he fell asleep on my lap all curled up so cute . He became my pet for a long long long time .. they are special loving creatures,4년 전,1,

A feeder suspended from a very high branch with a long metal cable (think bicycle brake cable), under two overlapping cone-shaped or inverted bowl-shaped plastic or metal deflectors spaced a foot or two apart (so from top to bottom: cable, cone 1, 1-2 feet of cable, cone 2, feeder. They can hang on to the cable by their feet from above cone 1 but can't reach the feeder, and if they let go, they slide right off the cone. If they try grabbing on to cone 2, they have nothing to grip and just slide right off. Works like water off a duck's back.",4년 전,1,

@LGAussie,"One time I saw a squirrel hop out the roof of my garage. I then saw a baby squirrels head pop out. We had to close up that open patch the mother squirrel made for her babies. I didn’t know what to do since it would rot from rain getting in. So, I stood back 25 feet and stared at the squirrel and basically pictured in my mind that this area was going to be sealed off if u don’t get ur babies out to a safer place.  I kept thinking and visualizing it as she stared back. I was shocked when she started taking them out one by one to another location!! Wow!! That was so satisfying! My fears of them being nailed inside were horrifying. Maybe squirrels are smarter than we know?! 🌝🙏🌿",4년 전,2,

When you multiply (times) using whole numbers as you did, you ALWAYS  end up with a greater number. If you want a smaller number, you divide.   In other words, you can say that something ""is ONE-TENTH (a number divided by ten) the amount of another thing"", but you can't multiply whole numbers and get smaller numbers.

@topsquirrel5323,"An astute observation. Their intelligence plus their adaptability is what has probably made them so successful a species. If you ever raise a foundling baby squirrel to adulthood, find that you and the squirrel have bonded to each other and decide to adopt the little guy to be a member of the family you will have a fabulous companion. But you must respect their right to be who they are. They are even more independent than cats and treated with proper respect, certainly more playful. They may live only about 10 years but for decades thereafter you will find nuts hidden all over the house. Like in sock drawers, in shoes, under a pile of sweaters, in shelves or drawers, down tub drains (fortunately, they float). There is a book by Bill Adler called Outwitting Squirrels. It claims to show 101 ways to outwit them. But if you had an idea that worked, you'd need only one, not 10I. I've read it and I think the subhead might read ""Exercises in Hopeful Self-delusion."" Given enough time, they'll devise workarounds against most any impediment between them and what they recognize to be necessities of life. They'll keep trying until they solve the problem. Intelligence plus a sound work ethic is a powerful combination.",4년 전,0,

@aquamarina2686,"It was fun watching but I'd just put out some walnuts on their favorite trees: coconut trees. Much cheaper & happy squirrels. Put the bird feeder in another location higher up.  Everyone's happy. Yes the manicous are night feeders & love my carambola (5finger) trees. Keep looking because you'll see agoutis roaming too. I planted fruit trees for my kids to enjoy but it's wonderful to see I have others who appreciate the fruiting trees. Birds enjoy bananas, mangoes & avocadoes too so plant one or two. You'll never regret it & I use half of the bunches & leave half for my wildlife. Plant an ixora hedge for the hummingbirds & other birds & a Gulab Jamoon tree for making wines & for wildlife. Also, birds can build their nests in the trees.  So far, we're all happy & you'll discover a whole new wildlife world. Hmm... You might go into wildlife photography next.",4년 전,1,

@axlejohnson9156,I don't know.  Where you trying to feed the squirrels.  You really made that way to easy.   Asking a squirrel to sit still for three seconds is an eternity for a squirrel. Someone did this years ago and had spinning wheels and rotating arms.  One guy made a Squirrel trebuchet.   You do realize that you will soon have three times more squirrels then you had before.  It's because you are feeding them massive amounts of nuts.   You need to use optics that trigger pushers the instant they step in front of the optic.  These squirrels are clearly a whole lot smarter than you are.   Not one got launched.,4년 전,0,

But I grew up in England where they do, I used to watch a family of them housed in the beech tree in our playground,  I knew they were very intelligent, resilient, cunning little animals, so no one got where I was coming from.  My husband died 2yrs ago.  How I wish he could have seen this video…..At that seminar, he said he was lion, king of the business jungle.

@nommy8599, @hilariousskullnamedcatzo647  @eponymousIme If brain size does not affect intelligence then why don't we all have rat sized brains?  They'd use far less energy which is a huge advantage from an evolutionary perspective.  I expect most people would like to see either a reasonable explanation or the guts to simply acknowledge when you're mistaken.  [Edit] BTW I totally agree with comments about us being arrogant and not distinguishing forms of intelligence well.,4년 전(수정됨),12,
@hilariousskullnamedcatzo647, @nommy8599  the reason why we don't have rat size brains is so that we don't have a huge HUGE amount of space in our head,4년 전(수정됨),2,
@nommy8599," @EF0E  That's all quite interesting actually, especially the ratio bit. I wonder if like size vs relative physical strength smaller is far more efficient. E.g an ant can lift 50x it's body weight and every material has a size after which it can't support it's own weight let alone anything else (bones).   Larger brains would require more spaced out neurons and bits (slower messages) so maybe have to compensate for that and there's an upper limit too?  Also I was wondering why would larger mammals/creatures need bigger brains? They have similar amount of organs etc... But I guess there's more to just turning them on and off. Sensory input from skin and nerves inside would scale with size to some extent. And do you need to send more signals to larger muscles? Like all along the length? Is that ever delegated to nerve tissue near the area? We have like 50% of our nerve tissue in our gut & body right?",4년 전,1,

Where she was hiding six of them in that tiny body is anyone's guess. But with that kind of kitten power, squirrels, mice, moles, birds (unfortunately), frogs (yes, frogs), and moths are all endangered species.   The dogs in the front yard get the raccoons, possums, and the occasional cat (including one of the kittens). But because of their zeal in dispatching cats, they are penned up in an enormous front yard to do as they please during the day, and bark at anything and everything all night long.   We live out in the boondocks, so an extra half-dozen or so mouths to feed is no big deal. The females have been spayed, the aggressive tom has been neutered.The rest have their day coming.

@topsquirrel5323,"It is impressive enough that the squirrels cleverly found ways around each obstacle. What may blow you away is the realization that the squirrels knew somehow that to get to the pile of walnuts at the end, they knew they had to start at a seemingly unrelated and distant first step and work forward, diligently solving nearly a dozen sequential puzzles as they approached the ultimate goal. That they connected the first step with the final one, started at the right point and persisted until they solved each subsequent step until the final goal was reached, is what I found most impressive. How old does a human child have to be before he or she attains the smarts to equal this achievement? I have raised numerous squirrels from babyhood, babies aimlessly wandering about or abandoned in the nest, scooped up by someone who brought the little guy to me. Smart dogs most often use their intelligence, I find, discovering what they can get away with. But squirrels are the only animals I needed to match wits with. Clever, determined little problem solvers, they showed an impressive work ethic and survival capability, manifested by a remarkable native intelligence. And they did it as a fun-loving smartass, sort of a cross between Bugs Bunny and Groucho Marx. One of the ones I raised figured out how to open a screw-top jar if there were nuts inside, but she tried to hide her ability from me until I held up the jar for her to work it open. Urban squirrels have trained us to supply them with nuts and in return they allow us to stand within their Radius of Cute while they munch away. That their rear feet swivel is why they can run down trees and vertical poles, while cats cannot. The lack of an opposable thumb may be all they lack to be a real threat to engineer employment. That they won over Mark Rober is not surprising. He recognized a clever fellow engineer when he saw one.",4년 전,98,

When they try to reach the feeder, the cone tips down (and is slippery metal) past the end point of the feeder and they can't reach the feeder and slide off.  Hang it high enough that they can't jump on it from the ground.  Ours is hung from a tree.  We used metal from old car fender skirts.    I don't have the exact measurements correctly stated, that's up to you, the physics guy, to figure out.  All I know is that we made one and it's worked for years, they've never figured it out.

UGH!! Sadly they kept coming back even after repairing the hole so I had to put steel over it which still didn't stop them so I had to shoot one of them to make it stop for good. Which is sad because I used to throw food out for them but they went a little to far and well..... Any way, thank you for sharing this with the rest of us. It was cute and hilarious!!

@hoshinokaabi2848,"just a suggestion; if you ever do this obstacle course again, you should put a one-way ""door flap"", like a cat door, on the front of each obstacle. They will then have to figure out how to lift the door up with their paw and duck under it in order to proceed. This way, they can't skip obstacles by jumping across. And for the obstacles without a top or sides to it, you could attach a piece of wood to the front of the obstacle with a cut-out for the door. And to ensure they don't just jump over that, you could essentially make a ""false front""; use a piece of wood that makes the obstacle look too tall to jump over.  I also thought of some good obstacle ideas: - seesaw: a long narrow platform that is set up in such a way that it tilts one way or the other under load, similar to a seesaw. - slack line: what it says on the label. - Warp pipes: a squirrel-sized version of those tunnels that people use in hamster cages, but with a catch: there's three possible routes they could take. One actually leads to the other side. The second one leads to a vertical drop down to the ground. The third one loops on itself, effectively forming a dead end. alternatively, you could make three of the corridor maze obstacles where each one does the above; one leads through, one ends in a drop off, and the other is essentially a dead end. A decision-making obstacle.  - stepping stone bridge: follows the same principle as the ladder bridge, but it's a chain of platforms with a bit of rope between them. - cliffhanger: basically an upside-down rock wall. to get them started, you could have a sideways rock wall that leads up into the upside-down climbing wall. At the end, there's a platform they climb down to that's in front of the cat door entrance to the next obstacle, and to prevent the squirrels from jumping it, you could put a ""anti-jump"" partition on the front side, and make the climbing wall go around it.  - mine field: a grid of square platforms; some are static (do not move), some drop under load, and some wobble and tilt, similar to the seesaw one.",4년 전,0,

@ChrisRI1000,Here's a situation where animal psychology trumps engineering. :-) We had the same problem and solved it with a clothes hanger and a weak flexible branch. Hung the feeder using a bent up hanger and affixing it to a branch that would droop if a squirrel went out on the branch. It messes with their minds and they just won't try it. The other thing is it must be put at least 4 or 5 ft away from the trunk because they will l aunch off the trunk and grab the feeder.,4년 전,0,

So why when you show your wife that video she still says “ ehhhh just don’t hurt them”. Bruh they would easily survive your awesome catapult. Is she logic intolerant or something??,4년 전,0,

I used to collect acorns from my parents garden each autumn when their oak trees dropped them and I'd take bags full of them to Elvaston Castle in Derbyshire, England where there was always an abundance of squirrels 🐿. They were so used to humans that many could be hand fed and it was a delight to see some of them burying their stash and stomping them into the ground. Really I should have gone back in later years to look for any they'd missed digging back up.   I expect they have their own home grown ones now from Oak trees which have grown from the acorns they forgot about. I'd have loved to take my children there but we moved away to somewhere 80 miles away and my parents also had their oaks chopped down.",4년 전,0,

When the man came home I sent him out there only to find about an inch of tail caught in a crack. We’d see him around , he was the one with the short tail who cussed at us every time he saw up. We put a metal screen over the dryer vent and we all went on with life until........ he decided he really did want in the house, got the screen off only to be met by two cats who really didn’t want him in the house.

@mrpete2405,This has been a pretty shi**y year and not much to be happy about but I stumbled upon your squirrel feeder and enjoyed it very much. I've seen a few of your videos so far and have enjoyed them very much. I am now subscribed and look forward to your partnership with law enforcement to catch those that prey on the vulnerable since I am 67 years old and many people in my age group are the victims of the dirt bags. Thanks for the chuckle.,4년 전,0,

@tadperry1817,"The most interesting part of this wonderful video is what it shows about cats and dogs. Both species are implicitly aware that they should not disturb the  artificial order that has been imposed on their surroundings. The dog knows that to do so might not be appreciated and dogs seek acceptance. As for the cat, I think it recognizes that there is order, and although it might not understand the necessity for this order, it is instinctively cautious and takes care not to disturb the order in any way.",4년 전,0,

@andrewporter1868,"""As vines grow, they spin around looking for something to grab on to.""  I believe this is a rather naive conclusion. Upon further thought, one realizes that such a thin stem requires extra support to be sustained and remain strong. A spiral growth pattern provides optimum strength and minimal growth expenditure, namely, changing vector each iteration of growth. The simplest implementation of such an algorithm doesn't even require knowing about spirals for that matter. Instead, it can simply respond to gravity. Due to an imbalance in weight, the plant can sense sag due to gravity. As a response, it can grow more cells in the area with more sag. God has done some excellent engineering here.",4년 전,0,

But after she passed a few years ago, I guess I'm his sadness, he turned to the squirrels. He back a squirrel watcher. Had squirrel signs, and basically just fed the squirrels in new and interesting ways to remember his late wife. I just wish he was still with us today to see this, unfortunately he passed back in August and I only stumbled into this video today. He would have loved to see this and would have laughed till he cried right along with me.

@joseville,"16:45 amazing.  In addition to using limbs to control rotation/orientation in space, aren't they using their tail even more to accomplish this?  Example: at 17:56, the entire body is rotating clockwise (relative to camera) along axis that goes through the length of the squirrel's body. Around 17:57, the squirrel's body has made half a rotation clockwise, but squirrel's tail begins to spin clockwise very rapidly. Effectively, the squirrel has transferred all/most of its angular momentum to its tail so that it's body stops rotating and stays in that orientation. That's really amazing.",4년 전,0,
@pegmay01746,Dear God....,4년 전,0,
@colemorrison2899,nice,3년 전,0,
@joseville,"Conversely, if instead of stopping its body from rotating, a squirrel is not rotating in mid-air and wants its body to rotate, it rotates its tail in the opposite direction. E.g. if squirrel wants to rotate body counterclockwise, it will rotate its tail clockwise. Also, since the tail is lighter (in mass) than the body, the body will rotate more slowly than the tail. That's why the tail rotates so quickly in the footage - so that the body rotates at a decent rate.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Not just that you can't have it pointed into your neighbours house. You can't have ANY view of ANYTHING past your property lines.   It doesn't make any sense.  You also can't put a camera inside your house pointing out a window because the lens has to be visible from outside the house at all times. That also means you can't use a weatherproof security camera box. Idk who makes these laws... The criminals?,4년 전(수정됨),0,

@joseville,"I see a lot of comments about tails being used as helicopters, but I doubt the tail provides much lift (lift is what keeps aircraft up). More likely the tail is used to stabilize/fix the squirrel's orientation in space.  Example: at 17:56, the entire body is rotating clockwise (relative to camera) along axis that goes through the length of the squirrel's body. Around 17:57, the squirrel's body has made half a rotation clockwise, but squirrel's tail begins to spin clockwise very rapidly. Effectively, the squirrel has transferred all/most of its angular momentum to its tail so that it's body stops rotating and stays in that orientation. That's really amazing.",4년 전,0,

Good engineering follows Occam's Razor - the principle of parsimony - which states that the simplest answer is usually the right one.  In my case, keeping the squirrels out of the bird feeder took nothing more than hanging the feeder by a longer wire - a flattened coathanger works just fine.  In your preface you failed to lower the feeder out of the squirrels' stretching distance, and thus did not demonstrate that the simplest answer wouldn't work.  I get that doing so would have deprived you of all the woodwork and TV show references and fiddling with ardguidos and pneumatics, but dude, let's not pretend that all that stuff constitutes ""good engineering"".",4년 전,0,

Example: at 17:56, the entire body is rotating clockwise (relative to camera) along axis that goes through the length of the squirrel's body. Around 17:57, the squirrel's body has made half a rotation clockwise, but squirrel's tail begins to spin clockwise very rapidly. Effectively, the squirrel has transferred all/most of its angular momentum to its tail so that it's body stops rotating and stays in that orientation. That's really amazing.",4년 전,0,

This should ensure that no squirrel reaches the feeding station.,4년 전,0,

@joseville,"Exactly! They are using their tail to stabilize/fix their orientation in space. Kind of a bad omission.  Example: at 17:56, the entire body is rotating clockwise (relative to camera) along axis that goes through the length of the squirrel's body. Around 17:57, the squirrel's body has made half a rotation clockwise, but squirrel's tail begins to spin clockwise very rapidly. Effectively, the squirrel has transferred all/most of its angular momentum to its tail so that it's body stops rotating and stays in that orientation. That's really amazing.",4년 전,0,

@j9andphoenix,I clicked on this because I know how smart squirrels are - it's great to see a long clip of several of them over a period of time and watching them work it out with a slightly different technique - The people who didn't like it I am guessing had an issue with the 'launchpad'aspect - and to be honest I was a tiny bit torn by it - the fact that as smart as they are they immediately just problem solved and went back is testament to them not being phased by it and not hurt - ideally though I could maybe have not seen that .. Gus is Great! I guess Gus has had her babies by now...?,4년 전,0,

@joseville,"I see a lot of comments about tails being used as helicopters, but I doubt the tail provides much lift (lift is what keeps aircraft up). More likely they are using their tail to stabilize/fix their orientation in space.  Example: at 17:56, the entire body is rotating clockwise (relative to camera) along axis that goes through the length of the squirrel's body. Around 17:57, the squirrel's body has made half a rotation clockwise, but squirrel's tail begins to spin clockwise very rapidly. Effectively, the squirrel has transferred all/most of its angular momentum to its tail so that it's body stops rotating and stays in that orientation. That's really amazing.",4년 전,0,

I live in Munich (Germany) opposite a park and I see the littly rascals almost every day. I have always loved squirrels since I was a boy, but this video made me appreciate them even more. I’m on team Rick, by the way. :-) And I especially like the home wrecker. :-D  You mentioned in the video that you have a child. Lucky kid! And although I’ve had a wonderful father, I kind of envy your kid. I would have loved to build a Ninja obstacle course for squirrels with my father when I was a little boy. You are a great guy and you seem to have preserved your inner child! Keep up the good work and say Hi to the squirrels for me. All the best for you and your family! Greetings from Germany.",4년 전,0,

@joseville,"Exactly. It's truly amazing. They use their tail to stabilize/fix their orientation in space.  Example: at 17:56, the entire body is rotating clockwise (relative to camera) along axis that goes through the length of the squirrel's body. Around 17:57, the squirrel's body has made half a rotation clockwise, but squirrel's tail begins to spin clockwise very rapidly. Effectively, the squirrel has transferred all/most of its angular momentum to its tail so that it's body stops rotating and stays in that orientation. That's really amazing.",4년 전,0,

@tomhobbes741,"Very entertainig to watch! :D  Just a few things:  It was my first guess, that the squirrels will just jump over most of the obstacles to shortcut (and it looks like that's what they did). So the parcours needs a bit more of a jump protection. I'd have triggered the catapults the other way round: so they have to sit somewhere for a longer amount of time or be catapulted as soon as they try to sit on the next plate (sitting on it disables it for maybe 10 seconds). Because stepping over something is the normal behaviour. OR: Turn the catapult the other way round, that the 3 second trigger plate is somewhere where they have to pause to think about the next step, so they have to learn a larger chunk of the parcours first instead of using it step by step.  The diagonal plates haven't been slippery enough, they could just walk over it.  From a learning point of view there's a lot more experiments possible without harming these beautiful critters and still reward them greatly. And it looks like they really enjoyed their walnuts ;)   But that's all theorycraft, hoping there will be a version 2 some day ;) I wish I'd had a backyard with squirrels to play with.

@gabrielflores9565,This reminds me of when me and my siblings tried to prevent squirrels from getting into tallow balls (bird food) at my granma's house. I took iron wire and set it up between two trees and the bird feeder in the middle. The squirrels jumped from nearby bushes onto the wire and somehow climbed along it to the balls. It took them few tried to adjust their trajectory every time we moved the wire but they'd always get ro eat. Then again them being good at obstecle courses makes sense because their whole life is basically an obstecle course,4년 전,0,

@damianousley8833,So if you want to eliminate pesky rodent squirrel's you bait them with poisoned walnuts. Or lay on the walnuts and use a squirrel gun. In Perth Australia the palm squirels had to be eliminated as they were considered exotic vermin.

@joseville,"I see a lot of comments about tails being used as helicopters/propellers, but I doubt the tail provides much lift (lift is what keeps aircraft up). More likely they are using their tail to stabilize/fix their orientation in space.  Example: at 17:56, the entire body is rotating clockwise (relative to camera) along axis that goes through the length of the squirrel's body. Around 17:57, the squirrel's body has made half a rotation clockwise, but squirrel's tail begins to spin clockwise very rapidly. Effectively, the squirrel has transferred all/most of its angular momentum to its tail so that it's body stops rotating and stays in that orientation. That's really amazing.",4년 전,0,

Squirrels seem to be interested in peanuts, walnuts, raisins and fruits. If you’re around them enough and you visit rather frequently, they have no problem coming up to you just so they can get a nice scratch on the head and enjoy some food on the back of your bike tire.",4년 전,0,

@jokuvaan5175,This reminds me of when me and my siblings tried to prevent squirrels from getting into tallow balls (bird food) at my granma's house. I took iron wire and set it up between two trees and the bird feeder in the middle. The squirrels jumped from nearby bushes onto the wire and somehow climbed along it to the balls. It took them few tried to adjust their trajectory every time we moved the wire but they'd always get ro eat. Then again them being good at obstecle courses makes sense because their whole life is basically an obstecle course,4년 전,27,

Raise an orphaned squirrel (or a dozen over the years like I have) and you'd have a change of heart.  My dad loved our squirrels, put food in our feeders for them, taught me to love all critters. But when he was in his 80s he started trapping them and dropping them off at local parks.   Starve them, shoot them, move them. I never understood that.   A friend rescued and raised a squirrel last year. Her neighbor hated squirrels, caught the poor thing it on his deck, threw it against his house and killed it.   Big macho men. Woooo. I'm swooning.

It looked chaotic when not slowed down, only once it was slowed down do we see the squirrel had control basically the entire time.

Then they chewed another so called squirrel proof feeders wire where it was hanging from a tree and the feeder fell, but this time I saved the day by observation because I had chimes to the feeder so when they tried I heard and my dog also now is alerted! Now I’m mad, so next time I’m taking a cable and gorilla glueing pins and needles so they won’t be chewing it that’s for sure! Then I’m going horizontally with cans or soda bottles between so they can’t hop across it!! I could build a wonderful amusing squirrel proof pole one but I can’t say yet ! Not patented yet!

With all that scientists have come to know about living cells, the genome and the actual internal workings inside the cell, there is no longer any room for the science-denying myth of abiogenesis and darwinian evolution.

It all started with a squirrel we named Buddy who just saw my mom in the window one day and came to the back patio, begging. He would stand in the window of our dining room as well, and climb the furniture outside. Then, every other squirrel after him copied what he did, but less brave. Then the squirrels just stopped begging, but today, I think a squirrel just realized what food we have in store for the animals outside. I think he's gonna start another chain of begging squirrels.

I'd thought about toasting seeds at the end of the season for snacking on.  We had 10 flowers.  Over the space of a week, we had 3 left.  I managed to spot a squirrel making its way over the neighbour's fence with this 2ft diameter flower head.  It was struggling with it but it wasn't letting go.  I ended up taking 2 heads off and left them to take the last one.  Very intelligent creatures.",5년 전,0,

They have been begging me to make a version of the squirrel ninja warrior obstacle course in our backyard as our squirrels also get at our bird feeder.  Well, I haven't done that yet, but we did pick up the same Bird-Be-Gone feeder you have in your video at Home Depot and tried it out in our yard.  First day we had it up the squirrel (that my kids named ""Thin Gus"") foiled it not by unhinging it or sending it to the ground, but rather by hanging by his hind claws to the tree branch holding the feeder (and thus not putting any weight on it to lower and lock it) and just hanging down and having a feast!

But at one point she dropped the baby which fell to the platform on the 3rd floor and just as the baby was about to slip through the cracks, she leaped straight down and caught the baby mid air in extremely dramatic fashion and landed on the 2nd floor platform. It was insane. Thank God I had 1 other witness because it's so ridiculous I've never even told the story 😂. Squirrels are crazy smart. She did end up making it to that hole 🕳 👍",5년 전(수정됨),669,

I had a brilliant moment and put the feeder atop a 8 foot steel pipe, that I drove into the ground,  no problem for the Squirrels, every one else was left out.  Brilliant Idea 2  I greesed the top 3feet of the pole with vasalene,  The stuff you put, on your toddlers bum to prevent diaper rash,  Fun watching them get their paws in the V and try to get it off.

However, how are you going to react when I say that you, yes you, good sir Mark, are but a product of a long-standing evolutionary experiment on behalf of mice squirrels, to develop smarter squirrels?  Daylight Robbery! (Jessica Holm, 1988) was a BBC documentary TV special (exported to America via PBS) that had exactly the same narrative arc. It started as an investigation to find a squirrel-proof bird feeder design -- witnessing feeder after feeder give up its treasures to the indomitable Sciuridae -- evolving to test the perseverance and intelligence of squirrels in an obstacle course, to end with not-so-grudging respect. Hilarious -- both documentaries! In fact, yours is so similar you must have seen it, right? Confess!

@MatthewCampbell765,"I suspect mixing in something spicy with your bird feed would work pretty well. To my understanding, birds can't taste spicy food (or at least not certain kinds) while mammals can. Peppers evolved to be piquant because they want to be eaten by birds (who can't digest their seeds fully) rather than mammals (who can). I'd double check to make sure it's safe for the squirrels, though...having said that, I wouldn't expect them to even try to eat your bird food if you spiced it up like that (they'd smell it, recognize it for what it is, then leave it well alone).",5년 전,0,

@Howtragicforyou,When I was a kid my grandfather had a hobby of catching squirrels. he would wait on the deck for hours with a trap and manually pull the string. he would then drive them several kilometres up the road and release them. For a while he had this one squirrel he called Bugsy. He had a heart shaped white patch on his head. no matter how many times my grandfather caught him he would be back in less than a day or two. My grandfather cursed him for years until finally Bugsy never came back. Until he died in 2018 he would talk about how he missed that squirrel. I cherish those memories now and have all due respect to the evil genius of the squirrel kind.,5년 전,0,

@joseville,"Exactly! They are using their tail to stabilize/fix their orientation in space.  Example: at 17:56, the entire body is rotating clockwise (relative to camera) along axis that goes through the length of the squirrel's body. Around 17:57, the squirrel's body has made half a rotation clockwise, but squirrel's tail begins to spin clockwise very rapidly. Effectively, the squirrel has transferred all/most of its angular momentum to its tail so that it's body stops rotating and stays in that orientation. That's really amazing.",4년 전,1,

@joseville,"I see a lot of comments about tails being used as helicopters/propellers, but I doubt the tail provides much lift (lift is the force that keeps things in the air). More likely they are using their tail to stabilize/fix their orientation in space.  Example: at 17:56, the entire body is rotating clockwise (relative to camera) along axis that goes through the length of the squirrel's body. Around 17:57, the squirrel's body has made half a rotation clockwise, but squirrel's tail begins to spin clockwise very rapidly. Effectively, the squirrel has transferred all/most of its angular momentum to its tail so that it's body stops rotating and stays in that orientation. That's really amazing.",4년 전,0,

@Fyreflier,"The little picnic table is basically my mum's solution to the squirrels and starlings - the sacrificial feeder. The good birdseed and mealworm mix goes in the cage she made around the feeder that's too small for squirrels or starlings to get through, and the walls too far apart to be reached through; the cheap fat feeders and peanuts are left in the open. Opportunists and lazy fuckers like them and pigeons will take the easy option and the bonus is that the more wary birds (usually coal tits) have learned that the cage is so secure that there's plenty of food for them and predators can't get in so they're safe to sit and eat to their hearts' content.",5년 전,0,

@timj9418,"You might think that squirrels are cute, clever and incredibly athletic.  Sure, I agree with the clever and athletic part.  But otherwise I find them obnoxious pests--rodents with fuzzy tails, which they are.  They will chew through telephone lines or whatever gives them the equivalent of a trip to the rodentist.  So they're destructive little buggers.  They're also annoyingly stubborn, which is the flip side of persistence.  I had a nice little vegetable garden in my backyard, until a ground squirrel took up residence next to it, burrowing a home for himself under the fence about two feet from one side of the garden.  The garden plot was covered with a pvc-pipe and bird netting contraption to keep out birds and other pests, but of course that doesn't include squirrels that just chew through the bird netting and dig into the veggies.  I tried lots of discouragements to the squirrel--filling his burrow entrance, flooding the burrow, placing these supposed ""repellant"" powders around the garden, etc.  Nothing worked.  So finally I bought a trap, baited it with peanut butter and tried repeatedly to catch the squirrel.  After many tries, I caught him in the trap.  But I made a serious mistake after that, a mistake that I could have avoided if I did a little online research first about the homing ability of squirrels.  Being a compassionate animal lover, I released him about three miles from my house in a more rural area.  Next day, he was back at my house.  Turns out, squirrels have this amazing ability to find their way back to a previous preferred home.  That diminishes the farther away you take them--roughly five miles minimum, and preferably driving there on a twisting route, even if they're in the trunk of your car, as mine was.  As for how I finally rid myself of the little jerk, let's just say it was less pleasant for him.  But like Denzel Washington in ""Equalizer,"" I gave him more than enough chances first.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
