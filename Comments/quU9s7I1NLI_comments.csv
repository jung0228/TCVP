@TheGoldenboyo,I was part of a documentary team that followed young children having full heart transplants. The craziest part was the fact that a child would die somewhere in some tragic accident or something...but then this other young person would suddenly have the potential to live by adopting their heart. It would all have to happen within a 12 hour window to be successful. It was the weirdest emotions I've ever experienced because as an onlooker you felt absolutely torn between one family suddenly struck with shock and grief and another experiencing relief and hope. It was a very strange world.,1년 전,1,

@ROCKOCTANE,"They are praying to a God? Science is the  reason this is happening.  Humans have been on this planet over 250,000 year many more, ok let's go with 6000 years. In only 1% ,the last 100 years, your God gave Humans information? Only 100 years ago ,women and their baby would die giving birth,in a hospital ,they didn't know to wash their hand after handing a dead body. It was the telephone, transportation, that brought more human brains together.  Everyone has the experience of being at a learning Plato, and someone walks by and saz try this. And it hit you ,over course,  why didn't I think of that.  God didn't do it . Have a belief is one of the 400 God's today, creates tribal cohesion.  You meet someone, you don't agree with them on everything, by because they have the same faith,  you have cohesion. Isn't it odd how your God is in relationships to the popular belief were your born. Logic ,reason and evidence is how this person got a face transplant,  the very thing belief without evidence is called into check. Every 4 seconds a child below the age of 5 dies in the world, of just bad drinking water,but because your in a 1st world country, you God is blessing you. By changing the laws of physics for your convenience. Belief is something, is pretending and you can stop pretending anytime you like. The power of a God is already in you,look at your hand,those are the hands of God. Isn't interesting your God can do anything, but your God need you to do something. Oh, the sales pitch, you can't be a good person if you don't have religion, with or without religion you decide what to do. Just like in the Wizard of Oz, the Lion,Scarecrow and Tinman, were looking for something they already had.",3년 전,0,

@mistyclark5247," @nadi2sweet  It does seem very scary indeed! On another note.. I thought about this and believe it's referring to the donor's body on it's own. When a donor passes away, the body must be kept ""alive"" or in other words, stabilized, so that it doesn't shut down. The reason for this is so the surgeons can collect all donated body parts whenever they are still fresh. This allows the donated parts to be used inside another person. The parts would be fresh enough they can still behave actively when transferred in it's earliest hours. :D  I hope this clears the misunderstanding. Take care. 😊",5년 전(수정됨),26,

@TJ-wk9gl,"katie’s story Katie was an irrepressible little girl, her older sister, Olivia McCay, told me(doctor) “She was fearless, very fearless, and a lot of fun.” She developed a quick, sarcastic sense of humor, a trait she shared with her brother, Robert. But as she grew older, Olivia noticed, Katie put enormous pressure on herself to achieve. “She wanted to be the best in all of these sports that she’d never even tried before,” Olivia said. “She wanted to be the best academically. She studied for hours, all the time.”  When Katie was in high school, the family made two major moves. Her sophomore year they moved from Lakeland, Florida, where she grew up, to Owensboro, Kentucky. She’d just settled in when they moved again, a year later, to Oxford, Mississippi. Her father, Robb, who’d been a minister and educator, and Alesia took jobs teaching at a small Christian school. Katie enrolled as a junior and fell in love with a classmate. They started talking about marriage. “This one was just so serious for so young,” Olivia said. “She just grew up so fast that year.” After the moves, she said, “I think she was ready to have some stability and some consistency.” She didn’t get them. In her senior year Katie’s world unraveled. She was already contending with chronic gastrointestinal troubles and surgery. She’d had her appendix taken out the year before, and complications led to the removal of her gallbladder in January of her senior year. Two months later, the Stubblefields told me, the school’s headmaster informed them that he would not renew their contracts and then abruptly fired Alesia. Katie, who had trusted the headmaster, felt betrayed.  Then, on March 25, 2014, Katie picked up her boyfriend’s phone and found texts to another girl. When she confronted him, her family told me, he broke up with her.  Hurt and angry, Katie went to Robert’s place in Oxford, where she furiously texted and paced, back and forth. Robert called their mother. While the two were outside talking about how upset Katie was, she went into the bathroom, put the barrel of Robert’s .308-caliber hunting rifle below her chin, and pulled the trigger. When Robert kicked in the locked door, he found his little sister covered in blood. “And her face is gone,” he recalled, still shaken by the memory.  1 year, 2 days before Katie’s transplant  During one of Katie’s hospital stays, Alesia cleans and comforts her following a meal. Katie drank from a sippy cup because without lips, she had a hard time keeping liquids from dribbling out. To move her eyes closer, a doctor would come each day to adjust the distraction device, which was attached to her maxilla, the bone in the center of the face.  Robert, Katie’s brother, teases her during a visit to the family’s apartment in the Ronald McDonald House. Katie was at Robert’s place and used his hunting rifle when she tried to kill herself. Robert, who found her, is extremely close to his younger sister.",6년 전(수정됨),135,

But unless you’ve dealt with mental health issues that have driven you to the point of attempting suicide, don’t talk. She had a second chance, and she took it. Yes, she put this on herself. But she deserves a SECOND CHANCE. You don’t know what goes on inside of people’s minds or how much of your life and early development can affect you mentally. For people to automatically assume and judge her for her “impulse decision” is just morally wrong. We all make impulsive decisions every day. Hers just happened to be more drastic. Mental Health is just as important as physical health. If you can’t understand that, then you obviously haven’t dealt with any mental health issues 🤷🏽‍♀️",6년 전,1,

It's hard not to be suicidal if ur depressed. Some times if ur depressed u aren't suicidal but some people are. Depression is real and u will never understand what it's like unless u actually have it. Put yourself in her shoes. If that happened to u wouldn't u want another chance at life? How would u like it if people told u that udidn't deserve it? And that ur a brat bc of it?   Just be nice bc u never know the whole story to someone's life.

@kristinhomura,"there’s more to organ/face donation than “who deserves it more.” the facial tissue of the donor still has to be alive in order to take. the donor has to be declared legally brain dead within a close enough radius to the recipient because there is a limited window of when the transplant can occur before the cells start to die. the face donor is matched to the recipient based on blood type, bone structure, facial features, etc. it doesn’t matter who “deserved” this face more, katie was 99% likely the only one to fit all of the requirements and be in the right place at the right time. if she didn’t take it, the face probably would’ve gone to waste. what was she supposed to do? refuse it? and refuse her probably only chance at a more normal life and feel guilty for the rest of her life to please you? that sounds like a great way to help her mental health. next time do your research. your opinion is not an informed opinion.",6년 전,0,

People seem to only embrace ""faith"" when it comes to that belief and nothing else. Does me saying ""I believe the Earth is flat"" suddenly make that true? It wouldn't. So why would we say that is the case with God if we don't have proof?  It's basically like ""innocent until proven guilty"". Only in this case it is ""God doesn't exist until proven to exist"". The initial assumption is based on an objective analysis of it's existence. Just as it is reasonable to assume a human standing trial is innocent as a baseline before proven guilty, the same logic holds here.",7년 전(수정됨),5,

@geraldjoshua9554,"Haha all these comments are all good actually. I agree with the idea that there is no accurate way to prove God exists scientifically (or perhaps there is). But also, imo, there is no accurate way to prove that God doesn't exist either. So I guess it's 50 50. And if y'all are curious about my belief, I personally decided to believe that God exists and I believe it through Jesus Christ (and it's through experience and life journey I had with Him). But even if you don't believe God exists in the first place, unless you have a scientific or really accurate proof that says God doesn't exist, I don't think it's a good idea to just disbelieve the existence of God. All of us will know for sure whether God exists or not after this life a.k.a after we pass away. But that's too risky to assume God doesn't exist before we die. Why? Cuz if it's true that God exists, y'all don't have a chance anymore. But if y'all decide to believe that God exists, even if it's true that God doesn't exist, there's nothing to loose. That's just my opinion. Again, I'm only a human and only God that can prove Himself to be true. And if y'all decide to believe in the existence of God, start comparing religions. Find what statements have been declared by all these Gods when they're on earth. Perhaps you can find something interesting : )",7년 전(수정됨),4,

Such an inspiration, and to think that people are so entitled and feel as though their lives are the absolute worst because of petty, irrelevant reasons. Please keep that spirit, sweet girl. I have a feeling I'll be sharing your story to some of my patients next week. And it is so fortunate that you were able to receive such a generous donation. I had a patient pass just last week, and it was his wish to become a donor...unfortunately, when we called the organization after contacting and notifying his family, he was refused due to his previous histories. The man had been homeless prior to admission, and had been brought in through the ED unresponsive and with a fever. Though any infection he'd had had been resolved, and fever broken for over a week, he was still denied as a candidate for donation, both for science and research as well as for transplants for those in need. Though I understand the concern, as any recipient of a donated organ will be on immunosuppressants due to risk of rejection, it was incredibly heartbreaking. Even more so that his family members who shunned him when he was in need and would not answer any calls regarding the patient all showed up after his passing.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@Zaphyera,"thing is: she was probably depressed. and since you seem to not understand this, depression is when your brain doesn't make enough of the ""happy chemicals"" it's supposed to. it's not like she was fine her whole life and one day went ""wow my boyfriend cheated on me, guess I'll die"". she had most likely been suffering for a long time and her boyfriend was the catalyst that made her feel unable to continue with her life. the amount of pain someone has to be in do attempt to end their own life is unimaginable.

Medication wont cure any mental disorders bc medication only treats symptoms. it doesn't fix your brain and then ""woohoo I'm cured, i'm no longer depressed and oh-so happy"". First of all, medication works differently in everyone. it may help a lot to some people and it may do nothing for others. but even if it does help a lot, that person would have to continue taking that medication, and probably for the rest of their life. do you know how expensive that could get? especially if their insurance decides not to cover it? that's one of the main reasons people don't get diagnosed and get medication.",7년 전,0,

I wish everyday i could just get up and go to the bathroom or even take a walk. Or even go work as a man i feel like im not worth anything becasue i cant work   Folks please take advantage of everyday and dont worry about stupid shit like your coffee is not done right at starbucks.  Slow down and enjoy life bc at a moments notice it can be gone or like me completely changed.  Enjoy going to work and dont stress not having a great cup of coffee.  Who cares folks  Nothing matters except your heart beating in your chest.  And help others folks as there a alot of people who really need it. It could just be a hello and that might help or rise someones spirits. Try it you will feel good.  Dont be lazy and live your life. Not on a phone all day texting Go out an experience life not from a screen  I wish i could go out and smell the air but im confined so dont be confined to a cell phone or computer and put it down and just go and enjoy what life has to offer before its gone  And by all means stop fighting you guys. Its not worth it. All you youtubers get off the screen ans get out and meet people and live life. I wish i could   Boy do i wish i could just once walk around the block it would be  one thing i would love or dance again before i die.  Live people and stop with the political nonsense you know what is right be smart and forget about all that  Its what they want you to do  Dont waste your time bc before you know it you dont have any time left  I wish all of u luck  Take care,7년 전(수정됨),0,

The chance to end her life, without any regard for how that'll do to people around her OR to herself. There are people who have deformities and such NOT because of suicide attempts and you don't see them getting the f*cking treatment!

It’s just sad how you people aren’t even willing to have some sympathy on what happened to her just because she shot herself and you all think she brought it upon herself anyway. Y’all should learn to actually have a heart. This girl needs support, not people telling her she doesn’t deserve the chance to get the help that she needed. She may have tried to commit suicide, yeah, but what matters is that now she actually wants to live.

@sarahweekes4829,"Sarah Quinn im not saying all others dont deserve it. But the struggle of being auicidal makes it to where you have an extreme difficulty to control your action because it makes you unstable. She needed help. An being suicidal, you do it because you believe your family is better off without you and such. And you may think its selfish, and sometimes, some people ARE ACTUALY trying to be selfish. Not her. And dont you realize your also being selfish? Whos right is it if she lives or dies? Your making her continue to live in pain all because youll miss her, and yes it can be better an it can help, but in some cases, the family and friends are being the selfish ones when it comes to the other. Both sides  can be selfish. No one is wrong but no one is also right. This is a gray area but she still deserves happiness and deserves this from all the pain she did go through. And her family also deserves theur happiness by being with their daughter who now has a chance at a better life. No one has the right to condemn anyone here. This has always been a tricky area but them being just plain old selfish is not the situation and can be very ignorant.",7년 전,1,

@emulatemetheuniverse.3670,"So someone loses their life, kindly and selflessly donate their face, and they give it to someone who tried to selfishly take their own life? My dad is in renal failure and waiting for a kidney... Did you know if you ever had a history of suicidal tendencies in the past that you cannot get a kidney transplant? We were surprised by that information too, the transplant team explained to us these donations are still rare. That the recipients need to be people who are expected to live long, happy and grateful lives. I'm happy to see that she doesn't want to kill herself now after her suicide backfired. I hope that she will not take this for granted. Having been suicidal myself in the past, a part of me feels like this should go to someone who was mutilated by abuse or in a car accident or a fire. The other side of me finds some kind of beauty in her awesome second chance. I just hope she really realizes how lucky she is and that she is obviously meant to be here.",7년 전,0,

@shrekuschrist3892,hold the fuck up. What is fucking wrong with this comment section. some of y'all saying she doesn't  deserve a face transplant  because she committed suicide and failed and that she is selfish.  Absolutely DISGUSTING. People just don't commit suicide for the sake it you know. It comes from deep rooted problem and mental illness. sometimes people hit rock bottom and feel like its the only way out. they have fallen so far that they can't see light anymore. Even if the light can't be seen it's still there. With the help of loved ones and support the light overpowers the lonely darkness. she isn't weak for doing so. That doesn't make her any less worthy or lower than anyone.,7년 전,0,

It's a really difficult thing to have. For instance my sister has bipolar due to a gaslighting parent. On the outside their situation doesn't seem bad but in reality it's truly serious. Same can be implied to this woman. It's hard enough for her already might as well try to help her to live with what she got left to accept herself  Who knows maybe the friend really did something worst, it could be assault, betrayal, cheating with her bf, ect.

@tango8011,"Having read the article in Nat Geographic, I have to say, I'm incredibly conflicted by it all. The cynic in me questions why she out of hundreds of others, was given this opportunity, and it rather obviously boils down to age, and a lifelong commitment to being an experiment. Having shot herself in the face, I can't imagine how difficult the journey has been, for both Katie, and her family, but, what makes her story and more important than others? The psychiatrist seemed to be quite sure that Katie doesn't have suicidal thoughts, as she came to the conclusion that Katie hadn't pre meditated her suicide, but one has to consider, what is going to happen to this woman, five, ten years down the line?? All in all, I commend the surgeons, and Andrea's grandma for giving Katie a new chapter, I may be a cynic, but I can still see that at the end of the day, this was not solely a story about the miracles of science, but also the advancement of humanity; a welcome sight. I hope life treats you well Katie and that you succeed in all you wish.",7년 전,0,

@angelikistam1387,"This comment section troubled me a lot, mainly because i was really shocked by the amount of people that claimed that she does not deserve the transplant because her facial structure was caused by an unsuccessful suicide attempt. First of all, every person on this Earth deserves a second chance. This is not something debateable in the civilised world, people are flawed and they should be forgiven for that. Also, she was underage, which means her character, beliefs and actions weren't completely developed and adolescence is always a rough time. But, most importantly, there can be no progress in this world without real, deep compassion. There should be no debate on why we treat people that are responsible for the state of their health. According to that theory, the medical system should also not treat the people in car accidents who were found drunk, right? Or those with lung cancer that keep smoking. But we do. Because we are humans as well and we fail too.",7년 전,168,

@Tom-xy9gb,"Dam so it was all her fault her face is gone :0 she blew her face off with a rifle! The Article says: “Then, on March 25, 2014, Katie picked up her boyfriend’s phone and found texts to another girl. When she confronted him, her family told me, he broke up with her. Hurt and angry, Katie went to Robert’s place in Oxford, where she furiously texted and paced, back and forth. Robert called their mother. While the two were outside talking about how upset Katie was, she went into the bathroom, put the barrel of Robert’s .308-caliber hunting rifle below her chin, and pulled the trigger. When Robert kicked in the locked door, he found his little sister covered in blood. “And her face is gone,” he recalled, still shaken by the memory.” WOW",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@Miss_Loving,"Dear friend, I have some wonderful news for you. Did you know that there is NEVER any variation in God's enduring love for you. God's love is love without limits!! In reality the word ALONE should be omitted from our vocabulary because none of us are ever alone. God knew us before the foundation of this earth and is ALWAYS with us. Again there is never any variation in God's enduring love for us all.  Psalm 145 overflows with the word all. ""The LORD is good to all; He has compassion on all He has made"" (v.9) ""The LORD is trustworthy in all He promises and faithful in all He does. The LORD unholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down"" (vv. 13-14). ""The LORD watches over all who love Him"" (v.20).         A dozen times in this psalm we are reminded that God's love is without limit and favoritism. And the New Testament reveals that the greatest expression of it is seen in Jesus Christ: ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life"" (John 3 : 16).  Psalm 145 declares that ""the LORD is near to all who call on Him, to all who call Him in truth. He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and saves them"" (vv. 18-19). God's love for us always endures, and it never fails! Friends welcome Jesus Christ into your heart RIGHT NOW!!! Recieve the blessed love without limits that our Lord and Savior has for you. ❤️❤️❤️      Please say the following prayer with me....Father in heaven, we are awed by Your love for us that never changes, never fails, and never ends. We praise You for demonstrating Your limitless love for us through Jesus Christ our Savior and Lord. Amen!! ....May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ.",7년 전,2,

Its hard to understand how someone can make the choice to take their lives..suffer from disfigurement..and then are rewarded with the aspect of living a relatively normal life, when the previous life was taken for granted. But when you rid your mind of that perception of ignorance, ie..she doesn't deserve it.. You feel warmth and compassion for this young girl and possibly can empathize with her story. Biologically speaking the human brain stops developing at 25 years. She was young..and immature and unaware. She must have been in a dark deep depression to do what she did.. Now God has given her a second chance to live. And live well. I say God as these doctors are miracle workers and have been given gifts and instruments that will give her life. There is not one person who is undeserving of second chances. We all learn and grow through struggles and through stories like this. Perhaps her story will save others from attempting suicide as after all, you may live and have to live with the consequences of possible disfigurement or other permanent injuries.

@trixiebootle8772,"Nikki Fresquez  Here... God gave her a face the first time. Then this young girl became severely depressed and became lost.. She took a rifle in where she disfigured and lost her beautiful face, but she lived. God stepped back in by giving to her the opportunity to live again.. He allowed a new face...that was specifically given to her, at the right time.. this is evidence that God does not judge. So why do you? If you choose to speak of ""God"", speak for him.. Tell others not to judge..not to hate. This young girl, God saw deserving to LIVE . He saw deserving of a relatively normal life.. And gave her the face of another. This is a gift created by 5 people, all in which were helping this girl. 1) God. He has made this possible.. 2) the  Doctors.. 3) the deceased woman.. 4) the deceased womens family..  5) this young girl. This life changing experience has not just affected her; everyone in this story benefits. And dont forget..she knows the face in the mirror is not hers. Could you imagine her pain?  This young woman will not be ""beautiful"" as prior to her attempt; what is beautiful is that in this tragedy...FIVE people became one. This is what God wanted for her..and those affected by her story. Trust that God did not judge her on the error of her ways; he simply offered her a gift, and in return, her story may be a gift to all others who are considering suicide. There is no guarantee someone will die from suicide, but there will be long term effects. Could most live ..looking in the mirror...of their new face...when it is not theirs??

Will be to prevent others from attempting. And that is nothing but beautiful. ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡,7년 전,0,
@trixiebootle8772,Jeanette Jacobs  My point exactly. She does not see herself.. Imagine that. She is beautifully pieced together again..but never as she was. The face in the mirror? Is not her..

This was all to happen; and she is writing her story now by empowering others.  Only through the eyes of those who have faced this will one ever know what it is like.. I pray no other person endures this or such tragedy to attempt suicide. For every bad day..a better day soon follows.. Next year will not be the same as this year..  Let's all learn to listen and grow. To be compassionate..not judgemental. ♡♡♡♡♡,7년 전,0,

Luckily, she was able to receive a new face (though sadly, her donor OD'D yet an tragedy). While I am impressed with the advances in medical technology, I find the entire story rather depressing and tragic!
