@Mark-d7j9b,"Why is everyone hung up on reading faster? However, unless it is required to to read 10-15 books a week, it is not about reading faster; it is about enjoying what you read. Reading 600 wpm is much better than reading 1200 wpm. I compare it to watching movies. I love silent movies and movies made in the 1930s. There are well over 7,000 movies I want to watch. I would love to watch 10 movies a day. Then it would only take me about 2 years to do so, assuming I did so every day. However, my enjoyment of the motions of the actors, their words, etc would drastically suffer regarding my enjoyment. Reading is about enjoying what you read. If reading 1200 wpm is you enjoyment point, FINE. If reading 400 wpm is your enjoyment fine, FINE. Take Bleak House, for example. I read it over a week, and I calculated my pace at 900 wpm (I was in college at the time). Several years later, I re-read Bleak House at 450 wpm. I took me 4x the time because I not only slowed down my pace, but limited my time per day. I enjoyed the book 10 times more than when I read it faster. I literally placed myself in the book and could see the characters much better, as well as the settings and descriptive words Dickens is known for. Stop putting pressure one yourself. I actually limited my sleep time and allowed 90 minutes toward reading, and that has made me a better student of literature and history. For me, I became more selective in my reading and my time allotment. What a difference.",5개월 전,0,

@凯哥爬出来,"you never need to speed reading, you only need speed information processing. when you read a book, you are not using your eyes, but your brain to really think about what you are reading, or, it is just a pointless bioloptical scanning. According to my own experiences, you are already winning 90% when you picked the right book, a book which has a high quality high dense of information which by interacting with it will greatly change your mind and knowlodge base, and for this kind of book, you need to give your brain enough time to processing, thus, reading word by word is a good technic, you are not here scaning words, but processing information thoroughly and hopefully rewiring your brain. If you feel you need to speed read a book, it only shows that it is just a waste of time to read that book, the sense of fullfilling from completing one more book, is just a self lying useless thing. And, the fact about fast reading a book, is just like fast reading music sheets, it is never about fast reading itself, but about how familiar you are with those basic and neccesary knowlodges. Some people read music sheet really fast, because they are familiar with those basic music patterns, chords,etc, they don't need to read it note by note, but chunk by chunk because they know those chunks. You will become a faster reader after you read a lot of books and  built a big knowlodge base , you don't need to speed anything, and the only thing you need to speed is building your knowlodge base and thinking .",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@MartínCalvoRubio,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:58 🧠 Acting like a degenerate in your youth can form bad habits and lead to continued degenerate behavior. It's essential to focus on self-improvement and productivity from a young age. 06:50 🤝 Surrounding yourself with loser friends can drag you down. The people you associate with significantly impact your self-image and your level of success. 07:17 💄 Looks maxing and building social media status can make you more popular in high school and college. Being physically attractive and having a strong online presence can boost your popularity. 10:37 😂 Being funny and charismatic can enhance your social appeal. It's about having the courage to express your sense of humor and developing warmth, power, and presence. 15:42 🎉 Initiating and hosting social events can make you more popular. Being the one who takes the lead in organizing gatherings can increase your social value. 19:14 🚹 Pursue high-quality relationships regardless of your age. 20:12 🎉 Enjoy social events, but don't overdo them, especially when it involves late nights, partying, and drugs. 21:06 🚫 Don't engage in degenerate behaviors just because you feel like you're missing out; focus on what aligns with your values and interests. 29:05 🎉 Social experiences improve with age as you work hard, make more money, and meet higher-quality people. 36:56 🚷 Transition from low-quality friendships to a period of solitude, and then attract higher-quality people into your life by improving your social skills. 37:39 🤝 When attending social events, be a value giver, not a leech, to maintain invitations and enhance your social standing. 38:45 🌟 Bringing charismatic personalities or attractive people to social events can significantly increase your value and social status. 42:30 🤔 Evaluate your friends based on warmth, presence, power, social skills, and future projection to determine their value as friends. 44:06 🚪 Gradually reduce contact with low-quality friends who don't align with your self-improvement goals to enhance your own progress. 48:07 📚 To excel academically, prioritize high-impact activities using the 80/20 rule and tackle the most challenging tasks first thing in the morning. 57:43 🧠 Prioritize your tasks: Focus on your most important task, like studying, first thing in the morning when you wake up, even before eating. This can lead to improved concentration and better results. 59:37 🚫 Avoid merging socialization with study: Keep your study and work time separate from socialization. Minimize distractions, silence your phone, and create a dedicated workspace. 01:00:47 🏡 Create a productive workspace: Don't believe the myth that you can't work in your own room. Set up your environment to be conducive to focus and productivity. 01:02:37 🕐 Use the 80/20 rule: Identify the 20% of actions that yield 80% of the results in your studies. Focus on high-impact tasks and prioritize your time accordingly. 01:03:21 🍻 Assess the cost of partying: Understand that partying, alcohol, and lack of sleep can impact your academic and business performance. Be selective about your social activities and prioritize your goals.  Made with HARPA AI",2년 전,0,

@TheVivek00700,"Measure ""We can only manage what we can measure"" Pick a book that's mostly text.  Count number of words per page (just estimate it) Read for one minute Calculate WPM  Tips:  1. Utilize peripheral vision Scanning left to right using your eyes takes a lot of effort and uses up time. Don't read till the edges. Instead, use peripheral vision to read at the boundaries of the line. Keep on increasing the edge boundary, thus reducing horizontal eye travel. You'll start to read only the middle third of the page (horizontally)  2. Use a pacer Use a pacer like dragging your finger across each line. This is because your eyes keep jumping from one point to another and this takes time. Keeping a pacer helps your eyes move along that path and also move it smoothly in a linear way.  3. Read slightly faster than you can For 5 minutes, read faster than you can. Just make sure you have full comprehension. This makes your eyes and brain really focus on the content. Then move to regular speed. This will also help you increase your reading speed gradually.",3년 전,1,

However, a non-fiction book requires all words to be read. The reason I want to speed read is to read my Science book quickly and consume all the information. For some reason I can't do that. It may be because of the font size, the lack of understandment of the content (since my Science books are high level for my age) or that I'm skim reading and skippig out words.

@WillN2Go1,"I love these Tim Ferriss videos. I've learned so much from him 4 Hour Work Week changed my life. So many simple concepts. (I'd never before compared what it cost to travel with what I spend at home. I've got cheap rent, but I still spend more than I do staying at hostels and camping overseas. In fact some months of travel it costs me more to pay for my house back in the States than it does traveling that month. Ferriss got me to realize this.  Thanks. And 4 hour work week? I made more money before getting out of bed this morning than I used to in almost all years.)  I disagree a bit with speed up 30mph part. Anders Ericsson citing different, but very successful Deliberate Practice methodologies says they first start off getting the motions perfect, doing this by learning them as slow as it takes to make the motions without making any mistakes. In a music school in NY state (attended by YoYo Ma and other notables) they say that in the first week of learning a new piece if walking past the practice rooms you can tell what the piece is, they're going too fast. Also Spartec the Moscow tennis school that's produced as many tennis champions as the whole U.S. beginners practice slowly moving the racket so three months later when they start hitting balls their form is perfect. So here the method would be to slowly practice the saccades as you read a page. boom       boom       boom       new line  boom      boom     boom  until they are automatic.  I think the first thing you want to do is build  the motion but knowing you still have comprehension.  (The very narrow center of our vision fovea is the only part that is sharp enough to be able to read letters, so if you think I'll do two saccades per line - it physically probably won't work. I'm guessing three saccades per line, but I might be wrong.  What I've noticed as I get old and I've got these annoying floaters, but  I can 'read' words and numbers that are completely blurry. This is based on years of practice; I might be able to read a popular paperback with bigger jumps, I wouldn't be able to read a scholarly article with words and concepts that are new to me. ) I've also noticed that sometimes I find myself at the bottom of a page and I don't have a clue what I've just read. I will always go back and re-read. During a session with a therapist she said something that I realized I completely blanked. So I asked her to repeat it. Again a total blank. So I asked her to repeat it word by word while I wrote it down. ""My brain didn't (wouldn't) hear that."" She was happy that I'd caught the resistance (?)  I noticed it this once, but while reading I've noticed it a lot more. That section you read but your brain skipped, might be something you really need to know.  And yes I think most of us can benefit from working on this. I've found that sometimes I just sort of meander while reading.  Hope this contributes.",4년 전,1,

@RIanCold,"#TimFerriss Thanks very much. The important thing is to understand that our brains are incredible but we tend to have learnt to use them very inefficiently. When I teach English to young non-native children I show them an image for one or 2 seconds. ""What is it?"" ""dog"" More information, please ""A big dog"" More ...eventually we get to ""It's a big brown dog with a long tail"" Over time I can include more detailed images. So, what's my message? If we challenge our brains, it takes up the challenge and surprises us. The same works with reading, we do NOT read with our eyes, we read with our brain. Written words are a graphical representation of verbal communication/information, they reach our brain through our eyes. We can train our brains to receive this ""information"" much more quickly than we do so now by learning how to read faster while understanding as well, or better.

@TokyoXtreme," @ralphcastillo5796  You should be reading phrases instead of words, basically jumping phrase-to-phrase within written sentences. With practice, it becomes very comfortable, and the speed prohibits you from subvocalizing. It’s never been a big problem for me, but I’ve read about an exercise where you can hum or mumble, in order to disrupt the vocalization process. It’s not an exercise you need to do all the time, but just occasionally until you can break your bad habit.",3년 전,19,

@TokyoXtreme," @mortadella-o6o  I should've mentioned earlier that the eyes of the speed-reader make a limited number of fixations upon the page being read, a bit like a jagged connect-the-dots line back-and-forth down the page. Also it helps to use a finger or other pointing device to help guide your eye from fixation to fixation. Anyway, a much better explanation can be found in Tony Buzan's (RIP) ""Use Your Head"" book, which is one of many excellent books by the man who explains mind maps, memory systems, study techniques, and other reading strategies. It's really the one book I would suggest everyone start with, and it can be found very cheaply if you know where to look 😏",3년 전,6,

You can skip words if the text is easy to understand and the loss of reading comprehension will not outweigh the gained speed but there is no reason to skip words at the side of the book just skip words when you can predict the sentence already.,5년 전,0,

@benth162,"First we must define comprehension.  What is it?  Comprehension is subjective but they try and measure it anyway by gauging speed and then testing the memory of the subject  It has more to do with your memory capability, and that takes longer to attain through practice, more than just learning to read fast.  I believe that comprehension is stifled because of the mechanics of speed reading.  All you will get with speed reading is a dull mechanical understanding of the text.  Reading is more than the mechanical aspect of reading because the mind wanders into visions of our imagination which makes reading much more fulfilling because it becomes the landscape of our escape.  I speak primarily of recreational reading such as a novel.  Reading school text uses less imagination because it is dry and emotionless.  That is when speed reading becomes valuable.  Remember my friends, reading for pleasure is satisfying when done slow such that your imagination is engaged and you understand the nuances of what is between the lines, as it were.  Just like the micro expression on a person's face when communicating, what is between the lines of text has just as much impact as do the words on the page because of your imagination !!!",6년 전(수정됨),1,

That makes no sense at all as to how you could comprehend three lines at a time.  I imagine that it would be good practice to re-read a little of what you have already read at full speed / 10% comprehension lose, and then go back down to a comfortable rate once you get back to where you left off. So open the book to the bookmark, flip back a few pages, read as fast as you can while still being able to comprehend what is on the page, and then slow down once you get back to your bookmark. This way you can get more comfortable driving 40 or 50 mph by pushing yourself to go faster every time you pick up the book. This probably has its limits as to how fast you can go comfortably but sounds like a good idea.",6년 전,0,

It's also a great way to develop a less ""forced"" or ""bookmarked"" way of getting the periphery awareness developed.

IF (and I repeat, only IF) it can be proven that no comprehension is lost by practicing speed reading techniques (as opposed to torturing your stomach or not digesting food well, when speed eating), what's bad about it?  I really think the analogy isn't justified, but with your degree I really like to hear your insights on that.",7년 전,0,

@eyemedicsoptometry2155,"Hi Tim!  I’m commenting here for two reasons:  1. Your first book was life changing … a quantum leap! 2. I don’t want people to be mislead (esp. those teaching children).  You opened your video with a caveat, warning listeners about the pseudo-science / nonsense of speed reading (SR) courses.  But after watching your video it appears you have joined, unknowingly(?), the ranks of those you warned us against.   I know speed reading (SR) is not your field of expertise, but being who you are increases the risk of misleading thousands!  Your solutions/suggestions to increasing reading speed, while maintaining comprehension, is not supported clinically or in the real world. Nor is it supported by the science of visual processing or learning / comprehension.  Simply put, it does not work.  Also, my clinical experience and understanding of vision neurology, suggest speed reading (along with improved comprehension) cannot work without lowering comprehension.     Can someone be taught to speed read?  Yes.  But at some point, it becomes a detriment to overall reading comprehension.  And is not comprehension (learning) the main reason why we read in the first place?      My take:  - Words per minute (WPM).  This is overrated and means nothing in and of itself.  Unless, of-course, you are more interested in knowing how many words you can fixate your eyes on within a set time-period.  But what does one gain from such an exercise? - Children are NOT taught to ‘read’ word-for-word, as you stated.  First, they are taught the alphabets.  Then they are taught to group these alphabets into words (vocabulary).  Lastly, they are taught to string these words together to form meaning (sentence).  This process of ‘stringing words together’ is what defines the act of ‘reading’.    - People use both the fovea and peripheral retina to read.  But it is the areas ‘outside’ the central fovea (para-fovea / peripheral retina) that do the lion share during the reading process.  (note: vision/comprehension occurs in the brain…not the eyes). - Using the finger as a reading guide does not increase reading comprehension.  Nor can it prevent saccadic eye movements.  No matter how hard you try, the eyes still saccades (fixates) in front of the finger when reading. This is because ‘vision’ always leads ‘action’ (movement).  Besides, saccadic eye movements are designed to HELP reading and comprehension.  Clinically, when I see a child (or adult) using a finger to aid reading, this potentially points to a hidden vision problem.      - If a person really wants to improve reading speed, but without decreasing comprehension, I suggest studying vocabulary and reading more often!    It is clear to me people who promote speed reading programs do not understand vision and the role it plays in learning/comprehension.   At one time I owned about 2,000 books, and to be candid, I barely remember 5% of what I’ve read over the past 20-years, and maybe 10% of what I’ve read over the past 12-months.  If I were to take speed reading into consideration, I’m willing to bet these numbers would fall under 1% and 5%, respectively.  It’s not the quantity, but the quality, enjoyment and knowledge one gains from reading that matters most.    Tim, if a person really wants to understand what really occurs during the reading process, and ways to improve reading, I suggest they contact the following organizations:  - College of Optometrists in Vision Development (COVD) - Optometric Extension Program Foundation (OEPF)  Sorry for the long, hastily written comment, but years ago you made an impact on my life.  I don’t want to see you spend time in areas outside your modus operandi.  Doing so risks losing credibility in the academia, medical and main street communities.  Keep inspiring us with the great content you are so well known for.  Unfortunately, this video doesn’t fit that mold.         Sincerely, drjs",7년 전(수정됨),0,

It's not like a major commitment in time. If it doesn't work, you are out a couple hours of time. That's a very little risk for a decent reward.",8년 전,17,

This obviously depends upon your own level of comprehensive ability, speed reading ability, and memory. Also, we've been taught to read at like a 7 year Olds pace.

This to me is called Growth and evolution in how you can further your ability to read. Think about aliens, how would they read and understand the world if they evolved on a different dimension of existence?

@Snow4LifeNEver,"I believe he is not the one who is missing the mark. He explicitly compares his method to a Ferrari,  a simple tool basically. Having a printer available doesn't mean you need to get rid of your pen, just as having a pen doesn't mean a printer wouldn't be useful.  Being ABLE to read much faster with minimal loss of comprehension is an extra tool that can become super handy. If you read carefully every single word of a whole book, you're losing precious time comparing and cross checking all the useless sentences. By having this Ferrari available, you can skim through the dull looking landscapes and slow down once you pass by more interesting ones that are worthy of extra attention.  I am an extremely slow reader, but in terms of audio, I always increase the playback speed of videos to at least 1.2x up to 3x the speed. People might complain that I don't have the time to reflect on more complex issues that require more attention, but the truth is that I never play those passages at the maximum speed and often even rewind them multiple times. And if I'm listening to something in another language, I usually slow down the speed below 1.0x.  Being able to read up to 4x faster is definitely useful! And if you still don't see how it can be useful, then you're the one missing the point.",6년 전(수정됨),17,

@mindasb,"The optimization itself will be a focus that will affect comprehension negatively is my experience (subjective assessment of sample size = 1). By that I mean, that there is little room to have a ""conversation with the book"" (where you jot down important points, the ideas you had, questions). I sometimes walk around the room thinking about the concept I have just read for 10-20 minutes which I believe gives a lot of value and could be lost (i) or makes the reading speed not really the bottleneck (ii). However I don't think the ""high achievers"" of this world are doing ""conversation with the book"" type of reading? It seems like they are more speed readers. It would be nice to see an article about ""reading habits of successful people"" not only stating the volumes, but the styles of reading, the schedules and so on.
