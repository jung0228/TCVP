No don’t get me wrong I’m not saying she can’t sing Victorious proved that, but she puts too much of other legends into her voice so it isn’t her voice anymore. So her singing these songs in their voices comes easily to her and should be no shock. I just wish she was more her less other artist that we already have in her own music.

Dicekek supaya suaranya rusak, digorok, digantung.  4. Lidah digesek gesek pakai cabe supaya bisu, dan suaranya rusak.  5. Gigi digetok pakai skenario kecelakaan, dibuat gigi berlubang supaya tidak bisa menempati posisi Ratu Islam atau Raja Islam jadi di bor gigi mereka setelah itu dimasukin makanan basi.  6. Dibakar pakai skenario kebakaran dan supaya kulit putih mereka gosong, dikasih minum alkohol kemudian dikasih panas""an.  7. Tulang mereka bentuk""  8. Tidak suka rambut tebal mereka jadi dijambak supaya Ratu Islam itu jelek dan tidak bisa menempati posisi Raja atau Ratu Islam di masa depan.  9.

Ever Got angry on people?(anger=murder) Ever Stolen? Ever Lusted after someone?(lust=adultery)  Because Everyone has sinned against God and became worthy of death(☆Rom 6:23) but God being a Loving Father sent His only beloved Son for us on the Cross✝️ to be Sacrificed as a ransom for our sins(We committed crime,  Jesus paid fine ☆John 3:16).

@joshd8342,"Christina has a great voice for sure, however she lacks control which is very evident when trying to hit high notes where most of the time she is either shouting or have to scale up to hit a high note. Technically gifted singers like Mariah and Whitney just have to open thier mouth and go straight to the note they want to hit, no scaling nor shouting needed, that's why thier belts, and runs sounds divine and effortless.  When Christina goes in for the high notes, she sounds like a dying cat or about to have diarhea.  She sounds very pleasant though when singing within her comfortable range.  The thing that is off putting with Christina is just she just tries too hard in everything, resulting in oversinging.   You can just tell when she's singing that she wishies she has an extra octave or two, but unfortunately she doesn't.",2년 전,3,

@Them-x4p, @joshd8342  Whitney and Mariah’s voice didn’t hold up well into their 40s. Their control whether you agree or not didn’t hold up as they aged. Their belted notes turn into shouted off pitched notes. Christina however knew what her voice and played with a lot when she was younger and now chooses to use it in a controlled way because she’s getting older. Old methods require new methods.  Christinas recent concerts and performances test to that if you care to see them.,2년 전(수정됨),0,
@joshd8342," @Them-x4p  Who cares?   Everyone's voice changes with age.  What matters is what they did and what they were able to do during their prime.  Mariah and Whitney are supreme vocalists with numerous vocal skills and impeccable technique.   Christina is just pure noise and lacks control on the upper register, just look at her face when trying to belt.  Mariah and Whitney can just open their mouth and hit the note they want even smiling without needing to scale up.  Chritina is pleasant to hear when she's singing in her comfortable zone, but the problem with her is she always try hard to hit the high notes but lacks the skills and control and range to execute thereby just creating just pure noise.   That's the problem with Xtina, such a trying hard singer, you can tell she wishes she has one or 2 more octaves in her pipes, but unfortunately she doesn;'t.  Whitney and Mariah doesn't even need to belt when singing and you will still be in awe as to how perfect and skillful their voices are.  Xtina doesn;t even realize that there is more to singing than belting.  She is nothing compared to the legends that are Whitney and Mariah, not even close!",2년 전,0,

@jesuslovesyou8404,"Hey! To whoever is reading this, you are so loved and you matter!And right now I just want to tell you about Jesus😊you don’t have to listen to me, you don’t have to agree with me, but I promise you that Jesus loves you so much and He died for you out of that love!❤️  Jesus died for every single person on the cross,He died for me, you, him, her, them and everyone all so we could be made right with God! “For God so loved the world he gave his one and only beggoten Son, that whoever so believed in him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16)  now don’t worry if you’re a little bit confused by what that means— when I say that “Jesus died so we could be made right with God”,what I mean is that Jesus payed the debt for our sins in full, He died so that every single one of us could be forgiven by God for our sins. we have all sinned against God(what that means is that we’ve all made mistakes & fallen short of Gods biblical law), BUT God loves YOU so much that He sent a saviour, He sent His one and only Son so that YOU could be forgiven for all your sins, have that burden taken off you and start again through Jesus!Jesus saves us from our sins and the consequences from those sins, but He also saves us with His love, His peace that surpasses all understanding, His Joy and His grace!   Jesus loves you so much and God loves YOU so much that if you accept Him(Jesus) as your Lord and saviour, confess your sins to Him and believe God raised him from the dead HE WILL save you and you can spend forever with Him! “If you declare with your mouth,”Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved” (Romans 10:8)    now you may be thinking “ I want to believe in Jesus, I think do believe in Him but there’s a part of me that doesn’t” DONT PANIC, JESUS WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU! He knows your heart, He knows what’s going on for you, He knows you want to believe more and more in Him, just talk to Him about it, whatever is on your mind don’t worry Gods got it!there is never any issue that is too big for God, I promise you He understands it all!  “ if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9)  “Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me” (Psalm 51:10)  There is nothing you could ever do for Him to stop loving you, Jesus loves you! And let me tell you, this isn’t one of those kind of relationships where you spend half the time sitting around thinking “Hmmm do they really love me?” Because Jesus already wants a relationship with you! He loves you, He literally died so you could be forgiven!  when He died for us on the cross He thought about us individually, He knows you personally, He knows your heart, He knows your situation,He knows all the things you’ve done and regret, He knows how much you wish someone could understand the things you don’t say and how you wish they knew what was really going on for you. Jesus knows it all, He doesn’t see you as your mistakes, nor does He see you as your regrets, He sees you for your heart, for who you are  and He sees you as someone he cares and loves for deeply!He loves you! I don’t know if you need to hear this, but just in case you do I also need to assure you that God is NOT waiting for you mess up! He’s not waiting to leave you (in-fact he promises to never leave or forsake you), BUT what He IS WAITING for is for you to accept Him into your life so you never have to feel alone again! He is a genuine, forgiving,all loving, He is a rock for everyone and a saviour for everyone!   Jesus loves you more than you could ever know and He’s waiting to lift that weight off your shoulders, He’s waiting to take away all your pain and hurt, He’s waiting to welcome you with open arms, He’s waiting to forgive you, He’s waiting to save you!HE LOVES YOU!thank you for reading this, have a great day and there is no better moment than right now to accept JESUS into your life! Repent and turn away from your sins, GOD LOVES YOU! He is “the way and the truth and the life” No one comes to the Father except through Him, (John 14:6) He wants you to be with Him one day in heaven!put your trust in Him! God wants to save you! God bless ❤️❤️❤️",4년 전,0,

@davidshanholtz6674," @rehanakousar3328  it actually makes more sense when you think about it. In (our) football, we throw passes and run the ball, and we also kick the ball sometimes during kick-off, field goals, and punts. Really, in all actuality, in what we call “football,” the ball is handled by the hands much more often than by the feet, whereas in soccer, the ball is only handled by the feet, never by the hands, except when blocking by a goalie. I think they can use their hands anyway, but I could be wrong on that! It does make more sense to call soccer football, not that I’m saying I want it changed or advocating for it because I love football, actual football, and I wouldn’t want to start calling it something else now because soccer stole its name ! Not this late in the game nor! See what I did there? Lol🤪🤣 Also, I’m not sure what this had to do with the original comment. Lol🤷🏼‍♂️",4년 전,1,

@jeffclark2675,"in more than 4 decades on this planet, and as a singer who has been professionally trained i am just gonna say arianas wheels on the bus performance here may be literally the best i have ever seen in my life.  i am sitting here completely blown away.  i have never heard anybody hit runs as difficult as she did with such effortless precision.  i was almost brought to tears by the realization that i had just witnessed true genius.   with this kind of talent it glaringly obvious that the fact that she isnt a legend like on the mariah carey or whitney houston level is ONLY because she has not had the right songwriter/production/magic/moment/break.  gosh i hope it happens for her.

Now if you say you don’t like a celebrity it’s like everyone that likes that celebrity takes offense because they feel I’ve insulted them for liking said celebrity.  My initial comment was I think her impression of xtina was trash and to me Melissa Villasenor did it better.

The continuing pop artist sell-out stuff where you can always expect that they don’t write their own music, can’t okay any instruments and they dress like drag queens because that’s all they are selling is sexuality and bouncy church voices, Someone, for the love of god, please give them something memorable to sing! Bb King, Led Zeppelin, Johnny Cash music. Better yet, write them an original that will last the test of time like Hey Jude or most Queen songs. Someone please guide them back to real music so they can understand how to create art! Take notes from Billy Eilish, Grande, she can help you! One Maria Carey in the world is enough!",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@Michelle-pn9xt,Wow! The level of ignorance is..... She probably wears glasses. She may not want to wear them on TV. Have you ever met a person who wears glasses or contacts? Needing  glasses or not having 20/20 vision does not make anyone stupid.,5년 전,0,
@линаЛен, @Michelle-pn9xt  what I meant by stupid is the characters she played. But in real life she is not better. Sorry if I offend one of her stupid fan but this girl is disgusting and has disgusting personality. Now go away with your ignorance because I am not going to waste my time with miserable people,5년 전,0,
@Michelle-pn9xt, @линаЛен  I don't know you. I am glad that I don;'t. You have no reason to call  anyone names.  Please don't contact me anymore. You seem to have strange anger issues. She did what she was asked to do.,5년 전,0,

@minnie3497," @andthebanshees  I mean look at their MR removed videos. I already know what you're gonna say ""they're ""dancing"". But moving your arms around and doing body rolls is not dancing anyone could do that so they still wouldn't be stable.",6년 전,0,
@andthebanshees,"minnie mr removed videos aren’t always accurate and they have A LOT of good mr removed videos as well. any kpop idol has bad mr removed vids. and they only have one song with body rolls?? 💀 a choreography doesn’t have to have them jumping around or crazy footwork for it to require energy. no, not everyone can do what they do lmao",6년 전,0,
@minnie3497, @andthebanshees  Agreed. But they have multiple songs with Body Rolls DDDD and KTL but anyways they're kinda ok when they have minimal chereo or no chereo at all. All they need to do is improve more vocal wise to step up on Ari's level.,6년 전,0,
@andthebanshees,"minnie nah, they’re actually pretty great with minimal choreo if you check out their concert mr removed vids. they don’t have to be on ari’s level to collab tho you act like they’re the worst lmao 🗿, and KTL could barely count as body rolls lmao...",6년 전,0,

@matrix23225," @sofiacruz7705  : Most artists improve over time that's a given. But to say BAD technique, I disagree. Was and is as good as most great female singers of our time, by checking her singing live, you can hear that she’s always in pitch, can sing the notes either high or low whenever she wants, has no trouble in belting high notes over and over again, and has her skills downgraded because people think she’s straining, when she obviously isn't. As you can check on her cover of Whitney’s hit, “I have nothing”, everything is on point, she can sing with volume control, very defined vibrato, good diction, great pitch, very good transitions.  If she was so bad, then how is that she has come so far? hmmmm",6년 전,0,

Listening to Ariana's songs on the radio or on TV almost makes me mad, because I can't understand why any producer would butcher such an incredible voice and make it sound as generic as any other female pop singer out there. She can do whatever she wants, of course. If she thinks she's with the right people and she feels good working with them, alright then. But I really, really hope she'll one day end up working with someone, who will appreciate her voice in all its natural brilliance and leave it just like it is.",6년 전,0,

@MrBoybergs,'My everything' .......... stunning vocal.,6년 전,16,
@johnnydtractive," @MrBoybergs   I agree, in a way. Ariana has an amazing voice, I just don't like her style. She traps her voice in her nose & throat & jaw so that the clarity is lost. I find her style too muddy (partly due to lack of enunciation), breathy & ultra-feminine.  You know that clip of her impersonating Whitney Houston? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0WM4CRWO0E) Her voice there is so clear, she doesn't trap it at all & the sound is very bell-like & beautiful. It's obvious there that she actually has beautiful tone, & I wish she actually sang more like that, rather than the style she uses. Again, she has an AMAZING voice, I just think the true quality is lost in the style she uses.  I know lots of people love her style tho.  I actually like her more for her personality, sense of humour, & outspokenness. & she has an amazing relationship with her fanbase, I really respect that.",6년 전,36,

Plus, she wasn’t even sober when she did and said that; she was high off laughing gas and other drugs after having her wisdom teeth removed. And how can somebody hate Americans when they themselves are an American? That doesn’t make any sense. My point exactly, she was intoxicated and didn’t what the hell she was doing.

But it's important to know that moving your jaw doesn't always mean jaw tension.,7년 전,0,

@TheMannSays,"Ariana Grande can sing and do really good impressions of the three singers she impersonated in this clip. She is however very annoying and extremely full of herself and it comes across clearly, which is not a good thing. She is terrible at acting and should never do that again. The way she sings with the constant vocal gymnastics and shoving her head back and sticking out her chin, is irritating as hell.

Her parents didn't  know anything about the music industry and I love her and her music. Being nice to everyone is just her personality. If you want her to mean then believe the rumors about her being a diva and shit. She has big hits on all of her albums bc she works with the people who get what she wants her music to be. And she is fucking talented.",8년 전,11,
@abrilcarbajales1487,"Ok.I am not here to try to make a stupid fight because that is this chat..stupid.If someone wants to give his/her opinion,be my guest.But if no one asked you for that opinion shut(in general) you mouth.Because there are a lot of people that loves Ariana and i think she's talented because of her powerful voice at that age.Besides,if her parents are rich and put her on a Broadway show that is going to make her famous,it doesn't mean that some kind of angel is going to give her a perfect voice.The other thing is that we don't know how is Ariana's personality because we don't live with her and we're not her friends or family.I'm m sorry if this message offended someone but i think the ""mature"" thing is shut our mouths an let the others be happy.Again,I'm sorry if I offended someone and sorry for my writing because I'm not from USA soooo...have a happy day or night and good bye.",8년 전,3,

And imagine returning back to our city so soon and having the courage to stand up on a stage after that happened with families of those victims looking on. I'm not particularly a pop fan, but for me she has proved she is an incredible role model for young people. Hell, not even just young people, for me.

@MrStickyrice420,"what kind of drugs makes u look like that?  or do you me she was probably stoned. Because usually drugs are like coke, meth or heroin and she wouldn't be looking that.

She's an American, that HATES Americans. I'm not quite as forgiving for the attitude, but I've never said she was bad or ever categorized her with Bieber. It's mostly Americans who buys her albums, digital downloads, merchandise, and concert tickets. If she had no American fans, she would be like Cherie Curry in 1975 with The Runaways. Cherie now makes a living with chain saw art and lives in a small ranch house. Being a great singer doesn't matter sometimes. No fans=no money=no career as a musician.",8년 전,0,

@AJ-wz9lr," @JustAZillennial  I agree to disagree. As a huge disney nerd, Ariana does not have a musical voice. She has an amazing voice, don't get me wrong, but for a musical like the Little Mermaid, she wouldn't be the best choice. Musical theater requires good pronunciation, and the way Ariana sings, it is hard to understand what she is saying at times. That is just her style and I personally believe that that kind of style would not be good for The Little Mermaid.",5년 전(수정됨),5,
@JustAZillennial," @AJ-wz9lr  She's sung Part of Your World before, though. She has her own style of singing, but she's able to copy other genres and singers. Matching Jodi Bensen's version wouldn't have been a problem. I'm sure the girl Disney picked isn't going to sound anything like the original. Of course it's a matter of preference, for example, Idina Menzel's version of Let It Go sounded much better to many people than Demi Lovato's. Although I'm very disappointed that Ariana isn't going to play Ariel, that's not the reason why I'm not going to see it. They're changing Ariel from white to black. It's nonsensical. Back when the original fairytale books were written, the authors weren't thinking of their storybook characters as black because blacks weren't thought of as equals with whites. It would have been nice if Ariana was chosen, but Disney could have chosen another white girl if they didn't want her.",5년 전,0,

She's a modern day contestant for a new vocal trinity. For those that don't know....there was a vocal trinity that started in the 90s, that has yet to be duplicated. The vocal trinity consisted of Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, and Mariah Carey. This has never happened in the past, but hopefully it can be repeated. Ariana Grande is definably a contender. Given her vocal abilities....I'm not sure why record companies aren't looking for two more female singers to create a new vocal trinity.

In person, that look is nice because you can still wear make-up without looking like you are going to a red carpet premier.",9년 전,4,

Because of your great compassion,     blot out the stain of my sins. 2 Wash me clean from my guilt.     Purify me from my sin. 3 For I recognize my rebellion;     it haunts me day and night. 4 Against you, and you alone, have I sinned;     I have done what is evil in your sight. You will be proved right in what you say,     and your judgment against me is just.[a] 5 For I was born a sinner—     yes, from the moment my mother conceived me. 6 But you desire honesty from the womb,[b]     teaching me wisdom even there. 7 Purify me from my sins,[c] and I will be clean;     wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 8 Oh, give me back my joy again;     you have broken me—     now let me rejoice. 9 Don’t keep looking at my sins.     Remove the stain of my guilt. 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God.     Renew a loyal spirit within me. 11 Do not banish me from your presence,     and don’t take your Holy Spirit[d] from me. 12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation,     and make me willing to obey you. 13 Then I will teach your ways to rebels,     and they will return to you.
