@HR-wd6cw,"I wish US airports would adopt this concept for those who have layovers.    I have had times where I had a 4-5 hour layover after a long 8 hour flight (for which I maybe didn't sleep much if at all) and then have another flight a few hours later and would like to just sleep for a bit.  I think they would actually make quite a bit of money.  Maybe limit it to 8 or 12 hours max per 24 hour period so people can't just ""live"" in the pods and to allow others to take advantage of the space.  I'm really surprised these don't really exist in any of the major US airports (that I know of).  I mean for the noise, if you had ear buds you could put in, or ear plugs, that would work.  But even just being able to lie down for a bit would be enough in some cases, even if you didn't fall asleep, since in most cases, you're sitting upright possibly for a long period of time.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Hotels are expensive, so this would be a nice alternative and you don't have to go anywhere just to have to come back. This should be available in all airports  I used to work at Kennedy Airport, in the food court, and I can definitely see people being really happy about this. Sometimes people have connecting flights, but the times are different. People can stretch out in these pods. Traveling can be very tiring.

I know they have them in other airports,  New Delhi is one I think.  Never tried one but compared to sleeping on an airport seat it's got to be better. Thais normally have harder beds in my experience so it's probably not a surprise that they are harder in the pods. Thais also don't use toilet paper. Often they have a spray which I prefer but you do end up with a wet bum. Quite often there's no way to dry your hands after washing them but I have seen those toilet rolls in in our local Tesco shopping centre. Absolutely useless as it's so thin it breaks up when wet.  I also can't understand why there's a flat bit on the escalator as it just seems wasted.  Three only thing I can think is that if a case rolls down it might not go as far.   Nice video and showed me something new.  Maybe I'll try it.",5년 전,0,

@skontheroad2666,"No, every airport has lounges. Owned and operated either by the airport or the airline. Access is granted based on your airline status or membership, either to a specific airline's lounge program (for frequent travelers of that airline), or through a partnership based your status with your preferred airline, or with the Priority Pass, which has different levels of membership based on different things (how you got it or purchased it). They can range from basic amenities (free beer, wine and snacks) to luxurious spaces with free top shelf craft cocktails, showers, conference rooms you can book for meetings should you just need to pop into a city for a meeting and want to maximize time. I can't remember the last airport I was in that did not have a lounge, and I am on a plane every other week. And traveling for work does get old btw, whoever posted that they would never tire of it.... but I built a life around it and I don't complain and would not stop, but sometimes I need a break (honestly, just to appreciate being back on the road again).  Even they posted that every 6 months they go home to repack bc they bought too much stuff (more likely they go to see family, friends and sleep in their own beds as mailing their stuff home would be cheaper!).",5년 전,0,
@skontheroad2666,"@Isabel Weinberg You probably are not looking for them. They are often upstairs once you have gone through security. Or in the main level, but they usually have a fairly discreet door and small sign. What is the main, major International airport closest to where you live ( or that you most often)? With the AMEX platinum card for example, you get access to the Centurion lounge which is separate from the airline lounges, but usually the better choice if you happen to be in an airport with one (they don't have enough yet, but their site has more info in what is coming). All you need is a boarding pass for that day (I think it has to be within 4 or 6 hours of your flight). Some airports have separate first class lounges. But access is granted to the majority of the others around the world as I described above. There are whole websites devoted just to how to get lounge access, best lounges, who has what amenities where, etc. For many, it is a huge part of their travel experience (which is why many charge a separate membership fee to coach travelers. Are you global entry? Or do you have TSA pre-check? They are usually included in the fee as well. And signage generally starts when you pass thru that security side.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@SoldtotheHighestBidder,It's cyber style! Another traveler showed a casket hotel like this in Vietnam which was downtown and had a bathroom. It's even more cyber style and higher quality. Seoul airport has a place in the basement you can rent to shower and bathe in a big hot tub and then you have the option sleep in a tiny room a bit larger than a coffin with clear glass wall and door to prevent sex from happening. It was only $17 a night to bathe and sleep about five years ago which is very useful to come the evening before an early morning flight out. It even had a Starbucks right out in the hall along with McDonald's.,5년 전,0,

@Gareths-Travels,"Hi Kara and Nate , Do you think it was worth it ?  As you know yourselves it may have been novel but in a place like Bangkok for a 15hr layover it would not be worth it . And the Info that you posted on the Avagard Capsule hotel was not full and correct .  There are hotels within a 3-4km taxi drive of the airport  . OYO 376 Ok home airport  17$ per Room  with a pool . L42 Hostel , Private room for 2 people 17$ private shower , free hotel pick-up .  Zen rooms 25$ with shower . and these are just 3 there are 20 or more hotels with double rooms , showers and facilities , Also  there are Hostels with dorm rooms starting at around 5$ ,   If people want more options then a 30min taxi ride gets them into central Bangkok for around 9$ or you can use the Skytrain which is an overhead train to get you from the airport to the center of town costs around 2$  between 06am and midnight . So if people have a 10-15hr layover there are a lot better options ,  but if you don`t need or want to leave the airport or your layover is around 6-10hrs then this is the one of the best options  . but only for the daytime tarife . But the info is the Avagard capsule hotel has 2 prices there is an option from 10am until 5pm ,  7hrs for 800Baht = 26$ per Capsule   . The other option is from 6pm to 9am , 15hrs  2200Baht =72$ per Capsule . So 72$ for a night in a loud capsule with no place to shower . where they kick you out at 9am is not worth it   If you haven`t access to a lounge with a shower and you don`t need a bed ,  there are 2 possibilities that i have found . Before you enter the airport at the Novotel hotel for 600Baht or Inside the airport at the Miracle transit hotel for 350Baht  ( shower info from a website called jackthedreamer.com )",5년 전,0,

@mommymarine1756,"They slept at the capsule because they’d never stayed there before. Since they’ve been in Bangkok before, I’m certain they stayed there for the lounge not necessarily the shower or price. When you can shower in the lounge and get free breakfast and coffee, that’s worth not staying NEAR the airport vice IN the airport. Good info for me though. I’m sure no one wants to hear my kids when they’re trying to sleep 😂",5년 전,0,
@Gareths-Travels, @mommymarine1756  But the Lounge and shower were NOTHING to do with the price or booking of the Avagard Capsule hotel  . that was something totally seperate using tickets or lounge passes that they had  .,5년 전,1,
@mommymarine1756,"Gareth, the price comes into play when you wake up in the morn and have to eat. In Kara’s case, it’s coffee and food. For me, it’s food x4.  Idk about BKK but around most airports isn’t good food. Like I said, that probably made it worth it for them. When I watched again though I think what made it worth it was washing the old capsule hotel video from their memory. While staying at a cheaper hotel with a shower may be ideal for some, leaving the airport for them is work. Honestly though, only they can answer your question.",5년 전,0,
@Gareths-Travels," @mommymarine1756  The Capsules are in the Airport but not in the Transit area which means that you DO in affect have to LEAVE , which means entering Thailand , going through immigration  and then going through security again to come back into the airport to catch your next flight . So getting the skytrain into the city or a 3km taxi ride to a nice cheap hotel with breakfast is not a lot more work for a 15hr layover . The only good thing of these capsules is that the check-out time is 4pm so that if you arrive early in the Morning and your next flight is early evening then you can sleep through the normal 11am-midday check out time . but some hotels offer a late check-out option which is still better value than the capsules especially if there are 2 people",5년 전(수정됨),0,
