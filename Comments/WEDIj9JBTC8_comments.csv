@SeniorBalance_H,"Bill Ackman's initial setup with the lemonade stand analogy is a highly effective way to simplify the foundational concepts of raising capital, equity issuance, and the debt vs. equity decision for new investors.  While the video makes a good point about using debt to retain a larger ownership stake, it's equally crucial to consider the inherent trade-offs. Borrowing introduces financial leverage, which can significantly amplify returns if the business thrives, but critically, it also magnifies losses and increases the risk of financial distress or even bankruptcy if the business struggles to meet its fixed interest obligations. Understanding this delicate balance between growth potential and financial stability through an optimal capital structure is a sophisticated challenge that goes beyond just 'keeping more stock'.  Exploring the strategic implications of capital structure decisions and their impact on a company's risk profile and long-term viability is a core theme I often delve into in my content.",2개월 전,1,

Stocks with dividends that can compound, if you don't plan on using the money soon, or you can enjoy the dividend  part ( there's a lot , just look up "" dividend Stocks with consistent pay out"" on Google or whatever search browser you use)  I currently like options because they're cheaper than buying a lotta stock and can pay out the same as selling those stocks..but options are very risky because you can lose it all just as fast, if not faster. Become an early investor in new companies  ( it would take extensive research )  Start a business and once you can afford it hire people to run it OR sell it with an additional legal binding agreement to Royalties ( again..extensive research)  There's a lot of way to legally multiply money as well as lose it so as said before, get a financial advisor.

@НикитаФадеев-ф3ь,"There will be this awareness that we need to rethink how the money system works, we need to get out of a debt-based economy. We cannot allow a small power elite to create money and reap the profit from lending it with interest. This is something that the state needs to take on, and the state needs to be in control of the money system so that only the state benefits and thereby the people benefit. If the state makes money off of money, people do not have to pay so much taxes. It needs to be seen that the only institution in society that has a right to make money off of money is the state. The state, of course, cannot go into the many forms of schemes that the capitalists have come up with in order to manipulate the economy because the state has no interest in manipulating the economy. It simply has an interest in creating a money system that allows for the greatest amount of creativity, movability of the money, the greatest ability to finance new businesses. This will promote a growth in the economy, and the more the economy grows, the more it is in the interest of all of the people and also, of course, in the interest of the state. These are very, very dramatic shifts compared to what you have today but they are not so unrealistic that they are so far off. It can come to that point where there is such an awareness of the existence of power elites that they will very quickly be put out of commission by the democratic nations. There will be either a raised awareness of how the power elites work and how anti-democratic it is, or there would be an awareness that if we do not reform the money system, then our economies, our debt-based economies, are going to collapse. The debt has reached such proportions that no country can pay it back and it is, in fact, in no way democratic, in no way in accordance with the democratic ideals, that the population of an entire country are enslaved financially so that for the next many decades a majority of their resources will go to pay back the interest to a small power elite.

@FeanorsBest,"Lemonade Stand business was a good analogy, but with very critical fallacy that most of the viewers probably lost track in between.  Where did the money come from after first year to buy the second lemonade stand, or the third? Because the company made -10 net income the first year, and only 90 for the second, whereas a stand costs $300. We don't expect a company to make significant revenue in the first couple of years, but the growth via new purchases accelerated the company's growth significantly. That is not realistic in real world. If the company did not have enough income to cover the purchase of additional stands, the capital could have come from several sources:  * Initial Capital Injection: The company might have started with a certain amount of capital that was larger than the cost of one stand, allowing it to purchase additional stands in the subsequent years. In our case, the left over was not enough for this purchase. * Debt Financing: The company could have taken on debt to finance the purchase of more stands. This could be in the form of a loan from a bank or other financial institution. But again, this is also not sensible as no one would be willing to lend to a company not showing profit. * Equity Financing: The company could have issued more shares to raise capital. This would dilute the ownership but provide the necessary funds for expansion. * Deferred Payments: The company might have negotiated deferred payment terms with suppliers, allowing it to acquire assets now and pay for them later. * Owner’s Investment: Additional funds might have been injected by the owners or investors of the business.   None of these are captured for simplicity, but growing a business and moving to the profit territory is not that easy as implicated, and that's why most businesses go to bankruptcy if they can't raise additional funding in someway.",1년 전,0,

@tedpalty,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  📊 Portfolio Management class focuses on applying Modern Portfolio Theory to real-world scenarios. 🤔 The lecturer emphasizes the balance between theory and application in the class. 💭 Students engage in a practical exercise to construct portfolios based on intuition and preferences. 🔄 The learning process involves observation, model building, mathematical analysis, and verification. 💰 Goals of portfolio management include maximizing returns while minimizing standard deviation (risk). 📈 Efficient frontier represents the boundary of optimal portfolio combinations. 📉 The lecture simplifies portfolio theory to a special case involving two assets for intuitive understanding. 🎓 Portfolio management extends beyond investments to consider various financial situations and objectives. 📉 Portfolio management involves optimizing the combination of assets to achieve desired returns with minimal risk. 💼 Diversification is a key strategy where less correlated assets can reduce portfolio variance without sacrificing returns. 📊 Understanding correlation between assets helps in portfolio construction; perfectly correlated assets limit diversification benefits. 🔀 Risk parity allocates assets based on equal risk weighting rather than market value, aiming for a balanced risk-return profile. 💰 Leveraging allows for higher returns by borrowing to invest, but it also increases risk and should be carefully managed. 🔄 Rebalancing ensures the portfolio maintains its desired asset allocation over time, adjusting for changes in market conditions. 📈 Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted returns and can guide portfolio optimization towards maximizing returns for a given level of risk. 📉 Beta measures the sensitivity of a portfolio's returns to market movements, with higher standard deviation increasing beta. 📉 Understanding portfolio beta: Beta measures a portfolio's volatility relative to the equity market, impacting risk. 🌉 London Millennium Bridge: Collapse due to synchronized forces highlights unexpected risks despite advanced technology. 🔄 Market dynamics: Mimicking optimal strategies en masse can lead to system-wide instability, akin to synchronized metronomes. 💡 Portfolio management complexity: Human judgment adds value by considering diverse market factors beyond pure mathematical models. 💼 Managerial roles: Managers play crucial roles beyond investment decisions, including HR and talent management. 💰 Risk parity portfolios: Weighing assets based on historical volatility can backfire during market shifts, raising questions about strategy effectiveness. 📈 Forecasting returns: Accurately predicting returns remains challenging, highlighting the uncertainty in portfolio management. 📚 Kelly criterion: Multi-period investment analysis, such as the Kelly criterion, offers insights into optimal betting strategies and portfolio optimization.

@AnotherAnon735,Something Bill didn't mention is that a company growing does not mean the stock price will increase. The reason lemonade stands generally traded at 20x earnings in his example was because there is a general expectation of how much lemonade stands will grow in the future that is priced in based on their current earnings. Coca Cola and McDonalds are not good investments just because their business makes sense and they are expected to grow- those two considerations are already factored into the price.,1년 전,0,

You have $250 cash left from first year operations and a negative net income (not to mention first year tax somehow reduced losses). Using the projections, the business needs to raise more cash either through debt or equity in order to fund the expansion (15 net loss + 300 new stand + 420 inventory - 250 cash = 485 additional cash needs). Funding the gap in cash requirements with 10% debt would increase interest expense to 73.5. While the business may have a positive EBT in year 2, it will require even more cash for the expansion (300 for third stand + 662 for inventory - 56 net income = 906 additional cash needs). Funding the gap again with debt would result in an interest expense of 164.1 in year 3. Depreciation expense does not just create real cash and the balance sheet depreciates the fixed assets in a extremely random way.",1년 전,8,

@Danny_6Handford,"I did  not earn my living nor earn my wealth by investing in other people’s businesses. Unfortunately, most people get fooled by the markets and by the financial experts, advisers and gurus. If you are smart, you will learn from your mistakes in trusting them and will stay away from the markets and stop listening to the experts and advisors. The stock markets, commodities market and financial markets are basically casinos where people try to outsmart each other but in the end the house always wins and there are always new games to play.    Regardless how predictable people think the boom and bust cycles are and that historical data can predict them, the boom and bust cycles are  staged by the insiders and owners of the trading exchanges (casinos) along with the banks and to some extent the government.  Although governments try to police some of this activity, in reality the government, the corporations that own the exchanges and the banks work as a partnership. If you are not part of this club, chances are you will lose money playing their games. If playing these games is how you plan to make your living, all I can say to you is good luck!  As with any game there is always a lot of bluffing, deception, smoke and mirrors to try and confuse and take advantage of the suckers. The financial experts, advisers and gurus think they have a winning strategy and sometimes they win but just like the players at the casino, most of the time they lose and if they suckered others into following them with their advice they also lose. The suckers can whine and complain all they want but, they will never get their money back. Many of the players try cheating because if they can get away with it they will be considered clever and will usually brag about it. Even if they get caught, most of the time the penalties and the fines are not that bad and if they did not lose all their money will be free to try again.  For those interested,  here are the rules I try to live by with my family:   Number 1: Try not to get deceived, fooled or scammed or become a victim of crime. If you do, learn from the mistakes you made and do not let it happen again. Everybody will make some mistakes in their life.   Number 2: If you had to work hard to earn your money, I do not think you will need to pay or even listen to a financial advisor to tell you what to do with it. Tell the financial advisors to go learn how to earn their own money and use your money to benefit yourself and your family.  Number 3:  Try not to go into debt. Living a happy, productive and successful life for yourself and your family without going into debt is possible.   Number 4: Pay for the stuff you need with whatever money the government accepts as legal tender and request payment for whatever work you do with this government money. Money that is not controlled by the government is way too volatile and unstable and much more risky. Crypto is a good example of this.. Money that is not controlled by governments is much more volatile and unstable and much more risky than government  money. The recent scandal with FTX should at least make you think twice before accepting payments or making payments with crypto.   Number 5: Any extra money you earn during the year that you do not need to live, use it to buy things that you can see and touch and hold their value over time. Gold and silver are good things to buy but there are many other things you can buy that you can see a touch that hold their value.   Number 6:  Learn to live a healthy life without getting addicted to bad habits like smoking, vaping, drugs or alcohol or over eating. Eat real food that has not been produced synthetically in a lab and food that does not have a ton of other things added to it and try to maintain an active lifestyle.  We only have a few decades on this planet and we have to learn to celebrate this time as best we can and being able to earn an honest living without trying to cheat, fool, abuse and take advantage of others and learning not to be cheated, fooled and abused and taken advantage of is the best way to do this.   Number 7:  Learn how to analyze and to determine what sources of information are reliable and what is fake and not true and learn to detect and understand what information is trying to take advantage of you, control you and scam you.",2년 전,1,

So the only true deal one would be able to make here, is (if having a talent) showing the stady at least 12-14%  in value investing or anyother investing with little money they have,  and then invite friends to give them more money.   Conclusion: to put any of this in  action with forcastable perspectives, you need to have 1. Talent 2. Friends with money.

Bill is one of the poets, and being a poet is not something you can be taught. You can manage to identity the poet by this, but not to teach. The key statements in this presentation can be as harmful as they can be of good use. For example: ""the  stock is  reflecting the value of the company"". Well,  once it's listed, it reflects the willingness to buy it, like Amazon, going from $107 per share in early 2000 to a 6$ when company's key ratios were actually only  getting better and better. What you are going to do, if you take that statement for reality during such decline? Musk shows no significant improvement in Tesla activity, but the stock of the company climbs 60% in one month.  So you don't actually buy a share of a company and it's earnings, you're  buying other people's greed or desperation.  What I'm trying to say with this, is  that given the volatility this market is a place where wicked poets take the money of those who are not, and the good ones,  like Bill, just take what's possible to take by active investing.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Are you investing only for pure profit without thinking about how that business or businesses influences the wider world, human welfare, and the environment? How are the short term gains putting the solvency of those businesses-and your investment at risk? Ackman showcases McDonalds as a solid, secure investment.

He has  built up Total Assets of $1750, Liabilities of $250, and cash of $750 He then spends 300+200 of his cash leaving him with 250 cash. Then the stand makes $10 but after paying the loan it looses ($15) So, he has 250 cash earns back the 200 which was the cost of inventory and looses 15 which makes his total cash going into the next year $435. Which means he can run this stand again for another year but this time he's going to increase his prices & not have his inventory cost go up ... BRILLIANT!

@JDWilliamsPD,"Someone asked how to learn to invest and my response is that the three popular types of investing income are (1) capital gains, buy stocks, real estate, etc. low and sell them high (2) dividends, buy stable stocks and receive their dividend income for the life of the company, and (3) interest, buy bonds and recive their interest income for the life of the bond. Simple concepts, but difficult to execute without a plan. I would tell the younger me to not focus on investing alone, but to develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes savings and investing for retirement age. The most powerful tool is time coupled with compound interest. Start early and you are set for life, start late and you have to make big sacrifices to pile every penny you find into tax-friendly compound interest bearing accounts until you catch up. I would hire a human certified financial advisor to setup the initial plan, and switch to a robo-advisor later if I have finally become financially intelligent. If you have at least $25k of investable $ a company like Charles Schwab can get you setup. If you don't have $25k you can google pro bono financial advisors and you will easily find a certified financial advisor who will give you at least one hour of true financial planning. It could take days or weeks to develop the plan, but during your meeting with them you can discuss fees for more in depth planning. Any thoughts?",3년 전,0,

It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC.  More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market.

It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market.

@kenkirkpatrick731," @w8what575  Most highschools have some sort of economics class now. Mine was in 7th grade. It wasn't a good class, but it was something. Anyway, teachers are given freedom to teach classes however they see fit as long as they follow certain criteria like mandatory tests and assigning projects from time to time with the end goal of them teaching the essentials from the midterm and the final exam for the grade. Since it works like that my hope is that some economics teachers will see this and think it's a great video to test their class on or something. Don't get me wrong it's pretty boring to talk about business so I know that most highschool students aren't gonna pay attention, but a few might learn something about it that sparks the interest of a great future business owner.",3년 전,0,

Not sure if the BigThink will see this comment in the 10k that are here but it seems like the investment strategy for year 2 and 2 lemonade stands is critical to understand the whole example. $25 is the only interest paid on 7 stands so only 10% on the original $250.

We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market.This is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don't back up their crypto assets.More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market.I have made over 10.8 btc from day trading with Ryan Willer,  insights and signals in less than 4weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish ..>> :buffering::yt:",3년 전,70,

@leapikkarainen3703,"This is not part of your News yet it should be. Thank you Lord Jesus Christ thank you for giving me the strength to write about what is going on in the USA. With Myself and other homeless people and shelter's  What is sad is the man I Love made me homeless, living in a shelter since I sold my house, Had The man I love steal part of the money, my jewelry. Belongings. And and thing he wanted. Believing he really loved me. Breaking my nose in a hotel. Dieing in the ambulance. Having the cops hospital myself all covering it up. Then have the hospital take My Drive license more jewelry and other things as well. Having A chair that was in my house before I sold the house, place at a batter woman shelter. Where I ended up at. Buying a car from the man I love. Paying more then he asked for. Then not getting The title to the car. Having the cop's tow the car away because he told them to. Because he new I was happy living in it. So I was again forced to go live back in a shelter. He controls all the shelter's here in the USA and in other countries. I found out about so much. Now he angry I am finally speaking about what has happened to myself. He has done this to so many people. Male and females. I'm not the Only human who this man did this to. Here in the USA the hospital, shelter's and the man I Love is a group of People who is targeting to control and do experiments on. Go read the book medical partied. There getting paid for doing different experiments. To see what humans Will do in different situations. They get paid very large amounts of money to keep these experiments going on. Just think how much hospital's get for put you in the hospital. The cop's get paid above and beyond their salary. To cover this behavior up. And the shelters homeless shelters that is and battered women's shelters and battered men shelters. Get paid a very lot to keep people homless. Then they're watching controlling what everyone is doing. And getting paid. You read exactly right. This is some of the things that are going on in the USA, and you thought you new what was really going on. Now you know what some of the things that are really going on. I'm born September 11. I had 8 , 11s  in my birthday numerology this year. That didn't know I was going to be blessed with the holy Ghost. From our father Lord Jesus Christ the only God there is. The University of Minnesota in the year of 2000 when I was a patient there their employees beat me so bad, they used electric shock treatment to control my memory and it did it made me have memory loss for 21 years I forgot that incident. Right around Christmas when my Father Lord Jesus Christ birthday is, I remember that when I was in The battered women's shelter. I learned to speak out about what took place in my relationship with the Man I Love, the hospitals the police. and to tell the truth. The Man  I Love controls YouTube. There was so many readers reading tarot cards, now not as many the higher elite got rid of them. I was to keep my mouth closed, to just pretend nothing is going on. I can't, I'm am very gifted They don't want me to tell what I know. I am to be quiet about the things I have seen and have happen to me. and the killings that are taking place. In the whole world, No they still have no reason to be upset. They helped create a beautiful loving Young lady me, Lea. , this is only a small part of what has happened and still is happening in the USA and world.",3년 전,0,

@高橋拓哉-c6d,"※The most stupid one is a scholar of winning the Nobel Prize, and the first genius is Prince Shotoku of the medium of the wisdom that excelled in intuitive power.   We are delivered from it from brainwashing of the science (mathematics, physics) got by a lie, and let's regain true study in our hand.    The science is the fiction which I made because the devil denies God, and what is listed in a Japanese old legend and the Christian Bible is true. A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin's evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).   I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 ≠ 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, ∞ which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.  ※If 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, ∞ which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series Σ = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4π^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or ∞ and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f'(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 → 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.   All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.   Message from the spiritual world of Einstein   When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on ""universal truth to certainly say to call God"".    Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan  April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea.

An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea   The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024   Final note  The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

@potato4258,"I'm an economics student and I mostly agree with everything he says, but one thing really bothered me. At the beginning he mentions that the earlier you start, the better because of compound interest. Then around 33' he says don't start investing before you have 5-10 YEARS worth of money saved up, paid off ALL credit card debt and student loans 😂 that is terrible advice. I imagine most americans who were students in 2012 (when this was published, won't even achieve all that in 10 years, which means they missed out on 20 years of compounding. I think majority of people who have a job are able to save at least 50-100$ per month even if they are young/have some debt. People often say they don't have anything they could save, but I think people don't think about what they spend enough.. How many subscriptions do you have? Do you need Netflix, HBO max and Amazon+? No, just chose one, same with music, newspapers etc. How many times a week do you eat out? Do you drink daily Starbucks? How much do you spend on alcohol/going out? How many items of clothing did you buy this month? There are so many ways to save even a bit and if you make it a habit it becomes easier. If you continuosly invest even a small amount every month that will make a huge difference years from now.",3년 전,0,

@user-xb5rl6wt5j,I was thinking the same thing!! I think maybe it’s wrong. I think what they’ve done in the graphic is calculated 35% of the negative earnings (-$15) which is (-$5.25) and then rounded that to -$5 and then mistakenly calculated -$15-(-$5) = -$15+$5 = -$10  But this would be wrong because you wouldn’t tax negative income I think.

It could be 10 or 1,000,000, whichever the founder decides. It affects the price of each share (more shares --> cheaper shares). As far as I understood, he started the company with 1,500 shares in total, owning 1,000 of those (66,7%) while giving 500 (33,3%) to the other guy in exchange for his investment",4년 전(수정됨),2,

@ghanshyamsinghsharma6656,"1. Good question. That is where the difference between Cahflow statement and Income Statement comes into picture. There are many things written off from the income statement on which we actually did not spend actual cash. For example the depreciation. If you add that cash  that was left in the balance sheet with that depreciation money, you can open a second stand.   2. Only when we take more debt.  3. Yeah that is real. But even if we add it to this example,  the final point which he is trying to make will remain the same, it won't make any significant difference. Businesses also pass inflation related effects to consumers. Which he depicted by that yearly price rise.",3년 전,0,

@plinioalvim9640,"Some people noticed a flaw in the growth assumptions like: ""How did he pay for another stand, and what about, getting more inventory for the next stand..."" at 6:48  My way of getting around that, is just by making the following assumption: The owner is going to work at the first Stand, then the ""labor"" cost, is actually reinvested in the company.  As First Assumptions said: $300 for a Stand, $200 for a year of Inventory for 1 stand [Cogs price goes up each year].  Every year inventory per stand is already paid at the ""Less: COGS"" My money to reinvest comes from 1 Stand as Labor costs $530  With my $530, i can buy Another Stand and Enough inventory for the new stand (Remember that the first stand already paid its inventory at the end of the year)  From now on, lets continue with the ""Income Statement: The Next Four Year"" My Revenue in year 2 is $1764 Less: COGS (420) [210 per stand, 2 stands] Less: Depreciation (120)  Less: Labor (530) [Thats someone else i employed] Less: Labor (530) [That me working at first stand] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EBIT: $184 Less: Interest (25) Less: Taxes (65) [Assuming 35% of EBIT] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net Income: $81  If we continue reinvesting our $530 of our labor, at fifth year, we shall have enough cash to buy 3 stands and continue our growth xD.   At End of fourth year, we shall have a net income of $608 That, added to the net income of third year of $286 and the secont year $81.  Were sitting at $975 + $250 (initial cash) = $1225 That means: More then enough to sustein our growth (For now xD)",4년 전(수정됨),9,

Also the City Sign Department will come every morning at 8am and rip down your Lemonade for Sale sign since local sign regulations only permit large Political signs, not signs for businesses.

@acharya9788,"Hey man! Im glad you took this much time to completely absorb the video information. Im having a hard time processing the 5:35 part. Bill says EBIT is $10 , then since $25 is interest to be paid so he says its a loss of $15 and goes onto says "" we dont have any taxes but still loose money"" , then how did he write 35% of EBT(which is negative as $10-$25= -$15) to calculate tax because he just said that we took a loss of $15 so EBT is negative 15$ , and then he wrote $5(assuming 35% of $15) in tax and net income $10, Could you care to explain this, i would really appreciate it!",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@noymorgenshtein9191," @acharya9788  I was stuck on the same part aswell. It appears to be one of the 2 options : The first is it could simpley be a mistake or a typo. The second one would be a lack of full explanation. I wouldn't worry about that part too much. You get the idea, your EBT is -15$ so obviously you dont pay any taxes on a loss thus your net income stays -15$. We'll just have to go with common sense on this one! :D",4년 전,1,

I've been into stock trade for quite a while now, and I must say it really goes with loss without the right approach and strategy. I have gotten to the point where I understand that strategy is a key element of a long term successful trading. You can keep making wins at the beginning of a period and later, you start making losses toward the end of the trading period or even halfway. This results from little or no attention to the need for sustenance and consistency with the prevailing market structure.

Cause as a human begin, Making money should be your main priority and number aim in life. Honestly at my early stage of life as when i just got married, Making money was so tough for i and wife cause i lost my job and i wasn't able to satisfy my wife needs anymore. She later made her way by running, and leaving three tenders kids behind. It was so terrible if i may say cause i had to hustle up by cleaning the streets so i could put food on the table for my kids and had to also shelter and cloth them. Early these year before the covid19 out break, I went for a church seminar which i saw on a platform so decided to go. Unknowingly the guest of honor was a woman named Mrs Lyra Holt Dean which i have been hearing for about 7 years now. She talked about Blockchain and Forex which i have always kept saying it is scam and forever it is. So as time went on, i kept on hearing testimony about this same woman how she has made a lot of people rich. As time went on the covid19 issue became serious that the Government had to put the whole country on a total lockdown. Things became more worst cause there was no cashflow due to the governments lockdown, Then i gained interest and decided to sacrifice with a very little amount cause i didn't have much. I reached her at contact@lyraholtdean. com Truly speaking just that first investment made me a very wealthy man and also got me a well nice positioned crib and a brand new car .I was so grateful cause that impacted a lot into my life, I became a very happy man by making a facial smile for my beloved kid.

@ashantijerome6659,"Bitcoin encountered an exceptional price resurgence lately, rising near a record remarkable high after two years of plunging prices. The most recent rally of the famously unpredictable cryptocurrency comes in the midst of a whirlwind of institutional speculation news, which has taken bitcoin near the peak it came to in December 2017 of $20,052. Unfortunately for the digital asset, it's undergoing a downward spike which has seen the asset trade as low as $16,500, bitcoin started this downward price action shortly after huge and major liquidation was noticed on some exchanges. The overall picture remains emphatically bullish and bitcoin is expected to hit a new all-time high before the year ends, for me, I will keep accumulating and stacking up more coins in my portfolio which is why I trade every day with trade signals from Ethan McKenzie . Since the time I began replicating Ethan's trade signal in my trades, my portfolio has been explosive from 2btc to over 8btc in a space of 10weeks. He can be reached for advice via Telegram @(EthanmcKenzie) and WhatsApp ( +44 7723 042647) for crypto related inquires.",4년 전,1,

@charlessc5943,"take everything in sort of chronological order and it will make more sense  he starts by getting money: look at cashflow statements, debt 250 + shares sold 500 gives him +750 cash (financing activities)  he uses -300 for stand (investing activities) -> +450 cash left    buy supplies for -200 -> +250 cash left selling the cups (revenue) for +800 -> +1050 cash look at other costs (COGS are the supplies we bought so dont recount it), depreciation (-60), labor (-530) -> +460 cash  repay interest (-25) -> +435 after that comes taxes but that wasnt so clearly explained...  all this is operating activites, he started with +450 above and ended with +435 which you can see on the balance sheet that he has a small loss (there is a small mistake with the taxes in the video so i have a small difference but you can understand the idea) in cashflows from operations they ad +60 from depreciation giving you 435+60 = 495 cash in the end! (again small diff) => so you can buy a new stand and the cycle continues!  ps: depreciation is accounting stuff look it up, they say the asset loses value so they write it down as a loss  you gained +60 cash asset loses -60 in value (this is on paper, its not a loss in cash)  you actually made cash (60) but earnings are still negative because of depreciation etc. its a bit confusing i know and took me a while to understand as well  hope this was helpfull",4년 전,0,

@Andrewjames319,"Well spoken, I really i loved the way he talked in details that's the most interesting part i really love that idea. But he should have just expanciated more on highlighting the citizens have a great knowledge on investing and trading. Cause as a human begin, Making money should be your main priority and number aim in life. Honestly at my early stage of life as when i just got married, Making money was so tough for i and wife cause i lost my job and i wasn't able to satisfy my wife needs anymore. She later made her way by running, and leaving three tenders kids behind. It was so terrible if i may say cause i had to hustle up by cleaning the streets so i could put food on the table for my kids and had to also shelter and cloth them. Early these year before the covid19 out break, I went for a church seminar which i saw on a platform so decided to go. Unknowingly the guest of honor was a woman named Mrs Lyra Holt Dean which i have been hearing for about 7 years now. She talked about Blockchain and Forex which i have always kept saying it is scam and forever it is. So as time went on, i kept on hearing testimony about this same woman how she has made a lot of people rich. As time went on the covid19 issue became serious that the Government had to put the whole country on a total lockdown. Things became more worst cause there was no cashflow due to the governments lockdown, Then i gained interest and decided to sacrifice with a very little amount cause i didn't have much. I reached her at contact@lyraholtdean. com Truly speaking just that first investment made me a very wealthy man and also got me a well nice positioned crib and a brand new car .I was so grateful cause that impacted a lot into my life, I became a very happy man by making a facial smile for my beloved kid. So anywhere i go i feel so glad telling people my story and also getting my fellow citizens motivated .",4년 전,8,

If they forego the depreciation in favour of growth in at least the first year, then they can afford the second stand. Not sure yet about the other stands. One explanation could be, that after year two they have a working business model, and they could ask suppliers for deferred payment, which would open up $400 of cash.

@PlaceYourChariotsUpHigh,im pretty sure it is the revenue multiplied by the 0.05 dollar increase in price per cup for the first year. Plus the net income of the year which was 10bucks. So. 800 cups sold at 1.05$ = 840$ + 10$ net income for year 1 (EBT) =850$  However the 5 cent increase per cup should not have been added for the first year but that must have slipped their mind when they were doing the math. just a careless mistake i guess.,5년 전,0,

I have gotten to the point where I understand that strategy is a key element of a long term successful trading. You can keep making wins at the beginning of a period and later, you start making losses toward the end of the trading period or even halfway. This results from little or no attention to the need for sustenance and consistency with the prevailing market structure. I've earned about $36,150 so far this month trading with Mr.Carlos Kingston strategies and working with his trading signals. You may never find it easy trading on your own.

@ultraSabotaj,"SECOND STAND YEAR 2  Everyone. If you do not understand where the money comes from for a second stand in year 2, PLEASE READ this comment first.  First of all, whenever you do not understand something like this, get yourself a pen and paper, and if you really fancy, a calculator, to go over the numbers and facts for yourself. Show more effort.  The problem is that people see the Balance Sheet which he presents first and the Income Statement which comes later as chronological follow-up reports of each other. You have to understand that some information could be given twice because these two reports tell us different things and do not necessarily continue on each other. They provide us different answers for different moments of the business.  So to start from the beginning: Our intention is to sell 800 cups in year 1 with 1 stand and 1 employee.  We have a total $750 available as the starting amount of cash to spend to achieve this goal (check the video to see where this comes from).  We decide that to achieve our goals we have to use $300 for a stand $200 for inventory  $250 is left over. We do NOT use this leftover for year 1. When year 1 is over, this is STILL on our account.  We do not pay anything else upfront. This is it. The labor cost can be paid on the go so we can look at this cost AFTER 1 year when we have sold 800 cups. It is not required to have it paid in advance.  So now let us look at how we ended YEAR 1.  We have sold 800 cups for $1 which means  Our stand Our inventory  Our employee  Managed to bring in $800 total.  So we made some costs upfront to earn this $800.  Now we have to take care of other costs involved DURING the operation and AFTER 1 year.  • We already paid for our stand • We already paid for inventory - Now we pay for the labor - Now we deduct some depriciation of the stand because it is used (technically the money is still in our pocket). - Now we pay interest over our debt. - Now we pay our taxes.  So this means: $800  - 530 labor - 60 depreciation - 25 interest - 5 tax = $180  This is left from our total EARNED money from selling 800 cups.  +250 that we still had left on our account from before year 1 (remember?)  = $430 <———— THIS IS CASH AVAILABLE AT END OF YEAR 1  So as you can see after year 1 we have even more than we need for a second stand, because 1 stand costs $300.  The reason why the income statement shows a loss is because we DID NOT earn back enough to cover for the total cost of operating in year 1 because the inventory was paid with our own cash that we put in upfront. That is the purpose of the balance sheet. To see if the return was enough to support or cover the whole operation on it’s own. It did not. We were not able to put back money that we used to pay the inventory upfront.  I understand that there are some typos and small mistakes in the video, but you have to be more openminded and grateful and play along.",5년 전,78,

@namok6143,"I can't see no wrong in the numbers If we look at the change in cash after the first year, they actually increase 250 more in cash, so that is why the cash account is 500 in the ending balance sheet. That is why they still can do one more stand in the second year.  I don't think you should minus $60 depreciation in calculating cash (since it is for calculating the stand value, not cash, and that is why it was put back to the CFO in the Cash Flow Statement), also they have a tax benefit of $5 (so +5). That would make the cash available at the end to be $500 correctly shown on the video.",5년 전,2,
@steare5034,"You're right. The available cash at the end of year 1 is $430. You want to buy the secound lemonade stand for $300, so $130 left for your inventory. But you need 2x $200 for the inventory, so you need $270 fresh loan. This increase the costs for the 2nd year (and every following year) by $27 and reduce EBT in 2nd year to $112.  After buying your inventory and depriciation for 3rd year, $112 is exact the amount of money left for lemonade stand No. 3. So the company needs another fresh loan of $338 (-$300 stand, -$200 inventory, +$112 cash) to expand.",5년 전,1,

,"This is not entirely correct. First, no need to deduct $60 cash for the stand. It’s already been paid for in cash at the beginning of the first year. it’s just the book value is depreciating. Taxes as well, it’s actually negative $5 so you can use it for a tax deduction in future. So at the end of year 1 you have cash available 250 + (800-530-25) = 490. After buying a new stand for $300 cash left is $190. Now you need to buy inventories for 2 stands which is 2x200=400. Where does the difference come from?",4년 전,0,

@Some0ne001," @latanezimbardo7129  luck is in my opinion not really a thing.

Because of all that you had a higher chance of getting the role of that character. Or you met a future business partner on the street because he dropped his papers, thats not luck its probability. A person sitting home watching TV had a zero percent chance of something like that happening because they didn't do anything to increase that probability they didn't go outside and walk down the sidewalk. Somtimes that probability isn't completley in your control all the time but you usually did somthing to become ""Lucky"" so you can definitely increase your chances of probibility or being ""Lucky"" you jist got to figure out what thing you want to be ""Lucky"" in. I highly recommend a book called ""the Luck Factor"".",4년 전,1,

@Jessica7318,"I picture this on Shark Tank or Dragon's Den. I can imagine the investors saying: ""You have the idea. You want 500$ of my dollars to get it off the ground. You give yourself 1,000 shares for having the idea, and my money is worth 500 shares?""  So essentially he just determined that the 1,000 shares (""We just made up that number."") is worth 1$ per share, and the 500 shares they give to an investor, he has to pay a dollar for each share.   The dragons or sharks would say: ""How do you come to this valuation?"" ... ""How can you decide that the 1,000 shares you've just 'given yourself' (by ""making that number up"") is worth 1$ each and the money you need to go forward (the 500$) is worth only 33% of the company?""  In essence, what's to stop the entrepreneur from saying: ""We're going to say that we have 5,000 shares, because we came up with the idea (""We just made that number up"") and we're going to sell an additional 500 shares to an investor for 1$ per share. So he invests 500$ and our company is now worth 5500$. 500$ for his investment for the small percentage he has, and 5000$ of value we've decided our idea is worth.  I'm guessing this is where Dragons and Sharks then inquire about what the entrepreneur has brought to the table that's worth the amount presented. In essence, the Investor's view of this becomes: ""If my 500$ buys 1 share for 1$... how many shares are you guys just 'deciding' your idea is worth?""  In this case, the investor gets 33%, he gets 500 shares for putting up 500 real dollars. A quantifiable amount associated to tangible value. The entrepreneur is just 'making up a number' they want in terms of shares. Their shares are worth 1$ each, but they can just decide the idea is worth 1,000 shares. So they've given themselves 1,000$ worth of value. If they decide to give themselves 5,000 shares... each worth 1$ they're saying their idea is worth 5,000$, so if the investor is the one putting up the money they need, he can look at this company and say:   They have an idea, it's worth X amount, no real way to value it. Maybe they bring a broken table or something. Maybe they have nothing. if they have nothing, and my 500$ is needed for something... then isn't my 500$ accounting for 100% of the value of the business? There's nothing without the money except an idea that can't be executed. So why do I get 500 shares for 500$ if they can decide to give themselves 1,000 shares, 2,000 shares, 5,000 shares, just by making up that number?""",5년 전,0,

@bighands69,You watched it now so that is the important thing. If you want to develop a strong background in investment I would suggest starting with the book Intelligent Investor that was written in 1949 as it is basis for most of these investors including Warren Buffett.  One of the major fields of investment that never actually gets discussed is valuation as you cannot invest without understanding what the value of something is. If you bought a car to sell to make money and you paid too much money for the car you will never be able to sell it for more than you paid so you need to understand how much the car is valued at in the marketplace.,4년 전,1,

@superchargerone,"""In early 2015, Ackman began accruing his initial stake in Valeant at a price of around $161 per share. Following the stock's massive free-fall in late 2015, Ackman doubled-down on his bet by buying more shares at a lower price. Pershing Square annouced that it sold its entire position in Valeant. Out of an original $4.6 billion invested in the company, Ackman got back only $874 million -- an 81% loss.   If the $4 billion loss wasn't bad enough, it has been reported that Ackman may have actually had to pay up in order to sell his remaining shares in Valeant. How is this possible? Easy -- derivatives. According to Bloomberg News, Ackman both bought calls and sold put options (a call is a bet that a stock will go up, while a put is a bet that a stock will go down) in what amounts to a tripling-down of Ackman's initial bet. Assuming Pershing Square closed these options out when it sold its remaining shares in Valeant, the company would actually have to pay the stock broker $447 million."" hahaha ya it seems that you win some and lose even more with this guy.",5년 전,0,

@bigdog8628,"What I would NOT do is invest with a woman whose website is registered in Montenegro and whom you had never heard of before somebody random replied to your comment on YouTube.   Assuming you don't know a financial expert whom you trust, and you don't have a sophisticated understanding yourself, then you really have only one good option:  Open a basic personal investment account somewhere reputable like Schwab or Fidelity (this costs exactly zero, don't let them sell you on other management services), research the fees and commission structure beforehand (most brokers offer commission free trading of some equities and mutual funds, but be careful).... Then buy as many shares of the basic S&P500 passive index fund that your brokerage offers as you can afford... and hold it. That's it.  The annual expense ratio should be around 0.02%. As for continuing investment, you can try to wait for downturns to purchase more shares, but you are probably better off just buying a few shares here and there as you come up with the money. Just watch those commissions :)  The index always wins in the end.  By trying to chase unrealistic gains, you are asking to be taken advantage of, either by a shady ""adviser"" or by an advanced trading algorithm.  P.S.

@superchargerone," @Frederick0220  ""In early 2015, Ackman began accruing his initial stake in Valeant at a price of around $161 per share. Following the stock's massive free-fall in late 2015, Ackman doubled-down on his bet by buying more shares at a lower price. Pershing Square annouced that it sold its entire position in Valeant. Out of an original $4.6 billion invested in the company, Ackman got back only $874 million -- an 81% loss.   If the $4 billion loss wasn't bad enough, it has been reported that Ackman may have actually had to pay up in order to sell his remaining shares in Valeant. How is this possible? Easy -- derivatives. According to Bloomberg News, Ackman both bought calls and sold put options (a call is a bet that a stock will go up, while a put is a bet that a stock will go down) in what amounts to a tripling-down of Ackman's initial bet. Assuming Pershing Square closed these options out when it sold its remaining shares in Valeant, the company would actually have to pay the stock broker $447 million."" so ya he made money off taking it off fees from people who invested in him and promptly lost them their investment haha. check out his history before you admire him too much.",5년 전,7,

@dostthouevenlogicbrethren1739,"An interesting point on compound interest and returns. You don't need a high rate of return if you have a consistent and stable one. Your losses hit you twice as hard as your gains. If you start with 10,000 in an investment, and the market falls by 50% you have $5,000 left. How much would the market have to go up to return to your initial investment? 100%. 50% of $5,000 is only $2,500, so it climbing back by 50% would mean you have $7,500. Your losses hit you twice as hard.   If you compare the ETF fund of the TSX over the 18 years from 2002 to 2016 to a medium risk balanced fund, despite the ETF returning as high as 20% and the balanced fund averaging 8%, the total return was 140% for the ETF, and over 170% for the balanced fund.  In fact, the ETF outperformed it in 9 of the 14 years. Why did the balanced fund earn more? Because the year preceeding that 20% gain, the market was -33%. The balanced fund however, never fell below -4%. It had very little to recover from, and so it kept growing while the ETF was still reclaiming the loss.",5년 전,0,

@zoeylockwood,Also - why is the interest on debt ($25) not accounted for in the cash flow sheet?,5년 전,0,
@sjakie49,"Equity and liabilities add up to a certain amount of money, to which the assets should equalize. This is the most basic accounting principle which is one of the ways to find out whether financial numbers are in good order. The assets (in the case the stand, inventory and cash) are of lower value than what it should be according to the debt and equity side, so the goodwill could be seen as what equity/debt holders to be of value for which no other labels are given. You could think of brand power or growth potential. These things cant be quantified as a value of a company individually, so goodwill is a collective value for them. In this case, the investor was willing to pay 500 dollars for one third of the stand, the cash AND for the prospect of growth/profit growth in the future.  If the company were to be liquidated, the value of goodwill would evaporate (brand power and growth potential will instinctively be valued as zero), leaving the equity holders with less to no value of the inial share. This, because the debt holders would take 250 dollars first. After selling the stand and inventory (usually at a discount), there is not much left for the investor, if nothing at all. Still, the investor takes this into account when considering an investment and bids accordingly.",5년 전,0,
@windswept17, @sjakie49  - ok but why not keep assets at 750 with the hard cash there is. The retained earnings could have been converted intoshare capital upon future profits. By showing goodwill initially the balance sheet is inflated with no inherent potential.,5년 전,0,

Over the past few years Bitcoin has generated more millionaires and even aided more billionaires who invested and trade it to be more successful. Bitcoin can turn around the economy of any nation and the benefits are too numerous to mention. As we approach the major bull run coming up in this second half of the year I will urge everyone to stock more Bitcoin and if you are lucky to have bought more during the bear period goodluck, but if you are not able to stock more up then there is still time as you can buy the little you can and trade with the master of crypto trading Nyberg Hansson. Nyberg is a pro trader and his strategies in trading Bitcoin work just perfect and I have been able to stock more Bitcoin using his strategies within a short period of time.

I find it hard to believe you would tell your grandmother to choose individual stocks over buying the market through a total market index fund from a trusted, low-fee fund brokerage like Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. If you don't want to do a ton of research and upkeep, the general advice is index funds, not finding an actively managed fund. The fees of those actively managed funds typically outweigh any benefits. I don't mean to be overly critical, but index funds might be the most important thing for someone without a lot of investing knowledge to learn about.

@HannuKaleviElo,"I'm sure that most of you have heard of Wisebanc. No? Let me try something else. OptionsXO? WMOption? PrimeCFDs? Do these ring any bells? Of course they do. You should at least know about the OptionsXO scam, that has been out in the public since last year ( moneyahoy.com/10m-lawsuit-filed-israeli-binary-options-com…/ , drive.google.com/file/d/0B2lxPNq2sETrOGhMUXlnVEdwSFE/view ).  By the way, it is said all over the internet that Birman Law is also a scam, working together with those fraud israeli firms, so don't start dreaming that they would be any help if you've been scammed.  But let's talk more about our friend, Wisebanc (aka OptionsXO aka WMOptions aka PrimeCFDs).  Beginnings: It all started somewhere in 2014-2015 in Israel, Herzliya, to be more precise. The name of the company was Toro Media, having as their owner and CEO Tomer Levi, operated by Omni Capital. Once more and more israeli scams were discovered, authorities started to do their jobs, banning all binary options scammers from Israel, so they had to find somewhere else to operate from. Where did OptionsXO (at the time) move to? Romania, the land of opportunities when it comes to binary scams.  Where are they located? They only have 2 offices left, after their attempt to work under a Cysec regulated platform as well (Wise Trader in 2017, located in Bucharest at first, and later on in Cyprus). Since 2016, they have the main offices in Bucharest, Romania (retention office: Calea Floreasca 169, 2nd floor, 'Toro Telemarketing', and conversion office also in Bucharest, under the same name), but they are also located in Kiev, with one office, operation both conversion and retention. Their bank accounts are obviously in the Marshall Islands, Belize, Bulgaria, Romania.  How they operate: The employees use fake 'stage' names, Oscar White, Robb Daniels, Ethan Stark, Mark Spencer, Roger Banks, Liam Brown, Andrew Novak, Jay Smith, Adam Louis, Warren Roberts, Simon Green and so on...they use american names it sounds more credible...everyone of them has a criminal and fake background story, lie about the place they are located in (at first, they used to say the office was in the UK, in Liverpool, later on they started saying they were in Bulgaria, right next to Romania, when, in fact, they were in Romania).  There are two main departments in the office: - conversion: account managers: their jobs is to call clients who just registered, lurking them into making a deposit; they are not allowed to talk to the employees from the other department about customers (they are working in separate offices as well), as they are not allowed to know much about the business, other than they have to convince clients to deposit and the so-called senior account manager is going to take it over from there; -retention: senior account managers: this is the real boiler room, where the real scammers do their jobs, calling clients who deposited and tricking them into depositing larger amounts of money, so they can profit faster, opening 'successful' trades for them, so it look real; the real magic is how they use Team Viewer so they can see how much money a client has in his bank account, or how they steal money from their account without approval, passing all bank security layers. If a customer dares to say he doesn't want to put more money into the account, they push and push and eventually, they tell him he's on his own then, starting trading the initial deposit without customers being aware of it (therefore, the customers lose even the initial deposit).  How do they get customers? Through scam adds, such as The Bitcoin Code, The Bitcoin Revolution, The Crypto Code or by buying data from other companies.  Why Wisebanc aka OptionsXO aka WMOptions aka PrimeCFDs? The reason they change the platform's name so often is because: 1. too many bad reviews online, so it's hard to trick people; 2. being blacklisted by the banks, so transactions won't work (unless they are using China made terminals); 3. good way of erasing customers from their database and stealing their money.  WISEBANC IS A SCAM! Once you're in, you will never get out. Biggest scam company operating on the market, stealing customers money (not only money they invest, but also make transactions without customers approval, never allowing withdraws , very aggressive, using a fake platform (claiming it's regulated by Cysec), getting warnings and fines from different authorities).  If you happen to have invested with these scammers, go to a bank with all you have against them (screenshots of the conversations, recordings, bank statements, emails) and start a dispute against them (Chargeback).",6년 전,0,

The balance sheet states that the lemonade stand earned ~33% of its EBT back from taxes, which is a really weird mistake for them to make. I guess they hard coded an expression that incorrectly deals with negative EBT's. He originally says the lemonade stand needs to pay $0 in taxes the first year, but they basically did this:  -15 - (-5) = -10. You don't gain $5 from taxes if you're $15 in the hole.",6년 전,1,

So in this case you have a loss of $15 and we owe additionally on top of that amount $5 in taxes which would mean that our net income is minus ($20) and not minus ($10) correct? Or is stated this way because the government cannot tax you on negative profits?,7년 전,0,

@davidmadisontheguardian,"Here's an example of an asset:  My friend wanted to use my Amazon MERCH T-shirt account so that he could experiment with it without risking having his own account closed down.  He pays me HALF of what he makes on the T-shirts.  What did I SPEND?  Nothing.  Ok, no, that's not exactly true.  What I spent was a little bit of my time... the time to apply for this specialized account; then some time to set up the account.  That's how I took having NO MONEY and MADE MONEY FROM A FREE RESOURCE.  There are MANY such things you could do.  Like I said in my comment below - THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO DO BUSINESS.  The way that this man is explaining it.... is ONLY ONE WAY WHICH FAVORS PUTTING YOU IN DEBT.  Sorry... but I don't care to do that for myself.  Is that SMART business? And this is the channel called THINK BIG?  My father taught me to think for myself and to solve my own problems.  Sure... this guy knows a lot of math; and he's studied what the colleges or the typical experts have to say about 'EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT FINANCING AND INVESTING' - but this is not what a TRUE CAPITALIST OR ENTREPRENEUR WHO CREATES PURE WEALTH ACTUALLY DOES!  I applaud the effort; yet I feel that the title is extremely misleading.  The question SHOULD be... what IS investing?  Investing has MANY definitions.  Why is he speaking of RETIREMENT?  A true CAPITALIST NEVER RETIRES; until they die. Retirement is an idea that the rich have foisted successfully on the poor and middle class who hope to aspire to NOT BE HOMELESS - basically NOT be robbed by the banks and the government and their own company that they are in servitude to.  It's laughable.  We need to shatter this paradigm.  Until then... people will continue to spin their wheels, stuck in a mass delusion.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Its great you want to get into investing but before you do anything with investing the number 1 thing you must and i repeat must do is master your personal credit and learn about business credit. If you have no credit at all go get a secured credit card at wells fargo and put money in a cd at the same time for 1 year...as you obtain a higher credit score you will start building a great relationship with your bank to use as leverage shortly after when you want to get a higher limit on your credit cards and personal loans.   Even if you dont have any business ideas you can form a llc or corporation with your name fire panda party penguin llc or inc. The goal is to open up a business bank account and when they ask you if you want to apply for business credit card say yes and they will run your good personal credit you established and get a business card.   Your personal credit reports to experian, equifax and transunion...your business credit that your create should be with dun and bradstreet. All wealthy people have great credit. Learn about rewards credit cards and you will learn to never use your debit cards ever again because you dont obtain any points and using your rewards cards builds your credit even more.

@rsjunki3,"xIceeJay5x It's pretty simple stuff. Read online articles/media to get a feel for what the hottest upcoming IPO is, buy shares low right when they become available, and then sell them after the transaction period is up (2-3 days later). If they went down, wait longer and they will almost without fail rise to a price above what you paid for them. Tech IPO's tend to rise rapidly, but some of the smaller companies in healthcare and such are great buys, and you can buy more shares because they tend to start cheaper. Having knowledge of accounting forms helps (income statement, balance sheet, etc.) but isn't necessary. You WILL experience success if you keep at it. Final advice: always look for trends. For example, about 6 months ago, I noticed tech IPO's were consistently skyrocketing their first day on the market, so I bought one of the cheaper ones, and sure enough...I had a 50% gain on the first day and ended up selling 2 days later, 55% in the green. Fun stuff. Good luck.",8년 전,4,

I'm interested in philosophy too and can spend an afternoon engrossed in all those things, but the business section of the newspaper sometimes reveals to me more about human nature than any philosopher.    A stock is a slice of a pie. Equity is the stuff of that pie; the jam, the sugar, the crust that holds it all. Shares are you owning little slices of that pie.  Imagine you are walking by a Home Depot and you see them always selling those John Deere tractors.  You say to yourself, ""Gee it seems like they are doing well in business and I am just working my average everyday job: I wish I could be a part of something like that.""    Well, you can.  Take some of the income you earn from your job and buy some Shares of John Deere co.  You now implicitly participate and share in their business--and profits :)  You own a slice (stock) of the pie (equity) that is John Deere.  You own this just like you own the shirt on your back, the only difference being, that the shirt on your back keeps you clothed, while these shares, ideally, should make you more money.

Companies keep cash from original investments, or from years where they made a profit for the exact reason of off setting losses in bad years.

Cash balance: $250 = 750 - 300 - 200 At the end of year 1, we see they sold $800 of lemonade, and paid $530 in labor costs (remember, we already bought the inventory, and depreciation is a ""non-cash"" charge - we're accounting for having to replace the lemonade stand every 5 years). Cash balance: $520 = 250 + 800 - 530 Finally, they paid $25 in interest, leaving them with negative EBT (earnings before tax) of $15 and therefore had a tax credit of $5 (this was sort of skipped over): Cash balance: $500 = 520 - 25 + 5  Note this matches the ending cash balance (bottom line) in the cash flow statement at 8:15.

@thomaslindsey1504,"I  said I would not write this down, however in hindsight it may be best  to put it here now. So this is what I have done to change the World and  spark peace, I looked at a power plant, at all the parts and most  importantly the crucial components like the fuel, the boiler, the  turbine, the generator, and then I set out to make them better or  replaceable with something better that already existed, that didn't  require great harm to the planet to find what is needed to be built, in  order to safely bring the power company into your home for the cheap,  let's start with the fuel, I use electricity to power the device, a 12v  motor cycle battery, I run that 12 volts through a Pure Shine Wave  inverter to step it up to 110-115v then I run it through a Panasonic  Microwave Inverter/Noise filter which steps it up further to 250v, the  250v in ran into another Panasonic Inverter which produces 4000v max  power, however you have to build a simple 555 timer curcuit ( Control  Switch ) that has a minimum start setting with a dimmer dial resistor,  of 43% power at 50% duty cycle in order to turn on the 4000v Inverter, I  then run that 4000 watts through the Panasonic Magnetron that comes  with it, because it is designed to handle all that power full time,  where a conventional one will not,"" the Panasonic Inverter Tech is true  40-50-60-80-100% Microwave Tech, because microwaves don't react well to  metal the Boiler is a ""Glass"" heat resistant ""Three Neck Lab Flask that  is filled with 60% water, one neck is for refilling the boiler it has a  one Tesla valve, one neck is for recharging the battery that powers the  unit, the final neck does all the work by recharging yet another 12v  battery with more amps to another inverter ( 6,000-50,000 Watt Inverter)  that will power your boat, plane, car, space station,  the steam  produced is low heat and low pressure, Compared to the power companies'  plant's steam, the turbine/generator is a modified Tesla Turbine, that  is both turbine and generator in one unit, that has small neodymium  magnets embedded, which spin at 57,000 up 90,000 rpm's depending on the  pressure the boiler can produce, the Tesla turbine is 90 to 97%  efficient and can be built out of Lexan to resist the low heat steam!  The condenser should be glass also and there is a small solar panel to  recharge units main power battery in case the need a raises to charge it  out in the field!

For instance, I remember Warren Buffet talking about an annual report from China that only he was made privy to and he was able to invest, make billions of dollars, and back out at the right time. Now sure the theories that he was able to learn from Benjamin Graham helped him decipher whether or not this company was a good investment, but the fact that only he had access to the annual report in English, and was able to invest and back out and the right time, would lead to further questions.

Then read the reports of good sound companies like Apple, google when you  find something you are not familiar google it . if you learn to do this you can easily obtain the information on how to do it on youtube you will be ahead of most people who mindlessly follow the opinion of so-called experts most of whom are just trying to sell you their inflated stock.

@toriegarrett3299,I really like the way he breaks down the concept of risk and reward.

When it comes to investing he advises for a certain amount of money to be in the bank and have debt to be paid off. The concept is great for those with money who want more money. If not then expect to find investors and take out loans. Starting with smaller risk investments and working ones way up to riskier investments with more reward would make more sense for those who do not already have the money in the bank.,9년 전,0,

@jacobotstot2021,"Michael Manaje depreciation. It isn't a loss, just decreases overall value if company if you were to sell it.",7년 전,1,
@SanketDube,"Your answer is at 8:12. We were losing money but that was theoretical however we always had positive cash in hand.  Number in parenthesis are negative numbers, indicating that the cash went out of business.  CFO is Cash Flow from Operations. Hard cash balance left after paying out for everything needed to keep the lemonade stand running. You could refer 7:42 to know how that net income is calculated. You could see we have deducted 60 of depreciation because we haven't actually paid for the depreciation in cash. It's just a theoretical expense to account for wear and tear of the lemonade stand assets and hence shouldn't accounted for in cash flow statement. So our net cash flow = Net Income 'minus'  theoretical losses.  CFI is Cash Flow from Investing. Net impact of cash after buying or selling assets. This is where your answer is. You could see we reduced cash every year. This reduction in cash IS the cash is used by us to buy new lemonade stands.  CFF is Cash Flow from Financing. Net cash inflow by either borrowing or raising capital. (repayment not considered as that's accounted for in income statement already)  Opening Cash Balance = Net Cash balance at beginning of the year. Final Cash Balance (This cannot be negative EVER) = Opening Cash Balance + CFO + CFI + CFF  Fun fact: Your company could go bankrupt even when it's profitable.",7년 전,0,

What a terrific  way to learn I wish I had been given this overall run down on how things connect back in my uni days to get the whole picture as oppose to having to put  a puzzle together not really knowing how its meant to look like. Having studied Applied Finance and being familiar with video development I take my hat off for how the information is presented and conveyed  On constructive feedback note I would actually say that reducing the flaws in the information is of extreme importance specially for newbies absorbing it for the first time. It's a given that one the end goals of developing this material would have been to speed up the learning curve as much as possible in one go and  and not having viewers going back and forward in the video.  I do wonder how the subsequent lemon stands were funded given the initial negative return in the first year and given that there doesn't seem to be any additional funds raced via equity or debt? which would change the whole analysis and derived conclusions.

His time has to be worth quite a bit and yet he wastes it making a simple video like this.  I'm certain that so much of what we see online is meant to draw ""the easy money"" into the markets for the benefit of the rich.  Meanwhile a video like this has people thinking this guy isn't like the rest of those that people refer to as ""The Man"".  You know he has what they call a Single Family Office (SFO) to manage all the money he's made from us fish. It's like a hedge fund for your own personal assets.  Look it up.  He was in the news a while back 'cause he had the Hedge fund he manages buy out a company that his SFO had invested in before it was big enough to be invested in by institutions and hedge funds.   I think he does garbage like this to get people to believe in his opinion so that when a company like Valeant tanks, as it has, he can go on CNBC and do a two hour speech on why we should all throw our money back into the company so that he can make back the two Billion dollars he's lost.

Obviously there were individual ramps in there when it did great, but you can't count on that.  And presumably there were dividends.  But it was also negative from 85 to 2011!  McDonalds has done great since 85, but it was level/a big looser 99 to 06, to mention one period.  How many people know enough about Mcdonalds to slug it out for 7 years while it was going down and sideways.  People tend to buy high and sell low, when it is their money.",10년 전,5,

Coke was a great money bagger - not if you cherry pick data though - but look at the price from 1985 - 1998 much more appealing right? I think the best approach to leaving your money in a company long term is learn how to avoid the pit falls. The thing about long term investing is that it doesnt take much work to learn when you're in a downtrend. Coca Cola was in a 4 year downtrend after that nice rise ending in 1998.Selling late would have still given you an insane return on your investment in 1985 and even a decent return had you invested in 1992.,10년 전,1,

@wearesavingtherepublic,"highs in the 2000s were because of insane irrational bubbles, but the economy during that period went mostly up, with a few down months. Nasdaq is highly tech related, which is why it blew up so high, and then crashed so bad. But the 'highs' in 2000 were not real value. I'd argue that the real underlying value of the Nasdaq is actually only now just reaching 2000. It was 2000 on paper, but in reality the companies it represented was worth less than that. Picking a broader index like S&P 500 is going to be a safer play because it's represents the broader economy as a whole.  Again playing long on an index protects you from that sort of thing, unless your buying at top of the bubble. Even if you invested in 1990, and saw your stock jump to insane heights, and then drop again, never to return to that amount 10 years later, when you average it out, your gettting about 10% a year.   Japan has been suffering from stagflation for a long time. Though I consider that the exception that proves the rule. I wouldn't recommend a Japanese index fund.   I do monitor the P/E (price vs Earnings) on my companies. If the ratio rises too high, I may dump the stock and get something cheaper, on the bet the stock is actually overvalued compared to it's actual value, so i can protect myself from the downside and claim a little profit. So in that case, tradingfours is correct. If I was investing during the tech bubble, I probably would have dumped my stuff early, and missed out on alot of gains, but also not gotten clobbered by the losses.  I value invest as much as possible. Is company A over-priced or under-priced? Is Company B going to grow or shrink? Is Company C well managed?  I'm Leary on 'exit strategies' though. They are too complicated for most retail investors, and there is value in simple and disciplined strategies being the core of your portfolio. Every-time you introduce a decision point, your adding a non-zero risk of making the wrong call. Which is why I always recommend Index's to people just getting started. All the smartest people in investing will generally say the same thing. Not all of us are Warren Buffet, and most people who try to beat the market fail, even experts. ",10년 전,0,
@tradingfoursj,"Bryan Winter , meh, fundamentals haven't had any incidence in stocks performance in the usa in a long time. this is a quote from 2011; ""  on average, an s&p 500 company is now being replaced about once every two weeks. "". the economy of the usa has not grown at all since the subprime - financial bubble burst in 2007, and the stock values of the companies that constituted the s&p 500 back then will attest to that in that they have gone nowhere. the wild escalade in index valuations is an illusion fed by cherry picking and other crucial factors that i won't give away for free but that every investor should be aware of. since the stock market bottom of 2009, s&p 500 companies' revenue has grown around 30%, the s&p value has gone up more than 300%, good luck explaining such developments with fundamentals.",10년 전,0,
@wearesavingtherepublic,"so a qoute in 2011 said the market didn't grow during the greatest period of deleveraging in american history since the great depression? Of course not. All the wealth being created was being used to fill the capital buffers over extended banks.   With regards to the 2009 S&P 500 has grown about 30% since before the crash. Comparing the lowest point to the highest point is exactly the kind of cherry picking that make thinking about fundamentals important. Of course the value went up that high. The crash was insane. But smart money buys when the economy crashes.  If you have a major company like google making revenue increases but the stock is dropping like a rock, that is because the market is NOT reacting to the fundamental nature of the company.   Granted, companies are now turning over faster, which is why fundamentals are more important than ever. Companies are extremely easy to disrupt, so the only way to protect your investment is to keep your ear to the ground, and evaluate the company in question on it's value.   Again, i'm a retail, and not professional investor. But index funds still outperform most hedge funds, so unless your Bill Ackman, Carl Ichan, or Warren Buffet, I'll stick with what i know, and that is companies in industries I understand, with a competitive moat. the chaos of the past 10 years is exactly why you need to understand where companies are profitable and not.  Last point, recent run up in stock is not irrational, and valuations are approaching historic norms, in accordance with the fundamental as opposed to the technical approach. ",10년 전,0,

@ais89x,Bryan Lightningrod The balance sheet is an indicator of value. If you were looking at a company that was making a million in profits every year. You wouldn't look at the balance sheet to see how much of their assets they used to generate profits?

@wearesavingtherepublic,"Idea's have a capital valuation above and beyond the actual cash in the bank. Apple Computers in many ways owns far less than it's book value, but it's total valuation is justified because it can take that small book value and leverage it to produce large profits. It's not made up. It's based on the market consensus about how much money a company is earning, or could potentially earn in the future. Organizational structures that can produce wealth are more valuable than the pieces that make that up. You couldn't liquidate apple, and then still be able to produce Iphones at the end, even though the total value of stuff would be the same.  In his example, he is stating the idea of a lemanade stand is worth 1500. Of course the investor should do due dilligence (which the marketplace tends to do, with some failures, after all starting a buisness is risky and speculative for this reason), and figure out, can this guy run a stand and make a profit based on his business plan and idea? It's a great deal more complicated because of course, the start up founder him or herself is also being looked at for trust worthyness. The idea itself is usually extremely complicated, and good start-ups often take weeks of assessments to figure out if they have a legitimate plan or not, ect.  The number isn't made up ... the person seeking the investment capital is proposing a value, and the investor agrees the value is accurate when he agrees to invest. This is how value is created. You ever hear the term 'wealth creation'? This is actually where it comes from. Ideas have value when you structure them properly, and that value is abstract and can't be spent , but eventually becomes products which have value and can be sold. Once an idea is 'monetized' it moves from being theoretically valuable, to actually valuable. That is why guys who invested $1000 into Google when it started are now millionaires. The idea was so much MORE valuable than the proposed investment value, once it moved from theoretical into real.   It's amazing to me how much hostility there is basic financial logic.  It's not smoke and mirrors. Money is an odd entity, but it does allow you to create something from nothing. And it works so long as an actual product of actual value is being made at the end. ",10년 전,3,

You didn't take into consideration that the dividends grew by over 80% from 2005-2012, and then in 2012, there was a 2:1 split, doubling your dividends per share (because coca-cola still paid out the same amount per share). And today the most recent payment was $0.33.   Now add to that the 97% gain over ten years. By capital appreciation alone it beat the S&P500 and Dow by over 20%, this doesnt even include the dividends i discussed!!!Now look if you had invested in DPS (Dr Pepper Snapple) you would have had an even more extraordinary gain. the reason i point this out is because it wouldn't have taken a genius to figure that DPS possessed more growth potential and return on equity than KO.   So i would say yes.

Rather than depending on charts and things that could be strategies for alchemists or astrologers, these people look at the fundamentals of a business, but also do a lot of other analysis. I've bought several books, studied several strategies, and I've decided that when I get into college (currently 17), I'll major in economics, intern, or get a job at a fund for awhile, and then start my own based off of similar principles that Ackman or Buffett might follow. I'm going to be a value oriented activist. It makes the most sense to me. And I really don't like day trading or holding stocks for short periods of time.

@financesafeguard8234,"Interesting video, but like Bryan says, many people cannot simply ""be financially secure"" before working off debts very slowly. However, many people don't realize that they CAN payoff loans if they just do something as simple as a lemonade stand every week and get that extra 100-200$ every month to pay them off.   I suggest paying off the easiest debt first, then put what you were spending on repaying that debt to the next lowest debt etc. This is one of the best ways to get out of debt if you have any amount of debt. This requires some discipline and a bit of planning, but it is worth it if you are struggling with debt. Hiring somebody to keep records of everything and make a plan for you to repay the debt is NOT a waste of money, this can have a huge impact.   Another way is to ""consolidate"" the debt. Meaning taking all debts and combining them into one larger debt. This way you can much more easily track your expenses and what you need to pay off.

That means, if you own 500 shares, that's $500, regardless if you own 1/3 or 1/3000 if the business. Secondly, dividends are not a cost because dividends come from the profits of the business. The profits of the company can either be A:reinvested B:cashed out to shareholders(dividends).

@TheNecropolis20,you should watch the video again you just dont seem to be getting the lessen down. Ackman raised 500 dollars from a private investor he gave that private investor the right to 30% of the lemon aid stand business. the lender who loaned 250 dollars is just a bond holder only only gets 10% return on his business per year. in fact one of the reasons why the business was losing in its first year was because the lender needed 25 dollars back and also paying taxes took such a bite that the first year was up profitable.,11년 전,1,
@ssuperknuxx,"It comes ftom cash generated from operating activities, i.e. selling lemonaid. At the end of Year 1 you have $800 in revenue + $250 residual cash left after buying the 1st stand and inventories - $530 labour costs - $25 debt + $5 tax compensation. That brings you to $500 neccessary to start up another lemonaid stand. Or you can do it another way: go to the Cash Flow Statement (@ 08:19) and see step by step how you come to $500 at the end of Year 1.",11년 전,23,

So maybe he just pulled that $5 out of his ass (it couldn't be new investors because in the later part he still talks about his original angel getting full return on his 1/3 share) or maybe the lemonade stands got cheaper to build due to a combined forces of technological progress, unemployment and deflation.",11년 전,0,

@clray123,"russell schaeffler I believe it's fairly common knowledge.  There are two ways of improving business: by reducing risks or by increasing expected gains. The skill of a businessman consists in being able to do both.  The risk part is done either by hiring other people with special skills who are able to avoid the risks from materializing or at least to deal with their consequences. Unfortunately, high-skilled people are generally not dumb to sell themselves cheap, perhaps to the point that the venture is not any longer profitable if you want to have them. So, generally it's more convenient and may cost less to find someone (preferably deep-pocketed) that would agree to bear the burden of risk for you and dumb/adventurous/desperate enough to not demand full return on his capital. Failing that, you can also try shifting the risk on society at large (and possibly face punishment when they catch up to your tricks).  The key lesson is you cannot make risk disappear, but you need to do something about it and first and foremost you should not keep it to yourself (see above; risk-handling is better left to well-paid, highly skilled professionals and rich investors, not enthusiastic entrepreneurs).  That's even proper when judged from a left-wing perspective because it harms the ""evil greedy capitalists"" in a way by pulling out money out of their fat pockets and forcing them to contribute back to society. From a right-wing perspective one would also add that there is no need for any further mechanisms of redistribution, as the redistribution already happens by means of capitalism.",11년 전,0,

Two things in here people might question is: 1) using the after tax ($10), instead of the pre-tax ($15) lost. Based on 5:41 cash flow statement after 1st year, he get $5 tax credit, so he is using that number. 2) he doesn't need additional $200 cash inventory for the already operating 1st store, because of accrual accounting meaning business like people could buy inventory on credit cards and don't pay the $200 till later especially if they established good relationship with suppliers, and been operating for a year.

There's also occasional ""resets"" (wars, revolutions) during which accumulated wealth is destroyed and/or forcibly redistributed from ""the rich"" (savers/investors) to ""the poor"" (criminals/combatants).

Had Mr. Ackman published all up front start up costs the lemonade stand would have never got off the ground. There are maintenance costs over the next 5 years on the existing stands to keep them in good standing. This could include paint, new boards, missing screws. Then there is the licensing required by city's to operate a business in a certain location. Rent on the land to have the lemonade stand. Obviously there was no purchasing of a spot to place the stand. The startup cost was merely to buy the stand. Not the location it was to be placed. Insurance to protect our investment against acts of nature, vandalism, or illness' brought on by ""bad"" lemonade in the event of a law suit. Last but not least is the percentage of spoilage. Lemons that go bad. Partial jugs of lemonade not served at the end of the day but cannot be saved and have to be dumped to comply with safe consumption federal laws.   In no way shape or form am I criticizing Mr. Ackman.

@mihirm3632,***** What happens in real life is that the actual money used to build the company is from borrowing or investment. So the actual amount that we have above is $750. The $1000 dollars are just magically assumed to be the value that we bring along.   As someone explained above if we offer 33% of our business to the investor and he gives us $500 then it automatically means that we have bought in the remaining 67% which works out to $1000. This is because we want to control the company.  The actual rate that we get and the actual value will be determined when we actually sell the company. The share value is in fact a pseudo value.,11년 전,2,
@clray123,"***** Book value of a company does not equal its market value, which does not equal available cash at hand. The $1000 in book value is what the accountant recorded to account for the 66%/33% ownership stakes.  Of it only $500 exists in form of available cash, the $1000 constituting the remaining book value is more or less fantasy (and therefore called ""goodwill"").  The market value of the business would be what someone else would be willing to pay for it. It might be less or more than $1500, depending on whether they are more skeptical or more enthusiastic about the future prospects than the current owners.  The important thing to remember is that things do not really have any ""intrinsic"" value. Rather, everyone may come up with their own price of something; the price will only be realized if someone else agrees with them (which is very unlikely to happen if they can a better deal elsewhere - which is why market prices for some well-defined good or service tend to be quite uniform).  You could argue that the $500 cash has an intrinsic value - it's worth exactly $500 after all. Obviously, it is true in a shallow sense, as long as you stick to using dollars as a metric of value. However, if you consider that $500 can buy you an X amount of stuff today and Y amount of stuff tomorrow, you realize that even cash has no stable value - it's an asset just like others, the value of which fluctuates relatively to other assets. This relative value comes from demand, which apart from common use comes from the fact that you cannot pay taxes or obtain any public services using any other asset (which you'd have to sell for cash first).",11년 전,0,

@OratorImperator,Goodwill should not be placed on the balance sheet upon creation of the balance sheet. Goodwill is only generated when a business is purchased above its net asset value. Remove the Goodwill and change Shareholders' Equity to $500 and you have a correct starting balance sheet. Intangible assets are rarely placed on balance sheets except during purchase situations as it is very difficult to value expertise and ideas.,12년 전,0,
