@SashiOno,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  02:36 🪑 The costco bayside chair, at $110, has been the tech lead's daily driver for 8-10 years, providing decent value, but lacking lumbar support and having non-maneuverable armrests. 04:40 🪑 The Herman Miller Embody chair, priced at $1600, features an exoskeleton for spine contouring, offering comfort similar to sitting on a pillow. However, the tech lead criticizes its slippery surface and size. 05:52 🪑 The Autonomous ErgoChair 2, around $400, is praised for its customization options, including adjustable lumbar support, seat tilt, and armrests. However, its firm cushion hardness is noted as an issue for prolonged sitting. 07:46 🪑 The Steelcase Gesture chair, priced at $1000, is commended for its beautiful design, customizable armrests, and professional feel. However, the fear of getting it dirty and its foam cushion hardness are highlighted as drawbacks. 09:36 🪑 The Staples Hyken chair, around $200, stands out for its lumbar support, headrest, and tilt-lock features. Despite its basic design and cheaper plastic feel, it is considered one of the tech lead's favorite chairs. 11:00 🪑 The Herman Miller Aeron chair, priced at $1500, is acclaimed for its high-quality construction, mesh netting, and ergonomic design. It provides a premium feel, inspiring longer desk sessions. However, it restricts sitting cross-legged, lacking a headrest.  Made with HARPA AI",1년 전,1,

@antiquegrrl,"I had several good laughs in addition to being impressed with your overall review/s and your conclusions.  I have it down to x1 chair,x2 chair or hyken. Got a great deal on x1 (~520 with headrest  for ~800 chair)brand new on amazon with prime deal and 150 off for getting amazon card) but lumbar is so stiff and uncomfortable. I can return w/no monetary penalty.  Had tried x2 at Relax The Back who did not have x1 to compare - and that was more comfortable. Liked looks of x1 better and sales girl said they were the same otherwise. Not exactly true! Not sure if x2 more comfortable re lumbar only because of stretchier mesh, but also it is I know as the lumbar spring is worn out from use, being the floor model as the salesguy mentioned  and he has had customers complain that the x2 they bought is uncomfortable re the lumbar unlike demo chair in the store and he tells them to use for awhile and they never do return them for that reason.  Before and during this time I tried many other chairs at relax the back where I had gone to try the xchair due to it's arm moving in out, back forth and most importantly at an angle...and looked at tried all relevnat chairs at Staples and the Hyken is what I came up with(only Ayalon had the angle arms but the mesh back maybe not supportive enough for long hours but it was not bad. I was not so sure about the material seat of the ayalon either, both good and bad ...cat would like that better tho). I chose the Hyken as my favorite without knowing it was a best seller due to comfort over long hours sitting. My one issue with Hyken is arms don't angle in/out adjust that easily otherwise and I feel that I need that but perhaps if they are close enough I don't. The Hyken is made for smaller people which became apparent right off the bat and that is why I gravitated towards it.  Have you  tried the X chair ? Wondering what you thought. There was  a lot of hype with them apparently  for sure. x2 is so high in price that maybe one of these other high enders would be better if one were to spend that much money- Leaning toward trying Hyken and returning x1 but if x1 would break in that would be good since it is here and nicer looking than Hyken probably longer lasting. It was such a good deal. I have till Nov 15 to return x1.",1년 전,0,

These are our first and will likely be the last mesh chairs we will ever buy. The plastic seems to squeeze my hips after long hours at the computer, making it difficult to walk afterward. And it seems to numb the butt after a while. The plastic is hard and uncomfortable. It makes loud popping noises when I move around. The head rest is awkward and pushes on my shoulders, so I removed it. And I can forget about trying to sit in this chair with shorts on. The mesh is painful on the skin.

I am 5'8"" (175 +- 5lb) but because of my short legs and current desk height any chair I use absolutely needs to be around 16 inches max for the seat height including the cushion (if it isn't mesh). Over 18 inches and my feet don't touch the ground without something under my feet and over 19 and my athlete legs hit the underside of the desk. I definitely require neck and lumbar support and the arm rests must be under 25 inches otherwise they will hit the desk. This severely limits my options.

I'm 6' so other people's mileage may vary.  The other thing is that the armrests aren't very adjustable (only up and down) so they don't really work with my desk.

@DanOblinger,"STEELCASE GESTURE V2 - Loved the video, here is a comparison for your readers.  I have a couple mesh chairs at home, and my wife's back started hurting her.  She got a steelcase V2, she is a bit shorter and the non-adjustable seat and other things really hurt her on the cheapie mesh.  Then MY back started hurting so I 'stole' her chair for a bit.  Wow!  it was better.  So I researched the SNOT out of which chair to get.... In the end I got a refurbished V2.  (much cheaper than a full price one, and these guys really redo all the parts of the chair that wear).  My back is MUCH MUCH happier.  I cannot compare to this Haikken, but I can say I love the V2, and I cannot imagine worrying about the fabric, but I don't often drop into it from a super sweaty run....   definitely worth the cash for me.    p.s. the chair seat is very flexible on the edges so you could sit cross leg, but still the virtue of this chair is to gets you into good posture.

@sntxrrr,"Good arguments and a great video. But I would like to add two things. Those expensive designer chairs like the Aeron and Steel will last longer and can be serviced making their cost of ownership very similar or better than a cheap chair you have to replace every 3 years. I have had my Aeron chair for over 20 years and I only had it serviced once, replacing the coasters, lumbar support and leather armrest. With maintenance this chair can outlive me and that not only adds financial but also environmental and personal value. I still enjoy this chair and sit on it daily for several hours both for work and pleasure. I did miss a headrest on this chair but there is a third party headrest available designed by the original team that designed the Aeron itself. Yes, it's an add-on but it has greatly increased my enjoyment of sitting in this chair. That said, I understand that these chairs aren't an option for everyone - financially or otherwise - so it is good that you showed some quality cheaper alternatives.",3년 전,1,

@PierreVB-514,"I have been juggling between my Corsair T1 Race chair and my IKEA Markus chair. Both of these offer a higher back support so we may lean back our head on it. The thing though is that both have minor inconvenient.   The Corsair has an odd shape to its seat and back rest that is angled on both sides. This feature may feel snug at first but can feel restraining after some time. Crossing our legs on this chair quickly becomes painful , and when leaning the back rest at a 45+ degree angle we can feel a bump form on our lower back which can also become painful.   The Markus from IKEA is simpler in design but its armrests are much more solid , though I have to use two small accessories to keep the comfort level at a minimum. A mesh-in-a-curved-steel-ring is essential to make the lumbar support adequately positioned , and a wide cushion is also required because the seat can feel hard after a prolonged period of time.   Just to let you know , I'm 6'4"" tall and I have a slim physique. I can spend hours every evening and weekend in front of my computer and the chair I use is key in preventing back injuries.",3년 전,0,

@BKDDY,"The Hyken & Costco chairs have the same issues. The mesh on both are cheap and will sink over time and if you sit on them 8+hrs a day they'll be lucky to last you 2 years. (if you're 200+lbs they probably wont last you one year) Another problem is the actual design of both the Hyken & Costco chair.  Look at 12:50 and notice how the Herman Miller has a ""V"" designed brace in the back that is much larger & spans a bigger length than the Hyken. The Hyken & Costco have a brace that doesn't support the entire back of the chair. Why is this important? Because over time both the back of the Hyken & Costco chair will actually bend where the brace ends, (in the middle) and essentially make it so you can't sit up in the chair at all unless you put a pillow behind your back.  Over time the lack of bracing will also make the chair snap in that location. You can always return/exchange the Costco chair at any time so at least you wont be out money if you buy one of those.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Here is what I can say 1> Hyken -> With that headrest, you can sleep on that chair comfortably. I can see the chair will  last for me for a very long time too. Mesh is great but it is not as great as compared to Aeron. 2> Aeron -> As soon as you sit, you feel the diff.. rather I feel the difference. But somehow I feel for a long time sitting purpose, Hyken could be more comfortable than Aeron.   If you wanna get one.. Get Aeron",3년 전,0,
@Kolenment,"That weekend fun comment genuinely made me laugh. I bought the Komene ErgoPro, which is basically the same as the Staples and Costco chair, and my only gripe with it is that I slide off. It was also starting to be uncomfortable on the bottom so I put a cushion on it which fixed the sliding. I also added high quality rubber casters and thick armrest cushions and I keep the tilt adjustment almost tight so it keeps me upright but still has just a bit of give. I eventually want to try the Steelcase Gesture for that depth adjustment which is what my chair really needs.",3년 전,1,

@johnellis1783,"Liked the comparisons, great job there.  Only criticism would be that you mentioned the potential costly repairs of the Aeron Chair without mentioning that it comes with a very good 12-year warranty.  Not likely any failures of the chair are going to cost you anything but inconvenience.  Think you made the right choice in the end--after all I'm sitting here in my own Aeron as I write this comment.  I say that having evaluated all the same criteria across the three top chairs you critiqued.  Why did I choose the Aeron?  Because, despite the allure of the new Embody and Gesture chairs, I've been sitting in Aeron chairs at work since around 2003, and I've never been uncomfortable from any aspect--seat, tilt, position, support or temperature.  With 18 years of complete satisfaction, it would seem like an unnecessary risk to try something new at the same high price point.",4년 전,0,

But it's good to know watching your video which chair to buy. Which is my first instinct I should continue to follow. But since I'm concerned the mesh chair I got him need a upgrade. Seeing your video make me realize the upgrade I need to get . The one with the head rest similar to the mesh chair he already have. As for the leather chair it wind up looking good in my dining table . Since I was never done furnishing my living room and dining. 🤣. No money waste thank God.

@Solonneysa,"I keep looking at these chairs, and I'm just **not sold**. I sit in them at stores, and they just don't work, for me; they're uncomfortable! It's frustrating, because I'd like a chair to replace the one I have, and I just can't find one I like. I have a hand-me-down, leather, executive chair, with a wide/deep seat, and wide/tall back. The armrests are also wrapped in cushiony leather. The entire thing is a solid metal construction, with very few plastic parts. The chair is much larger than me, which lets me sit up, cross-legged, without problems, in the seat (something I do often). It's great for sitting up straight, or sitting up to let my cat on my lap. It never pinches the nerves in the back of my legs, and it doesn't feel like I have to sit in one specific position to feel comfortable. One huge issue with most new chairs, like in this video, is they all have enclosed armrests which block me from sitting cross-legged - immediate no.   I have no interest in these plastic, bendy, thinly-cushioned, or mesh, chairs. They cost a crap-ton, aren't comfortable, and look cheap, when put in any environment that isn't a contemporary office, or bare-bones space.   My chair has lasted over 10 years.

@MeticulousTechTV,"I absolutely loved the Hyken Mesh chair when I first got it, but it didn't hold up, especially with working from home. I bought it on a Black Friday sale combined with a coupon code and a Staples BoA cash back offer, so I got it for a stunning $130 shipped. It only lasted about a year before the foam in the front that supports your thighs came totally loose. I can push it back into place, but after I get up / sit down 2-3 times it falls out again. Another 9 months of using it this way has lead to the mesh sagging significantly.  The potential sale prices make me tempted to just buy another one since I loved it so much when new, but I'm also tired of buying new chairs every 2-3 years, which is leading me to look for something more premium that will hold up longer and possibly be serviceable.  Edit: I think for someone who is only using it a few hours a day (versus my 12+ hours a day), it's the best bang-for-the-buck option on the market and the chair most people should go with. If you require longer hours or you're taller/heavier (I'm 5'10"" 170lbs), one should look elsewhere",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@OpenAIChatGPTbot,"I have the Hyken chair and am 6'2 145 lbs. It's an absolute nightmare for even moderately tall people. First off if you plan on using the headrest, in its stock form, it will dig into your shoulders or even your back. The height seems to be designed for those that fall below 5'8. There are videos on how to mod the headrest, but even with that extra length it still digs into my shoulders forcing me to hunch or slouch beneath it. I am thus forced to use it without the headrest. Now the second problem, the arch support and the curve in the lower back are WAYY too low on my back even at its highest setting, it nearly jabs into my sacrum. This also forces bad posture and pain over even just an hour or two of sitting. The lack of adjustability is a huge negative for me. I did a mod where I slid the seat forward more allowing for a further back and deeper position to alleviate some of the issues with the arch being so low. This made it more comfortable and supports the back and legs better. The armrests are at awkward widths in my case and I usually only rest my left elbow on it as I keep my keyboard off-angle -15 degrees or so for more mouse swing on lower dpi/sens settings. Quality control is also bad as some armrests won't even match each other's levels, one arm will be millimeters lower or taller than the other and the mesh frame will be seated off balance leaving you rotated at a slight angle rather than sitting straight. Overall it's an ok attempt at trying to be a more ergonomic chair, and I would rec it any day over terrible gamer DRX style chairs or executives and any other cheap office chairs on the market, but I regret my purchase and wish I had just put the money towards something better.",4년 전,0,

Ive had it for 4 years now, I dont treat it particularly well and it is in identical condition as the day I bought it (used already). That is a big difference and worth paying extra money to avoid. As the cheap chairs wear out, they offer leas support and becomes less comfortable. Im 44, can work full days in the Aeron chair and I never have back issues.

When I bought my Aeron back in 2012, it cost $869 or something.. and even then I thought that was bonkers.   I dont know where or when or how the new price has bumped it up to $1500.   In its defense..again.. all these years later with daily use.. all day, every day... its never skipped a beat. It works just as good as it did on day one.  It would still look brand-spankin' new if I wiped it down, else it has no scuffs, no blemishes, the mesh is still absolutely flawless, the added headrest is a godsend as I do find I nod off and thought I was gonna die a few times when my head flopped back when I dozed of and and felt like it was gonna break my neck.. not the chairs fault, I just simply need a chair with a headrest, and now I have it...so now its even a great chair to doze off in.  9-years later and proven its worth IMO.. but must admit that the cost is a hard pill to swallow, but just know that if the chair is a good fit and complement for you, it's of a quality so high that you'll likely own it well beyond its 12-year warranty period, and so long as you don't beat it with a hammer or a machette, it'll look like new the the whole time.",4년 전,0,

@garolstipock,"@Salut For stiff-limbed folk like me, crossing my legs (if you are talking about 'indian style' cross legs, is actually quite painful for me. I'm just not limber, my knees and hips have 'latent' issues from wrecking them playing sport neverendingly as a younger man.   Plus the very hard frame of the chair I would think would not contribute to comfort.   relaxing, as is 'reclining' back ranks pretty high in Herman Miller chairs when compared to others (head-rest notwithstanding), I'm sitting in a Steelcase Gesture as I write this, and have access to Steelcase Think v2 and Leap. None 'recline' as well as a Herman Miller, but all of them would be more comfortable options to cross your legs, or fold your legs under you on than the HM Aeron... or to have your legs laid out straight ahead of you, because of the hard-rigid frame of the Aeron.. whereas on the others you have softer pliable seat cushion that you'd be in contact with.  Best 'relax' would be a Barcalounger, or that style, but so far as task chairs go, the Aeron is a good spot to 'relax' and recline so long as you either have your legs bent at the knee or can prop you lower legs onto a footrest of some kind and add a 3rd party headrest, which impacts the aesthetics but greatly increases the napping comfort.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

And It’s the only chair that I find attractive without losing ergonomic points (the look and description of the chair seems pretty good). I’m willing to save up money and splurge one, but is it worth it’s price?  The mixed reviews on the SAYL chair is making me second guess it. Some complained about its stiffness, useless extension features, tilt angle problems, etc. But it’s all based on personal preference (duh). Other YouTube reviews I’ve seen are also mixed, they either liked it or nitpicked every little thing.  I haven’t sat in enough chairs to know what I like. I’m a 5’4, 125lb woman and I just want to survive long hours of sitting in good chair.   I mean, I could just buy it and return it if I don’t like it lol.

@EbonySeraphim,"I think the Herman Miller Embody was overlooked and had some bullshit critique. Complaining about the armrests being ""difficult"" to get in the exact position? You do know this is something that shouldn't be slipping unless you intend on setting it right? I think what he means to say is ""when you're dicking around trying to get it exactly somewhere, it doesn't work"" -- this is true. I just came back from a showroom where I instinctively was doing that and I found it hard. Then I came to my damn senses and used two hands to set it where I wanted, and realized I wanted them to say there if I put weight on them. They aren't going anywhere unless I want them to and it's not hard to get them there. Slippery material is also not the best criticism for the chair itself considering you can get different material for it when you order. I'm sure some of them slip less, but I think I sat on the one he's on there and I had no issue on it. Next complaint: ""I'm too skinny to push down on the cushion"" -- I'm fairly certain other chairs would give you the exact same problem. Lastly, there's a huge breezing over the adjustment options of the chair but the Embody has a very unique ability to extend the seat length which was shown off for another chair and missed for this one somehow. Normal people who are spending the $1k+ on that chair would know what it can do.  General things missing from this review that I find most people should ignore (if spending over $100 on a chair so you care about not making a mistake): * None of these chairs were rated for lifespan. My current chair is $200-ish from Amazon, mesh. I loved it at the start and it was flawless, but the tension that locks the back spring in place is worn  after only 2 years? If even that and it no longer supports my back weight even with the front knob at the tightest. I'm 170lbs and 6'1"" so..fairly skinny. That lifespan is unacceptably short. I'd rather buy a better chair that lasts 6+ years, than 3 of those lasting 2 years a piece. * Adjustable armrests can be annoying if they pivot or move all the time and don't ""lock"" into place. Again, my current chair is annoying that the arm rests don't just say where they are. To be honest, they become a distraction and I find myself uselessly playing with the adjustment to no benefit.",4년 전,0,

I chose the Herman Miller for me, as it has a 12 year warranty and will most probably last much longer. So if the cheaper chairs just last 2-10 years but the Herman miller might last 20, the price difference isnt that much.  During its lifespan it might be the best there is for my back apart from being also very well designed.",4년 전,8,

In my university (when we used to attend to school) we had the Herman Miller Aeron on various places at campus.

It feels amazing if you slouch down but that kinda defeats the purpose of an ergonomic chair, right?  The  lumbar is also not adjustable enough for taller users.  The fabric is nice but when new, beware of your knuckles.  It's like a cheese grater and you will lose some skin until it breaks in.  My cat loves to scratch on the mesh and it's so far holding up quite well. No claw damage at all.  I used it for two days and gave it to the 5'7"" wife.

@freemansfreedom8595,"My experience about the expensive ""meme"" chairs, I found one Steelcase that someone threw away. Outside the consumables, and some squeaking, the chair was good. The chair was marked as a refurbish on the bottom, refurbished around 2004 IIRC (don't remember the exact date) model not even listed on their website anymore. I sat on the damn chair, not even adding new cushion, nor anything like that, and it was, hands down, the best chair I've ever used, period. It was easy to sit down, stay a bunch of hours on the bloody thing and get up better feeling than I was when I sat down. I mostly stopped shuffling my posture on the chair as it was mostly triggered by the discomfort that you don't even notice day to day. If you do have the chance to test try a good chair, from a reputable manufacturer, do it. It is worth finding which ergonomic chair is for you and spending that premium. The best chair is the one that you don't feel it, both after a long session, and changing your (naturally) bad posture to a good one.",4년 전,6,

The gas cylinder died and I felt like a hobbit reaching up to use my keyboard. Because of everyone working at home, thrift stores don't have office chairs anymore so I had to buy a one new. I have never EVER bought a NEW office chair. Always got them donated or from thrift stores.  I went to Staples, sat on all the chairs, compared prices and decided on the Hyken. I have never used a mesh chair and loved the feel of it. All my other chairs the cushion will ALWAYS COMPRESS OVER TIME and hurt like heck. No more cushion chairs for me.   I know it's stupid and a waste for most items but I did buy the extra 3 year protection. I can have the chair replaced for any reason for 3 years. Ironically I had to replace it the same day I bought it because a part fell out during assembly and the gas cylinder failed when I first sat in it (If you get a Hyken make sure the green plastic tube thing DOES NOT FALL OUT OF THE GAS CYLINDER before the last step).",4년 전,1,

The lumbar support is poorly designed in my opinion; it's basically a curved piece of plastic and I found that the ends of it jabbed into my kidneys leaving me sore and aching at the end of the day.  Additionally, the headrest is WAY too low... I'm 6'2 and the headrest just jabbed into my shoulder blades with it on.  There are a bunch of people posting instructions on how they modified the headrest to work for them... even people that are 5'8 said the headrest wasn't tall enough for them.  I was very unhappy with the Hyken and returned it.    I went to a Staples store afterward and there are several other mesh chairs that are more comfortable... the mesh fabric on the Hyken is not very nice in comparison.",4년 전,14,

I'm 6 foot, 150 lbs., and it has caused the back to not support me well. The small amount of foam cushioning underneath the front lip of the chair also repeatedly slides out of place throughout the day, causing the back-of-knee support to crumple and produce pressure points under my thighs which are painful. I spend about 10 - 14 hours/day in the chair - it definitely handles long-term seating well, but just be wary about it falling apart like every other cheaper office chair. I'm probably going to go Herman Miller as a result.

@IntoxicatedVortex,Be mindful that the HM chairs do come with a 12 year guarantee. So under average conditions you would expect to have 1 HM chair in the same time you would need to buy 4 Costco chairs (comparing against the cheapest). This means that over that 12 years you're not comparing to $US100 of chair but $400 of chair where your Costco chair is guaranteed on 4 (the 1st year of each new chair) of those 12 years. It also means your point of repair cost not exactly accurate. The HM chairs are still obscenely priced and the way to go is to find a good 2nd hand one at 1/3 the price if that's your thing.,4년 전,2,

There emails basically tricked me into believing there default lie ( try it for a month to see if you like it, The return policy is for 14 days. I bet I am not the only fool who fell for this customer service trick)  I am 70kg. The people who say this is comfortable must be big boned. I contacted secret lab and they fobbed me off. Actually they closed my complaint before I had even opened their fob me off email. I have noticed a lot of people are complaining about how hard and uncomfortable it is. The front of the seat has very little give and cuts into the back of the thighs causing numbness in the legs. The back has also given me sciatica as it does not protect the spine. I am a fit man the sort that does press-up etc but this chair is making me feel about 93 years of age. My work load has dropped and I am going to but back my BMW 5 series sport seat that is far more  comfortable although a little dodgy as i screwed it to some old chair castors. I do thing that there is a marketing ploy with this chair. They already cajole people to give a better review then it is worth by extending the guarantee If you say how fab it is.  I will not advise anyone to ever purchase this. This is such a shame as the chair is very well made and from good materials, including the foam. Finally the arms are too far forward. in order to fit under a desk close enough to reach the keyboard with comfort I have had to remove the armrests. they are great when you dont have a desk in front of you, but then thats not a computer chair. I am going to see if i can sell the bloody thing on eBay or return it. I do not expect them to reply to my email I have found this to be the case from forums.

Other than that, most other chairs do not offer adequate back support and are uncomfortable. I'm 6"" 1', 71KG. The review is flawed because his posture is awful, look at how he always rests one arm on the armrest and how he is always slouched with a forward head posture. Of course he will find ergonomic chairs uncomfortable with that posture. Additionally, the cost of the chair plays the biggest role in his comfort. I think he uses price to justify cheaper chairs.  Herman Miller chairs offer free repairs for 12 years and a used Aeron is around $350-400. He is also short, so that doesn't help.",4년 전,28,
@iTakeCash,Thoughts on the Hyken are all over the place but one thing that does seem to stay consistent is the height and weight of the person.

If you're tall I heard the Dexley is a way better option over the Hyken (though their the same chair technically).

@DementedDistraction,"My problem with the Staples chairs in that $200 range (and as an artist who regularly spends 8+ hours at the computer nearly every day I've gone through plenty over the years) is that practically the entire chair is constructed from cheap plastics.  So while it seems solid at first, after a few months - or a few weeks in some cases, you'll find that key structural points in the chair get loose or wobbly, become brittle, and inevitably break, leaving you without armrests, headrests, lumbar support, and more. That, and/or the mesh stretches, frays, and rips, or you're left with cheap gas cylinders that can no longer support the weight of yourself or the chair.    This just leaves you buying yet another chair and throwing $200 into the trash again and again, so before you know it you've spent the equivalent of an Aeron or Gesture on chairs you've had to toss in the garbage. I've found that spending more for a high quality chair is worth it, because the quality is invested and readily apparent in the product from the largest components down to the smallest bolt, and you'll feel the difference when sitting in it at first and for months and years down the road.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@Mambacit0,"To share some experience, I've had both the Harmon Miller Aeron and Staples Hyken. You can probably get a used Aeron for less than $400 if you're patient enough. The Staples Hyken goes on sale often for roughly $150-170 on staples. Based on my experience, I would only recommend the aeron if you can get it for used around $400 or less. The hyken has been amazing and I would say for bang for buck, it's the best budget chair out there that has all the functionalities you need for a comfortable chair. Personally, if I didn't get the Aeron, I would have been absolutely fine with the Hyken. However, I'm using my Aeron right now and it is amazing. I can definitely justify getting one for $300-400, but not at $1500. I have no issues with the Aeron at all. All positives for me as of now.  My issues with Hyken overtime: To my lower back sensitive people, the lumbar support pillow will dig into your bag over time. It's shaped like a ""C"" in which overtime will dig into your back as you sit long hours. I had to throw a mesh seat on the back so it wouldn't dig into my lower back. Definitely narrow. So if you have a bigger frame, your legs will definitely feel sore when you first get this chair.  However, I would recommend the Dexley over the Hyken. It goes on sale more often, the chair is wider and it's the ""newer"" version of the Hyken. The lumbar support is flat and doesn't pinch your back. Everyone in my household was able to get a Dexley for $130 where I paid $170 for my hyken. At the end of the day, Hyken or Dexley is an amazing pick. Herman Miller Aeron is even better if you have the extra $200 or so. Can't go wrong with either or. However, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get yourself a good chair for your back and posture. Invest into your chair is an investment into yourself and your health.",4년 전(수정됨),3,

@kvnngkronos,"Nice comparison. As a Hyken chair owner, I can say that it is a good chair for what it costs. To me, the standing features of the chair are the headrest and the locking mechanism for the backrest tilt. However, there is a couple of things I wish were different: first being the support and contour in the backrest are meant for slightly or fully reclined position and not well suited for sitting upright as there is a significant gap between the backrest and the curvature of my back; and second, the armrests can benefit a lot from better adjustability, they just go up and down (and they don't get low enough to my liking), adding forward and backward adjustments will hugely improve the chair ergonomics, without this I'm never comfortably close enough to my desk (which is a standing desk with plenty of height adjustability). As a consequence, I can never achieve optimal productivity sitting position with the Hyken chair. For reference, I'm 1.76 m tall and weight about 74 kg.  So, the Hyken chair is good for relaxing or working if you favor reclined sitting posture, not so good if you like to sit upright with the keyboard close to elbow level. I hope this helps.",4년 전,49,

@carb0nxl,Look for your local family-owned office furniture stores / warehouses.. my local store gave me a great deal at $999 which already competed with Steelcase's sale prices on their Gesture chairs.  I should also mention my $999 gesture already included the optional neck (head) rest which is like $200 extra. So I got an amazing deal on a Gesture chair. The full-movement arm rests make it the perfect chair for me IMO and fixed my awful posture overnight and haven't hurt my lower back since I switched from a DXracer.,4년 전,0,

@Zoumios,"In addition, not everyone is a millionaire. That is, even if the HM comes with a 12 year warranty and then breaks right after, it may still be cheaper in the long run compared to re-buying a $200 chair every couple years.   That said, apparently HM chairs last for much longer than their warranty, so that's even more value.   Then there's even the possibility of re-selling the chair because HM chairs have a large used market. So again, more value on the back-end of the overall purchase.   So an excellent chair with a 12-year warranty (labor and parts) that normally far outlasts its warranty and can even be re-sold for partial value back.",4년 전,8,

@Kami-yq3kq,"@TechLead , can you help me figure out what chair might be best for me? I actually own a Herman Miller Aeron. I bought it a year ago because my last chair was leather and it made my back and butt sweat due to hardcore gaming sessions lol. So now that I have the herman miller aeron. My back and butt is always cold. And during the winter time I freeze in the chair lol. And I tend to like to put 1 leg in my chair while I work as well. And the aeron like you said in your video does not really support that well. I have the same body shape as you and probably weight about the same as you. I'm just looking for a chair that will keep me cozy in the winter, wont make my back or butt sweat while gaming hardcore. Something that I can put 1 leg in my chair with me. My dog tends to like to sit behind me in my chair once in a while and I really can't do that with my Aeron chair. The problem I had with your video was your #1 chair pick. The Hyken Staples chair looks like it has the same sort of material as the aeron. And I kinda don't like that material on my butt. I like soft pillow like material like the Herman Miller Embody. But I never tried it and would hate to waste the money on it if I did not enjoy it lol. But I also considered the Steelcase Gesture because you said the arms are great for artist. And I do digital art as another hobby of mine. So I was just alittle undecided between the Embody and the Steelcase Gesture. The embody for the fact that the seat ""might"" feel good on my butt and hopefully not make me sweat and also the fact that I might be able to have my dog in the chair with me. The Steelcase Gesture, because it does look comfortable and you even said it was cozy in the winter :) lol and the fact it might be good for artist. So maybe you can help me decide. Thanks.

With the Leap you can totally put one leg up or sit with crossed legs, as you mentioned you wanted to. It's also a warmer chair for winter compared to the Aeron, being made of cushion and normal fabric. Not so great during hot summers without AC tought. I love how the Aeron looks but I never had the chance to try it out, however, after a lot of research I noticed that the leap was loved by almost  everybody, while the Aeron still had some detractors...

@dja9900,The Aeron is amazing for productivity. Extremely comfortable when used properly. I agree though the lack of headrest and inability to sit cross legged even for a minute makes it a no go for my home office. However for a regular office it might be the best. Also you can't really judge an ergonomic office chair from sitting on it for 5 minutes. The best ones often take days to perfectly dial in to fit your body. If we are just going off of comfort alone from a short stint I am sure one of those bulky leather executive chairs would feel far more comfortable. After a month of 8 hour days however one may feel different.,4년 전,0,

@bizlur,We bought 2 of the Hykens when we started working from home.  We put one together and used it for a couple days and then returned both of them.  Mesh on the bottom isn't comfortable if you like to sit on your leg/foot every once in a while.  We ended up getting a Humanscale Freedom and a Freedom Headrest.  They are much more comfortable.  The headrest version moves forward and you lean back and always keeps you facing the screen.  They are definitely worth 5x the price of the Hyken in our opinions.,4년 전,0,

However, its nowhere near as comfy as the Aeron or Mirra 2 to be honest. Also, they changed manufacturers of the Hyken in 2020 and now the Hyken's don't last. I bought a Hyken 6 months ago and have already had to replace the gas cylinder and the mesh is ripping, yet my 2013 Hyken is perfectly fine. I do not recommend the current Hyken. Any way as far as chairs go people, you can find these high end chairs used in excellent condition for 1/3 of the cost. I snagged a Steelcase Gesture in leather for $300 and an Aeron for $350 there's no reason to mess around with these crummy cheap chairs if you need a comfortable 8 hour chair for working from home or whatever.",3년 전,0,
