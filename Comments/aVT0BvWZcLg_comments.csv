@AbroadinJapan,"NOTIFICATION SQUAD: Where'd you want to see Natsuki and I travel to next?! We're hoping to do more of these excursions throughout 2021! And a special thanks to Sharla & Shiori from Tokyo Creative who came along on short notice to help us film our journey. They're lurking in the background throughout the video. I have to say the Tottori sand dunes exceeded my expectations, and I'd love to re-visit the region if not to explore, then certainly to shoot NATSUKI OF ARABIA.

Night trains are beautiful memories when I was 6-23. The other thing I miss in modern trains is that you can't open windows. Also, all those superfast trains have no way of stopping for anything in time. I know Japanese trains are surprisingly safe, but still. I love the older trains that you can still feel, the cozy movements, the night stops, the change of scenery and climate.",2년 전,0,

The JRL Passes for non-japanese are like 300-400 USD, and I'm trying to figure out if that's a good value instead of a love hotel every night or a hostel/capsule, because after all, the JRL covers the almost all the rails...so...I'll have to look into my financies.

@thehighlassdressmakersshop,"The rooms seen in the video on the sleeper train for Japan are about the right size for the accommodations. The roomettes and suites on Amtrak are different in size and amenities that they offer. While quite a few of the standard roomettes on Amtrak share shower facilities, some include a private shower and separate bathroom facilities. In comparison, I would say that Amtrak roomettes are a little more spacious and the roomette packages offer breakfast and dinner included with the option of complimentary room service or dining in a special dining car. Another amenity that Amtrak offers for their roomette guests is a complimentary toiletries gift bag. The family suites on Amtrak are double the size of a roomette and offer the same meal packages as well as complimentary toiletries gift bags, including complimentary room service with the option to dine in a separate dining car. In comparison to the room that Chris stayed, in this video Amtrak's roomette is almost three times bigger than his room is. In fact, Natsuki's room in the video is the size of an Amtrak roomette, without a bathroom, nor included shower facility. The showers on Amtrak are amazing, you can get up to an hour of shower time using an Amtrak shower, due to their recirculating shower system. The solo accommodations shown on the Japanese sleeper train would normally be a utility closet and used for storing items. The room that Chris stayed in would normally be an Amtrak staff room housing two staff members, who while appreciative for a place to sleep would feel very cramped in them. The public coaches on an Amtrak train offer plush, comfortable seats which recline for sleeping in. Passengers in coach have a snack car which offers snacks for sale with no shower accommodations.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

@ObservationofLimits,"If you didn't know, Japan is the only country granted unilateral protection status. Any attack on Japan, is by treaty, promised to be honored as an attack on America. Mostly because we felt incredibly guilty about the bombs. But also, a few decades later, the US came in and saved Japan's tanking economy, probably the only time we prevented Communism from taking root without waging war.  Something else I always find odd. My father's family is from Japan (moved post-Korean war but parents both in WWII), and most older Japanese people in America will say, ""no Japanese-American, I am American."" Almost as if they subconsciously consider themselves as having abandoned Japan, and so there is no going back. That or they're dedicated to their decision.  Unfortunately, US demands post-war also ended up being a direct cause of the current imperial succession crisis they've been debating for two decades. I think maybe we could partially rescind that abolition of a noble class. No extra privileges, but sort of like knighting people in England, grant people the title for meritorious acts or Nobel-esque contributions to the country. Now you've solved the imperial succession issue without reinstituting an actual caste system AND you've given people a reason to do more for their country.",3년 전,0,

For California, I recommend visiting San Diego, Big Sur, the Redwoods, San Francisco, Yosemite, Napa, Healdsburg (small town, but good wine and cheese!), & maybe Petaluma (smaller town, but I enjoyed it). Los Angeles is usually disappointing for tourism. I live around LA and it's nice for living, but places like Hollywood are not as interesting to see, and I'd actually say it's best not to even go there. Parts of downtown LA like Little Tokyo and the Arts District are ok. There is a good art museum called The Broad and the Disney Concert Hall for classical music. If you like other types of music, there are a LOT of places to see performances. Santa Monica is good for tourism. If you like architecture, then you may like to explore some of the neighborhoods or to do an architectural tour. As for the rest of the country, there is a lot of really fantastic nature to see.

Yeah... You actually may give dollar or two to the volunteer which will stand right on your way in metro or bus station...

@constancestrawn1303,Sleeper trains are so amazing. This video has lit the fire under me to visit Tokyo asap so I can experience this. In Europe we are increasing night train services. Trains are seen as an eco option so the journey itself is built into the holiday. I hope Japan will maintain those two scenic routes for the experience. Sometimes you can get a sleeper car out of Chicago but it's really more because the schedules suck and you're catching a midnight train after a long day. No pleasant scenery. There are a few tram routes in Berlin I use just for the view. Some will go through beautiful lush forests. Those ones are really great on the rare fairytale days we get snow.,4년 전,0,

They were all named Watanabe, so I couldn't call anybody by name. I just called them all Obaachan and Ojiichan (because 80% of the people were elderly).

Night trains are a really comfortable way to travel.

Other then arriving annoyed and stressed at your destination, with a night train one arrives relaxed after a good night's sleep. Yes, it takes much longer, but it happens during the time one sleeps anyhow, so there is not really more time lost. But of course that night connection, starting in Switzerland, traveling S to N through all of Germany and ending in Denmark, got eventually canceled. I assume ppl want to be stressed nowadays. Ah, yes one more remark: That cabin hanger has a looped ""hook"" so it can not be used in a usual cloth cabin. That discourages people from stealing it as they can't use it.

And the beds were too short.  The sand dunes: You... put your feet in plastic bags? This enhances the observation that Japan will not hesitate to produce MORE plastic garbage if it makes some trivial thing just a liiiitle bit more comfortable. Wow.

But sand dunes are so amazing and yet there's no way to record it properly on film, I've found. You just have to be there yourself.  And I've gotten poison ivy from the surrounding forest so many times. I always imagine it would help keep people out, but it's just me that's affected so heavily 😑 Anyway I notice a lot of Asian not-speaking-English tourists there and find myself wondering what similar places they have in their home countries.

@sirrliv,"It's ironic that sleeper trains are losing relevance in Japan while they're enjoying a resurgence in Europe. Thanks to operators like NightJet, an offshoot of OBB or Austrian State Railways, sleeper trains are now available to major cities throughout almost all of Central Europe, with a line recently opening between Brussels and Vienna with connections as far south as Sicily and as far east as Istanbul. And they're proving incredibly popular thanks to ticket costs less than half that of airlines and stations being located in or near the center of every major city.   But while public sleeper trains in Japan may be fading away, a new industry is emerging for so-called ""Cruise Trains"", ultra-luxury trains that offer scenic tours through parts of Japan. The point of these trains isn't so much to go anywhere, but to show off the sights to high class tourists, like a cruise ship on rails. One of the first and probably still the most famous is the Seven Stars of Kyushu, which meanders its way over about 6 days from Fukuoka throughout the Kyushu countryside. Even one former sleeper train, the Casseopeia, which once ran between Ueno and Hokkaido, is supposedly being converted into a cruise train.",4년 전,0,

@Friendship1nmillion," @AbroadinJapan  Chris , Firstly   THANK YOU  for making this #Video for me. That journey would be so convenient for me { disappointed it doesn't go all across the country } . Does either of the rooms you & Natsuki stayed in have usb power points { to plug in things like mobile phone , portable kettles } ❓ There doesn't seem to be much of surfing current in the water off those sand dunes So swimming wouldn't be much fun. How would fishing be like there ❓ Lastly , When you said "" Japan's most eccentric man "" I thought you were referring to Ryotaro 🤨🤭. 🚆🎎🛌🚿",4년 전,0,
