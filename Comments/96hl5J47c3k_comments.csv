@TomHendricksMusea,"Most modern art substitutes weird for quality, narrow isms for scope, and trendy for depth. It also refuses to change or even talk about progressive ideas in art like those that follow  Too many treat art as a marketing scheme. Modern art has become a trendy clique and the art now is mostly over promoted footnotes to greater art that was done 100 years ago.  But art is too important to be reduced to a trendy clique.   Post-ism, is art for a new century, not a continuation of last century trends.   1 Mass Market Paintings like Prints. When any art form is mass marketed it enters a golden age. This has happened with books, records, and film. Let's add paintings. Most art is in storage in museum basements. Mass Marketing allows art to tour in copies and allows artists to make royalties on copies. Why do you think the world gets so excited about a new great book, record, or film; but no one cares about a new great painting?  All are mass produced except the painting.  2. End a Century of Isms. Dump the genres and formulas and let all kinds of art be a part of the art world.   3. Shift Emphasis From Trendy to Quality. Shift emphasis from the latest trendy art, to quality art in any style. Just because art is weird does not mean it is great art.  4. Free the Art From Museums and Galleries. Get the art out of the ivory elitist museum and gallery towers and back into the world.  Have city art centers open to all artists. Make art that is relevant and communicates with people. Start with the first generation of artists online.  5. Postism is Part of a Bigger Revolution. Postism is part of the bigger art and media revolution out of Dallas, that includes art, music, lit, film, media, and a lot more.  6.  Postism online: Online artists are the new wave of art. We had all the isms of last century. Now we have a free for all, of all kinds of artists, that are not sanctioned by any museum or gallery, displaying their work. Out of that comes the next wave and revolution of artists.  Last century the goal was to fit the ism. This century the goal is to do great art – no ism, no boundaries.  Fractionalized art then, synchronized art now. Even calling something modern art is a type of ism that separates that art from the art of the past.  The 20th century was a century of experimentation in art. Now in the 21st we can choose from all those styles and / or start one of our own.  Then too if someone devises a way to charge and collect a penny per view on a webpage, that would allow any great artist to get money for their art and have a career without any middlemen.  Duchamp broke ground 100 years ago - but now his clones are just shoveling dirt.  Weird art is easy, you put a strip of raw bacon across an expensive violin, but it's not good art.  Join the art revolution and pull the art world out of last century.  Musea since 1992.",8개월 전,1,

@KpxUrz5745,"As a lifelong artist with an extensive background and education in art, a good ""art resume'"" having won plenty of awards, and with works in important collections and museums, I remain positive about abstraction, although most of my own work does not fall under this rubric. HOWEVER, and this is a big however, I consider nearly all examples of abstract art shown in this video to be artistic failures. And with few exceptions, I would not want to own or display them, nor would I be especially thrilled to trouble myself to visit a gallery or museum to see them. (I have spent many years doing just that). So who are the few artists working abstractly that I actually find to be great artists? Well, mostly Mondrian. Of course I greatly admire Picasso, who was surely the greatest artist of the modern age. Picasso had immense talents as a draftsman and spatial inventor, which is a lot more than I can say about most of the other artists featured here. There are some brilliant examples here of his cubistic paintings, but I would not describe them as purely just abstract as the term is now used. Picasso used recognizable subject matter, and he was one of the top masters at composing and defining space and form in utterly original and intelligent ways. Another artist could compose a non-subjective arrangement of triangles and trapezoids similar to some of Picasso's cubistic buildings in Horta de Ebro, but no other artist could do it as well. If one even achieved half the brilliance of Picasso, then I would credit them as a superb artist. Interestingly, I have not yet found such an artist. There are other abstract artists who impress me, artists like Motherwell and probably one of the very best is Arshile Gorky. So, all these other artists such as Nolan, Kelly, Stella, Louis, Reinhardt, Basquiat, Condo, Koons, Newman, Delauney, Hesse, and a great many others are either inconsequentially minor (in my estimation!) or otherwise mostly uninspiring and unimpressive, regardless of what they achieve in the art marketplace. To conclude, while I love the idea of abstract art, in practice it has mostly resulted in art that does not measure up to the best artistic measures.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Like, the video was not tying itself into knots just to include a female artist's work any more than it was tying knots to include Fauvism and Cubism in the same video.

@hd-xc2lz," @MCAndyT   Substitute ideological purity for artistic intention, and you'll grasp my meaning. af Klimt stated no interest in the history of art, of freeing herself from aesthetic assumptions, or rethinking painted form, rather she was creating diagrams to illustrate forms to be found in the spirit world. Read Kandinsky's Concerning the Spiritual in Art, his goal was to rethink painting practice. O'Keefe and af Klimt, for instance, are miles apart in intention. There were many 20thC women working with abstract artistic form, af Klimt was not one of them. Next time please consider asking for a clarification before crassly scolding.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@MCAndyT," @hd-xc2lz  She went to art school, she made paintings and they're dope. They deserve to be included in this video on abstract painting. Intentionalism isn't the only theory for interpreting & evaluating artworks, nor determining how to talk about them in communion with one another. Bridget Riley doesn't self identify as an Op Artist, but it's absolutely reasonable to bring her name up when talking about Op Art (which they do in this same video). Dali was kicked out of the Surrealists by Breton, but do I get mad if people talk about him as a Surrealist? Not so much. I appreciate you wanting to clarify and protect af Klint's artistic integrity, but you did so by invoking ""anti-woke"" language: "" just to make space for a female painter,"" which was entirely unnecessary. That's why I crassly scolded you, you portrayed some ulterior motive by the makers of this video rather than sharing your helpful information and moving on.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@hd-xc2lz," @MCAndyT   Yikes. I could care less where my comment falls on a woke scale. There is a point where advocacy/activism willingly departs from scholarship and historical record to create heroes for its adherents. Someday for fun, please read/review the pre-war history of socialist realist literary and art criticism in Europe and the U.S.. Largely ignored today as ideological bunk, it was passionately argued for in its time (strong influence on WPA artists). Reading original texts, one is immediately struck by how badly colored it is by a reduction of past authors, artists, composers, etc. to either heroes of the People, or enemies of the People, with little patience for context of milieu, authorial intention, etc... Point is- it's a scenario quite redolent of the state of art history today. I'm in the art world, have many friends in art history, trust me, there are many female art historians who in private smirk at the elevation of af Klimt to feminist hero and inventor of abstraction status. Again, populist hero crowning (yes, ulterior motive) that motivates activists, but isn't useful to historians writing on the period because it isn't borne out by period literature.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@MCAndyT," @hd-xc2lz  You're assuming her inclusion in this video was motivated by activism rather than the power of her work to serve as a good case for abstract art (I.e. the title of the video). Yes, af Klint made no impact on the history & theory of painting while she was alive making her paintings, but once they were revealed to the greater art world contemporary audiences recognized just how special the work itself is. Same thing with the photographer Vivian Maier, or the cave paintings in Altamira. The works didn't have an impact until they did. Now that they do, people talk about them and they get reintroduced into the canon and have an impact on contemporary thinking about art. I'm sorry that it's too ahistorical for your liking, but there are young artists today who take great inspiration from folks like af Klint or Maier and I choose to be happy for those people rather than smugly denying  the works' relevance and suggesting ways that the work should not be talked about.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@hd-xc2lz," @MCAndyT   No, I'm objecting to her very recent insertion in the history of abstraction, which has been celebrated in present day feminist art history circles as a victory against the patriarchal exclusion of women from art history. No doubt the contributions of women to 20thC modernist art developments were disrespected and under-considered, but af Klimt is not such a victim, and her works have been lazily mis-categorized to support a present day critique about historical bias. Regarding your point about the impact of Vivian Maier and cave paintings on young artists today, I agree that's a wonderful thing, but that could be said for thousands of minor painters and illustrators in history who never made it into the survey texts undergrads read in art history 101, and I've never met an artist who wasn't aware of, influenced by, and able to name numerous artists outside the canon (particularly local artists). It's practically required to be taken seriously, and hopefully every artist's experience from undergrad to late in life. But... you still want to understand those minor artist's work as they saw it, how it responded to the art issues of their day, if that information is available. Borrowing ""cool"" images without regard for the context of their development, without dialoging earnestly with the insight they once offered, leads to much bad, derivative art.

@IvanGarcia-cx5jm,"Abstractions can be good when their semantic is either self evident or if there is a consensus on its definition. They can be powerful by allowing the mind to handle complex concepts fast. If for the symbol ""2"" some people say it is two and others 3 it looses its value. The same happens with words. The problem I see with abstract art is that I don't see them defining the semantics of texture, edge curves, or geometric shapes. It is meant to be open to subjective interpretation.   If I make some random shapes/texture from the computer and place it as a form of art. Then someone inspect the ""art"" and starts making a whole complex story out of it. Does this makes sense? The same can be done with clouds. I can genuinely paint an abstract art with my emotions and state of mind. And what happens if the person that inspects the painting feels/interprets something totally different.

@rickycouture7224,"I've given this subject a whole lot of thought over the years, though less so in regards to the value of the art itself and more for its (abstraction) value to society as a whole. It's no coincidence that when dictators like Stalin, Franco, Hitler, Mussolini, Pinochet, Peron, etc., each rose to power that their respective governments went to great lengths to destroy these works of art, along with their creators. It's hard to imagine now, but back then these works of art were viewed as vile and no budding dictator could (or would) take the risk of exposing their people to it. The same goes with poets and folk singers, and really anyone with the capacity to inspire through artistic means.  The reason I'm bringing all of this up is because we've seen yet another rise in fascism. We have leaders all over the world corrupted by power and money, many of whom are only a few checks and balances away from doing severe harm millions of innocent people. In my view, much of this (at least in regards to our susceptibility) can be reduced to the fact that modern technology has essentially made it so that our chances of naturally encountering a problem that requires abstract thinking to solve is virtually zero. We have apps for just about anything that might otherwise cause us a stress headache, and so we've chosen to comfortably this alternative world in which we outsource all our problems to our phones or computers.   Even our vehicles, really, as self-driving cars are becoming a reality. Pretty soon we will be living in a world where abstraction itself is nothing but a distraction. Our brains won't be willing to justify the redundancy, because the option to sit back and rest within the confines of a fully self-operating vehicle, thinking only about likes, follows, subscriber counts, vacation plans, Amazon orders, etc., will be far too tempting. And for anyone who thinks this might sound like an episode of Black Mirror, don't get it twisted... We're already there.  Point being, Trump's run at the presidency and subsequent ability to convince tens of millions to scream ""Build a Wall"" while living two-thousand miles from the border, that was the canary in the coalmine for anyone wondering whether or not 21st century Americans were in danger of losing our ability to think reasonably for ourselves. Somewhere between now and then, and way back when, we stopped raising our children to push through the discomfort. We instead took to diagnosing them with disorders like ADD, ADHD, OCD, anxiety or various sorts of learning disabilities. Rather than suit up as parents and introduce our children to abstract concepts, ideas, puzzles, artwork, etc., we thought it wiser to introduce them to the local pharmacy.   This is not to say that parents with children on medication have failed, nor is it to say this is simply the problem of one generation. I think it is the problem of many and by no means do I think it's wrong to pursue modern medicine when needed, but I fear that we are now so comfortable quieting our intellectual and emotional distress -- suppressing it to the point of numbness -- that we couldn't even actively follow an abstract thought for more than a few seconds even if we wanted.  As for my appeal for a solution: More abstract art. More abstract ideas. More abstraction period. We need our brains to be challenged by these things all the time so that when we are confronted with a statement that appears true and another appearing false, that we might have the tools to work it through on our own, or vice versa. We're human beings so it's only natural that the parts of our brains that go unused take a backseat to the parts that do. When we're not exposed to art at a young age, or music, or puzzles, games, existential conversations and the like, we grow to be adults with a very limited capacity for understanding. Instead we just become reactionary, gullible, over-indulgent, feeble-minded consumers. We lack nuance and depth, existing only to have the beliefs instilled in us at a young age passed onto our children -- a vicious cycle without end, all because we failed to see the value in using the better half of our human brain.",3년 전,0,

@jakekaywell5972,"That's very much incorrect. Art does not have to either reflect the real world or display beauty. All it must do it get a point, idea, or emotion across, whether that be love, fear, utopia, dystopia, or whatever else. Any other uses it has are nice, but not strictly necessary. I personally enjoy hard angles and shapes, with nary a curve in sight.

If the claim was accepted by a collector or a trader and they managed to sell it at much higher price, the claim became truth.

@jgordondean,But what of grids and dot patterns in prehistoric cave painting? Or Islamic abstract patterns or Celtic rope patterns? The introduction in this video hints at its European Fine Art bias but doesn’t acknowledge. The reality is that abstraction or more generally non-representational art has been part of human culture for a long long time. The rebellious adoption of abstraction by European artists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is interesting because it those artists were looking outside of their highly representational tradition to other cultures and to parts of their own culture that wasn’t ‘fine art’. They didn’t invent abstraction.,3년 전,1,

@doylesaylor,"The break down in the nineteenth century of painterly realism leading to abstract art’s rise has never united artistic expression as realism once did.  Realism before as a practice got ever more real in some sense.  The obvious observation that this realism was not ‘the’ realism hasn’t reared it’s ugly head during this longish time.  The early oddity of Picasso claiming he was a realist just seemed hubristic to expand the discussion in unknowable ways.  The already inscrutable cubism could claim anything and the public wouldn’t know what to believe.  Some physicist comes along here claiming abstraction in mathematics is one with painterly abstraction.  Agency flowed out of realism into abstraction.  Machines do realism, and anyone can buy a camera that is better than a painter.  Isn’t that Warholian?  Further the Cold War attacked socialist realism, so abstraction was capitalist friendly ‘freedom’.  All of this prancing show offery of claims about abstraction conveniently shut out abstraction from questions to explain itself as put to realism especially socialist realism had pointed at it.  The whole business of property relations as defined by the asset inflating art market that ‘defined’ art has come to a mythic making climax in which artificial intelligence pushes away agency from all plain old human touch to the ownership class of technology.  Intellectual rights belong to corporations rather than the public.  The assault against realism is almost complete with millionaire painters transitioning out of the public muck and mud of humanity into the only true artist is a capitalist.  Hence the full circle arrives from the 19th century agency is capitalism and the rest of humanity are mere bugs and bacteria to the profound creative agency of capitalist class scum.  Of course there are still questions to answer about why this division exists.  Why did realism get put in a box with the lid closed and abstraction sits out in plain view as the art answer.  Maybe because abstraction artists like Gerhard Richter do blurred realism paintings without explaining why visual focus is passé as a fashion statement.  The nearly billionaire Richter can do anything as art, but ordinary poor people are now the fringes and outsider art.  The market expands to include something from nothing because abstraction leaves no room to scoop up the bacteria of human hands.

@duncanweller1,"This is a great video that serves as an example of how to defend the pseudo-arts. This video is historically inaccurate and its arguments nonsense. This video is a baby-boomer tall-tale of the art world that suits their beliefs in unrestrained freedom - the idea that we are all equal and no such thing as talent exists and we can all be artists if we want to be. Here's an example of how this video is ideological propaganda: artists throughout history did not try to ""represent things as they appeared in the world around them."" Artists of the past used allegory, metaphor, symbols and told stories important to their culture. To focus on the aesthetics is to completely avoid the content (the world in which people of the past lived) and the function of the work. Why avoid discussing the most important and interesting aspects of thousands of years of art? Why simplify it so drastically? Could it be that a new world of argument opens up to defend an art form that has little to no content in favour of artists who have nothing to say while simultaneously supplying the rich with an art form that never really challenges them? What makes art great? Surely not the art whose only claim to fame is aesthetic changes over the years? And by the way, modernists didn't invent those changes. Braque and Picasso didn't invent collage; illustrators two decades before them did. Maxfield Parrish used collage twenty years before the term was coined. Motion was represented in comics long before the Italian futurists gave it a try. Cubism comes from stereo-optic photography (photos taken from balloons) and the vast majority of other aesthetic inventions were in lock-step with advances in photography. The modernists were copying photographs, then tacking on their own ""isms."" As a result of copying photographs (as Gustav Courbet - ""father of modernism"" certain did) modernists weren't rejecting reality, they were rushing towards it. They were in love with realism. Meanwhile, photographers, illustrators, political cartoonists, movie makers and so many others of the ""Low Arts"" or ""Mass Arts"" or ""Popular Arts"" were rushing ahead with all kinds of new technology and ideas, from which modernists continue to steal with abandon. The world of art is amazing and the primary functions of art haven't changed. Good art is all around us continuing to perform myriads of functions intrinsic to our human condition, but the field of abstraction (contemporary art in various forms) - as fun and interesting as it can be - doesn't hold a candle to the amazing journeys made by thousands of other artists who truly contribute to our lives rather than making pseudo-art for millionaire collectors. As an illustrator myself, I find the continuing propaganda of the contemporary art world to be astonishing. There's so much out there, like you wouldn't believe. And you don't have to be a millionaire to own an original piece of it. Not at all.",5년 전,0,

@michelepalozzo5824,"A topic way too vast for just one 10-minute, all-encompassing video. Also it fails to explain - even partially - WHY abstraction became a thing: many of the major abstract movements were born out of feeling sort of ""threatened"" by photography, a medium that allowed anyone to portray reality with absolute exactness in a matter of minutes and then seconds. Thus were born those new art forms that investigated interiority and feelings, something that photography (at first only b/w) just couldn't capture. Abstraction became a way to preserve the humanity of art, in a world that was rapidly moving towards automation and anonimity.",5년 전,0,

@wolfsommer1767,It seems that the word and the meaning of abstraction is being deflated it is being abstracted - but there is a point where abstraction is just merely nothing more than chaos and here we must stop wanting to define and put meaning into something that has no meaning at all - there is a difference between abstraction and just smearing or random distributions of color and form - if we lose the definition of abstract or abstraction to those that prefer to use it just to justify their ambition to sell a product to the public we are the victims because we are paying with the loss of the ability of defining reality. Abstraction is still a reality as long as we can derive reality from it if we can not it is not abstraction it is what it is nothing more than chaos.,5년 전,0,

I believe that true abstraction comes from understanding art fundamentals and willingly pushing those rules and bending them for their own visions. Studying some of the most famous abstract works you can see how he artist was thinking and what they were doing to go against traditional art. One who does not understand the rules of art is simply creating for creating sake and there is perhaps less meaning in terms of art professionalism. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing, there are plenty of outsider artist who create beautiful work. Ultimately I think all art is beautiful as it is a form of self expression and dealing with inner thoughts, but I truly believe everyone benefits from learning traditional art or what you call “realistic”",5년 전,0,

@aeromodeller1,"I have always thought ""abstract art"" or ""abstractionism"" were misnomers. It does not correspond to my concept of abstraction. Abstraction seeks to generalize. Each piece of abstract art is a particular. What they usually mean is ""nonrepresentational"". But even that concept is problematical. There are different ways to represent and degrees of representation.  Especially paradoxical is ""abstract photography"". A photograph is an exact optical representation of a particular object. Can't get more representational than that. But photographs of eroded sandstone, broken glass, ice sheets, tree bark, architectural details or leaves are called abstractions. Representational photography shows an object or tells a story that can be put into words. Abstract photographs usually don't.  Most of the photographs you see are about the subject matter, not about the photograph. This is Aunt Em. This is the Golden Gate Bridge. Abstract photography is about the photograph and how it works. The picture of eroded sandstone is about how light plays on a surface to reveal shape and how the photograph captures that light, revealing form. It is not a geological description of sandstone. It does not suggest a conventional verbal category. It is purely about how tonal gradation reveals form. It is appreciated for itself alone, not for its depiction of something else. Being outside conventional categories makes abstract photographs a bit mysterious, and interesting. They are not limited by a title.",6년 전,13,

@curtbarnes4294,"Quite an amazing 9 minutes!  This Jerry Saltz response to a query about abstraction is a more reasoned, rather than historically-based, approach:   Over the past few years, I've noticed a lot more abstract art being made, and I often find myself stymied by something a little bit embarrassing. Jerry, is abstract art for real? I mean, I often don't really get it. Isn't it just smudges and stripes and squares and stuff? -- Embarrassed Dear Embarrassed, You are not alone. I too have heretical thoughts like yours. It can also take 30 years to understand why an all-white painting by Robert Ryman or a pencil grid on canvas by Agnes Martin is art. I can't tell you what abstraction is, but I can tell you a number of things that I think that it allows artists to do. What I say about abstract art could also be applied to representational art. With that in mind here's ""The Jerry Saltz Abstract Manifesto, in Twenty Parts."" 1. Abstraction is one of the greatest visionary tools ever invented by human beings to imagine, decipher, and depict the world. 2. Abstraction is staggeringly radical, circumvents language, and sidesteps naming or mere description. It disenchants, re-enchants, detoxifies, destabilizes, resists closure, slows perception, and increases our grasp of the world. 3. Abstraction not only explores consciousness -- it changes it. 4. All art is abstract. A painting of a person or a still-life is a two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional reality and therefore infinitely abstract. Whenever an artist sets out to make something it turns into something else that he or she could never have imagined or predicted. 5. Think of an abstract painting as very, very low relief -- a thing, not a picture. 6. Abstraction exists in the interstices between the ideal and the real, symbol and substance, the optic and the haptic, imagination and observation. 7. Abstraction brings the world into more complex, variable relations; it can extract beauty, alternative topographies, ugliness, and intense actualities from seeming nothingness. 8. Abstraction, like ideas, intuitions, feelings, and life, is not mimetic. 9. Abstraction is as old as we are. It has existed for millennia outside the West. It is present on cave walls, in Egyptian and Cypriot Greek art, Chinese scholar rocks, all Islamic and Jewish art -- both of which forbid representation. Abstraction is only new in the West. 10. Abstraction gained ground in Western art after centuries of more perfected systems of representation. By the mid-nineteenth century, representation felt like a trap, and seemed empty, false, or limiting. A similar situation existed in the early aughts, after artists of the nineties re-deployed realisms in numerous ways. The field appeared closed off for younger artists. That's why contemporary artists have not only begun to reexplore the possibilities of abstraction, they're shedding much of the Greenbergian cant and academic-formalist dogma that attached themselves to it over the last 50 years. Abstraction is breaking free again. 11. Abstraction offers ways around what Beckett called ""the neatness of identification."" 12. Rothko's glowing floating rectangles of color are more than abstract patterns. They are Buddhist TVs or what Keats called ""good oblivion. One sees what nothing looks like in them. They make you ask, ""What light through yonder painting breaks?"" (Now do you see how full emptiness and abstraction can be?) 13. Abstraction is just a tool. It is no less ""real"" than philosophy or music. 14. Abstraction is something outside of life that allows us to be present at our own absence or alternatively absent in our own presence. 15. Abstraction creates patterns of meaning and its own extremely flexible intricate syntax. It is astral synthesis. 16. Abstraction teeters on making empty gestures while also making deep statements. 17. The camera was supposed to supplant painting but didn't. Instead, painting -- ever the sponge, always elastic -- absorbed it and discovered new realms. 18. Abstraction may speak in a sort of intra-species visual-electronic-chemical-pheromonal code, creating optical-cerebral networks and wormholes, organic maps of unknown yet familiar territories, may have a kind of plant intelligence that allows it to grow, proliferate, flower, change directions, and survive relentless aesthetic predation from a lay public. 19. Abstraction contains multitudes. 20. I've left out No. 20, because I want to hear your opinion: What else does abstraction do that's special?",6년 전,0,

@sleepymandragora1392,"Design and illustration arent the opposite, they frequently use abstraction themselves. In this video for example there is Bauhaus, which can be seen as an art movement, but still produces very modern furniture and other everyday objects and rodchenko is sometimes called the first graphic designer, since some pieces use principles often used in posterdesign to this day.  illustration isnt an art because thats pretty much how its defined. ""illustrare"" is latin for ""illuminate"", the first illustrations were to illuminate biblical figures, making them wasnt concidered art, it was a craft. People in the middle-ages produced the craziest stuff (carpentry, sculpting, painting, etc.) in the name of god and didnt even think about putting their signature underneath it.  illustrators are assigned to projects, an artist does whatever he wants (more or less). In my opinion there are many people that are considered artists, that should actually be called illustrators.

@emilherran,"Visual art has always been a medium that necessitates an artist to communicate their ideas visually- obviously. The reason abstract art- and most contemporary art for that matter- fails to engage with viewers is because it utterly fails at communicating it's concepts visually, thus failing as a piece of visual art. When someone tells of an abstract work's storied history and complex philosophy it- almost- always fails to connect intuitively because there is no evidentiary support for those ideas in the piece itself.  For an abstract work to connect intuitively the concepts must be of an appropriate simplicity. For example, artists like Mark Rothko and Francis Bacon have relatively simple themes and concepts attached to their works. Their concepts can be perceived emotionally, and the abstract technique serves to convey their meanings visually.  Most abstract artists either don't have the talent or or the intuition that is needed for matching an abstract style to their themes, they just come up with a concept and put paint to canvas with no regard for visual communication. As an analogy, most- abstract art is like hiring a mute to deliver a speech. The meaning in the words may very well be there, but that doesn't mean anyone can understand it.  Panting and sculpture are a VISUAL medium. If an artist cannot properly communicate their ideas visually they are failures- plain and simple.",7년 전,0,

Why are people spending millions of dollars are art. They should be spending millions of dollars buying complicated things like sports cars and sneakers. It's kinda like when people make simple food with only a couple of ingredients; it just cannot be good. If you make food it has too super complex and use hundreds of ingredients in order that it tastes good. Simple food is just plain bad. If someone offers me food that has fewer than 50 ingredient I scoff and laugh in their face. Simpletons is what I call them.

@gagi6294," @rron5641  Well that's just not true. Ever heard of occam's razor? You are so wrong that I don't even know where to begin to explain. Abstract art is about penetrating into deeper layers of reality. For example, a realistic painting is made of form, color and texture. If you remove the context, everything that is recognizable, you are left with only form, color and texture, without any association to the perceived world. This is pure potential and a completely new world with new rules. Each shape has its qualities, as each color. Abstraction allows individual study of form and color, without unnecessary noise. This can have many practical applications. Math is a great example, it is pure abstraction. But from a psychological perspective, I would say that your inner space is cluttered with unresolved traumas that you can't appreciate simplicity. It also seems that you would think something is better only because it is more expensive. This is very a very shallow and superficial way of thinking.

We see humans everyday, we see the grass waving in the wind, the trees standing firm. Renaissance art includes subjects such as historic battles. There is so much detail going on and so much work put in to make it closer to what we see in realism. But with an artists touch, because it is impossible to recreate the real world. By comparison, simple geometric shapes in base colors or splatters of paint are loved by none. When you see a traditional art piece, you immediately love it, there is so much going on and so much we can relate to from life or history. And on your other comment about “we should not teach children how to draw butterflies”, you are failing to realize there are art schools for that purpose. By understanding and learning through actual EFFORT, students will be able to achieve much more than just butterflies. The principles of art include form, perspective, values, color. Individually, these can be learned, so that they don’t overwhelm the student. But moving on, students can make connections between these principles and create more complex forms of art.

@TASmith10,"All art is both abstract and realistic, it's just a matter of perspective, and of degree. Most people enjoy both in an artwork, up to the point where they go to extremes. You might not notice the abstraction going on in an Inness or Caillebotte, but your eyes enjoy putting the pieces together into a recognizable image. Thank you Sarah for putting this video together and introducing me to some great new artists. I'm just going to add in one little quote from Stapleton Kearns just to play Devil's advocate, and maybe add an additional perspective to the discussion:    “When I go to the museum, I often find myself standing behind people who talk about psychology. Many people mistake painting for psychology. They know nothing about painting, but they learned about psychology in school. So they talk about their feelings and how the artist must have felt. They discuss the various pathologies of mental derangement and vicariously imagine themselves as decoratively insane, well only a little, nothing too unattractive. They are happiest in front of the work of obviously tortured artists or paintings that lend themselves to speculation on the ideas of Freud. It is a little like the fable from India about the blind men examining an elephant. Each grabs a different part of what must have been a very patient, docile animal and speculates about the larger beast. One holding the tail supposes the animal is very like a snake, another hugging an enormous leg says the elephant is more like a tree…”",9년 전,8,

@TASmith10,"Just adding another quote from an artist friend,  ""There’s a realist movement afoot at the present, so it’s like we’re taking laps around a track. It’s pretty great to see fine draftsmanship and painting. I’ve done my share of academic painting and drawing. But a lot of this drawing and painting stays at an academic level - that is, beautiful nude, beautiful pose, beautiful technique, etc. A lot of concept art is starting to look the same as well. With modernism, people simply took a break for a time. The academic stuff can get boring and redundant. You know exactly what it represents - a naked guy with a stick, a still-life, etc. There’s no meaning anymore. The models can begin to look like they just want to go home.  Prud’hon’s models didn’t look that way.    On the complete other side of the spectrum we have pure abstraction, with Mondrian, et alia. You may not like or understand them because they’re seemingly unreasonable – unreadable. Hence people say, “I don’t get art.” I think it’s safe to say that few of the general public would prefer either extreme. Most people prefer something in between. Take, Andrew Jones as another example.   His pieces are mostly abstract with hints of representation thrown in subtly to make you believe that it’s a figure, or face, or whatever. Even if a work isn’t quite so abstract, compositions are abstract. Interesting compositions always start with abstract forms. If you simply drew what you saw in front of you without organizing it, even if you drew it photo-realistically and with incredible technique, it would be boring. So, most people do like abstract art, to a certain extent. It’s only when you get to the extremes that people start complaining.",9년 전,4,

@danielcookman3971,"As a physicist, what struck me was the connection here with mathematics: from my perspective, maths IS abstraction in the realest of senses.  Take, for example, numbers: when we first learn about numbers, we think of three beans or four cars, i.e. numbers as an adjective to describe.  The first major leap of abstraction we teach is that four is not just a describing word, but also an idea, an object in itself that has properties attached to it (addition, subtraction, etc.). As the maths gets more complex, we continue to describe certain ideas (e.g. the concept of a vector) as objects, which of course from the literalist's perspective is absurd: how can you have a number just exist in the world?!  All of this isn't coincidental.  We use maths precisely because it strips away any of the guff (i.e. unnecessary context) not needed to solve the problem.  Want to add to add three beans to two beans?  Well, it's exactly the same question as if you were talking about cars or anything else:  what matters is the number, not the thing itself.  By doing this, the tools we have left are not only incredibly efficient (algebra, calculus, etc.) but also can have the context built back into them with ease.  The case for abstraction in mathematics is then self evident!  Funny, how different fields of thought end up closing upon the same idea.",9년 전,1.5천,

You are completely correct that mathematics is logical and objective. However, it is also abstract! Take as an example the mathematical subject of abstract vector spaces. It is certainly logical & objective: we define a vector space from a small number of basic axioms and then can derive all of their properties from there. They are also abstract: not only does it have the word abstract in the name, but it's true: trying to picture an infinite-dimensional vector space is certainly something I can't visualise, but regardless they're incredibly handy.",5년 전,1,

Abstract ""art"" plainly sucks because pseudo intellectuals, such as this video, like to give a dissertation on the meaning of what the artist is trying say. When there's no message at all. Which is probably the reason why Pollack descended into alcoholism just as he became famous for his drip paintings. Hell one could argue that the entire post war era of art can be described as the Age of Artistic Hackery.  With Pollack, Rothko, Warhol (who knew and embraced the fact that he was a hack), Basquiat, Damian Hirst, Jeff Koons (who is the biggest hack of them all). There's a reason that artists such as Da Vinci, Rembradt, Goya, Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso, and Dali (prewar) are still remembered. Yet anyone outside of Artistic circles cannot tell you who is the most famous contemporary living artist today.   Hell I would argue that we are living in another age of the Salon.

I feel like the three questions everyone asks their art major friends are a) what even issss art, b) defend abstract art, and c) why would anyone want to look at a bowl of fruit? and youve now covered a and b. just putting the idea out into the cloud of ideas in the world.",9년 전,1,

@sashakindel3600,"The assertion that art was generally not abstract until a hundred years ago doesn't seem to consider the full range of artistic disciplines. What about architecture? While some elements of it mimic things from the natural world, like the leaves on the capital of a Corinthian column, am I mistaken in suspecting that most elements do not? Like the fluting on that same column, or the panels on a door.  One might argue that architecture, and things like pottery that doesn't happen to have pictures on it, don't count because those arts also serve concrete, practical purposes that to some extent dictate their forms. But the video does mention music, which doesn't have that limitation. What sensible definition of art can one use that doesn't include music?  I suppose the end of the video gets at these things, but I'm not convinced that the statement at the beginning is justified in light of them.",9년 전,0,

@maggieedna,"I think there are whole bunch of different ways you can look at still lives. (if I were writing it, I would pick one still life and make as many different case for why its interesting as I could, but it might be rough to find one painting that could shoulder all that.) what made me think of still lives here is how sometimes even if a still life is ""of"" something, the interesting part isnt what its of but how. or you can look at still lives as important records of trade and values and material history. (one  of my professors was really specialized in the history of carpets, and wrote a bunch of stuff about carpets in renaissance paintings). or about still lives as a show of technical virtuosity and use it as a chance to defend things that are ""just"" pretty. or you could always talk about gender and how still lives were a more accessible genre of painting for women. thats all Ive got.",9년 전,2,
@CrumpArt,"+The Art Assignment An aspect I love about still life work is the freedom it can give to talk about a subject matter through euphemism, like how we often use the objects that are accessible and in front of us as stand-ins for characters when relaying a story. One of my favourite paintings ever, The Battle by John Brack – http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=157050, is kind of a combination of still life and abstraction, depicting the Battle of Waterloo imagined as thousands of pencils.",9년 전,0,

@MarkHatlestad,"I think she assumes visual art when saying ""art"". Also, did you watch until the end of the video? She explains that abstraction has always been a part of art, though it's dismissed as craft...architecture would fall into that same category.",9년 전,0,
@sashakindel3600,"I must admit that I started writing my comment before I'd seen the whole video, and revised it once I had.  I took what she said about craft to mean that there are things that are considered crafts, and abstract patterns were mostly limited to those things, not that the presence of abstract patterns is what makes them crafts. That's a pedantic and probably uninteresting point, though.  I do wonder if there's a good reason for the word ""art,"" without qualification, to refer either to all art, or just visual art, but never just aural art, say, or poetry. At least linguistically, visual art seems to be privileged above the other kinds.",9년 전,0,
