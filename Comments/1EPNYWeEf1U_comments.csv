That is, the distance from the hairline to the eyebrow line is half of half of sphere? So this is a quarter of a sphere? Is the same distance from the eyebrow line to the nose line also a quarter?

@ProkoTV,"There are some diagram sheets you can search for. But there are only going to be so many on one page.  The Loomis method is exactly that: a method.

And then one day an artist friend of mine (I also would like to thank him as well, he knows who he is) recommended this video, and for the first time, I actually gained some knowledge on how to draw a head properly. Ever since then I kept practicing, drew almost every day, and joined some workshops. Now I am working as a Gaming Artist reaching my first year in the industry by next week.

@Stmartinianus,"13 yaşındaki bir kız çocuğu yazmış: Ben Berfincan Side Tunç 13 yaşındaki bir kız çocuğuyum. Amansız bir hastalığa yakalandım. Doktorlar bir çare bulamadılar. Gözyaşlarımı şeyhler şeyhi Hz. Hüseyin'in kız kardeşi Hz. Zeynep'in türbesini ziyaret ettim ve orada uyuya kaldım. Rüyamda Hz. Zeynep ağzıma su döküyordu. ALLAH'IN İZNİYLE iyi olacaksın diye müjde verdi ve başımdan geçen bu olayı yazıp halka dağıtmamı istedi. Bende bu isteğini yerine getirdim. Bir tanesini fakir bir kişiye verdim inandı. 13 gün sonra zengin oldu. Bir tanesini zengin bir kişiye verdim umursamadı. 13 gün sonra servetini yitirdi. Bir tanesini memur birine verdim oda umursamadı. 13 gün sonra hapse girdi.""İnananlar mutlu inanmayanlar perişan oldu."" Bu yazı kimin eline geçerse 13 tane çoğaltıp 13 kişiye dağıtsın. Bu yazıyı yazıp dağıtan kişinin muradı 13 gün sonra gerçekleşecek ALLAH'IN İZNİYLE. Hz. Zeynep'in şefkatiyle 13 gün sonra muradına erecektir. Bu yazıyı okuyup umursamazsanız ilgilenmezseniz çoğaltıp dağıtmazsanız 13 gün sonra kötü bir şey yaşayabilirsiniz. ALLAH'IN rahmeti ve bereketi üzerinizden hiç eksik olmasın.

@jakestewart5899,"I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.   1. What do you think happens to someone after they die? 2. Do you think there is an afterlife?  3. If heaven exists, how do you get there?  4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?   Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person:    1. How many lies have you told in your whole life?  2. Have you ever stolen?  3. Have you ever used God's name in vain? 4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust?  5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day?  6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?   The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell?    2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us.    What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus.    When are you going to do that?   Here is a short Christian movie on this subject and depression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc",4년 전,1,

It's been excruciating. Something did not compute and upon seeing this video, I see what was missing. The dimensions of the oval on the side were NEVER given.

@malcolmhisky6665,"Quick question, I saw that when you drew your oval, it was right in the middle of the circle height wise, despite the face having a bit of an upward angle. But in the demonstration using an actual face, the placement and angle of the oval varied depending on what the angle of the face was. Is there an official way to determine the angle of the oval given the angle the face is looking, or should it always be drawn at the same angle?",5년 전,1,

@citeltheof,"I think this video is funny because I ended picking up a bunch of Andrew Loomis art books a few years back and really only cracked the ""Fun With a Pencil"" book and that didn't produce the results I wanted, do I scratched that idea and looked elsewhere. Then I stumbled across this video and the YouTubers simplification of Loomis' Drawing the Head & Hands book suddenly found its way off my book shelf and into my hands. Then I cracked the book, took a look, and went back to the video. 🙄 But, this video reminded me that Loomis really was the man when it came to drawing. Just need to get past his archaic feeling writing and teaching style to learn what he has for me. Hopefully, the rest of you aren't so foolish as to ignore Loomis' work like I did. 😥",5년 전,0,

That is a credo that has always been with me. As for faces its all a case of proportion. Nose being the length of the ears and as wide as the inside corners of the eyes. The eyes are actually halfway down the whole head. The mouth as wide as the centre of the eyes and so on and so on. It is all in proportion , unless of course your name is John merrick.

@std01077,"Big fan of Proko's videos! Have been studying the Loomis method for some time now, and I feel there are a couple of slips in proko's otherwise awesome explanation (correct me if I am the one in error) : a) The circle in perspective inside the sphere is not merely an oval, it is specifically an ellipse b) At 2:10, Proko mentions that when tilting the head upwards/downwards, the ""angle"" changes accordingly. While the line does rotate, the orientation of the ellipse's minor axis should remain the same (and not rotate as seen on the video) - the minor axis should point to the left vanishing point and since the camera or the plane of the ellipse doesn't shift change in any way, the vanishing point (and the orientation of the ellipse) should stay unaltered! c) ...and a question: At 3:23 Proko clarifies that the face centerline should be at the center of the frontplane, not the head-width. aren't these two the same?

You can go at it relying on what you see (hear) or you can use techniques to help you see better and/or create a face from your head.  Then like music it's practice, practice, practice.

It would be super useful to be able to move the head around and see clearly how the construction lines relate. Also, a simple nose would be a huge help too. Thanks!

@jamest.135,"For people still watching this I found a method for drawing a circle that works really well for me and ight work for you too. One mistake I see a lot of people do is drawing a circle with too much wrist action. ""Giggidy"". Instead concentrate on the back of your elbow. Make a few rotations in the area as if you are tracing an invisible circle but instead use only your shoulder to do the rotation. Ensure your wrist is not bent and your elbow is close to your chest. Your goal is to get a wrist that lines up with your forearm. Concentrating at the back of your elbow is a good way to focus on this movement. Once you've made a few roations in the air you like, drop your arm to the paper and repeat the same motion, using just your shoulder while concentrating on the back of your elbow. Press lightly because the friction of the paper is what causes a lot crazy lines. The lighter you stroke ""giggidy"" the last friction so therefore the smoother the circle will be.  This movement works so much better for me because of the greater control afforded by the larger engaged muscle groups. It works for me and hopefully this helps you all.",6년 전,2,

@FlashManinSpace,"Andrew Loomis lives on. Although he did talked about a special method that he uses professionally called the Blocking method. Though this method you illustrate is great for beginners where you just combine standard primitives together in a Boolean fashion. The Blocking method is far superior as you will have to invent your own primitives. So instead of slicing the edge off a sphere and sticking a rectangle for the jaws, you instead invent a new primitive that closely resemble a skull and flesh it out from there. It's why he emphasize so much on skull, tendons, muscles and fat.",11년 전,0,

@Ceceiliapus," Many other people making tutorials just say the following, when drawing human or cartoonish characters with tilted faces: ""Since we see the character from this side, and the face is slightly tilted forward, I place the ears slightly higher, and a larger portion of the side of the head will be visible."" That's not good for educational purposes... I always the started thinking things like: ""How much higher should the ear be placed, and what will it look like when tilted? How much more visible will the side of the head be? Will the proportions of the face still be correct?"" This is the first guide I've come across that in an easy way explains where to place guidelines and what they are for, as well as ensuring that the proportions are right...

@ncshuriken,"LOL my technique for drawing heads at angles other than 'portrait' or 'profile' is to just draw and hope for the best, while hopefully scrapping it less than 4 times! Next I just draw the ""face cross"" to give me the layout of the key features. I have to rely on ""seeing the head in my head"" before I draw it. Usually works okay but it can be really confusing at some angles when you know how it SHOULD look, but you cant seem to translate it to paper. I find heads looking up or down are quite easy though because the circular nature of the top of the head is more apparent and the shallow U curve the eyes will sit on make the downward angle even more obvious. This way seems to make it nice & systematic though so theres no guess work or pure hit-n-miss.",11년 전,0,

Because when we change the angle looking up to the head from below or down upon the head, this system doesn't work anymore, as far as I understand...Same for when the person tilts their head far.",11년 전,0,

@hieronymusfrutflanel3099,"Well, strictly no new completely new information but the way you presented this was possibly the best drawing tute I've ever seen - witty and innovative. The oval on the side of the cranioid was something I hadn't formalized in my thinking before, rather I'd sort of intuited it without the ""rule."" I've been teaching my daughter to improve her drawing and this is far better than anything I've been able to put over to her so if I can ever get her out of bed, I'm going to watch this with her a few times and make her practice (and so will I, but don't tell anybody.) re. the teaching side - one of the things that's holding her back a bit is a tendency to work too dark too fast, so her lines are committed and she's beginning to render rather than sketch before the space is adequately modeled.  Any tips? Whacking her round the side of the head and shouting in a cartoon Zen Master accent isn't working any more.  OK, I'll subscribe :p  Thanks again.",11년 전,0,

O.K. it's impressive in the way that  embroidering the entire text of the Bible on a quilt is impressive; it has its place and it demonstrates tenacity and devotion to one's obsessive compulsions, but it's the same sort of ""art"" that bronze plating your first-born's first shoes is ""art.""

Manga is a bit diffrent since characters in manga seems to have for exampel bigger eyes and diffrent shapes on their chin and more. But the distance and proportions between bodyparts are pretty much the same. I would sugest you watch some of Sycra's videos which are great for understanding the anatomy of the body and face then just watch and try to brake down a lot of art and manga! Good luck!

From my life drawing experience I've found that usually the jaw line is slightly﻿ further back than the vertical on side plane. But it also varies from person to person. Loomis puts it right on that line. I think maybe he tried to simplify it? Saying ""slightly further back, sometimes"" isn't simple.",13년 전,0,

One question, though: You put the end of jaw line (near the ear lobe) a little bit back from the vertical line on the side of the head. When Loomis does the method, he puts the jaw line a bit in front of that vertical line (and he also tends to add a bit of length to the back of the head). Are his heads a bit too long? I ask because putting the jaw line there never felt right  to me.",13년 전,0,
