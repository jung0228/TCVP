@derekpolano3654,"Just finding this now. I have pretty sever anxiety and depression and am on a number of drugs to help with that. I used to love mushrooms when I was younger, but now that I am on these pills I have taken up to 10 grams of very high quality Mushrooms and I feel absolutely nothing. I have tried DMT as well, everyone with me doing the mushrooms and DMT had crazy trips and I was dead sober, didn't feel a thing. I took 2-3 times as much as anyone else and felt nothing. The same thing happens with MDMA, really pure take 5 times as much as other people and nothing at all.  Is there any evidence that antidepressants curb the effect of hallucinogens? I'm just curious because it is kind of frustrating that I can't even use psychedelics without first cutting off my meds, which are helping me. Curious to hear your thoughts.",23시간 전(수정됨),1,

@frydaze13,"Pretty amazing that all of these substances are still listed as controlled substances, class C1, which means they have the most abuse potential and have no therapeutic use. Both of those claims are positively ridiculous. Another chemical that is also designated C-1 is THC. Just for a little reference, in the US heroin is also a C1 drug. C2 includes morphine and codeine,  oxycodone and Fentanyl. Valium and many of the benzodiazepines are C3.  It is patently absurd to categorize marijuana and its derivatives, as well as psychedelics, as C1 drugs. Allegedly they have no medicinal use, are most addictive, have the highest potential for abuse, and harshest penalties for possession.   Call or write your Senators and representatives, and demand that these substances be recategorized C5, or better yet not as controlled substances at all  The following is verbatim from the DEA website:   The abuse rate is a determinate factor in the scheduling of the drug; for example, Schedule I drugs have a high potential for abuse and the potential to create severe psychological and/or physical dependence. As the drug schedule changes-- Schedule II, Schedule III, etc., so does the abuse potential-- Schedule V drugs represents the least potential for abuse.",4일 전(수정됨),0,

It was a “bad trip” but in my deep experience on this topic, I’d say “bad trips” are also deeply meaningful, even if challenging to work thru. It helps people to look within and face incredible fears they may have. It went from “I’m about to die!

@martin_katten,"Liberal drug cultures tend to romanticize substances and turn a blind eye to the risks. People like to talk about freedom, self-development, and “natural” experiences, but forget that drugs are fundamentally powerful chemicals. All powerful and euphoric drug experiences alter the reward system. By being drug-liberal, we send out the message that it is okay, and even good, to use drugs. As individuals, we have a responsibility to care for everyone in society. As usual, we focus only on the positive aspects, and the hype leads us to ignore the possible negative consequences",2주 전,1,

@yanasitta,"In SF around 2000, we dropped multiple moly pills along with 1/4 to 5 g of shrooms and it was the most remote experience from any altered state. We never saw elves or other beings, but we could feel a presence. The trip was a fractal of our lives. Imagine memories, feelings, impressions, etc., being branches and nodes on a fractal landscape that would evolve and fold. Anytime I would focus, I would travel very fast down a ""corridor"" and wherever I stopped it was the same evolution/expansion/convolution of consciousness/memories/ impressions/ etc...  It really delivered the axiom of ""Wherever you go, there you are"". There was no deeper truth other than that. It suggested that existence was not about current position but rather perception and experience of that perception at that given moment. you did not create reality, but you ""tuned"" into a reality of your conscious choice if you were in control. It's difficult to reconcile ""absolute reality"" and ""your reality"". We know that if one was to jump of a building, we would perish due to damaging our body but at the same time we suspect that it's a limitation of the conscious control of our reality. Who knows. I have yet to meet anyone that has truly mastered these concepts but many they claim they have. They live their lives in chaos and yet claim they have mastered reality. It's still better than trying to dominate our fellow humans/animals and instead working to dominate ourselves to better serve others and our environment. Please give me your thoughts.

@danhaywood5696,"IDK, I used to be able to walk 100 meters from my door into a beautiful forest and harvest my own between last week of Feb to June 1st. They were Oviods. Though its a nice setting and was safe, and I spent everyday in thst forest all day with my dog and worked out with weapons on dead standing trees, my trips were horrible. My life is tragic in lonliness, yet now I often try to be alone with just my dog. No family or friends around in life. Blablabla. Id micro dose, and I also cool  extracted shrooms  into Cranberry juice and it was a shitton. That extract would hit me hard in 8 minutes then hit in hard waves over and over. It was brutal, quite scary too. Im never happy anymore except for moments of joy seeing my beautiful doggy happily running in a beautiful forest or swimming with me across a cool mountain river on a beautiful hot day. Shit like that, and playing instruments by besutiful mountain creeks with my doggy about maybe howling along. Mostly Im in a deep hard depression that has gone on almost two decades. I know why though. I spent years just thinking for hours on end, often in a forest. I can understand almost anything. When I was young and I tripped on shrooms, I had a great time, yet I was with friends and had a cool motorcycle house, and we were out at night in San Diego some, I remember a diner. I had gotten out of kenpo and saw my buddys and visiting HS buddys at the burrito joint Albertos next door. So I went in and they handed me anawesome Carne Asada Burrito, only cost $2 then in '88. They had loaded it with shrooms. I had no clue and ate it all. I live in an ancient van now with my dog. Not easy to get into the forest where I used to live. Havent found another source yet. I havent noticed is what I should say, as I have not looked for them. I used to walk out in the morning with my coffee thermos and dog and had added dried shrooms into my thermos. Id tripp out enjoying the sunshine through tall oak trees and looking out through Hemlock branches across a canyon. As long as I only took a few and had some food in my stomach, I was fine and did not trip hard. Judt did my usual which generally did envolve thinking for several hours about things. I have a lot of trouble doing anything now. Especially csuse my back and knees hurt and drop me. Depressed as fuck. I suddenly got shittons of money, and while it is merciful and gives hope, I still cant feel anything but doom generally. I think we are all fucked anyway soon. I need to purchase my own forest and put a house in it, yet I need 8 cleared acres mostly flat. Gotta have strong creek flowing year round. I get that shit, and treatment for disease I got and some vintage motorcycles and ultra light airplane to cly off and on my property and a garage for it all, and Ill be happy AF I bet.  Even if lonely. My dog will be happy, yet she has to greet other people regularly, so hopefully I can provide for a hot college girl to tend to my dick and love my dog till she moves on. Fuck yeah! Only problem is the land is too pricey, yet Ill find it. Or I may just go live in CR with my dog and hire young woman to teach me spanish.",3주 전,1,

@khonsuthecore4788,"As a trans person, psychs really helped me figure out who I really was and give myself the space to accept myself and see myself as beautiful and showed me that transitioning would give me a life that I wouldn't want to leave, because even after my first few psychedelic experiences I still denied myself and tried to live as a man, or as nonbinary, but I kept feeling this horrible feeling in my neuron systems that felt mismatched as I tripped, and eventually I began to accept that it was there while I was sober and drove me to substance abuse and suicidality, and I would trip acid to feel like myself. I wanted to break through to myself like that, to being a woman again but I didn't want to take acid after moving back in with my parents so my friend and I planned a picnic to eat shrooms. They started tripping at home and got stuck and I ate far too many mushrooms (the psilocybin content on these things is skyrocketing btw, be careful) and met Jesus and Buddha, before going on a journey through my mind and realizing all these weird things that my life had left cemented into my brain. I will never be able to to completely unravel everything that I saw but the universal peace I felt before that crazy break with reality, listening to the Beatles' Let It Be over and over on loop while sitting in silence with a giant Buddha made out of trees (Jesus didn't stick around too long) will always be such a good memory, and after one more acid trip (saw a Jimi Hendrix tribute concert, Buddy Guy played, it was amazing) and watching I Saw The TV Glow  I finally decided to start transitioning, I am on my first week of Estrogen and I feel like I'm finally in my own body already.",1개월 전(수정됨),1,

I decided to take a heroic dose of 20 gr of dried mushrooms, it was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced, I was sure I killed my family and friends, I was sure I was killed in a violent and horrific way, I was completely sure I was a monster playing the character of the nice person, maybe I was so focus being a nice guy in my life that I try to suppress the bad emotions I was feeling until the mushrooms let them free, I am trying to learn from what the mushrooms showed to me, but even after months from that trip I am still terrified by the things I saw",1개월 전,1,

@matthewsebolka9830," @allison9995  My son was born with PDD which falls in the ASD spectrum. His is more on the mild side so he will be able to function in society. This pertains to your question above. When my son was about a year old....we took him for vaccines. About 24-48 hours after that appointment he came down with a VERY high fever. It was 104.1 at its highest. Yes we rushed him back to the ER. Anyways, to make a long story shorter, I feel my son was never the same after that day. He used to pay attention to what was going on in the room around him. Like your average baby if that makes sense. After said appointment, he gained the ""1000 yard stare"". Like he didnt notice anything or anyone around him. It was liked someone flipped his lights off overnight. His form of ASD will give him early delays in life but eventually he will catch up. He is now 19 and getting ready to go to college and also has a memory like I have never seen before. Would I change his appointment knowing what I know now? No I would not. If it wasn't for my son....I can promise I would not be here today to tell you this.

@jackdaft258,"I had a breakthrough experience on a heroic dose of psilocybin before. I’m not a religious person or a man of faith but I finally understood the “religious experience” in that moment. I broke down with tears of pure joy at the realization that I did in fact want to live, that every moment alive was a blessing and I had the ability to shape the course of my own life in a positive way. I can’t even properly describe the experience… everything just made sense. I finally knew my worth, I loved myself for the first time in what felt like forever. I felt this incredible feeling of interconnectivity with everything in the universe, and all I could feel was boundless love emanating from it all. I wanted to reconnect with family and friends and mend relationships because I realized that’s what feeds my happiness. I went through more than a decade of self isolation and withdrawal from almost everything and everyone in my life up until this point, and in one trip I realized how I was the biggest obstacle in my own way - the reason for my own unhappiness. I had been to therapy on and off for years, tried so many different medications and disciplines of therapy, so many attempts that felt like I was simply a hamster in a wheel. This one trip I had did more for my mental health than any amount of therapy did - and this wasn’t even in a therapy setting. I had read about recent studies regarding the positive effects on folks with treatment resistant depression (this was during the height of the COVID lockdowns) and at that point was desperate for some relief to my worsening symptoms. I had been in therapy since before the lockdowns, going to in person appointments, but with everything being virtual during the lockdowns, o just didn’t find the same tberapejric value in virtual meetings. I had essentially given up trying at that point, until I came across articles regarding previously mentioned studies. I sourced some mushrooms with the intent of getting something therapeutic out of it, but I still could never have been prepared for how transformative and experience it was. I used to leave the house so rarely that it hurt my eyes to go outside. I was pale as a ghost. During my trip it started to rain like it had when I was a kid, and it instantly brought back feelings of comfort and warmth and nostalgia. I was compelled to go outside - I was simply fascinated and wanted to feel the rain on my skin like I used to when I was younger. Fortunately, I wasn’t able to figure out how to get my belt on, so I remained inside… but it was simply another realization of how I was creating my own happiness by copping myself up indoors. I love being outside, I love my friends and family, and yet I was doing everything I could before this to avoid the things I love. In bindsigjt it’s so easy to see why I was so unhappy, but when it builds up over years, it seems normal almost.. you can’t see reality for what it is because you’re too deep in it, too rigid in your world view and feelings. Mushrooms helped me rise up above that. My ego had completely dissolved. I was so out of it at one point I forgot all about the concept of time, life, the universe… everything. Until I realized I was thinking and in fact living in my body, and everything came snapping back. Before that it was simply love and connectedness.. I had been completely removed from my own experience and coming back to it was almost like seeing earth from space, realizing how I’m a small piece in an interconnected universe. It was a comforting realization,a peaceful one, an acceptance of that fact and a resolve to make the best of this gift I’ve been given, and try to put as much positivity into the world as I can. As far as I know, we’ve only got one kick at the can, and I’ve been able realize that it’s absolutely worth the effort to try and make it a good one. Sorry for the rambling, this video got me a little emotional, thinking about how that experience changed the course of my life. It’s been about five years since then. I knew it was an important experience in the moment, but for a while I was confused how it would resolve or change anything in a major way. Now it’s easy to see, in hindsight, how it fundamentally changed how I love my life, and where those changes have led me since. Thanks for reading my rambling comment.",2개월 전,1,

On the off nights we would dry them for home. You cant do them two nights in a row. We were eating wet/fresh liberty caps, semilenciata. Massive amounts. Three handfuls. When counted out the wet ones of various sizes (100 - 125) and dried that amount; it came to 7 grams. It changed my entire being and showed me the power of the mind and an intensity of pure love/nirvana/god that changed my being for the better. I am a much more compassionate being. I am sure that if the powerful and greedy people of this world were exposed to that type of thing it would help them escpae the trap they are in.

@randall-q7o,"The Trivialization of Entheogens: A Strategy to Suppress Truth  There’s been much made of entheogens’ potential to treat anxiety, depression, PTSD, and addiction. While these therapeutic outcomes are real, reducing these sacraments to tools for symptom management fundamentally misrepresents what they are—and what they do.  Entheogens are not merely medicines. They are revealers. Used in the proper context, they initiate profound journeys of remembrance and confrontation, uncovering truths buried beneath trauma, denial, and cultural programming. This process can be disorienting, even terrifying. But for those seeking truth, it is liberation.  And therein lies the threat.  Memory, Revelation, and the Threat to Power  Trauma caused by abuse—especially in childhood—is unique in that it often leads to repressed memory. Or worse: full recollection without the recognition that abuse occurred, due to gaslighting and cultural normalization. Entheogenic experiences frequently bring these hidden truths to the surface. Dots are connected. Patterns are revealed. In many cases, perpetrators are exposed.  The implications aren’t only personal. On a broader scale, entire systems and institutions are exposed through these experiences. Religious, medical, and political structures built on control, suppression, and deceit are laid bare.  In every true entheogenic session, someone or something gets exposed.  And then the real question emerges: What do we do with that truth?  The Campaign of Substitution  Those in positions of power cannot easily suppress entheogens outright. Doing so reveals too much about their own fear. Instead, a more insidious strategy is used: trivialization and substitution.  By reducing entheogens to mental health interventions, and emphasizing narrowly defined outcomes like smoking cessation or mood regulation, the sacred is made sterile. This sanitized framing allows for the introduction of substitutes—synthetics like ketamine and MDMA, and microdosing—which, while potentially therapeutic, do not typically lead to the same radical confrontations with truth, ancestry, or spiritual warfare.  These substitutes become tools of containment. The experience is kept “safe,” therapeutic, and—most importantly—non-revolutionary.  It allows the manipulator to appear benevolent while suppressing the very forces that would undo them.  The Fruit of the Knowledge of Good and Evil  Entheogens have long been feared by the Abrahamic religions. The prohibition against the “fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” is not merely metaphorical—it is a declaration of war against direct knowledge, spiritual sovereignty, and the unfiltered confrontation with good and evil as forces embedded in this world.  Evil is not an abstraction. It operates in this realm, and the exposure of evil—especially when it’s hidden in the guise of righteousness—is the deepest threat entheogens pose.  Medicalization is not neutral. It is a tool of control, designed to regulate the sacred and repress its most dangerous revelation: that we have been lied to—systematically, spiritually, generationally.  This Is Not About Symptoms. This Is About Liberation.  The trivialization of entheogens is not just a misunderstanding. It is a strategy—a way to domesticate truth, to keep the soul asleep, and to neuter the revolutionary potential of direct spiritual experience.  True entheogenic healing is not just about relieving suffering. It is about remembering who you are, what has been done, and what must now be done in response. It demands courage, responsibility, and spiritual maturity.  If you’re seeking only relief, you may find it in a clinic. But if you’re seeking truth, prepare to remember everything.",3개월 전,1,

@cannaissuer,"""im going to die"" is not a bad trip. its whats supposed to happen. YOU ARE FOR REAL DYING according to your brains interpretation of whats happening. thats what happens during ego death. your ego. you. your self of self. actually dies. at least for the time being. you return to the ""real world"" when you die on psychedelics. the world of pure love and energy. the true universe. a bad trip just happens when you fight it..... if you fight psychedelics they will fight back. the more you struggle the stronger the horror gets. just let go... it imediately morphs into pure bliss. once you finally let it do to you what it wants. just let things happen and go with the flow. it becomes infinitely more blissful and feels like pure love and contentment.",3개월 전,1,

@kc0jtl,"I suffered for years from PTSD from my time in Iraq. A couple years ago I legally purchased a prodrug of LSD. I took it at home, alone, with the hopes that I could find some relief. It was interesting, I could feel the colors get vibrant after an hour. That slowly morphed into a dreamy feel with light hallucinations of movement from things in my peripheral. After 3-4 hours it peaked and I could feel it start to come down. That is where the real magic happened. Without trying to think about my problems or life, I just started to automatically. I thought about my trauma, and how bad other things were in life. I thought about how my pain had caused me to treat others, people I loved. poorly. If felt like a weight was being lifted off my shoulders, then I felt a flood of emotions, that all came at once like a dam broke. I began to cry. It wasn't a sad cry, it almost felt like a cry of happiness. I came to terms with these things, and while they weren't good, I could deal with them, and that was such a relief. I don't think I have ever felt so emotionally drained in my entire life, but I felt free from my problems. It was life changing and I would urge others who are having emotional pain to seek out therapy using psychedelics, they work. I do think you need to be in the right mindset and ready to work through something or you will just experience the effects.",3개월 전,2,

@AveragePlayerEXP,Heroic dose of shrooms hell yeah lsd ummm let's say you can't prepare for that shit 😅,3개월 전,2,
@sninstall,"Never had a bad trip on shrooms even at big dose.  Here's my LSD heroic dose story: I was in Chicago in the mid 90s and had a friend who was selling a bit. His dealer gave him like 1/2 sheet size piece of handmade blotter acid. It has some writing on it saying ""extra potent , share with friends"" and like Christmas stamps , skulls and crossbones etc. Anyways we decide yeah let's eat a piece we cut of bits like as big as your thumbnail. 30 mins in it felt like I was peaking on 5 regular hits.... Oh it gets worse! We both decide yeah we better get out of the house and go for bike ride. My chrome bmx is melting in my arms, which looked 2ft longer than normal, and the whole world around was just smeared tracers. We made it to the local park and its around dusk and by now it felt like invisible ocean waves of hallucinations and body rushes were almost too much to handle. I could barely speak or form a coherent idea of what I wanted to do by this point. We are looking around a realise the commuter train was pulling in as workers all exit it at once. So we went from basically being alone to surrounded by 100s of grumpy office workers scurrying round us in what seemed like a instant..We both basically freak out trying to ride round them in a blur and lose each other in the storm of visuals. After losing my friend I wait there for 10 mins ( or 10 seconds) no idea really and start to panic!. I decide I have to get back to where I'm staying asap. As I try to ride it ended up a mix of walking and riding. I was so fucked up I waited next to a busy road as I couldn't work out how heavy the traffic was , and if I could cross. The cars headlights seemed like smeared stop motion cycling every 2 seconds or so. I finally decide its clear to cross and pick up my bike and carry it across the road!! I was soo munted I didn't know what I was doing.. I'm in full blown panic mode now so overwhelmed but the rush and visuals that I must of autopiloted myself back the house. My friend ( who hadn't had anything) was there and helped me contact my lost friend and talked me down a bit from the peaking panic I was in. I went to the bathroom to wash my face and get my shit together. I remember the water flowing out of the tap seemed like a slow motion clear worm like twisting out. I look in the mirror and it's like my face was twisted and contorted by invisible hands into like Polynesian designs!.  This night was a rough 12 hrs of intense tripping, body high, panic, exhaustion, intense hallucinations.  It probably took a good 2 days to unscramble my head. I took the same acid again but about 1/2 what we took initially . I did it to conquer the beast and prove to myself that I could handle it. Going forward though I was always weary about how fucking intense tripping can get and moderation over heroics!.",3개월 전,0,

@toniheinonen1034,"I've done 3 trips with shrooms so far with doses of 1,5g, 3g and 1,5g of dried shrooms. First and third trips were really beneficial and beautiful experiences. During those ones I learned very profound things about myself and during the third trip I experienced rebirth in a way. I kind of shed my old, worn out and dirty shell and was reborn as an bright yellow orb of pure energy. I'm not much of an artist when it comes to drawing pictures but I had to sketch it on a paper. I still have it stored. Just thinking about that experience makes me feel amazing.  The second trip with 3g was way more intense experience. I feel that it was a bit too intense to do an expedition to my subconsciousness and thus didn't get that much out of it. Those smaller doses are already enough for me to get some open eye visuals and strong closed eye visuals.",3개월 전,0,
@TheJoker-gg8hc,"If psychedelics weren’t associated with psychopaths on the left, then they would be legal, but it’s usually just psychopaths on the left that literally say out loud and on camera how much they hate humanity, birth, work, etc…  Seriously, it’s not the people on the right advocating for the murder of children rather than just keeping your clothes one. Nope, it’s leftists, the same druggies supporting psychedelics that also murder children just cuz they don’t wanna keep their clothes on or be celibate.  The mental association between psychedelics and people in the minds of the conservative people is that they turn people into hateful angry people, not positive happy people that want our species to grow and thrive.  You can TALK all day long, but actions matter more, and what I SEE leftists doing is advocating for the literal MURDER of babies, and the break up of the family unit, rather than NOT forming a family unit in the first place to destroy later.  P.s. the Beatles ALWAYS sucked.  My mushroom trip didn’t turn me into the anti-corpo anti-capitalist anti-family anti-human psychopath that all my other friends were. That’s what they were counting on. Mushrooms showed me the future we as people could have if we embrace our own species instead of constantly shitting on it and killing babies.",4개월 전(수정됨),2,

Then I was handed an LSD ticket... and I had one of the most intense and craziest experiences of my life. I don't want to elaborate, but it was a very painful and shocking experience.  I understood that I was not disconnected from society, living organisms, or the world itself, and that everything I would do to harm others was also harming me. Very simple to understand for most people... for me, this was absolutely new.   I started experimenting much more with psychedelics, but after a while, I came to the conclusion that this would not lead to any further insights. The initiation of the process had already begun on the first trip.   Today, I'm a professor at a university. And only very rarely... maybe every five years... I take a trip back to not forget the lessons I was taught on my first trip.   I would never recommend anybody to experiment with psychedelics, especially not without proper guidance. But in my situation back then, it changed my perspective on life.",4개월 전,7,

The most powerful trips I've had have been outdoors, preferably in the morning, when the body's reserves are at their maximum. I've come to the point that using psychedelics indoors makes almost no sense to me. Especially under psilocybin there is a feeling that walls and ceiling are pressing and do not allow you to feel the full scale of the experience.  I am from Kyiv (Ukraine). Therefore, after February 24, 2022, when russia invaded Ukraine, I have not taken psychedelics even once: I don't want this experience indoors, and outdoors you can't provide yourself with a safe space for 4-6 hours because an air raid could start at any minute, and that's definitely not what you want to manage in such sensitive state. Because every time an air raid siren goes off  of the shaheeds, you realize that most likely someone innocent will die or be injured by Shaheds (UAVs that russia gets from Iran) ...

@roxannee8316,"I think, something to consider is that the experience of taking psychedelics and how profound it may be is down to ones 'openess' and translation of experiences as a whole. for example; I could see a star for the first time and feel that I felt something and thats changed my life; because of how my mind works and translates what I see. Someone else could see a star for the first time and think .. 'oh wow what was that, thats strange' and never consider it again. its not a great example as its not not quite the same as ingesting something that actually has a chemical impact within your body but hopefully you see what I mean. Without a desire to find knowledge or wonder why and with ceratin minds not having ceratin pathways open to be inspired by life yet, ones experience of the psychedelic may feel like a series of uncomfortable effects rather than an experience of any meaning.  These medicinals can help us to connect to what is already in us all, the core knowledge of everything but it depends. Its a dance between us both, the chemical compounds and ones perception  Side waffle; Interestingly, I feel I have noticed how weed may expand some animals consciousness, in the same way, how some will be 'enlightened' and try to communicate more where as others not so much which i feel shows a similar thing. That being, some animals do strive for more, they have the same feeling in their core that there is more to it all and they are open to that.",4개월 전,0,

I took sooo much acid, E, amphet & coke that ended up in a decade of me & a few friends partying like rock stars.... yet despite having unlimited access to drugs I never had a real ""moment"" when everything made some cosmic ""sense of knowing a profound truth"" But when the craziness ended & I began living a settled, adult life - wife, career etc - I visited an old pal & his family on evening for a beer. Too my shock & surprise my friend had another 2 old pals I knew visiting from their new home of norway, on the stove in the kitchen was an enormous copper pot which was gently simmering away, the amount & type of mushrooms brewing in that hot water I couldn't guess.... I nearly left them to their experiment but was relaxed, in good trusted company & surroundings so I slowly drank down the earthy, quite horrid tasting mug of mushroom ""tea"" Everything was chilled & happy as we all anticipated the fx of the brew, lots of giggling &losing focus on what we were saying...it was as expected... but my stomach, my temperature & general handle on calmness began slipping & i became a little too 'focussed' upon all my senses & scared that this wasn/t gonna be fun anymore. I voiced my worries & a fellow tripper who was aware how my breathing plus general head-set had become, talked me into deeper breaths as she took me out into the large back garden, it was so refreshing in the cool evening air. I ended up vomiting just a little acidic amount... drank a little water which she brought for me... suddenly I recall an internal laugh at my attempting to resist the intense growing effects of he shrooms & that was the start. I Said to my friend I was feeling super-fine, but wanted/or needed to experience this incredible journey by myself & went to one of the bedrooms....I assured everyone It was all good, and spent the next period away from my own body & despite no light in the room, a bright golden, warm light surrounded my aura!

As i say, not touched hallucinogens since then.... I just hit 53 but still use certain ""substances"" at live gigs, saw The Chemical Brothers just recently ,took some 'E' - same for Gorillaz & Twenty One Pilots too! Was given 5 pressed tablets of a synthetic 'psilocybin/magic mushroom' hallucinogen called 4- Aco- DMT 20micro gram just recently from a pal in Calgary, Canada. Watched a lot of vids plus read plenty & not in a rush to experiment....not at a gig anyhow! Will just hold on to them or maybe pass them on again... who knows?! Take care.x",5개월 전,0,

@kittypalkingdom5547," @cgrummon    What is Neuroplasticity? Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This process is essential for learning, memory, and adapting to new experiences.  2. How LSD May Enhance Neuroplasticity: Stimulating 5-HT2A Receptors: LSD primarily acts as an agonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, which are abundant in the cortex. Promoting Structural Plasticity: LSD has been shown in animal studies to increase dendritic growth, the number of dendritic spines, and synaptic connections in cortical neurons. Upregulating Plasticity-Related Genes: LSD and other psychedelics can increase the expression of genes involved in neuroplasticity, including BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), a key protein involved in neuronal growth and survival.  3. The ""Window of Plasticity"": Psychedelics like LSD are thought to create a ""window of plasticity,"" a period of enhanced neuroplasticity where the brain is more receptive to change. This increased plasticity, combined with the often profound and emotionally salient experiences during a psychedelic trip, can potentially lead to long-lasting changes in thought patterns and behaviors.  4. Potential Therapeutic Implications: The ability of LSD to promote neuroplasticity is a potential explanation for its therapeutic effects, particularly in combination with psychotherapy. Enhanced neuroplasticity may help individuals overcome rigid or maladaptive thought patterns associated with depression, anxiety, and addiction.  Important Considerations: Research is Ongoing: While the evidence for LSD's effects on neuroplasticity is promising, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and its potential clinical applications. Set and Setting: The context and environment in which LSD is taken, along with the individual's mindset, significantly impact the experience and potential outcomes. Safety and Responsible Use: LSD is a powerful substance that can have both positive and negative effects. It is essential to approach its use cautiously and with proper guidance when considering it for therapeutic purposes.",4개월 전,0,

@RyanEnright-m8k,"Psilocybin has changed my life. I was first hospitalized at 9 years old for suicidal ideation and depression. At 15 I began a meth and heroin addict and didn't put it down till a couple years ago. after I got sober I felt so empty and life felt meaningless. I was constantly asking ""what's the point?"". I had done mushrooms for fun a handful of times in my younger years but didn't do it how it should be done. About 7 months ago I took 5 grams of some Thai elephant I had grown and it permanently changed how I look at my self and the world. I covered  my eyes and layed in a dark room listening to 2 cellos. I can't go into the full experience here because it is deeply personal. but I was a theistic lucifereian. after that I completely changed my spiritual outlook. It hasntiven me a pourpus and a light in my life that I had never had before. it's not a fix all. But it is a good way to locate where your suffering and issues are coming from and fix them through integration. I haven't touched heroin in 4 years..meth 3..I flushed my Vyvanse down the toilet the day after my psilocybin experience as well as my Seroquel.

@LegendOfKhaos12," @engjds That’s what i kept having to tell myself after i started to have sort of an out of body experience almost while on 14g of shrooms, and it seemed like I could see, or feel idk, other energies or something around me.  I’ve never astral projected before, but that’s the first thing that came to my mind if I were to try and describe it, it’s like I was able to almost control myself, not my actual body though, and not interacting with anything physically, until then I decided to not go further and it stopped. But after that it was like I could see every on a different level or something, like I could see every atom or particle and the energy everywhere or something, seeing how everything is just energy and nothing is ever motionless, everything is always moving and rotating and orbiting, and it’s all mathematically related. It was the craziest thing I’ve ever experienced by far, when it happened it was just so obvious, i have no idea how the hell i knew, but almost instantaneously it was made so obvious  how it all worked. And then not long after, I already had my tv on, ​​⁠and I shit you fuckin not, it took me a while to even realize it, but the guy on tv talking and what he was saying were literally my own thoughts. Like I was literally dead ass hearing my thoughts through this guy on tv. Which honestly scared the fuck out of me after a certain point because I legit thought I was dying after something I’d heard before sprung into my head, that when you’re dying your brain does crazy shit and makes you see/hear things that aren’t real. So I started thinking I was dying in that very moment😭That’s when I had to just keep telling myself it’s the drugs I’m fine I’m cool. And that worked good for about an hour or so, right up until I had a seizure lmao, 2 right back to back. So yeah I honestly don’t know about that, it’s weird how a seizure was related to all of that, and I’d love to know the science and true cause of it all.",7개월 전(수정됨),0,

@Clip7heApex,"The best therapy I've ever had is with mushrooms. It makes you honest with yourself. It opens the doors in your mind that you closed because you couldn't or didn't want to think about, but then allows you to look at the situation without the usual entrenched thought patterns which didn't allow you to come to peace with it. A kind of spring clean for the mind. It can be a wild emotional journey but you come out the other side feeling better for it. Like the negative energies have cleared and perhaps a better understanding of what really matters to you. Which can give you a more focused direction and motivation toward your goals, which in turn gives a sense of purpose. Just make sure the environment you have the journey is a peaceful, comfortable and safe place without phones or distractions. I'd say to do your first journey with a close friend at a relatively low dose and titrate up as you feel more comfortable with it.",9개월 전,0,

My Mom passed away back in October 2018 and I felt depressed, it was the lowest point of my life. I tried to self medicate smoking pot and cigarettes and drinking alcohol daily.  I met a woman who talked about Jesus and I could tell she was serious which impressed me. I thought maybe I missed something in Christianity.   She led me to the Lord and I asked Jesus in my head “Jesus if You are who You say You are, if You are God please reveal Yourself to me and I will follow You”.

Also Dr Johnson said there was a very limited physiological risk with these drugs.

@dollydork9187,"I have a lot of personal problems that keep of tearing at me left and right and I was taught to turn the other cheek even if I felt deeply violated by people’s words and actions towards me. When I took the shrooms, I was searching for peace. I saw many things at first like a dragon, faces of gods, faces of important individuals in history, the pyramids, the country flags, lots of eyes. And I remember thinking “this thing wants to show me the dawn of humanity but I don’t care about that, I don’t wanna chase that rabbit. Show me something else.” Why. Why did I ask for that. It took me straight inside myself to show me all the bottled emotion I had, 25 years of my own suffering right inside me in a black tunnel. My own face in a million shards, screaming back at me in so much pain. All I never let out. It was my personal hell because I knew that it was my fault it was all in there. I was never meant to hold my pain inside me. In the middle of the trip I thought to myself “do I really need to walk that tunnel and feel all this pain that I never let myself feel before?” Then suddenly something incredible happened. I realized that my faces and my pain in the tunnel were telling me something: I wasn’t just suffering, I was ANGRY. An all-consuming pure RAGE. For a pacifist girl such as myself that never even shouted, it took me by surprise. What did the emotion inside me show me? That I am an animal, and a predator at that. I felt the thirst for blood, for justice. The animal in the cage was wounded and ready to strike back. My suffering didn’t make me pathetic like I thought it did, it made me dangerous. It made me powerful. Gave me a jolt of “i will fight back and no one will ever hurt me and get away with it again, even if I have to go down fighting and die.” I found out there isn’t a doe-eyed victim inside me but a hurricane, a a jaguar. I looked into the mirror in my trip after this realization and saw the most beautiful creature in there, wild and free and smiling like I was capable of ripping someone’s throat. For a girl that felt inoffensive her whole life, it was indeed, life changing. I took the shrooms to find peace, but I found the strength I needed to fight for the peace I want. That is how I started to work hard, apply myself to get what I want, and I didn’t let anyone get in my way to happiness and satisfaction no more. So yes, the shrooms will take you where you need to go, and sometimes, it won’t be pleasant, but if you stick around till the end of it, there is the reward of much needed transformation.",10개월 전,0,

But after a while, it didn't matter anymore. The experience was the same each time, with a few minor shifts in perspective, but then the novelty wore off and it became uncomfortable.

@ChiefWiggum0,"I love the part where he talks about cancer patients and says, 'They realize they can still live life, the cancer hasn't killed me yet. I can still live life, but I am letting it do this to me.' That really resonated with me. Although I’ve never had cancer, it applies to many challenges we face in life—whether it's depression, fear, anxiety, or anything else that keeps us from fully living. It reminds me of the concept of 'Ego Death.' So many people are detached from the reality of their own mortality, thinking death happens to others but not to them. The fear of death doesn’t have to paralyze us; instead, it can push us to release unnecessary stress, stop putting off important things, and truly appreciate the beauty and fragility of life.  I believe that’s why I think most people should experience something like this, at least once in their lives. I realize it’s not for everyone, and it can be harmful for some, but it’s an experience that has the potential to completely shift how we live. Confronting our own mortality—whether through something like ego death or simply reflecting on life’s impermanence—can help people break free from the constant distractions and anxieties that prevent us from truly living. It’s not about dwelling on death itself, but about using that awareness to fully embrace life and stop taking it for granted.",10개월 전(수정됨),8,

It was impossible for me to determine or get any sense for how to make and accomplish a long-term goal. And my friend kill everyone. Then he asked me if I wanted to shrooms with him, so we went to the park and we had a trip. Details aren't important. I feel about how you experience the trips because you can never really explain them, what I can explain though is after that day it was almost like my entire life changed and I was able to make goals although it's filed and through other to accomplish them. Since that day I have known to view life in a different way and I don't think that my mind could ever go back to how I was before the first time I took that trip.",10개월 전,1,

@eltomasoable,"One 5-meo- DMT trip i felt i died and it was an explotion that spread me into into energy only, one with everything, and nothing. I had no way of badtripping, i didnt understand what it meant as a glimpse of thought somwhere out there. Then i was born again feeling every part of it, from baby to now, and that all my sins was erased, and i was given a new start, if i never sinned too much or too evil, my new life would be taken from me. So I try my best to have no enemy, and make my former enemies suddenly hug me when we meet. And i try to be a good host and respect others home and rules there they may have. And to wish every man a new chance, but i think some sins are too bad for this world to let continue. Like child sex offenders, but even worse, someone innocent jailed for that, you never know for sure, many are free that should not be, and some are put down like some sick dog, innocent after years of waiting. But lets think about the good things, like the recent lsd trip when my best friend jumped from his chair over the table, and into my open arms, could have broke my back lol. We hugged for some time. Then by accident he got all of our lsd bc of brain fart, which i payed dearly for. He found the centre of the universe and i wasnt more than some amphetamine woth of high. We did not connect like if we shared it. In the end i force fed him xanax to be able to go home, after babying him swaying from heaven to hell in an understandable only for him world. The next say he called it the best amd worst trip ever. And he may never trip again he said. soon to talk about getting some ket in the same five minutes. Drugs mmakes us seem smart to others on the exact same tripp. like Lsd and mdma pills that we knew and i liked, took 3 hours to work. suddenly thinking the purple skulls werre  bunk, they hit me like two e's tested between 270 and 450mg mdma. Two, everone does two bc all are shit usually. These were just hard pressed, tried breaking one, no chance, 3 hour time bomb, cool. Everybody happy tripping, big trips that can be mind melting art first are the trips that you see yourself from outside, all of you, good and bad. Do you like what you see? So be carefull too, not all are meant for DMT OR even stronger, 5-meo-DMT, I counted the yellpw ketamine like grains, only much smaller grains then ket. Five was first breaktrough, 10 was my first felt i didnt know the limits between me and the keyboard. The borders were fuzzy and all was becoming one, then i was in complete beautifully silence that nobody has ever heard in life. Then in a sec i was able to explain my experience to my watcher, not trp sitter, he was just very interested, and used lsd and such from before. He ended up not daring to try it.......... Peace love and unity. And no to f'in trump all young stoners vote for real this time, he is the worlds most dangerous man, and he should be in a padded cell. The forreigners eat our cats and dogs? Even his dog he added, MY LORD WHAT A FOOL, TO LETE RULE.",10개월 전,1,

The over and no dose mistake was not fun, and he not used to any form of stims read adderal bettered lsd trips, so i had a crying baby in a long night with same sad music all night. I longed for home. He became angry at one point, thats when i dosed him goood wth xanax, and saw him sleep before i left. never leave someone on a hellish trip, but it was his best AND worst............

@rainncorbin8291,"LSD saved my life and helped me walk away from a 35 year addiction. It changed my life profoundly. I'm not the same person. I've been clean over 5 years and i don't have to do 12 step meetings. I took LSD and it allowed all my issues to come up, over the course of 2 years of weekly use, and i was able to process and release traumas and fears and everything that caused me to want to use. I didn't do this with a therapist, i was my own therapist, having a background in psychology. The processing trips were difficult and i often cried for 8 or 10 hours but afterward, wow, what a sense of relief.  I would often do the heroic doses, a ten strip, for example.  Funny, that's what I'd do, close my eyes and turn the music up. You can't control it, you just go where it takes you. It eventually wears off. I still take psychedelics maybe 3 or 4 times a year. My depression is gone, anxiety is gone, PTSD is gone. I have completely changed everything in my life. I have zero mental health diagnoses anymore. The psychedelics break the circular thinking patterns.",11개월 전,0,

@wandererstraining,"Unlike a lot of people, I didn't really have mental health or dependency issues to resolve. But starting earlier this year, I've done a few mushroom sessions, under a friend's guidance. Every time, I start preparing myself two weeks in advance, taking extra steps to be as healthy as possible, and taking time to reflect on things a little bit and prepare myself mentally. During the session, she sings, plays music, etc. It's been super interesting for me, as every time, I reflected on something different, and every time, it opened my mind a bit more in some ways. These sessions are done in small groups of people, too, so there's an extra layer added to it because of the shared experience. Afterwards, we discuss what we went through. I tend to do a lot of the integration on my own, but I describe the experiences to my friends and my (adult) students, because it's really interesting. Something that I think is fascinating is that when we do those sessions, the preparation, the settings, the formality of how it's done, the music, the people... It accentuates the experience to the point where high doses are not needed. First two times, I had 2.22g, and went on quite a journey. Third time, I had 3.33g of a mix of two different strains to the first time, and I didn't travel like I did the first two times, but it was a very clear minded experience, very present. Next times will be regular doses that I'm used to, but when I try a higher dosage, my friend told me that it would be a hero dose.  The experience is probably not right for everyone, or at least, it depends on the stage of their life. But if someone is ready to do it, whether they're in need of healing, want to experience something profound or simply satisfy their curiosity... They should try it. As safely as possible of course, and in the right state of mind. I'm really glad I did. And I'm glad I did it not as a recreational drug, but as an intentional experience and with a lot of respect for the medicine. I lived a lot more than I would have otherwise.",11개월 전(수정됨),1,

@JarkkoToivonen,"In Finland, psilocybin mushrooms grow almost everywhere, and it’s well known that people have used them to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Since the early nineties, I’ve witnessed how authorities have poisoned some of the most well-known psilocybin fields. This is insane. People like me, who have a stable mind, take shrooms without a trip sitter, nurse, psychiatrist, or psychologist. Meanwhile, the minority of Finns who have serious mental illnesses may suffer, while the majority, who use them for depression like I do, or to explore their minds and temporarily rid themselves of ego, benefit. I’ve personally experienced ego dissolution after taking a so-called “heroic dose” of Psilocybe semilanceata.  I find the term “heroic dose” completely wrong. Many of us take shrooms while picking them from countryside fields, which authorities haven’t poisoned and where the mushrooms are more potent due to less pollution. In contrast, the ones growing in polluted areas, like the city where I live, are far less effective. For example, I once took 15 mushrooms picked from the countryside and had a profound experience, but in the city, I had to take over 100 small mushrooms for a similar effect.  I’m deeply disappointed that Finland is always a few steps behind our neighbors, Sweden and Norway, when it comes to new medications, not to mention the USA. Whatever the USA does, the EU tends to follow—this is especially true in the realm of prescription medicine.",1년 전,0,
@emuwalton,"Psychedelics are not a recreational drug and should be decriminalized. I've taken psilocybin many times in a quiet and safe space. It was absolutely overpowering, amazing, and different every single time. Taking it at a club or to try ""escape"" your problems would be devastating. You can retreat into alcohol, heroin, cocaine, meth, etc. Psychedelics are an intervention, hard, fast, and right now. You deal with your problems and trauma head on ... whether you are ready or not. Better than all the fractals and light shows is what comes after. You reach a calm akin to when you were a child, as if you were never exposed to the concept of war, slavery, climate change, an abusive boss, political parties, etc. It's like getting a deep tissue massage and thinking afterwards, ""how did I allow myself to get that tense?""

@nightshadehelis9821,"I'm a disabled veteran who was drug free my entire life. I became an alcoholic and was struggling with depression and a severe feeling of hopelessness. I randomly stumbled upon an article about magic mushrooms helping veterans, which lead me towards reading a mountain of research. I felt like I had nothing to lose because I was downright suicidal, so I found a local seller on reddit. I explained my situation, met the guy the following morning, and I tried it that night. It was incredible. I couldn't stop smiling because it was extremely beautiful and therapeutic. Before I saw everything in black and white and suddenly I saw colors again. More than anything, I felt good. I've tried every possible antidepressant and SSRI medication out there, but nothing helped. Plus the side effects were awful. Magic mushrooms have been the ONLY thing that has legitimately worked for me. I didn't tell my wife because of the drug stigma, and she even hugged me one day and asked what was going on because I had changed so much for the better. She literally said she had her old husband back.   It's not a magic cure for everyone, but it helped me work through issues and confront things that bothered me down to my core. I now see the beauty in life. I went from sleeping my life away and staring out my kitchen window to being excited about starting my day. I went from surfing my phone all day to making art, playing my guitar for hours, and taking my dog for walks. I'm a more loving husband and better person. For me it's not just about the trip. It's a tool that helps me better understand myself and examine the lens through which I see life. Plus it brought back feelings I forgot I had. I've been sober for several months now and take 2 to 4 grams every couple weeks at night while staring at the stars and smoking a cigar.",1년 전(수정됨),3,

@sIowwalker,"I recently embarked on two consecutive high-dose psilocybin experiences, each 5 grams, spaced 5 days apart. The second session was a shocking contrast to the first. The first time, I felt a sense of heaviness and some mental discomfort, but I soon overcame it and was able to let go, leading to a harmonious experience that felt akin to reaching Nirvana. However, the second session was entirely different.  Before the second session, I hadn’t slept well, and after some outdoor activities, I had a light dinner with beer, smoked some marijuana, and then consumed the psilocybin. The effects came on very quickly, and within about 30 minutes, I realized something was wrong. Opening my eyes, everything felt disturbingly strange, almost unbearable, and closing my eyes felt like slipping into a coma. Unlike the first session’s harmonious images, I was overwhelmed by terrifying, distorted sensations and a darkness that seemed to consume me. I felt as if I had died and was experiencing something akin to annihilation, but my consciousness remained remarkably clear, and I realized I was undergoing ego death.  It was an intense mental battle, and if I hadn’t been firmly resolved that I wouldn’t truly die, and if I didn’t believe that the experience would eventually end and that I would emerge stronger, I might have been overwhelmed. After two to three hours of this intense state, I felt not just complete unity with the universe, but a profound understanding of its principles and laws, reaching a state of self-transcendence. It felt as though an aura enveloped my entire being, and I received a powerful message that a spiritual civilization beyond the material world was on its way. I felt a strong calling from the universe.  After the experience ended, I struggled for about an hour with near-schizophrenic anguish as my sense of self slowly returned. Drinking water and talking with a close friend helped me recover quickly, and I spent the rest of the night reflecting on how to integrate this experience into my life. This experience became a turning point for me to reflect on my life and gave me clear wisdom on how to handle relationships, allowing me to view myself objectively from a third-person perspective.  In addition, I now have a strong belief in a significant spiritual existence, and the sense of complete unity with the universe that I felt is something I will never forget. Psilocybin is a mystical gift of nature that should never be dismissed as merely a recreational drug.  However, I do not recommend multiple high-dose psilocybin experiences in a short period, as I personally experienced the physical and mental overload it can cause. It is essential to get sufficient rest, proper nutrition, and regular exercise to build physical strength after such experiences. Additionally, heavy use of marijuana post-experience can cloud the clarity of mind gained from the psilocybin experience, so I advise against it. I hope that those considering trying this will take these points into serious consideration.",1년 전,2,

Then comes the sorrow of all pain throughout history, then forgiveness and closure, one time I felt as though I became part of all understanding all knowing, it was almost like tapping into the conscious memory and awareness of everything that is and has ever been, questions were no longer required as answers to any thought simply revealed themselves with effortless understanding, the evolution of existence in itself from its beginning to our current time was present, it was as though the memories of every conscious being that is and ever has been was stored in one place, it also felt like the reality I perceive wasn’t anything more than neuron’s relaying information  to my consciousness, like touch / vision and all my other senses where nothing more than tools programmed to enhance the experience I perceive to be a form of existence, to say I became spiritual after that encounter is an understatement 😂",1년 전,1,

@seshelbow336,"I took psychedelics maybe 10 times in my late teens. I’m convinced to this day (25 years later) that things happen when you’ve had LSD that couldn’t actually happen in normal life without LSD. Not quite sure how I can explain it. Like one time, 4 of us had 1 tab of LSD each. We were in my mates car. We basically parked somewhere really quiet, where we wouldn’t be bothered by anyone, with the plan being laugh our backs off for a few hours until we were coming down a bit and the driver was ok to drive again. All 4 of us were weed smokers, but, didn’t smoke joints or blunts, we just all did buckets, or if we were in the car or away from water a “lung”…..a half bottle with a carrier bag taped to it and a foil with holes on the top. Wasn’t long before we realised we had fucked up. We had weed, but no way to smoke it, and all credit to the driver he wasn’t willing to drive anywhere until he felt ok again. So we are sat there, having a laugh, but all really wish we had a way to smoke our weed. All of a sudden I had this thought. Maybe 6 months earlier, we had been sat in the same spot, getting stoned, I had spotted a white roof with a blue light pop up over a hedge about half a 1/4 mile away. We ditched the “lung” out of the window, I started the car, and we left the car park as fast as we could, and as we turned left out of the car park, the police car I had luckily spotted during its 1 second of visibility passed us going the other way. I could see he was turning round to come after us, but being a windy country road and me being out of sight I just got my foot down, knowing my mates house was about a mile away. We got to his house but nobody was in. So we all bailed into his back garden. Police drive past a few times and left. So as I remember this happening, I tell my mate who’s driving, 6 months ago I threw a lung out of the drivers window, it can’t be far. So now he’s driving in same spot, he opens his car door, reaches down, and picks up the lung from 6 months ago off the floor. We are all cheering, buzzing, can’t believe our luck. Then we realise, there’s no foil, we have no foil, we have nothing else to use as foil, so our buzz turns to disappointment. So bloody close. But mo bother, we are still all giggling having a good time, just a bit of weed would massively improve the situation. Another half hour or so I have this brainwave. It’s like a eureka moment. I ask the lads if any of them can remember it being windy in the last 6 months? (We live north east England, it’s windy most days) but no, none of us can remember it being windy in the last 6 months. Well if it hasn’t been windy the foil off the lung I threw out the window can’t be far away can it? It’s like hope is restored. The foil must be somwhere near if it hasn’t been windy. 😂. Well as luck would have it, the driver, lowered his car window, put his arm out of the window, and hanging on the twig of a bush we were parked next to was a foil, pre made, already shaped to a bottle top, with holes in it, ready to go. So sat there all tripping our boxes off, all wanting a bucket/lung, without even moving the car, we had found a lung on the floor that only needed the drivers door opening to pick up, and a foil hung on a branch that we only needed to wind the window down to grab. This wouldn’t be so crazy in itself….but of the 10 or so times we took LSD, every other time we had the bucket or lung sorted…..apart from 1 other time. We had been out and about exploring on LSD. Stopped to rest at a church. It had like a gate into the grounds with a little roof on and 2 benches. (Kissing gate?) anyway we stopped to chill out for a bit. Again we realised it was time for buckets, but we are miles from home, middle of nowhere. All sat trying to think how we can piece a bucket together. No shop for foil or bottle tho. No litter even, just simply no way we could make a bucket. All of a sudden, and I can’t remember which one of us it was, I think it was me, pointed up to the roof of the tiny shelter we were sat in, and in the corner, where the roof meets the eaves, was a water bucket, with foil, and everything we needed apart from water. A quick walk to the church found us an outside tap, and yet again, for the second time, when we were all so desperate to find a “bucket”…..there was one within arms reach. Best thing about the second time though was it wasn’t even one we had made ourselves and thrown away or stashed, it was nothing to do with us at all. But was there when we needed it. Been fancying a heroic dose as an adult a long time. I think I’ll have to do it. Nobody can convince me otherwise, shit happens on LSD that could never happen if you hadn’t had it.",1년 전,0,

There is a large spiritual aspect to all of this that psychologists refuse to acknowledge. Until they do they will continue to try and find the needle in the haystack with blinders on. The greatest experience I've had was when I called out to Almighty Creator God after being clean and sober for years. The only other people I've heard of that have had such an experience were Elijah and John of Patmos. Instead of psychodelics perhaps people should be more genuine about seeking God who made those mushrooms and all the other natural medicines for healing the nations.

I was hoping for that trip into my past, to see where my traumata are coming from and to get a clearer vision of what to do next and get a relative normal live back. But it only makes me do more stuff that I stopped doing in my depressive state, like cleaning the house, reordering thing, doing administration and stay more calm in stressful or frustrating situations. That is of course a very good thing, but the hope was for the enlightening moment.  A well. I just have to enjoy it the way it comes to me, I guess.  Oh, just remembering....Time perception!

But I never did things other did because I was told it was wrong; I made straight A's so to speak and never had to study; the teachers would tell me to put my hand down and give others a chance. Then some how one night being with guys I was not supposed to be around, I had my 1st drink (Strawberry Hill I think) as I sat there in that chair for I was not really part of their crowd, I slowly felt that sensation wipe across my brain and I purposely took 2more heavy drinks just to experiment. I was suddenly recalling facts, and able to open share things and I was happy, and yet those around me could not keep up. I since, and after the military, depended upon Pure Grain Alcohols for relief from the world, and getting to enjoy being happy and all about information. I remember I had a masters class on children's minds and etc. So I wrote my paper on DNA and to the depth it could store and recall information; I as a conclusion ( the professor thought impossible) said that somewhere in my DNA is a memory of Adam and Eve, and that it is stored as the senses almost at the atomic level. I was asked can you prove this, and I kindly said you told us to give you a theory... and that was in 79 I do believe.  Yes, I believe what you say, and I will tell you this to stay with the herbal side of the scale; for the man made stuff will have long term problems; take care Doc, I almost wish I could help you on the experiments;  my brain stays locked up unless 'Unleashed' it is part, a weakness of humans; but also a safety factor with the majority",1년 전,0,

@PsychedelicDidgeridoo,"There are some thought about using DMT instead since it is shorter lasting and does many of the same things to the brain in terms of BDNF and neuroplasticity, being able to open up the 'critical period' to enable a re-wiring of old neural pathways that are dysfunctional, often based around different types of traumatic experiences. The only thing is being able to 'unpack' that kind of intense experience, and be able to integrate valuable insights from these experience.",1년 전,0,

I grew up, got a real understanding of life and the world and I tried psychedelics again.  I realized as I suspected that it was all BS.  The stories of psychedelic experiences being profound were lies I told after the experience, a narrative I used to justify my use, a repetition of things I heard others say.  It's just a drug that messes with your head, it's not even pleasant and can be downright unpleasant.  No need for me to lie about the experience anymore.  People are unhappy and desperate for meaning because they are doing something wrong, the brain is sending a message to you that your behavior is wrong, but people dont want to change their behavior, admit they are wrong, learn, grow.

I was addicted to OxyContin and cocaine in my 20s and thanks to this little magic fungi. I rebelled  against all hard drugs now for 31 years.   Both my mom and dad were heroin addicts and both overdosed. I’ve had a crazy childhood which  I won’t  get into it, here, but thanks to the fungi,  I have rewritten my neurological brainwave patterns.. all on my own watch and sincere diligence and compassion for myself, where I don’t even recognize that old self anymore which was full of trauma due to this sick external world.   It’s like the gods press reset on you.  Most of my trauma has vanished. I look for it for years, but can’t seem to find the intensity of it, of how I used to experience Life’s trauma and troubles.    Thanks to MM’s | psychedelics. I quit hormone therapy seven years ago. Too. And never returned to it.    I’m not surprised it’s still labeled as a schedule one drug   the corrupt people in our system have perverted this wonderful miracle this gift that God gave humanity  because they know the power it holds.   the fact that it’s still demonized is a joke and all these people should be held accountable for crimes against humanity   ..  for withholding another birthright experience we as humans should have.   Doc, I hope you actually took mushrooms yourself, because you can study and observe outsiders all you want,. But you’ll never understand them until you muster up the courage and go on several journeys yourself. To do a deep dive on how the shroom speaks to you.  And how it shatters your egos ill will toward self.   I kind of think it’s a little comical that people study these wondrous gifts, but never ever study themselves on them.  So hopefully your a real ""shaman"" so to speak rather than some kind of clinical observation.-ist.   I don’t know you so I don’t know. If you haven’t journeyed and penetrated through yourselves self, you’ll never grasp it’s beauty it’s importance and it’s value.

@davebry01, @dgodiex Yes these truffles are not dry. The shop where we bought them from in Amsterdam only seem to sell Truffles which are in air tight tiny plastic bags.

We are eating around 5grams a day of these and feel absolutely no difference whatsoever?? We have just ordered and are on the way “High Hawaiians” we are planning on taking 15grams of those each.

@lalailm,"You know, calm me crazy but to me, the rise of psychedelic therapy is the proof we are not just in a mental health crisis, but primarily in a spiritual crisis too. If it was just a chemical imbalance matter, then using medicine to fix that would be fine, right? But what a lot of people seem to miss is purpose.  And btw, im not bashing psychedelics or people who go for this treatment, to each their own. Im also not affirming that embracing a specific religion or traditional ways of tackling spirituality will do the trick for everybody. But, what a lot of people report after a psychedelic trip is exactly what I experienced a while ago after something I can only describe as a spiritual awakening, or at least a “free sample” of that. I never took anything, I just sat on my porch one day while going through one of the toughest times of my life and I felt an immense urge to pray. Im not a particularly religious person although I was raised in a catholic household, but even after being away from church for a few years now, I retained some of the teachings I learned, specifically regarding unconditional love. So that day I just decided to pray to God. And it had been so long I could only focus on how I had no idea what to do. But a few minutes in I just surrendered and sobbed. Just gave up control and everything came rushing in. And I cant explain exactly what happened but suddenly it was like everything became clear. I was 100% conscious and still it was like my mindset completely shifted and I had all the answers I was looking for. It was life changing, really. And I dont even know how long the whole thing was, maybe a few minutes but it felt like months worth of therapy, I tell ya. And after that I spent days in a state of complete bliss and peace and nothing would ever be able to bring me down. I couldn’t believe it. But afterwards I understood that it was a “sample” of sorts bc, just like your physical health and your mental health, spiritual health takes daily work and care. And since then I have been working on that.  So yeah, I do think we are in a spiritual health crisis, and for some people, what they achieved with psychedelics could maybe be achieved with a spiritual journey that may or may not involve drugs. Idk. Either way, I think in the future this will be more clear than ever. But for now, I feel like some people still confuse a need for spiritual care with a need for mental care.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@I3uttazz,"If you're thinking about getting into psychedelics, do yourself a favor and do not touch LSD. Only do mushrooms. I've done extensive testing, and the best testing I found where I could really see what the chemicals do to you is with fast-paced FPS shooters, mainly Apex Legends. And I can tell you right now when you trip on acid and play everyone around you is moving at high speeds but it looks like you're running in mud and everything you do is laggy and slow because of how LSD makes you perceive what's happening if you play the same game on mushrooms however everyone and everything is moving fast but you're moving just as fast with them and you're able to keep up and interpret exactly what's happening just as fast as it happens and you can kind of foresee what's going to happen and react accordingly to that. And it just makes the game look a lot smoother. Best way I can describe it is like going from playing 60 fps to 240 FPS it speeds up your brain and helps you interpret things so much quicker, whereas acid just literally makes you stupid and slows you down. LSD is synthetic and holds no benefits. You will learn absolutely nothing on LSD but you will learn everything on mushrooms. Long story short LSD turns you into a retard and mushrooms turn you into God like. LSD also has long-lasting negative effects even if your experience on it wasn't negative.

What I have found will stay with me forever. I don't even want/need to make another journey... One was enough to explain me everything I needed to know.   What I have learnt is that we are but one big ""organism/mind/brain"" creating this physical life to/for ourselves. This is why love and respect is so important to each one of us. We are literally treating other parts of ourselves so why not do it with love, respect and empathy? Wouldn't we all be treated like this?   I am also aware that yin can only coexist with yang but I think we can shift so much more towards love and good round the world minimalizing evil and all that's bad for longer.  I am forever grateful that nature (people involved spreading the word and means, etc.) and this life has let me experience it.  Let us level up life on our planet one day at a time. Let's enjoy it more/ Let us make others enjoy it more along the way as well/   One more thing:  This is not a quick fix. It is not even a fix per se. It's a lesson as any other. But the quality, magnitude, power is of the highest level I have ever experienced. You still go back to your old you, your old life but you have this lesson with you and you can use it to grow up as a better person and make everything and everyone round you better as well and as I have mentioned... At least for me personally... I don't feel like I want to even go back... I have seen everything and had all answers no I can focus on my improving my life and lives of others.

Psilocybin causes no serotonin syndrome problems regardless of dosage so long as you don't use SSRI's or MAOI's and even for my brain I only need microdoses twice a week. So why still prohibition?

At first everything was fun and happy like a usual trip but then we crossed that line and things became VERY VERY uncomfortable. We were brought to the root of consciousness. We basically died and were stuck at the point of eternity. We honestly thought we would never go back to being normal. It was horrifying to grapple with these ideas of what we actually are and what we are actually doing in this realm. We came to the conclusion that we are just apart of a consciousness that made everything up. EVERYTHING is made up by you. Everything is and always had been and you are experiencing it through your own consciousness that you made up. It’s hard to understand when you’re stuck in the 3D but we are actually eternal. It never matters what’s going to happen, what has happened, or what will happen because you are making it all up. You are in control. It’s scary at first but once you hone that power in and own it…life is just your playground. Make it up to whatever you want to be❤️",1년 전(수정됨),0,

It wasn't just visuals or audio, it was everything. There was significant synesthesia and it seemed like I only had one all encompassing sense. It gave me true introspection and a way to evaluate myself without my ego interfering. It was definitely uncomfortable at times as I was basically forced to confront some things that I hadn't wanted to before, but from my perspective it wasn't a bad trip, just a learning experience. Something to grow from. Ever since, I've been doing much better.

Sometimes it has to show you bad stuff to help you become a better person both internally and externally. I was only having a hard time at the beginning of a high dose because of wanting to maintain some semblance of control once I let that go and allowed myself to be a passenger on the journey it was easy.

I didnt turn spiritual or hippy by any means, but life has definitely changed permanently... there is however a balance you have to achieve, theres pros and cons to taking psychs and the more you overdo it the more apparent. My perception and attitude have changed, but I feel every emotion or sense of joy I feel is nulled. I do also take SSRI's, so trips like these especially in the larger doses (>1000ug Acid/>1g Molly) have to be planned out very carefully as to avoid Serotonin Syndrome.

I would say to those considering, if taking magic mushrooms at a heroic dose - make sure all is well in your life. Don’t do the heroic dose as the saviour of yourself as it may well be your last. First try with microdosing , then a 2-3 gram dose. He took 28 grams over the course of a day and was lucky to survive his first heroic dose.

@brianharris1573,"Heroic dose? New Years eve 2000 took me 5 years to collect all of the compounds I took. For the biggest party in the history of mankind I was going to trip. Started the San Pedro's with mescaline in the winter of 1995 from seed. By Y2K New Years Eve I had a nice shroom lab, 100's of San Pedro cactus (2 doses of extract), a dose of Voacanga root bark, a few hits of real LSD, Lots of Superweed, 1/2 gram of Diisopropyltryptamine powder, a ball of real opium from poppy plants I grew and incised, a bottle of cheap champagne, and some other psychedelic obscura, probably 2CT-2 or 2CT-7. Meth, cocaine and plenty of beer found their ways to me and I took it all over a few hours. The DIPT is an auditory distorting hallucinogen that makes guitars sound like bells and your own voice, you wouldn't ever recognize as yours. Like a Cylon from Battlestar Galactica or Megatron from the transformers. I was walking around like that and kept feeling my friend was in trouble at the bar. So on my way home from the party I'd just escaped, I went to the bar and there he was screaming 'You have to help me. You have to protect me."" with a bunch of people crowding around him. So I calmed him down and when I left got chased out of the bar for my bottle of Ballatore. I ditched the bouncer and was in an alley thinking about the crazy shit I'd just put myself through on my hands and knees crying for the sins of mankind when the fireworks started going off. half a mile and 3 steps I was home safe. Put my favorite Pink Floyd mix in and turned on a red party bulb and blacklight and was peaking my balls off to Cirus Minor when CRASH! the kitchen door slams open and my years sober dad is standing there with a total WTF look on his face. 5 seconds later it was a quiet and normal looking living room again. Turns out he had a strange feeling and couldn't get any sleep at his girlfriends apartment. It took 3 days for my hearing to go back to normal from Mr. Roboto. Then I started the experiment where I had to take at least 1 psychedelic trip every week for the entire year of 2000 and yes, I did finish it. 2013 I finally found MDMA and that's another story all together. How I used1 dose of MDMA every Saturday for 14 days, took a weekend off, did a double dose trip week 15 and another 15 single dose trips on the same schedule. That's when I found out I can sing and I lost my crippling social anxiety at the same time.",1년 전,0,

You can read about the aforementioned in the first edition of his brother’s book “The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss” (the information was removed from subsequent editions.)

@1AddictedPro,"When I took shrooms for the first time, I was out in the desert at night observing shooting stars while my DJ friends played all ranges of EDM. I was really floored but still vibing to the music while visual patterns and colors formed as my eyes closed, and opening them would actually ground me back to reality. Strangely, as I was tripping, I felt alone and acceptance to it. It's honestly weird, almost had me tearing up a bit. Shrooms had me tripping for 4'ish hours, and the come up had me anxious too. Then recently tried a DMT cart, it literally had me floored and feeling like I was at the peak of shrooms (never tried acid) the visualizations happened really quickly, my thoughts were constantly racing, and the only time I snapped out of it was when my friends got my attention and had me follow them on their walk around festival grounds. DMT hit really quickly as I kept inhaling for a full lung pull & holding it in. Almost immediately, everything started getting muted, then exploded back in after I exhaled. Luckily, it only lasted me about 10 minutes.",1년 전,0,

Instead of feeling trapped and high I felt such extreme love for my family. I remember we watched the America's Got Talent try outs and I was cracking up which led to my mom cracking up and then my sister. It's difficult to put into words the connection I felt that day.

I never realized that it's like an antenna... or the phrase ""we are souls having a human experience.""  Now I crave traveling to sacred places around the world, to connect with nature. Things I took for granted.  I always heard the word ""chakra"" but never really knew what it was, nor did I care to find out. Now I do chakra clearing meditations a few times a week. I pray before I eat the food that is nourishing my body and giving me life. I take care of my body (my vessel), much better than before. I practice non judgement, forgiveness and compassion for others more now because I realize how much healing we all truly need. I also meditate more, hug trees, listen to different music, eat better... it helps us understand the bigger picture and gives us power to change patterns that no longer serve us.

But what's more saddening is the sort of things people do with the various compounds. Abuse not correlated with depressive disposition.  aka a party drug.  There are pharmaceuticals for real-life conditions that are being taken by people who don't need them. I had a close friend that started taking Xanax. That was his ""party drug"". Xanax isn't a party drug, that is just how 40 million shitheads choose to use it. The same can be said about the plethora of substances. Mushrooms ARE NOT A PARTY DRUG. That dogma comes from people who abuse and misuse them.  Now, people that are not familiar with such things refer to them by how the degenerates define them.  Most people are mentally unstable, and I'm not talking about psychos. A sheer number of ""normal"" adults cannot manage their own temper. Most people are fragile minded and not in the mental space to even be safely taken out of their comfort zone without a freak out.  I remember my first time trying psychedelic mushrooms as a teenager. I had a fat bag in my hands that I had just acquired. My two other friends I was with also had their own share, but they only ate a couple stems and several caps. My buddy asked me how many I would take, to which I answered by consuming the entire fully stuffed ziplock bag. I don't know the exact quantity because there was just so much. it felt nice. I still remember the feeling as if I had just completed a very nice meditation. For me, out of a dozen meditations, one sit might feel quite absorbing, uplifting, I might even say heavenly. It felt almost exactly like a good sit. It felt okay, wasn't too strong compared to deep meditation. But my two friends were out of their minds from their little take. It was an eye opening experience, as they had allegedly taken mushrooms plenty of times and that had been my first. I recall them being very filthy minded people.  My point anyway, is I'd like to, in my lifetime, see substances rebranded by people that aren't drug addicts and freaks. POTENTIAL FOR USE should not be defined by what a person decides to do. I don't know what the statistics are for hammer wielding murders, but a hammer is not a weapon because someone decided to use it for that. Psychedelic substances are not party drugs because someone uses it for that.",1년 전,0,

@junepaul7843,Me and my wife used to buy an ounce of mushrooms and split it in half and eat it all at once. 14 grams each. We had no idea that that was something not really normally done. Like we got 3 grams of dmt and smoked it all in one night. Very cool substance btw. But yeah there were moments where things felt a lil scary but we had one another and it all was ok because of that. However. The last time we got them the guy told us I know you guys eat ALOT don't do that with these ok they are crazy strong... We just ate a quarter oz each and it was very uncomfortable to say the least we both rapidly got into a headspace like ok I just want this to stop. We weren't freaking out or anything. We know it's all in our heads so it's ok but it was unpleasant. My wife said give the other half oz away. I took it to work and told that story and shocker no one wanted them so left them in the work truck for like 2 weeks and decided to micro dose them and just ate a stem and cap in the mornings and all day my body felt light as a feather and I was moving like the matrix all day just on que johnny on the spot doing it all and getting praise for it.

@hanshandkante5055,"I can only warn people about this. Psychedelics are pretty much unpredictable. In my teenage years i took LSD and sometimes magic mushrooms every second weekend or so, never had any problems with it at all. I've literally ridden rollercoasters on LSD, I've walked around a pitch-dark cemetery for 6 hours on LSD, I've gone to festivals and clubs on LSD. You name it. So I was pretty sure I wouldn't have any horror trips because I already had a lot experience with psychedelic drugs. So one weekend i took LSD again and nothing happened for four hours. I was confused because i took teh same amount a few days before and it was a normal 8 hour trip but this time nothing happened at all. So me and some friends drove to some club and in the middle of the drive it hit me and from one second to the other all my senses were changed and it was like i was seeing, hearing, smelling and sensory feeling the world through the eyes of a strange alien being and on top i felt like i was stuck in a loop. I was sure i was loosing my mind and i never had so much fear in my life. Then we went to the club and all the people looked like puppets on strings and mechanically performed the same movements over and over again, it was a nightmare from which there was no awakening. As if that wasn't enough, all humans had a tail trailing behind them, as if they were comets. This went on for 8 hours and i manged to act ""normal"" by just sitting in a corner and drinking some beer but inside i was fighting for my sanity by telling me again and again that this was just the drug and that the effect would end eventually. After that i had two years of severe depressions and panic attacks. Needless to say that i will never ever touch psychedelics in my life again.   Also i knew a girl who was tripping on shrooms and became psychotic. She was in panic and run out on the streets but the people who were with her at that time were also totally wasted and did not follow her. After a few days she came back from wherever she was and was fully psychotic speaking to people that only she could see and giggling the whole time. She then lived on the streets and in squats for a while and was raped in a park. She never recovered from this and lives now in a care facility for mentally ill people.    Don't risk it, its not worth it! It can help you but it can also destroy your life and your mental health.  And if someone shows signs of psychosis or will not come down from that trip call an ambulance. The faster a drug psychosis is treated, the more likely a complete recovery is. Once such a psychosis has become chronic, there is often not much that can be done anymore.",1년 전,0,

In some cases it's not a very good idea. I have seen stuff, entities you might call them, who really really don't like anything made with common material. They HATE matter. I've tried to let go and got a little bit ""sucked"" by one of the ""beam like entity"". God almighty that was by far the most terrifying experience I ever had. The only thing that come to my mind is the shouting beam position of Leelo from the movie ""The fifth element"". I felt like struck by a lightning or something similar and it seemed to have lasted for hours. I puked my guts out because I felt how much this ""Thing"" hate matter, like if everything was excrement, like if I was excrement. Now I know that YOU DON'T WANT to look inside of this gigantic beam of light that just goes frome one end of the universe to the other. You can call me crazy or think whatever. That's what I remember from that hell of a trip. Took me several days to fully understand what I've lived. The weirdest of all, and I sweat to god that it is true, several month later I explain all of this to a friend who had similar very high dosage experience, and before I mention the ""Leelo pose"" he himself mimic it mentioning the beam of light coming out of the mouth and tell me how much matter is not welcome near those entities, how he felt like literal sh@t.

The so called professionals are merely trip-sitters while the work is actually being done in the experiencer's mind. And any post experience processing is, at best, a fraction of the significance of the actual experience. But don't mess with their bottom lines. And is it going to be another 60 years before they realize that these medicines were given by nature, and nature's god, to everyone? and not just self proclaimed professionals? If it's not clear to them that these medicines are vastly less harmful to the user's than alcohol and tobacco, and should be no more controlled or regulated than broccoli, then they do not deserve to be the gatekeepers of these miraculous medicines.

That’s the actual truth, but of course heyyyyy if I can wave my hand in front of my face and just watch the trails as they slowly fly by and then you start seeing entities you never thought were possible and then you try talking to it and it says nothing to you as it tells its other bad entity friends to come and join the mindf*ck we’re about to do on this person as they bring you into the realm of Hell where you flirt with deaths last breath… if you do it enough, you will have an experience known as a “bad trip.” Even people who know nothing about psychedelics have heard this phrase before, yet so many who go through it, don’t believe their lying eyes. They all believe it’s just your imagination going wild, too wild and the ones who have those bad trips, but can actually see it for what it is, will be very careful of trying that ever again. I do know that in some cases it can help with some mental illnesses, doesn’t mean those certain few won’t get attachments either. Once you’ve opened the 3rd eye, but your mind so easily overtaken by something else that’s been doing it for possibly millions of years, do you really think that can’t happen to you? lol 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ The way of projecting your spirit into the spirit realm, you must be able to both pray & meditate with high enough frequency, while looking through your 3rd eye. People have been well documented of being able to astral project from one place to another without ever breaking a sweat. Look up Edward Cayce as an example. I would really like for the collective of all humans to realize their true self, but through a way that does open your body up to corruption… that’s all demons can do after not that long of being in your body. Hopefully someday the majority has figured out that everything in this reality, is a lie. There’s nothing in it, you should ever want. The sour of all intelligence ends of being God, folks. Raise your frequencies, or suffer a wrath only compared to the Flood. I kid you not, you’ve got as little as 3 years and as many as 7, to be worthy of the ascension into the 5th dimension/Heaven and if you’re still tethered to the material world, you will go to the 3rd dimension, where the entirety of the Deep State will be headed on the day of judgement and when Earth becomes the whole realm of Hell, the only one that will literally be looking down on you as we leave this world and watch the world burn as we do, those in the 3rd dimension won’t see us, but we’ll definitely see them about to start their eternity in Hell.

@TactlessGuy,"Not everyone will have a breakthrough with psychedelics, but a decent fraction (maybe 10-20%, just coming out of my ass) will experience positive long-term life changes from a single profound trip. When it comes to certain psychedelics like shrooms and DMT, even a ""bad"" trip will promote beneficial changes in the long-run. A lot of times people who are in bad mental states are controlled by their subconscious, and ""bad"" trips are often somewhat of a harsh reality check where your conscious mind battles with your subconsciousness to tell you to stop being stupid. In my experience, it was my ""bad"" trip that got me to quit all of the other drugs I was doing and eat a healthier diet. Many people are scared of psychedelics because they're afraid of bad trips, but I encourage you to think of them as ""challenging"" trips instead in case they do happen to you. The mature side of your mind is trying to lecture you on your negative behaviors and lifestyle, and you need to listen to it.",1년 전,0,

In the Bible , those ""spirits "" , are called demons... these are the same entities  then and now , as in every single satanic and occult practice today , in certain rituals they perform in these cults  , this types of drugs , are still in use , to contact the same "" spirits "", or demons of the past , some cults , know what they are  , and some cults do not , some give them another names , or classification to this entities .   but the trip  of any psychedelic , is not just you wondering in Neverland , that trip , it is guided also by something else too.... you are not in control of that , and clearly , all that stuff that you experience  at that moment , is not all coming from your own experience. and mind... nor of the drug .  were is it coming  from then ?  and what  is given you all those visions ? .

Nothing will cure your sins , all your problems are traced to your own sins in this life every time , your mind and your Bodie , are only  symptomatic to how you feel inside ( your soul ,and how you feel , is completely related to the good things you do , or the bad things you do ) you can't heal the inside from out side , you need the proper treatment for that , except Jesus , there is no cure to our problems...    This new  treatments , are another trick to make people fall into a new trap ,  they give these  false promise that they will cure everything with just a drug ( and that you don't need to change your behaviour  )  The only cure , is in our good  behaviour ( everything we do , come back to us , every time...  ) and if we are doing bad things all the time , what do you think that your life will be ?  if we change our lives for a better path ,  and with the help of God , we can change for good , and for real .   Don't be fool  , following   the easy way , that  way , can only lead to destruction",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@johnathanmphoto,"I was given 11 grams at a gathering at a ""temple"" in Davie, FL back in 2020. I didn't expect to take that much and my own spirit guides told me, ""DO NOT EAT ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS CHOCOLATE!"" The afterglow lasted for 3 weeks to a month, but that evening was something that A.I. would have a hard time grasping to illustrate.  I'm no stranger to phenomenological experiences on a daily basis, however, if I hadn't have the experiences I had in life (including a spontaneous full Kundalini Awakening in 1995), I would have possibly lost my sh*t and even had a psychotic break.  Instead, I just enjoyed what was being presented to me, the many layers of it all, even here in the waking state of things (or is this actually the dream with death being reawakened?).  To give you perspective on what happened and how this came about... The two women facilitating were taking advantage of the ""Florida scene"" where everyone who has ever gone down to South America or even Soul Quest to experience Florida, all of a sudden self qualifies themselves as ""Shamans"" and want to then serve ""plant medicine"" to others. Sadly, there is often a disregard or lack of reverence for it all and well, this was no different.  So bad was this evening that one young Russian girl (she was a model), in her early to mid 20's, was losing her shit and wanted to call her boyfriend to come get her. Instead of letting him drive her home, this idiot who was running this evening told him no and let the girl drive her own car in the altered state she was in.  There's more, MUCH more. I don't want to disclose what ""groups"" were conducting work there, but let's just say they were actively recruiting and there was at least one sacrifice on the property before I ever moved in. Red tantra orgies, people who lacked scruples and I was duped into moving in there on the false pretenses that the place was something else entirely.

That said, I must disagree on one thing you said that I wish were true but simply is not. Most of the world, or should I say - the world's governments - are not ready. My fiance had ten doses of LSD on him in the United States and spent over a year in prison. Not jail, prison. The criminal sentencing for psychedelics in my country is far higher for personal possession of small amounts of LSD than sentencing guidelines for a convicted drug dealer selling deadly opioids, and there is a reason for that. The government fears too many of us waking up, fears too many of us being happy, fears enlightenment for the masses. It is a true shame.

@DadaNabhaniilanandaTheMonkDude,"Very interesting. I'm surprised that all of the comments I read were so positive. I took LSD twice in my late teens and it definitely opened my eyes to my inner world. But I realized almost immediately that I should never take these powerful drugs again, and instead should use a healthy discipline of meditation, spiritual chanting and yoga lifestyle to explore this world I'd gained a glimpse of with the help of the drug.  I know of many cases, some of them first hand, of people who've damaged their minds with these substances, sometimes irreparably. I'm amazed that so few of these comments acknowledge the dangers of these drugs, which are very real, especially in so-called 'heroic doses'.  I do know people who've benefited from micro-doses under the guidance of a qualified therapist, so I do agree that there is a case for therapeutic use of these drugs in the treatment of severe depression, but I would never recommend them for any other purpose.  As Aldous Huxley so truly observed ""these substances can open the doors of perception, but can never take you through.""",1년 전,0,

I was young and my friends and I had only seen stoner movies and thought you ate them and saw little gnomes and everything was funny on them.  They messed with me so much when I started to feel them that I ran and hid inside a dark room.  That’s when I was transformed into a different and better person. I left my body, traveled through space and then hit a moment of pure clarity.  I asked myself the questions to all my suffering and the answers resonated with me down to my very core.   It cured my severe depression and gave me a positive outlook on life. Helped me overcome the sorrow and self pity I felt for growing up in an abusive home.

@sthulander1,"Hello, Matt Johnson - Yes, I understand, you study 'positive' effects of psychedelics, and I assume, any possible side-effects . . . Side-effects being problematic with modern pharmacological uses of 'single-active ingredient' drugs - which, to my knowledge are never found in nature.  A 'whole plant' may contain, often, innnumerable molecular chains of varying types, and NOT isolated 'single-active ingredient' molecular chains that the pharmaceutical industry pushes upon the world's suffering populace.  ALL of these 'medicines' have one thing in common - they ALL have side-effects.  But, honestly, so do various kinds of 'natural, organic compounds' WHEN TAKEN TO EXCESS.   But, parallel with 'the 60's' advent of mostly isolated, drugs such as LSD - which is artificially man-made, mimicking . . . what?  There was, also present at that nascent point of our recent history, a growing movement to 'naturally go within'; such as differing forms - and effectiveness, as studied - of meditation, yoga, breathing techniques.   A question should arise, upon closely examining multiple research projects and surveys - what might be the most effective, 'predictable' (key word) ways of using the mind, say, or, the body, or, one's air-flow regulation and pathways FOR a patient's betterment?  And, not just from the outside, external effects of (hopefully) more natural means of stimulating and PREDICTABLY MODULATING our own body's 'internal pharmacy' which, as we all know, has parallel effects upon 'bio-chemical' brain functioning?   One problem of using 'externals' is the many unpredictable outcomes, including measuring 'potency'.   Additionally, we have right now within society's collective pain - unregulated, self-medicating ways of attempting to escape the mental confines of IMBALANCE.  How do we even measure 'imbalances'?   And, what are the qualities of differing mind/body types?   And responses?    Do you as a researcher of the mind and its downstream behaviors, have any idea at all of identifiable body/mind types?  I speak from a perspective of 50+ years of meditation practices (TM), and of its sister practices of Ayurvedic Medicine.  Expample: In Ayurvedic Medicine, there are 10 differing mind/body types.  And yearly, seasonal, daily fluctuations of our body's organic chemistry.  These highly varying conditions can become understood and quantifiable by a trained Vaidya/MD.  And yes, medical professionals ARE becoming vitally interested in the new medicine: Integrative Medicine.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

I felt this beaming in my mind and my heart and it was like all i was, all i existed as, was love. That i was born from love and that i will die with love. That love is all we are, and that I shouldnt be afraid of it, afraid of living. I accepted so many things from my past, from my present, from whatever might be of my future. I felt it all.

@StuartHollingsead,"There is only one hope. Jesus. You might shake your head, oh great another loony christian. But I am dead serious. The road to heaven is narrow and few find it.  I first learned about ""the way"" when I listened to a speaker named Ivor Myers. An ex rapper, turned christian preacher/pastor. God had a dispute with one of his creations, Lucifer. The shining one. To be fair, God could not sit as judge in this dispute, because he was/is a part of it. So God created a third party to sit in judgement between the two parties involved. Us. Lucifer figured it out, and bribed the jury, so to speak. So God put together a plan. That plan is spelled out in the sanctuary tent after the exodus out of Egypt. It is written in symbolic form. The furniture pieces describe a task that God will do to rectify the situation, and create a jury that is able to solve the dispute from long ago. The easiest one to recognize is the Altar of Sacrifice. It represents Jesus death on the cross. Each piece of furniture represents a truth that was lost, and restored. The knowledge was lost when Israel was in egyptian captivity, but then restored after the exodus. It was lost again, but then restored by Jesus and the disciples. It was lost again, but then restored by the protestant reformation. Altar of sacrifice = Jesus died once for all who wish to place their sins on him. The lavar = baptism by washing the entire body, then thereafter only washing hands and feet. Jesus taught the meaning by ordaining footwashing. Service to other christians. The lampstand = witnessing, or aka, reflecting God's fruit of the spirit onto those around us. The table of shewbread = reading and eating the word of God. The bible. The altar of incense = Prayer, we pray to Jesus, but our prayers smell horrible. Thankfully Jesus mingles his prayers with ours, and they smell good to God. And finally, the Ark of the Covenant. = Keeping the commandments, leaning on the staff to stand upright in a spiritual sense, and hidden manna for us to eat. Each new piece of knowledge was added by a different church group in the protestant reformation. Calvinists, Baptists, Presbyterian, Lutherans, Episcopalian, and Adventist.  Follow the way, or perish.",1년 전,1,

Some  religious patients might struggle a bit if the specific types of experiences goes against their belief systems. The mindset prior to going in is the biggest part of it. Btw Ketamine is also another great tool. It’s my favorite because I don’t experience stomach discomfort as I do with Psilocybin.

@wiseyoutube2078,"I struggled with Existential Depression and would feel my emotions take over the driver's seat. I'd be in severe despair, crying, unable to move, thinking of all the ways to die. I was living with my parents at the time because I'd be unable to work. My father didn't know how to respond and my mother continuously just said not to be depressed. But it's as if you see everyone dying, withering away in a hopeless, vast void where all of our meanings and axioms are revealed as just nothing. That was daily life and I still have those thoughts, but not the despairing emotion anymore.  I tried Magic Mushrooms in Portland three months back. It was a full cap and stem, just one. I felt things intensely. I had gotten emotional about feeling that I was annoying to my girlfriend's friend, who I was meeting for the first time. I gazed at the stars and saw them glowing, ruminating on how their glow seemed to extend from and circle back into myself. I felt profound connectedness. That night we also danced around a Bonfire at the Oregon Country Fair. I didn't see things moving, but I did feel my ""focal length"" shift. I'd feel as if I acknowledged people were sitting next to me, yet felt far away at the same time. Over the next two days, I found I felt more sleepy but in this very warm and radiatingly beautiful way. If I breathed slow and meditated, some partial feelings of my trio would seem to reignite, conferring a semblance that I could control my inner bliss.  Three months later, I haven't dealt with those crippling feelings of depression once. I also don't reflect on my trip as some validation that I connected to the universe or God in some major way. It just feels like an ""air blanket"" has developed between the despairing feelings and those thoughts would normally ignite them. I can still ruminate on life's philosophical emptiness the way I did, without turning to religion, and still feel peaceful and grateful.   Magic Mushrooms has the power to enable us to deal with the real implications of our Existential Condition by opening pathways to mature about them, giving us back control of emotions that arise from the fear of death and nothingness. This is likely why we had religion before, but Mushrooms, administered wisely, can lead to stable mental states with an honest disposition towards death and our existence without subscribing to fabricated ontology.   Mushrooms, I feel, have literally saved my life.",2년 전,1,

@DihelsonMendonca,"⚠️ It looks like I have depression for 10 years now. I have tried everything, SSRI medicines make me dull,  stupid to learn new things, and  cause memory problems. Stimulants cause anxiety. Psychotherapy is like placebo, doesn't help. I don't know what to do anymore. I just feel I'm hollow, everything is pointless, life is pointless, anhedonia. I delayed or cancelled all my projects, they don't worth a pity, after all, we're all gonna die, anyway. I had a wonderful childhood, no apparent trauma, my life is not bad, I used to have joy until 2013. One night, suddenly, I was working, and I asked to myself: What am I doing this ? What for ? Then, I began to notice that all other people live on the autopilot, they don't question their work, their actions, the fundamental questions, who am I ? What's the meaning of all this life ? What happens when we die ? So, I woke up to the reality that I am mortal, and I may die any moment, and didn't have made anything significative. I was just living like a vegetable. So. I began to research all kinds of books, from science to philosophy, people like Krishnamurti, Eckhart Tolle, Sadhguru, studied Buddhism, read the entire bible 3 times, but all I discovered was that all these guys also live on some kind of belief. They also don't know the basic answers. Some pretend to know, but they only have fancy stories without any proof. Also, ancient books look stupid, people only believe, believe... create stories. I tend to agree that nobody knows anything. It's all make belief. We're like ants, repeating what other people said, following the same rules of society, we are conditioned since childhood from school, parents, laws, society norms, and even fashion, social media, big tech companies, politics... all sorts of lies. We live a mechanical life, just repeating the same pattern: Being born, going to school, grow, find a job, marry, work, work, work, until one day you suddenly have a heart attack and die. That's our life. Either I'm crazy, or the world is mad. I don't even know if I'm depressed, or I accidentally discovered what we are. Krishnamurti said something interesting: ""It's not a sign of health being adjusted to a profoundly sick society"". I completely agree with that. But now that I took the red pill, I can't go back to the mankind ""Matrix"" anymore. I just sit down and watch the ants working until they die. Poor devils... ( Dihelson Mendonça ). 🎉🎉❤",2년 전,2,

At the end i did see something beutiful.  After many many good experiences I did have Another Bad experience but this was emotional. I decided to end the 2 year addiction.     This bad emotional .... trip ..was good at the start to the peak then after that, rest of the post houRs was bad. what happend was i hade an extra dose that i forgot about and could not remember where i put it.

I cied the crying was uncontrollable, i panicked for 20 min untill i accidently caught someones attention and i had to get myself calm. I had tothink critically about what i was feeling and why, my conclusion was that it was not normal and that it was the drug. I remembered were i had put it then i got rid of it into the dirt.even after that, thinking ""what if my dog got that or a guest?"" Just made me cry, the way some call you a name and how it hurts your feelings to were you physically feel it on your chest, yes this was 10× that feeling.

After i figure that i needed to personally better myself  , i had anger issues, whe these emotions happen, its uexpected.

@l7ragoon,"I had a huge ego death with 3 grams. I was 4 hours up north at a cabin. Took it at 8am. Dranked some orange juice to help a bit. I went out by the fire pit to grab some logs. As soon as I got the fire started. I sat down and looked up in the blue sky with the cool breeze blowing through the open forest. I started crying. Not because everything was beautiful around me, but I think it's because I was going through a lot during that time.  It really made me realized where I was in the moment of living life. It made me feel comforable being vulnerable to my own emotions and perspective on other things that I didn't even know for myself.   Imagine sitting down by the fire. The sky is blue and minor clouds. The sun it's out, 80 degrees. You look up and the sky looks like the clouds are moving with you, with a fish eye lens point of view.

@jeanettemarkley7299,"I once took acid and walked the cat walk (without holding the handrails because they were piled with inches of greasy dust) of the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge between Brooklyn and Staten Island. I took the acid in Brooklyn and waited. When I was feeling it me and my friend walked up the gigantic concrete slope that holds the bridge. We got to the lower level of the bridge and crawled through a hole in the fence. The catwalk was easy to get to from there and we went out to the first tower. It stops there because we couldn't get into the tower to go through, so we went back. This has to be the craziest thing I ever did, but it wasn't because of acid. I planned to do this while I was sober.   I would have done it, and it would have been a lot easier, if I was sober.  This was recreational use of coarse. I have no doubt that psychedelics can be therapeutic. If I knew where to go or who to contact to get this therapy I would. I suffer from every anxiety disorder in the book and have life long depression (hence the bridge in my teens) I do not leave my house other than to walk through my yard and around the house in laps for exercise, or to go to the doctors or dentist.

@richardgrier8968,"In 1981, when I was 24, I took my first dose thinking it would be a fun thing to do on a Saturday night. After 15 minutes, I began to feel really uncomfortable. I couldn't hold back this tide of discomfort, and I soon realized all the unpleasant things I had been stuffing down to avoid facing were now being thrust up, and I could no longer avoid them. My feelings of being an imposter (I was a BMW salesman who had dropped out of high school), of guilt and sadness over my mom's death 5 years earlier, the loss of connection with my family, and the self-loathing I experienced as the result of years of childhood trauma and abuse flooded me. I writhed in agony on my bed as these 'demons' came for me. Then a voice began to speak to me, telling me it was all ok, that it was normal to have these feelings - of course I was sad about my mom, of course I missed caring for my mom and younger brother, of course I didn't know or understand a lot because I had missed a lot of learning and guidance, and of course I would feel bad about myself when most of what I was told about myself was negative. Then I felt this tremendous sense of relief, like nothing I'd ever experienced. This experience changed me, made me softer, more vulnerable, and more empathetic to others. I'm 66 now, and my world has again ""shrunk"", and I'm stuck. I tried microdosing, but it had limited impact. I need another heroic dose.  I was afraid to try it again, but now I'm ready.",2년 전,0,

So the simple answer is to make it permanently a schedule 1 illegal narcotic. Psilocybin is different, it has the potential to give you a good night of partying or it has the potential to give you a spiritual awakening so i feel its more lenient.

The everyday life, all the little things that cause anxiety, all the things on earth seemed so small and meaningless compared to the vastness of everything. And not in a bad way, rather in a way that life on earth is such a small part of everything that there's no need to worry. I can't really explain wether or not it felt like there could be after life, but I can just say that dying didn't scare me at that point any more. It maybe would be end for me, maybe not. But everything (everything as in everything in the universe and possibly other universes) would continue.   Also I got this feeling, that I'm not really an individual, instead I'm part of the universe and I can't truly die as long as the universe is alive. I guess it was a kind of ego death.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@chrissimon3790,The best way to describe a psychedelic trip in my opinion is it turns up the power of your actions. You get a lot of energy and the things you do or feel have more of an effect. You can go from happy to upset very quickly but it's all with energy. I had heard many people talk about having bad trips but then I tried it myself and at one point had a psychological breakdown but it was needed as I became a better person after. I was being a piece of garbage person who was headed down a road that would only lead to a sad death. Now I'm inspired with the things I do and I try to do my best like I used to. I think the world is constantly bombarding people with dopaminergic activities left and right and we get overstimulated and burned out. It's why I think meditation and practicing mindfulness as well as rigorous exercise is the key to a stable mindset. It's all within your control no matter how bad you feel it is. I was genuinely wondering if I had deep psychological issues due to me constantly sabotaging my life and having no emotional control but I realized when tripping that your mood can change in an instant so why not apply it to real life. Why not reinforce positive attitudes on the daily and truly believe that something like depression or anxiety is just a construct of the imagination. When I said I wasn't depressed i felt something like a lightbulb moment that changed the course of my life forever.,2년 전,12,

But, lets take the opposite, what if it was true that, there was just so much joy, that it was overwhelming, nothing required effort, you could literally have anything, it could be stuff you didn't even know was possible, and it just gets served to you without any effort required.... We'll that is just as equally disturbing, you would have no reason to even be conscious, everything would be provided, you could literally not be aware of anything, and feel super amazing all the time, but then you would be unconscious, and super bored. You might even be bored to the point where you start to crave difficulty, and then you make a place where nothing in life is free, and everything is super difficult to get, and there is a constant looming fear that everything that you know of could end at any moment. It would be exciting, overwhelming at times, but at least you wouldn't be bored in to unconsciousness. And that is the cycle that we are in right now, but I think we are at the point where we are getting tired of everything taking a lot of effort, and we are starting to swing in the direction of not needing to use so much energy to obtain goals. But, this is the part where it's most important to keep busy regardless, because I have already discussed the dangers of having everything handed to you. Think about the children of rich people, it is much more likely to be bored and not feel fulfilled by anything that you can obtain, so therefore you obtain stuff that you can't, and for rich people, it's the things the society feels are taboo.

I have a hard time accepting psychedelics because I have a brother who committed murder while high on angel dust (PCP) back in the early 1980’s. It put a bad taste in my mouth for any drugs.  But again, each drug is different and if mushrooms or other substances can help and heal, then research should definitely continue.",2년 전,0,

We go through our daily lives numbing the pain. I feel like it resets our brain back to how we were as kids . I’m grateful for my enlightenment through shrooms .

@jenmdawg,"I was grief stricken a year ago. Unable to function after my fiancé died traumatically I could only find relief in plotting how to make my death not look  like suicide. I took a micro dose of mushrooms he’d left behind and went to bed expecting nothing to happen. 90 minutes later I was in my kitchen doing the dishes. Then I walked the dog and felt sun on my face. Then I ate dinner for the first time in weeks, drank water and went to bed.  My grief was still there - painful, raw and vivid but somehow I understood that I would make it and that life was going to show me the way and let joy in again.  Edit; I didn’t want my death to look like suicide - I wanted to find a way to have an “accident” that didn’t put anyone else at risk.  Edir 2: it’s 2 years and 3 months later. In many ways the second year really is harder (I really hoped that was not possible) but I have to credit mushrooms for giving me just enough light and relief to face the pain.  I’d like this to be available for anyone who is deep in grief and wants access and has correct understanding and support in place. I truly believe microdosing saved my life. I lacked the inner resources to survive my loss until my first dose gave me just enough insight to see, as I wrote above, that life would show me the way and that I am part of life itself (so suicide was a waste of my part to play).",2년 전(수정됨),335,

@NullStaticVoid,I'm confused by his terminology. He refers to 30 milligrams of psilocybin as a heroic dose.  That is a very small amount. We would often eat several grams of psilocybin for recreational doses.  Is he referring to some isolated and refined extract?   One of the things that gets left to the side is the abuse of these things.   People will reflexively try to negate any kind of statement about this.  Trying to defend their hallowed psychedelic experience.  But if you go back and read your Terrence McKenna he talked about this.  There is the initial epiphany which can be such a profound experience that we desire to get back there.  We waste a lot of time trying to get back there using the same means. Even formalizing the approach to this experience.  Which McKenna thought was the foundation of religion.  But there is something about our consciousness that won't let us use the same key for that door more than once.,2년 전(수정됨),0,

There has to be something physically wrong with my brain, cuz this cannot be normal by any means. I also take 450 ug of acid and watch horror movies. But that sounds a lot crazier than it really is for me. Acid is damn near just a party drug for me. Taking acid and watching paranormal activity was genuinely some of the most fun I’ve ever had.",2년 전,3,

@g54b95,"Once, many years ago, I found myself with about three days off, and I did an ounce of 'shrooms over my weekend.  Started with about 3g on Friday and just went nuts after that until there weren't anymore.  Watched some excellent movies (Blade Runner, 3 Rooms, Alien, etc.).  Two of the best were Baraka (a very expansive experience) and Das Boot (quite the opposite - WWII from the perspective of a German U boat crew).  THE BEST was Apocalypse Now, pretty much a mix of the two.  I also have Apocalypse Now on a double CD.  It's amazing to listen to the movie with the lights out.  Be in a good place, though.         Yeah.  Friends of mine have ended up in the fetal position in the corner listening to that while tripping.  Me, thankfully, I never forget I'm tripping and have never had a bad trip - only enduring others who have.  Other people I know - holy shit.  They think they're never coming back.  Haven't tripped in decades, but still value the experiences.",2년 전,0,

@davidherring5567,Psychedelic assisted psychotherapy is growing.  It’s proponents are saying it can change the brains neurology so that established neurology of depression or ptsd can shift and not  be established anymore.  When I tried psychedelic assisted psychotherapy I felt cured of depression and ptsd while under the drugs influence and for a short time afterwards.  Maybe  this approach of therapy could speed up a process of healing from early childhood trauma induced depression and complex ptsd while working with a skilled psychotherapist in regular psychotherapy. I thought I was seeing that psychedelic usage would possible short-circuit my continuing progress is psychotherapy so the risk seemed too high to continue with psychedelics.  I think they have a high risk of subtly leading a person into an entrapment of deep engrained delusion.,2년 전,0,

My journey began with  being an Admin in a mushroom group where we helped helped people identify edible mushrooms and so on ( nothing psychedelic or so ) so one thing led to an other i started to read more and more and got more interested in mushrooms and what it can do for the world and so on so it lead me to psilocybin and after years of reading and gathering information i finally took it small doses in controlled environment and it has had amazing effects on my and i have discovered more about my self and the mind it self.    It has even helped me to get over my alcohol addiction. And it has given me new perspective in life.   And every now and then i take a dose or so to explore more about my mind.

The awakening they've experienced is pretty basic in the first place. It is pretty known that while you are high you feel like every thought is a significant one it's just your brain chemistry. Long term usage shouldn't even be in question for its harms but I believe no one needs to experience it not even once for its ""good"" feelings.

@OOBEJuanKenobi,"Reality is this: telepathy (love) VS authoritarianism (fear). Focus on telepathy (love) at all times. This is anti-authoritarianism. Authoritarianism is both selfishness and lying (head games). Love is both honesty and respect (telepathy). An individual can only chose telepathy or authoritarianism. All of the authoritarians (conservatives, Christians, violent men, support for violence) are cowardly, so they look for an IMAGE of strength (bullying). REAL strength is fearlessness over telepathy. Image conscious individuals stay with authoritarianism because they are too afraid to do the right thing socially, and / or stick up for people doing the right thing socially. All strong individuals are both independent and focused on telepathy. Weaker minds group together, share fear, and bash stronger individuals socially. No one is really an introvert or an extrovert. Independent minds (those that express honesty at all times in all ways) appear introverted. They avoid conflict and drama socially. They reject fear shared by others. Conformist minds (those that lie socially to fit in and judge kindness and honesty in others) group together and share fear for an IMAGE of social strength mentally as individuals. Some people think thoughts of love, stay independent, and watch others socially. Others think thoughts of fear, let their minds race, and group together because they are afraid of being attacked socially. These individuals attack others for social independence (those that express more honesty - which is NO SUPPORT for human violence). This is exactly what is happening in society. CONFORMITY is the refusal to grow psychic out of fear, which drives the mind angry (mentally ill).  When men give attention to those that they know are nothing like them in the mind, and the other person is avoidant, they are sharing jealousy, lying, and resentment. They want others to feel unfriendly while they smile. The idea will never work. They act this way so that other people will judge them socially so they can get “power”, which isn’t real at all. When people lie about what they are on the inside and focus on acting skills and head games, it creates anger (judgement) in others. It gives some personalities a false sense of “power”. When people share the same ideas mentally, and they are kind, then smiling (joy) is authentic. Everything else is forced acting, which is awkward, stressful, and strange. Love (honesty and respect) is the only TRUE version of reality. Love is telepathy.",2년 전,0,

Micro dosing is a mood elevator, creativity enhancer and produces little to none hallucinations.  While the heroic dose, (5-7grams), is supposed to break through, disconnecting you from reality, and cause ego death, introspection, and dissolve the stress and bad negative habits and thoughts we learn as we go.    That being said, Mushrooms are not a pharmaceutical drug with a consistent dose.  It varies from plant to plant, in the species.  Its possible to take the proper dose and under dose.  However, some researchers use Psilocyben molecules, which are an exact controlled dose.  If you do have a need for further therapy in the future, dont take it off the table :)  Best luck",1년 전,0,

@icecube8496,Really curious,2년 전,1,
@barabbason," @icecube8496    I really hope you read this, because I really do care about you - even though I don’t know you. I may say things you think you’ve heard before, but read to the end - because this is much deeper than becoming “enlightened” or discovering truths about reality…  I was chasing after Glory, through my extensive use of hallucinogens. I wanted to know the core of reality. However, like I said, no matter what combination I used, no matter how hard I tripped and no matter how many Ego Deaths I had or grand experiences, I never reached where I actually was trying to get to. I was on a spiritual treadmill, trying to go deeper and never getting where I wanted - sometimes with grave consequences (like diving headfirst out of a moving vehicle on 24 grams of shrooms because I listened to entities which told me to sacrifice myself to save everyone…. that’s a longer story)….  My life has been radically transformed and I have found deeper, lasting satisfaction, peace, joy, and EVERYTHING I was looking for in hallucinogens (but not getting a hold of) - However, it wasn’t my intellect or power, or intentionality that transformed me. I didn’t do it - I just stopped running away… What I discovered was that the Source, God, the Creator of All, did not expect me or want me to try to manifest spiritual realities in the physical, by my own will through ingesting substances. He wanted to have a personal relationship with me, and I didn’t need to chase wind to get it… He offered a way and He made himself known, when I sought Him with my whole heart desperately - not trying to do it my own way… but through submitting to HIS way….   I was 18 when God made himself known to me and opened my eyes. He gave me a new heart and mind; true ego death - and I was born again - not through my own effort (with drugs or substances) but by HIS spirit and will, My only participation was HUMILITY and FAITH.  I was on the edge of suicide, going through withdrawals (for bath salts) and ready to die. I was desperate and so tired of trying my own way…. when I was calling out to God, telling him I was ready to die and couldn’t do it anymore - I remembered something my mom had said about Jesus and God’s unfailing power…. I had rejected Gods ways and chosen my own path, but in my desperation I leaned into the Creator who I rejected and it dawned on me that He HAD made a way for us to know Him, through the death and resurrection of Christ. He revealed himself to me and transformed my heart from the inside out. I realized I had never truly been alive, I was always “spiritually dead” and He gave me a new life. The blinders were removed.  I know you’ve heard about Jesus, but let me break it down simply: We ALL have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory - no human is perfect. We’ve all hated God and rebelled against our Creator, and we deserve the penalty for spiritual treason against God - which is death.. our physical death is the punishment for our sins. Our sin and rebellion has seperated us from a pure and holy and perfect God, who is beyond anything we can comprehend - and the debt we owed him for our treason is much too great for anyone to “pay back” through “good works” or “religious duties.”  No amount of human effort could reconcile or reunite us to God - but in his love and grace He made a way - He inserted himself into the reality he created, to live a perfect life and die a brutal death to take the judgement of our sins. He reunited Himself to us by making a way that we could be forgiven, by himself taking our punishment - which we can only have by BELIEVING he did it and turning to Him and away from our rebellion.    When we surrender and trust in Jesus’s work on the cross to restore us to God, He gives us a new spirit and we are born again - like I was, all alone in my parents basement, without any substances or moral “self righteousness.”  I knew I needed saving, I was desperate. Some people still rely on their “good works” which amount to nothing in God’s eyes… You cannot tell a judge the good things you did to avoid punishment for treason… So He made a way, in pure love and grace, sending himself in human form to die on the cross and bear our sins… You’ve heard it before, but I pray today that your eyes are opened and you recognize your separation and sin, and see that you deserve to pay the penalty, but rejoice in the good love of God that He made a way, by HIS work - not yours. He LOVEs you so much, and I pray that you come to know the depths of his love and personality. It is not about “religion.” It is about trusting in Jesus, who He is, what He did, and allowing Him to become Lord over your life. He will make you knew, and it is better than ANYTHING i’ve ever experienced… plus it lasts for Eternity… However it isn’t easy to be a Christian. People hate you for telling them they need to be saved. However, it’s worth it, because I have a real relationship with God.",2년 전,0,

@archiearjunawilding559,"As psilocybin mushrooms are capable of being harvested in nature, there is a major risk in misidentifying mushroom species and accidentally consuming poisonous, if not lethal varieties. This can be avoided by educating oneself in advance on how to properly identify the correct species of mushroom and the potential look-alike mushrooms found within one's local area. It is recommended to not learn to do this by oneself, but instead, have someone experienced in mushroom-picking as a mentor.",2년 전,0,

More than one year I'm trying to build my new career from scratch to have the opportunity feed my family. It's truly difficult especially when the war around is. A couple weeks ago I lost my power. I could not do anything just lie in the bed with regular panic attacks from time to time. My wife is a doctor and she said that this is how the depression is starting. We planned to get the psychiatrist consult, but... My good friend visited me with 2 gr. of magic mushrooms. And this is really a pure magic. Just one trip helped me to wipe all that bad things that triggered me all the time during the last year. I felt like after bath. I haven't been ready to this kind of effect and thought that it will be just like usual trip. But one day later when I realised that I feel absolutely better I started to research everything about the mushrooms. I found John Hopkins University researchments and analyse them together with my wife. That's why I text this message. If you are still sceptical about mushrooms and treat them like some kind of drugs, forget. This is pure medicine which can help you just after one taking. Just two grams saved my mental health. And protected my family and my child from always sad mood father. Now I'm living my happy life absolutely clear without any drugs or medicine. I enjoy every day. I understood how mush I really love my family and that they are the most important thing in my life. It's like all the noise went out from my head and I see what is the real reason of my life.

If you do large amount of DMT where you get launched into another reality for like 10 mins.....you see alternate dimensions and see what happens when you die potentially.   Even microdosing psilocybin has done amazing things for my anxiety and mood and depression.   The research shows that psychedelic treatment could hold the cure for alzhymers and other brain injuries.  Psychedelics are the only thing known that can create NEW neural pathways in adults.  Without them, it is a slow process to create new habits and learn new things.   That is why so many ailments can be cured with them.  Addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder, PTSD,  etc.  All these can be cured in just a few sessions because they create new pathways and re-wire the brain.  War vets that have had bad ptsd for years and years on a large host of pharmaceuticals can do a few mdma sessions with a counselor and be cured.... not better for a while, cured for the rest of their lives.  The same with ocd, turrets, and addiction.   12 step programs with an 80% fail/relapse rate.....do a week of psychedelic treaments and the addiction or alcoholism can be cured with about a 70% success rate.

Half way through this party I retreated from the group to my room where I laid in complete darkness with my headphones on listening to Pendulum, a British drum and Bass group, which for me was just not in my usual repertoire for music.  I had the most wonderful experience and the next day I woke up like I was brand new. I wasn't 100% cured for certain, but this was the catalyst for my healing journey.  All my friends and family instantly recognised a complete personality change.  I explained why and some were resistant to the concept, others just accepted.  Over the next year I experimented more and found I was able to work through each of my issues with the help of mushrooms.  its now been over 12 years since that night and I still explore my mind when the opportunity presents its self.

I remember seeing the so many patterns in the ceeling and in the walls, sometimes i would feel i was trapped in between the patterned walls and ceelings, it was to crazy because i thought i couldnt breathe, i am so amazed of how are mind can trick on us so bad. So after all the hallucinations, they were able to give me 5 bags of serum, and little by little i started to see how the effects were fading away. The ceeling and walls went back to normal, the hallucinations went away really slow, and in the end i was completely concioud again. Oh i remember, before going to the ER i was so freaked out, that i heard from somebody that smoking weed, will lowet the trip, it took me like 30 minutes to roll a joint, like 2 minutes to light it up, when it was already on, i would smoke and i didn't felt the smoke going in, i couldnt even feel the joint in my fingers or in my mouth, it was such a strange sensation, it was difficult for me everything that was happening, thats is when i started freaking out and my next plan was to go to the ER, it took me forever to put on some clothes, the hardest part was tying my shoes, because i thought my shoes were plant roots and my shor laces felts like worms or snakes, it took me forever doing this simple task.

@kindnuguz,"I miss the LSD of the 90's   Now if you want to hike \ adventure for hours while putting your mind back into pieces as you come down LSD is the thing.  Best to do it alone. Outside influence can trigger bad trips. It will control your mind and best to let it happen and not fight it.  If you want to let your mind wander while sitting down and feel the earths rotation (best in front of huge speakers blasting bass) MDMA is the thing. Best with others around. This is more a social psychoactive because when alone it doesn't feel right.  Another thing is.. I never felt like it fully kicked in with any of these until at minimum one puff of marijuana. Mushrooms always gave me this dark vibe and I never fell into the psychoactive state which LSD and MDMA would achieve.   But again; if I didn't puff on marijuana it didn't feel right.. As soon as I puffed I would be like ""ok now I'm where I should be""  I can say well over 500-600+ times with LSD and around 300ish times with MDMA and maybe 20-40 times with Mushrooms.

@stefanschleps8758,"Psychedelic expert here. I've taken psychedelics hundreds of times. Here is some advice. Give yourself one or two years to prepare. Take your time. Make the first time special. But don't think about it too much. Purify your set. Practice Yama and Niyama. Practice Dharana and Dhyana. Study and practice the eight limbs of yoga. Try not to get too caught up in either Hatha yoga or Raja yoga. What is Bhakti yoga? Ask yourself this question. All our feelings of guilt or prestige all the hoops society pushes us through, are all about feelings. Find ""the Beloved"".  Open your heart. Find a beautiful setting wherein you are at peace. Take the journey with a friend, at least someone who is willing to be with you until you come down and fall asleep, and who will also be there for you the following day. Forgive everyone for everything. With sufficient preparation psychedelics reveal the ""wish-fulfilling gem"". This is a non-religious spiritual journey. Be Here Now. I Love You. Yes, you are right. Use these simple mantras, they bring peace. Heroic dose? For LSD? 400 micrograms. For Psilocybin? Two grams. These are the only two sacraments I would recommend for the novice. Know yourself well first, and then be prepared to let go of all you know. Behind what you think you are, is the truth of what you are. Good luck. All the best to you.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@PoppaBadger,"The amazing things that one can learn, and experience on certain psychedelics are quite intense and can change your life. Everyone talks about mushrooms,  but I believe peyote could bring us to new ideas about life and love. Moreover, they can bring a wealth of knowledge, that we might not get from everyday life. I've had the pleasure of doing a decent amount of peyote. I saw people, things, and had thoughts that I would have never had, had I not tried peyote. But a ""trip buddy"" is necessary with peyote, as I was literally speaking to people and interacting with things that weren't actually there. Wow.😮 Hallucinations, but in the truest sense. I think I entered a different realm for a while and it was a very REAL experience. Maybe these beings (people) I was talking to, weren't just simple hallucinations but true beings. I saw at least four types of beings that weren't human BUT they were intelligent and very real to me, especially at the time. Hallucinogens can help us, as a society but we must learn to use them properly and with care. I now understand what the great Jim Morrison meant when he said, ""the doors of perception"" and I believe that hallucinogens can open these doors and teach us age old things that we would not learn from our world, being in the state it is. Would I suggest hallucinogens? Absolutely! BUT only for health and spiritual purposes and with someone who can help to keep us on track and learning, as opposed to having the worst time in our lives.

@PoppaBadger," gunne jay  I am truly happy for you. I have seen and heard of many who have benefited, even only using the micro dosing technique. The most important thing, and I think this is what many tend to forget, especially while on a trip, is that we still must take care of our physical selves. Meaning, while tripping, we must drink water, as to stay hydrated and eat nuts, berries and thongs from our earth that are beneficial for everyday health. When you take care of your physical well-being, your experience can only be of an improved experience. Many people forget to take care of their body while tripping, which can hinder the process, making it less palatable for many. This is where a KNOWLEDGEABLE ""trip buddy"" can be of most importance. Only if the body is taken care of properly, can we enter a worry free, and much more comfortable AND comforting experience. So always try to remember to take care of you body and your mind will thank you by allowing deeper meaning to the experience. I've tried most, aside from iboga, and have always felt best, before, during and after, when taking care of my physical self as well. Love well, love life and experience what nature gas provided, but safely and always in moderation. I'm glad your experience benefited you. All the best and just be aware if both your mind and your body, as they work together in a very symbiotic manner.  Eat and hydrate, and you will feel much better from the before, to the after. God Bless and be safe. If we weren't meant to use these fungi and plants, then they probably wouldn't exist. All the best!!!🙂👍🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",2년 전,0,

Long story short, I had a bad trip. For months, if not a year after. I thought my parents were trying to poison me, I thought people could read my mind, I was scared to go to sleep. It really messed me up. I would like to do ibogaine to see if it helps with my addictions. But because of that trip and what it did to me I'm a little freaked out by psychedelics.",2년 전,0,

@HalfNekoJames,"back when i ""tripped"" regularly primarily for self development as well as for spiritual work, I had one night where i dosed out a quarter of mushrooms and 15 tabs of LSD of varying recipes and dosage, i had estimated it close to 2k ug of LSD and a quarter Ounce of mushrooms (B plus )  it was the most amazing night ever.   unfortunately something happened that night that caused me to steadily stop.   Since then I have been removing the wall that went up just so i can return to my development.   I was just all in all happier, more easily and readily able to deal with the world and the problems it presented and solve the problems i was plagued with.   Prior i struggled just to get every day tasks done but with this, I was able to put my mind on a hyper focus.  I lost weight safely, and properly dropped 100  lbs from my overweight status and im now at a healthy weight and maintained it, I was a better and WAY more open person, nothing really bothered me any more.  Especially if it did not effect me.   Directly or indirectly i was okay with whatever happened, even when bad things happened i shrugged my shoulders and continued on with my day,  These days i struggle a little bit but i am finally getting back to where i can safely say, im ready again and will return to a status where whether im sober or under the influence that i can be happy.     some may consider this rose colored glasses but when you deal with some of the stuff we deal with in society today and take those things overly personal it makes that stuff worse.   Honestly i wish the entire world would ""trip"" because we all need to learn to just let go and stop to look at ourselves and where we are.      That has been a difficult accomplishment and it is sooooo very worth it.     I am so glad the world is changing for the better and finally putting the appropriate effort into these things and not just simply labeling them as dangerous and not good for you or coming up with other lies to scare people away from improving their lives.    AA use to treat members with MDMA to help fix their addictions and had huge success until the government and religion kicked in and destroyed it and turned it into more of a cult for a religion indoctrination.  So to see the world changing and being more accepting puts my heart in a state of joy.

She had died in a wheelchair in front of me and handed it down to me , They of course wanted control of this and these naval families began the process of human traffic may and use the mob in america to do it , My permission was used to steal billions , And to kill millions , I was seventeen years old When I was drugged with a Massive dose of p c p , They put it in my soda pop in a pizza parlor August seventeenth nineteen eighty nine , While there was a solar eclipse , In babylon they wold  conduct human sacrifices by the eclipses , Someone walked up behind me and shot me on the head with a twenty two short through the back of my head They missed the base the brainstem and the bullet landed in my mouth , The pcp kept me from going into shock But also caused me to fall unconscious to the ground Then they Video  taped it and someone sodomized my body , My mother is lower class protestant and my grandmother is egyptian And  Maltese , They were able to play upon divisionarism and strife Too manipulate my own family who I'd never met into doing this , They literally had a party raping and murdering me , I was put into a bathtub full of ice water by three doctors who came to my head and my house as I was bleeding to death , I was clinically dead for over 2 Hours , Not before I got up off the ground and hit one of them so hard.

Lots of crazy things were happening in the late ‘60s - ‘70s, and being born in ‘61, gave me a 1st hand account to so many 🤯 times. Most of our friend’s parents were divorcing in ‘74-‘78. There were a lot of us caught in the middle of crap that tore us all apart. We were becoming of age, turning 16, and getting our drivers license. Vietnam had just ended, white guys were getting perms in their hair, we had all the new music scenes; the ‘70s were the times of Sex, Drugs, and Rock n Roll! My 1st time dropping Acid in ‘78 was like someone opened up these doors to new worlds. I mostly used LSD, but we tried 🍄 a few times in there. Once I started college in ‘79, it was strictly 🍄, and Heroic Doses! This is what enabled me to really analyze my whole being and existence. I was able to find the answers to my questions.

I’m one of those who’ve been to the outer edges of out Universe, traveled hand-in-hand with God, learned to bend time and space, and travel faster than the speed of light. I was a true Psychonaut. I also discovered our Darkest places too. The Dark is where Pure Evil lies. The darkness is so opaque that it reflects Light - a truly terrifying experience. These Heroic Doses will take you to where you need to go, and see what you need to see. TRUST, allow yourself to be totally receptive and don’t fight with it.

@DrexSux,"I had a friend who did too many shrooms and came out schizophrenic. I haven't seen him in years, he's been in his parent's basement since the incident and rarely ever comes out. Not to mention, anyone who takes shrooms seems to permanently lose  a significant amount of their cognitive ability and find extremely shallow philosophical ideologies to be incredibly deep... giving mystical properties to normal things. I've done a lot of psychedelics and I'm just grateful it didn't completely reshape who I am. I have really bad anxiety and moments of severe confusion and disorientation occasionally, symptoms I didn't have before my encounters with LSD and psilocybin.  I wouldn't be disparaging towards the drug if it didn't have real consequences. People can say ""Yeah it might be because your friend was Schizo before and the psychedelics made him worse..."" ok... so if that's the case then don't preach like this is some sort of miracle enlightenment drug. You'll inadvertently destroy other people's lives by spreading that sort of misinformation.   TLDR: Always proceed with caution when trying any sort of drug. Psychedelics are one of the most dangerous, they can permanently reshape your reality to make it something happy and cheerful and full of candy (for neurotypicals) or it can make it a demented, anxiety-ridden, depressive and destructive nightmare (if you have mental health conditions, like 95% of people do)",2년 전,11,

Also all of us at one point or another went all the way into the delerious state where one friend was having a conversation with a giveway sign for 30 mins and thought it was our friend anna and myself i had an experiance where i thought i was at home and when i opend draws and none of my clothes were there i freaked out and started throwing draws around the room till someone managed to get me to relise i was not at home and had not been for days so all in all a very odd experiance and i know its on a whole differnt level to mushrooms so i wondered what others thoughts on it are.,2년 전(수정됨),1,

I experienced a strong period of nausea to which I looked for comfort down stairs, then back upstairs on the couch. I had cold sweats for a bit but I fought through it until I was suddenly thrust into extreme comfort on cloud 9, instantly. I was suddenly viewing the open living room of my friends place and it was floating in black space. At one point I went to the balcony and gazed upon the moon and could feel how my consideration towards ideas in how we exist in space was open and understanding at the most profound levels. I could tell we exist in an open space, no borders, anything could traverse here, that was slightly unsettling to fully consider.   Later, I was looking at a picture on the wall and somehow, I could see the picture and an evolving fractal edge of which I related to the train of cellular reproduction on earth. At least that is what my head told me or how I interpreted it. Following the fractal bit I came to a point where I could see myself from a distance like standing somewhere or leaning on a wall, but I could see what I looked like without having the ego of oneself. I could also notice how it creates an effect in your vision like looking at a 3D movie without the glasses on. At the peak I experienced conscious time dilation where you seemingly know time should be passing soon, but you know not when that moment might come, nor do you know how much time has elapsed so you don't know when the next minute will turn. It is the strangest sensation because just prior you knew roughly how much time has passed.

@mSingh-fh6fz,"While psychedelic research isn’t new, it has made significant progress in the last decade. Political rhetoric has made the subject highly controversial and has hindered science for years, but the opinions of medical practitioners have also created obstacles to patient treatment. I understand the hesitancy some doctors may have regarding illicit drugs, but “drugs” are just medications that have been deemed hazardous and habit-forming. However, that does not preclude these chemicals from providing significant relief to patients who have failed other pharmaceutical options. I believe it is a violation of medical ethics not to keep an open mind regarding patient therapy and not to support a patient’s “right to try”. The ethical pillars of medicine are beneficence, justice, non-maleficence, and autonomy. In my opinion, the obstacles thrown up by some medical professionals regarding alternate pharmaceutical therapies violate beneficence and autonomy. Autonomy is the patient’s right to make decisions regarding their own body and destiny. Beneficence is the obligation a medical practitioner has to make decisions that are best for the patient’s health and safety. I can understand that some doctors may consider encouraging or signing off on referrals for psychedelic therapy is a violation of beneficence, but I argue that when a patient has no more officially FDA-approved options left, it is in a patient’s best interest to explore any other options.",2년 전,0,

So maybe just stay solo?  That being said, sometimes I've found I can punch through the anxiety, I just had to really commit.    For example, I was tripping with a group and watching a movie (the very trippy 2008 Speed Racer, specifically) and my peripheral was playing tricks on me.  I kept thinking the person to my right or left was staring directly at me for no reason.  I internalized how awkward it would be if I checked and found out I was right.  What would I say?  What am I SUPPOSED to say?  I forced myself to check and of course, everyone was mesmerized by the movie and paying me no mind.

It seems to me like he’s a Dr. studying a substance he’s never experienced or experimented with on himself. You have to have empirical evidence to have a valid opinion on psychedelics. Plain and simple.  If you’re on the outside looking in, you will not understand what you are talking about and will rationalize the experiences and outcomes inaccurately. Like explaining how the pixels on a tv create the image you see without understanding that it’s the invisible signal that manifests the image and experience on the tv itself.  Psychedelics, put simply, boost your minds frequency so you can tap into more of reality. Your intention and state of mind matter because it isn’t simply a drug, you’re going to a real place, and dealing with real entities and forms of consciousness beyond our physical reality. That is why people have disparaging experiences with psychedelics. They are not a demand but an ask. They don’t work for you, they allow you if your heart is open and you want to know the truth.   Anything less than that and you will have experiences that won’t be the spiritual awakenings that many report to have. Including myself. They are not just drugs.",2년 전,0,

What psychedelics do is entirely, 100% explainable through activity in our nervous system, including the brains etc.  That´s what is causing the experiences, the substance is influencing that system.

I´m for understanding ""the it and of"" better, we need to focus more on practical things. I´m not denying the benefits, the sense of presence, emotions etc. I´m stating that you also need to keep your head screwed in the way that it fits. And be aware of how psychedelics affect the processes of decision making, reasoning etc.  Remember : we live in a world where people want to make money, use social power etc. One mistake can have serious outcomes years later and if you´re financially well off and secure, it´s a totally different scenario. Do you have any idea how many people are hustled while under the influence of something, anything? On a daily basis?  Your emotions will fool you, if you´re being fooled. And your reasoning, the intuition you have about people is what, at least to some degree, guards over that. You need to stay sharp, that´s what you need to do.

There may be methods to expedite the process (by varying degrees of success), but they do not exist without unique, often quite undesirable side-effects.   ""Buy the ticket, take the ride""  There is no turning back.   That being said, psychs did save my life in many ways. Encouraged me to finally move out of my parents house, move to a new city and go to college. Instilled a spiritual belief in me, when I had been an agnostic atheist my entire life.  That being said, I do often wish that I had remained ignorant and afraid of death. I'm not sure that I would have shed the level of depression that I was drowning in, had I not taken psychs, but there is certainly something to be said for a healthy level of fear of death fueling your desire to really make the most of this life.

These substances can simply open their minds up out of that linear path, and get remarkably more joy and happiness than if they were to just stick to one way, and sometimes that alone can be refreshing for people. No hate to you, but just saying sometimes people may never be able experience something besides these black and white loops of daily life, for you it may be religion, for some it may be mindfulness, arts, and for some it may be psychedelics. Readiness and determining whether a path should ""objectively"" be opened is completely subjective and down to the individual, and for all the times you stick to this part of your lifestyle, which clearly works well for you and that's awesome, I think you should also appreciate the other paths people may decide to take.",3개월 전,0,

Also, the trials and experiments of Magic Mushrooms are really NOT about the entire ""experience"" but only a very limited aspect. Limiting the focus to just ONE chemical-psilocybin- and possibly synthetic- negates the natural synergistic effects of the entire chemical matrix of the mushroom. There is a major difference between ingesting just ""one"" chemical compared to the entire plant/fruit. When you use the Plant Teachers in their natural form/state you can connect with their ""essence"" which act as guides-like the reporting of ""Mother Ayahuasca"".

@1hitwoon99,"It is crucial to understand the risks associated with consuming large quantities of wood lovers mushrooms. Ingesting 10 grams or more of dried mushrooms can result in a condition known as respiratory paralysis, which can lead to cardiac arrest and ultimately, death. As someone who has experienced this firsthand, I urge everyone to exercise caution when consuming these mushrooms.  I must take responsibility for my own recklessness in consuming high doses of these mushrooms over a period of 2-3 months, despite being a healthy middle-aged man with over 20 years of experience. However, it is important to note that these mushrooms can be deadly, and I am living proof of that.  Despite the risks, I still hold these mushrooms in high regard as a religious experience. But it is essential to understand the dangers involved and to proceed with caution. For those who may be skeptical of my warning, I challenge you to try consuming high doses of these mushrooms for yourself and experience the terrifying sensation of not being able to breathe.  I am frustrated that some individuals are not taking these warnings seriously. I apologize if I am coming across as angry, but I believe it is necessary to emphasize the severity of the situation.

Basically, I took about 3.5 grams of some of the strongest mushrooms I've ever done and I went to go to the bathroom and shut off the light to trip in the darkness, with all the patterns and colours, I couldn't find the light after. I ended up falling in the tub and just kinda laying there. I remember feeling like there was an omnipotent presence with me that was showing me the secrets of the universe. I remember wanting the shapes and patterns to stop because I could feel the anxiety building. Eventually, I realized if this is some sort of extradimensional being, I can't just say ""stop"" in English and hope they'll understand. So I went from saying stop in French and Spanish to just making noises, hoping that the configuration of sounds would end up as me saying ""stop"" in whatever language they speak. I remember I felt a connection to every single religion and language that I've never felt before. I remember feeling like I could understand the way our 3d universe is woven through a 4d spacetime, and I was looking in on it through an outside view, as if I was in the 5th dimension.

@aaronmicalowe,"Lol, I had a similar experience after accidently taking a whole months supply of LSD because I thought it was dud. Ended up taking 1400ug or 14 tabs. Had only done one trip before of 100ug. I had got on a motorbike and was travelling through Kampala, Uganda, not a good place to lose grip, when the trip started and I realised what I'd done. It took me 20 minutes to get home but that felt like 8 years. I didn't sleep for 3 days and couldn't get my full memories back for 3 weeks then even after 2 months didn't quite feel normal. It has made some permanent changes. Like you I was looking down on 3D reality from the 5th dimension and I could see echoes of all events going back 60,000 years in the past. Everything was written in mathematical formula and archaic Egyptian runes, like my brain was a simulation and not human. I completely lost the ability to do anything for a while. When my phone went off I didn't know how to answer it, because I was trying to reach it from 60,000 years in the past. 🤦‍♂😂 And the other weird thing was I could understand and speak languages of the people around me that I have no clue about to this day. There was a madman on the street that nobody understood but I saw him wearing a traffic warden uniform and understood that he still thought he was directing traffic. I asked him if he was ok and he said he was fine. He had no idea that he was mad, still stuck in his world. To everyone else he looked like a mad man wandering the streets wearing ragged clothes waving his hands at cars on the road. Afterwards I asked people what I had said to him and they said, you spoke the same language he did. We have no idea what you said but he seemed to understand you. It was very weird to them - they had no explanation for what they saw, and they were 100% sober. 😂",2년 전,0,

Therapy can only raise quality as much as the structures that the therapist bases their life on allow. And this can become a control-and-deception scheme when for example a therapy success is actually merely an integrating of the patient into the managed misery of the status quo, basically accepting to play the competitive-destructive game from a motivatingly advantaged position. In such a scenario you have to expect that those 'therapy successes' create more and deeper suffering in others. We should be aware by now how vastly such deception schemes are are play in society.

@neoshenlong,"One of my most important take aways from my first lsd trip (I'd done shrooms before) was that, if this was a state of mind where I could be under the influence of this drug, it had to be accessible to me during my regular sober life, too. It specially came to me when I realized that fear and anxiety have similar effects to what psychedelics do: they make you introspective, they make you focus on yourself, and suddenly your mind is having a bunch of crazy thoughts that come out of nowhere and you imagine countless situations where the worst could happen. And it's like... that's tied to creativity in a way. Close your eyes and try to walk through a room you already know. Even if you know that room perfectly, closing your eyes will trigger fear and suddenly you imagine a bunch of stuff that isn't really there in that room. It's... creating. And I think the state induced by psychedelics, creativity and fear itself are all related through that simple fact of letting the mind go to places that ""make no sense"". It's a matter of the path it takes (which is also why bad trips exist, and they have similar effects to what panic and anxiety do to you but amplified).   So, I realized, if my sober mind can trigger all of that ""creativity"" while experiencing anxiety, I should be able to refocus that energy to trigger it in other areas of my life. Trying to make art, thinking about the big picture, understanding different perspectives, seeing new things where I was always seeing the same. I think the end goal of psychedelics used in a therapeutic or artistic way should be to reach that state without the use of the drug itself, and I think it is 100% possible, or at least that trying to get there is one of the healthiest things we could do after experiencing an eye opening possitive experience with drugs.",2년 전,384,

@Roscapeaux,"This is an interesting view! I had similar experiences, YEARS ago like WAY before the whole thing legally expired...  Anyway, I noticed that I couldn´t get out of the loop of fear and panic but that was actually due to the circumstances. I was homeless and broke, also in a city with extremely conservative values and zero-tolerance policy, so it was not the best of places to be in. And I did notice that I´d get these very, very abstract thoughts from heightened fear, and that made me find creative ways to make myself feel safe. Now, if you take things like religion and symbols, you get in to the space of fear and safety on a whole different level. This is such a huge topic.  What was interesting that the only solid way I could think of to get out of that situation was to go and study physics and engineering. Like, you literally feel a lot more safe if you know precisely how EM radiation works, how the human nervous system works etc. and I´m thinking that both art and science probably have their origins in things like fear and beliefs. Only science offers something that actually works against thunderbolts and lightning. It´s called a faraday cage. It´s really interesting. So all things considered, fear lead to the need of safety, which lead to science, which lead to research and that lead to engineering. So next time you see someone with a tin-foil hat... seriously, it´s not going to work like that. What you NEED is a tin-foil overall, like you literally have to cover your entire body and especially they eyes. The least protective part of your body in terms of radiation is where there´s no skin or the skin is very thin. Such as the eyes.  So, if you happen to experience a shitload of fear and anxiety under extreme amounts of psilocybin or LSD, BE SURE to wrap yourself like a tortilla in tin foil but : YOU GOTTA PUT ON THE GOGGLES FIRST!!!!!",2년 전,5,

Though it did make me chuckle a bit when you referred to walking into a dark room that you know well in the light. You see, I went blind about 10 years ago. I did not have psychedelics to Aid me on my journey. I had to manually train my mind to understand there is no monster in the darkroom. There is only the monsters in the mind. I eventually discovered I could refocus the energy that was producing the monster into understanding that there is only the room. And my mind was my greatest asset. I have long since come to terms with my blindness, and am now using psychedelics to enhance my mind even further. It is so comforting to know there are many great leaders ahead of me who have forged this bath and shown the way.",2년 전,11,

@avery4234,"my largest dose of a psych was boofing 80 mg of 4-ho met ( psilocin analogue-- 4 hydroxy methylethyltryptamine) in total of the trip I boofed another 60 mg when i made it past the peak. A heavy/heroic dose is 45 mg.    boofing it led to me having my visuals flooded with fractals within a minute. I couldn't see in front of me anymore and sat down as all i could see was colors and geometric shapes. i felt the carpet and laid down. within 5 minutes i was shot into the same breakthhroughs dmt provides-- Except i was catatonic for 2 hours, then came out of it still tripping but dimmed down. I had been through an intricate tunnel very similar to my dmt trips, and at the end was a womanly-buddha figure that emitted light that felt so beautiful. I felt love all over me and was mind blown as i came out of it. I boofed another 50 mg and went straight into the tunnel again to be greeted by the same entity. It was the most beautiful trip of my life. I had also done ketamine and mdma to use as therapy on myself soon after. The combination of each allowed me to break a horrible opioid addiction, get out of an abusive relationship, and ended up with an incredible job.

@MrKevinStraub,"In my youth, about 14 years old, maybe 15, I had gone on occasion with my pals in the Chilliwack area of the Fraser Valley in B. C. CA, to pick psilocybes and ingest them, too. After many such times, I had a tremendous experience. I took a large dose of fresh fruits. I think it was maybe 8 or 10. We were all together at Lee's place, high school buddy. He was a drummer and other young musicians and friends were there in his basement, getting ready to have some musical fun. Not all of us had imbibed. About 40 minutes in, I was feeling first waves and they were strong. I started getting very concerned and feeling claustrophobic in Lee's dark basement so I excused myself, went out across the road and sat down on a grassy riverbank about 40 feet from a very large weeping willow. It was a clear, sunny day, warm.   It was definite. I had taken too much. I started to panic, knowing I had a few unpredictable hours ahead of me. I started to pray to the living Creator God, who hears us. I begged Him to take this away from me. As I was going on about it, I suddenly noticed that I was clear. The psilocybe effect was completely neutralized. At that instant I realized that I was heard by the Master. Personally. Awestruck at that understanding, I started to give profuse thanks. I raised my head and a downdraft swirled through that willow tree and then I felt it touch me. My eyes turned to the sun, drawn like a moth to the fire. I found that I could look directly into it and not only did it have no pain at all, nor cause the normal squinting reflex, it was something to go into, to drink up, to desire more of. Knowing that this Supreme Being had opened me up to withstand this glory, I wondered what it meant. It was then that I heard His voice, but not audibly. It said, ""This is what it is like to come into my presence. You cannot withstand it unless I prepare you. You are experiencing a small taste of Me."" That little draft of His perceptible presence was a combination of those things we call ""love,"" ""joy,"" and ""peace."" He is the source of those things and it doesn't come any other way. His name is also the Truth. The Way. And The Life. As I basked in both the warm sunlight and the intense pleasure of His revelation, I did not want to leave. It was something I wanted to go more into, but the presence faded.  Stable and sober, I climbed up the grassy bank, back over to Lee's house and downstairs into the big common room. All eyes turned to me, as they stopped playing. Lee asked me what happened. I just mumbled something about needing to get out for a bit. Then he said, ""You're glowing."" I didn't think much of it, replying only, ""Yeah, the sun and breeze are super,"" or something like that, just thinking they were noting a ruddy, sun-kissed complexion.  Years later, I was talking to another of those friends that was there that day. The comment about the glowing skin came up, and Blair explained it to me: ""No, dude, you were truly glowing, emanating visible light from around your head."" I was stunned. There is a story about an encounter with the same God as was experienced by a certain leader named Moses. God stuck Him in a fissure in the rock, face in, and just blasted by him quickly so that Moses would have minimal exposure, only to his back side. As God passed by, He declared His character as being ""merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth."" When Moses went back down the mountain to the people, they asked him to cover his head. He was too bright. He got a much bigger dose than I did. Of God, not psilocybe!  There was no ongoing effect of the psilocybe. It's effect was upon me only about 15 minutes or so and the entire experience over in maybe 30-40 minutes. But it was life altering. I know there is a real God who lives and hears.",2년 전,0,

@gweedohatsis8404,"I want to start with a disclaimer: I was MIS-diagnosed medication. I am no way advocating for you to go off your meds because of what you read below. If I'd tried to quit my meds without seeking outside help, things could have ended up a lot worse (read dirt nap, psychosis etc) than the state I'm currently in. A lot of people who also have the correct diagnosis will benefit on anti depressants whereas, because of my unique physiology, I suffer. This is my personal tale.    I'm currently withdrawing from anti depressants that were mis prescribed to me because of a lack of care in the public health system in my country. I was on these goddam things for 6 years at way too high a dosage and barely any oversight, I hadn't really been diagnosed with anything, the doctor just gave me pills to get me out of his office so he could push through to his next patient.  I didn't even go into the GP looking to get on drugs, I just wanted a mental health plan and to see if I could get someone to talk to about my problems. Being an experienced psychonaut going onto anti-depressants I thought ""no problem, no drug has taken over or ruined my life, I took them before, had a bit of a giggle, had a couple days down and then went on as a productive citizen. If he's just giving me a scrip after a 10 minute chat these things must be soft."" I was so wrong, the pills I was on cost me my marriage, my family, my career, my house and very close to my sanity.   The first 2 weeks of the withdrawals was 2 of the worst weeks of my life. I experienced paralyzing amounts of vertigo, nausea and tremors where I was bed bound for a week, I'm still having auditory hallucinations, shadow people in my peripheral vision, sleep depravation, extreme mood swings, paranoia, rediscovering that I have feelings, heart palpitations, loss of bowel control and a whole bunch of others. I am currently in week 3 of 6 of my withdrawals and I still have all of these withdrawal effects to lessening degrees, some even decide to come back at me full force when the sun goes down, but its's lessening over time.  While I was on the medication if I missed my regime by about 1 hour, I would get the beginning of these withdrawal effects, debilitating me until I could get one of the pills into my system.  The drug itself just cut off my ability to have emotions. It killed all my drives and cost me just about everything in my life.  Also, the medication made my eyes absolutely ache and made me tired all the time. It literally felt like my eyes had been sandpapered, some days I didn't  want to get out of bed because it meant having to open my desert dry eyes. It's one of the reasons why I decided to get off these meds, I just couldn't stand it anymore.   The side effects were understated, the withdrawal effects were barely explained and thank god I want to a competent Dr who's been guiding me on getting off these cursed things because one of the withdrawal effects is psychosis where any of the withdrawal effects can stick for life, that combined with the paranoia means you really have to have someone with a good enough bedside manner who knows what they are talking about and can reassure you in the correct way that this probably won't be the case.    I have had psychedelics before, and let me tell you, the withdrawal side effects from a big trip or a taking too much x are NOTHING compared to what I'm going through. I've heard quitting heroin is hard, the mountain comes the first few days, then you have a week of being debilitated, then it lessens where there's just a longing for the drug left. I would trade that for how I feel right now at almost into week 4 of this ""experience."" It's been a nightmare from physiology all the way down to introspection and it doesn't relent. The sun's gone down and the shakes are starting again.   Like, modern chemists and psyches KNOW that these side effects and withdrawal effects can be this bad. They know that this stuff absolutely has the potential to mess up lives and kill and it is handed out like candy.    On the flip side psychedelics that have been demonized for political and racist reasons, that our entire society has had it's collective mind poisoned against has side effects so mild, so well known through popular culture for thousands of years that EVEN if all they did was a placebo effect of making your life a bit more pleasant  by killing a few brain cells and make you giggle a bit, are the vastly superior option.  I'm in no way addicted to the anti depressants, the sooner this crap is out of my system the better and I never want to touch a drug that does this to me ever again. But the physiological reaction to them is insane. I've read stories of people choosing to go back on them once they tried to quit because quitting is too hard. I can understand that mentality.   It's funny looking at the footage of hippies facing off against national guard in a protest. It feels like the psychedelics are the hippies, nice, serene, chill out and enjoy life philosophy, which seems helpful and the type of help I needed when I got on the antiD's 6 years ago,  whereas these anti depressants are like the national guard, stomping on my serotonin receptors with their jack boots trying to make my brain conform until my mental processes resemble something like a normie's brain.   One of these things guides you to a better place, the other one blocks deviations with no regard for the havok that they cause to the wellbeing of those around them.   When getting off of a hit of shrooms, you feel fuzzy for 2 days and then maybe a week of not peak performance, nothing that can't be sorted with a nice cup'o'tea and taking it slow with a blanket on the couch. I imagine 6 years of microdosing would probably feel strange if you chose to quit, but not anything like I feel now.

@kriterer,"The biggest single instant of self-understanding I've ever had was when I was wandering a Western Mass town at 3-7 am, on 3-5 drops of liquid acid with a friend. We had been walking for hours already, looping around every road within a mile or so, when we came to a stretch bordering a field. This field wasn't very large, so we could see that there stood one van, alone, in the middle of the grass.   Suddenly, I hear a scream. A moment of panic. Maybe 5 seconds pass. Then I decide that I could never live with myself if I learned someone was hurt in there and I could have stopped it. I convince my friend to run over with me, and we find nothing. Hours later, I realize it had been at sunrise, next to a field in a rural area. Definitely a rooster.  Despite the ridiculousness of the story, I will always remember is that, as a stupid college kid on acid from a stranger, I cared for the health of someone I believed to be in danger above that of myself. Now that's become a standard I will hold myself up to no matter what. It's a promise to myself. I don't think I could make that promise without my experience with acid. The power of psychedelics can harm, too, but it's always important to remember that these drugs are a tool and can be used as positive influences in many people's lives.",2년 전,7,

I knew I had to get to my sister’s house and she would help me reconnect to the simulation. The whole time I was thinking I had broken my brain and I was never going to make it back. I got on my bike and rode all the way to my sister’s house, and the whole time I was thinking that she was just my link that would bring me back into the Simulation. I kept telling her “Bring me back.” Nothing was real. I had lost everything! I didn’t want to be outside of it, but I knew that life was just a force trying to continue and the mushrooms were our way back to the source. Sounds so cliche and stupid but I had lost my mind. Everything around me fell apart and  I felt like I couldn’t breathe and everything else was just fake.

Psychedelics overpower us and strong-arm it in that way.  Ya just kind of have to relinquish control.  The way out is through.  Buy the ticket, take the ride, and all of that.    Your story reminds me of a similar experience.  My girlfriend and I were tripping at a commune and got separated in the woods.  She had a lifelong fear of thunderstorms, and one started while I was trying to put together a search party to find her.  It took a long time because we couldn't hear her yelling over the thunder.  By the time we finally did, hours later, she was no longer afraid of thunderstorms, ever again.

@salt-emoji,A lot of the stigma surrounding psychedelics comes from the us government. They used lsd and pscilocybin to literally wipe people. You flood their brain with it and it destroys the seratonin uptake receptors and litterly emptys a person of themselves. The government was afraid the soviets would use them during the cold war. They lied about every aspect of them and fear mongered so they could influence into the public into illegalizing a bunch of drugs.,2년 전,0,

@PCP1992,"I took 13g of truffles the other day and I had such profound insights.  I saw that we are all lights of consciousness swimming around in the darkness, and that lights naturally are trying to connect with other lights, and that sometimes you're not meant to connect with certain lights but you are with others, and the ones you are meant to connect with shine brighter to you than others for whatever reason.  And whilst the lights exist in a non-material realm we are bound by the physical realm which puts boundaries and constraints in place when we want to connect with other lights. Our body and the laws of physics do limit us but our profound desire to connect with other lights of consciousness is not bounded by those laws, as it comes from a different place.  So when a guy goes and talks to a girl, it's actually just a light going and talking to another light to see if there's something there. If the intention is pure and honest and curious, at least...  I saw the impurity of manipulation when it comes to trying to connect with other lights. People just want to be loved, and some in their desperate attempts to connect end up using techniques to manipulate other lights into connecting with them, but it only leads to harm, and is impure. It made me feel disgusting to think about it.  And also sadly many lights are not shining so bright because they are walking around with a digital screen in front of their face all day. They are not aware or conscious of what they, and others, are.  I saw that many lights are looking for something to hold on to - many of them are looking for another light, a strong light, something solid to hold in the darkness. A rock, a pillar.  I saw that I can be that strong light for others. I can be that pillar of strength. Instead of spending my days desperately seeking that pillar of strength outside of myself, that other light, for me to hold on to, it's better for me, and for others, to become that light they're looking for. In a wholesome way. By doing REAL WORK. And I saw that the work I had to do was not some magic pill fix. That I actually genuinely had to actively work and it would take time and effort to build the strong foundation I need to build, emotionally, financially, and in my life. There is no shortcut to construct such a foundation in the material realm, despite originating from a non-material place. The material realm provides and arena through which to enact our purpose, it provides a timeline by which to understand and utilise the past to move forward and construct our future. The mushrooms showed me what was possible and what was true. And one of those truths was that they couldn't help me do the actual work to achieve my purpose.  My purpose was to become that pillar of strength (and to realise I already am that for some people) and to breathe life back into my broken family, from a place of power, by building a solid foundation for myself to give from.",2년 전,0,

The government cannot ban people from participating in society but they can jail them on possession charges.  This is true for alcohol prohibition as well.  Alcohol prohibition came as the aftermath of a wave of anti-German sentiment in the wake of WWI and the popularization of Marxism.  Publicly spearheaded by the most sour-faced menopausal old maid cunts you ever saw alcohol prohibition was an American legal disaster and a boon to organized crime.  Sound familiar?  Drug prohibition has put innocent people behind bars as de facto political prisoners and converted much of Mexico into narco-state status.  Meanwhile, drugs which have been proven as ineffective and dangerous are foisted upon consumers by corrupt politicians to the benefit of their pharmaceutical owners and handlers.

You are trying to confine the use psychedelics but none of your practicioners have any idea what the herbs are for. You are putting people under with notions of paternalism. Delusion and hallucination are individual and psychiatry is control. No. You're wrong. Do not allow the substance to take you anywhere. The point is to grab hold of what's inside to utilize not. You should not travel into a realm you do not understand. The psych telling you travel into the unknown means the psych will control your perception. Putting people into your control is abuse. You are putting chains on their experiences. So you're trying to figure out psychedelics and using patients as your guinea pigs. You're probably causing schizms and you'll diagnose people as schizoaffective instead of just depressed. It is not a disorder to have stress from physiological response to emotional displays of flawed logic. Their is no addiction. Hopkins is leading the way?

@draakisback,"I've trip sat and guided for many different people over the years across a variety of different chemicals.  There is something very profound here that is being ignored by most of modern society.   I find it interesting that the advice that I give to people is more or less the same advice that the professionals give to people; that you need the right set and setting, and that you need to let go and let the chemical take you where it wants to go.   These chemicals shouldn't be stigmatized and they should be legal or at least decriminalized.   People can have extremely challenging and difficult experiences on them but normally it's because the person did them in a bad set or setting, they had preconceived notions about what the experience was going to be like, or they fight the drug as it tries to break their ego down.   It always blows my mind that some people consider LSD and psilocybin to be recreational drugs; maybe that makes sense at lower doses but it's just such a waste in my mind.

@philipmcdonald-du5ws,"How is technology play speaking a therapist is supposed to just be there to support you in figuring out for yourself. Meaning you have to figure it out no mushrooms can help bring things to the surface for people so they can figure it out so they can empty them selves, and therefore fill them selves with what God intended, so I’m not saying that every person on the world should do it there are people that honestly have lived a great life for people with physical problems, mental problems, and a lot of it stems from abuse and some of it stems from self abuse know mushrooms will, and can help you bring that to the surface. You will find yourself telling your testimony, and you will find others talking about their testimony to help you find your purpose driven life because many times society has created a system of religion, which means way of life.

Ultimately, it comes down to the state needing to control your mind (not like that) so you don't think the BAD thoughts. They don't want you questioning wars, allowing poverty to persist, racism, why we don't treat people better, etc. If people go off and try psychedelics they're likely going to question the government, and in order to maintain power over people, the government needs to suppress anything that threatens its authority.

@marcinhibner9507,"Interesting and I think it's really all about access in being able with the need to gain access to pass through  and no access available individually due to institutionalized access of individual needs in charge in areas of charge available to the ones in charge of individual needs. We really live in institutional money prisons and the access of need is not available from placement and displacement of true need in society. Psychedelics are pleasing and and break bound you go on vacation type but if allowed to go through with it and being in area of no accepted go through with it in a different path of experience. Knowing theses days where you can and which moment and can you afford the area or time is also in the equation. Like fir example the shamans of the areas in varois places around the world can do psychedelics its technically needed in moments and everyone is ok with it. Can you imagine in let's say BIG CITY POLICE NRIGBORS PLACE YOU ON THE LOONY BIN CAUSE SOCIETY WITHIN THE REGION IS NOT EXCEPT ING IT DUE TO TIME IN POLPULATED AGGREEMENT OF WHAT'S BEEN ALLOWED FOR THEM AND POLITICS AND VOTING ALL THAT ONE YEAR WE CAN THE OTHER WE CAN'T AND WE GO TO JAIL AND COMPRESSIONS FOR FUN OF OTHERS TO BE IN CHARGE FOR MONEY. IT'S ALWAYS MONEY AND POWER AND BUDGET OF IT ALL. WILL THIS GET ME VOTED FIR POWER AND NEW HOUSE cars above the society i get in control of etc., BETTER THEN OTHERS TO BE IN CHARGE. psychadelics break barriers of individual barriers and let other views come into play like unchained effect and rechainmen in different forms from experiences. I read so much about it. But it's illegal it's illegal it's illegal  and other places it is but others is not here you can there you can't die to political needs and money budget needs in play area. Be careful what you choose and area of play in need in that time. People in power ownership are in charge towards uplifting governing levels. Like I'm Polish and other factors weaved in misconceptions and family and stereotyping from community's plans like above I wrote and I'm only allowed to play with computers nothing else is allowed from all that I wrote. Simple as that and so complicated for others needs at play fir others in charge of others and do on. I'm in Poland right now and it's so much different then Canada but yet the same, and different regions in Europe and North America have technically same approach weaved in MONEY NEEDS FOR CONTROL AND MATERIAL SHOWING OF BEHIND PAINTED MASKS.

@Dowlphin,"I can tell stories about how often I realized disappointedly how actively many people are defending their self-identity of suffering, and how their closed mind and unwillingness to listen to new impluses despite their allegedly unimaginably hard suffering suggests the real hardship isn't actually that bad, because then you have people who might have had the most crippling and frustrating physical impairments for decades and they say YES, PLEASE! to anything they haven't heard of yet, and this might eventually help them.  Just recently I had another of such experiences where someone dropped the 'yawmy' phrase ""I have tried everything out there!"" and then I mentioned something where they even confirmed they did not encounter THAT yet, but they immediately jumped to saying that's nonsensical bullshit, basically were viciously fighting against it. And at that point, figuratively speaking I look at the demon and say: The game's up. I see you. You don't fool me.  The problem is, many people are so servile to the demon that there is no one else to talk to but it, so maybe the only way left is to confront by making it visible. Otherwise those people would continue to radiate their state into the world, fueling deep deception schemes. We are seeing with harshly escalating intensity how destructive those can be. Servitude of fear is a systemic crisis. It explains why, for example, the German Green Party ended up being the biggest menace to the environment and the well-being of humankind, too.

@ShelleyMcCutcheon,"Thanks for the video. I spent a lot of $ on ketamine treatments, and only 1/6 sessions was dissociative. 5/5: nothing. I tried mushrooms for the 1st time on Christmas Eve 22 (2 g) & had a profound experience - insights I had hoped ketamine might bring me. It was like I could feel other people's hearts in their emotion toward me. They were proud of me. They loved me! I loved myself! I took them for a 2nd time mid-Feb (2 g) but nothing after an hour, so I took 3 more. (I am on SSRIs.) Wow! I don't know where I was, but I was not in this world. Euphoria, the most billowy peace you could imagine, saw that the universe is a trickster, is whimsical & likes to play (I knew this by the music in my head), had profound thoughts about the nature of reality - & that it is us who limits ourselves - stay coloring inside the lines. I also understood that I am energy - temporarily in this body, playing out this part in life (as Alan Watts says) & then I will be some other form of energy. This was an amazing perspective - like I don't have to let life experiences 'stick' to me. They're happening to 'Shelley' - as if a third person. I don't get so caught up in my own story, thoughts / emotions. I wish I hadn't spent the $$$ on ketamine.",2년 전,0,

@cidDraGonFly,"L.S.D. came from fungus grown on the Ergot plant. Mushrooms are fungus and fungus is one of the primordial living organisms on earth.  Psychedelic mushrooms are a natural carrier of all of earths' history, which is billions of years old. When we inject this information through digestion we are experiencing the very beginnings of life on earth and as a result immediately understand life and balance and harmony, we learn that we have the knowledge to live our lives as happily and free as we want and that it is all related and beautiful. That is why so many people feel connected to nature and feel the wisdom of thousands of years, all on a sunny afternoon, after experiencing psilocybin.  It focus your energy on what is important to you, not to anybody or anything else, and once you accept that,  any negatives that you felt before are gone and you transform into the person you were supposed to be; A complex living organism with an eternal spirit. It worked for me once over 40 years ago, and since then I feel the older I get the more magical life becomes.

It was like I was truly seeing the nature of things as they were without all the learned ideas tainting my view. I was flooded with tons of intense feelings and having to learn to experience them and let them go as all these feelings were rushing through me so that they didn't pull me into a rough trip left me with a very profound tool I can use in my day to day life and seeing things stripped of the surface level stuff, what my brain considered religion, politics, cultural ethics, national identity, etc... all that stuff we learn to think about but are really just our own constructs, has allowed me to interact with people far easier now that I approach them first as a fellow living being before addressing any of the stuff that matters far less than their inner essence.

My life completely changed afterwards, i quit every one of my addictions and focused on my work and studies. all my my self belief i was trying to force for years became reality. a true blessed feeling that no matter the circumstance i will always be able to hold my own. i am my own innocence and my own protector.

If you live in a state where cannabis is legal, you could try asking someone at a weed shop. You could drive to Colorado, if you have the time and money. It's disgrace that archaic laws prevent people from getting help. Advice: take a small dose first time, there are ways to minimize the mild and temporary stomach discomfort that sometimes occurs. It has to do with MM cell walls that are difficult to digest. Research lemon teching, it alleviates stomach discomfort. Consider micro-dosing first.  Be with someone you trust and in a safe place before you actually trip. If you experience dysphoria or fear just remind yourself that mushrooms are not toxic, you can't overdose on them and within four hours it will be over.

@yoshiyahu2135,he means 30-40 milligrams of the pure compound which refers to the metabolite of psilocybin (4-po-4-ho-dmt) psilocin (4-ho-dmt). psilocybin cubensis the most common strain of psilocybe mushrooms consumed is roughly on average 0.65% psilocybin so a gram will have 6.5 milligrams of psilocybin so a heroic dose (5 grams) will equate to roughly 32.5 milligrams of psilocybin on average which is then converted into psilocin when it is metabolized by the liver.,2년 전,0,

Or are you worried about grant renewals not being extended based on higher doses? A heroic dose or ""hero's journey"" is a minimum of 1000 milligrams, and typically at least 2400 milligrams for larger/heavier individuals, up to 5 grams or 5000 milligrams (though many universities don't seem to agree with basing it on an individual's weight, but that is an oversight).

@thenigglefish2682,"I'm 30. Started doing drugs at 9, and boy was I a connoisseur from the bat. I've done everything except weird shit from other countries (ibogaine, krokodil, w18, modern research chemicals within the last 5 years, etc.) And I've had plenty of trips where I was on like 8 or 9 substances at once. But I knew where was. I knew who was around me. I knew we were talking. After getting my life together, a friend decided to grow some penis evny mushrooms. We figured it'd be like old times, but it was like nothing I'd experienced. I truly did not exist in my own mind. There was no opening or closing my eyes, it all looked the same. I was not in reality with mountains, ducks, my parents, or anyone still reading this. I was somewhere else entirely, simply soaking in this wondrous landscape as a floating something. Like an orb or an eye or a camera or something. I've never been spiritual or religious, but I saw the universal energy that's one with us, possibly whatever string theory is trying to uncover. It was unfathomable but it appeared as some thing. We danced. It was beautiful. It was the scariest most beautiful moment of my life. I no longer party in an form, as I'm partied out for life, but I will never ""party"" with mushrooms again. They are something different. Something that everyone seems to come out of feeling more grounded and connected. Mushrooms are something we need to research more and educate people on because growing up as a hobbyist drug enthusiast I can tell you from experience. Nothing is that cleansing.  Synopsis - Mushrooms are not a drug, they are beautiful and they should be studied more.  Edit: Spelling",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Called in sick at the job for 1 week, i had time to focus and experiment with it. And to be honest i don't know what just happend but it feels like i spawned into a better life. After that sick week i called in, quit the job and applied for higher paid jobs which i thought i wouldn't get anyways. For some reason the LSD made me apply at all of them & guess what. I got the job, i do no more body work, no more lifting, i am paid double, i bought myself a brand new audi, i was able to go and see monaco, i was able to rent a entire villa with pool in greece life just became so much better and my family is also proud of how fast i advanced.

@nakedshot5813,"Even though I am beyond curious about shrooms, I know for a fact I will never try it. I'm an empath, and awhile ago I smoked ""wax"", I had tremendous epiphanies about love, life, good, evil God, Devil and was able to touch the very dark depth of pain and suffering OF THE ENTIRE WORLD!!  Crying for hours and hours to the extreme of feeling physical pain! I saw to some degree, a deeper nuance of evil! I must confess scary is not even close. Evil exist only and because God. Many suffering of the world ( like the Holocaust, like the natives of Africa absolutely unable and incapable of lessen the pain of their loved ones. Many people whom have died by form of torture and cruel assassination) the main question I ended up formulating was not ""why?"" That's the wrong question for the Main Source of Love; our Creator, God as you understand Him. Is also extremely disrespectful to question God for his decisions and ways. However the correct question is; to what end? Or what for? Or what/how are you trying to bless me via this predicament or tribulation? If you breathe, if you love, if your kids smile melts all the problems away, if you look into your significant other's eyes and find yourself IN LOVE, if you adore your mother for carrying you for 9 months and rocking you to sleep when you had a fever, if you are proud of your father whom has thought you that a spank actually scared him more than it hurt you, because he knew one day a spank was not going to be enough to keep you from the harms and twisted ways of the world, both mom and dad against their own heart HAD to let you go, out to the world and face your own mistakes but most importantly both terrified and sad that the world is the way it is, try as they might they can not change it so you can live out of harms way, now they're old man and woman, and now you being a father/mother yourself you UNDERSTAND the impotence and fear of seeing your own offspring open their wings and fly away.... Tears of the mother who ended up burying her child and not the other way around, tears of the father for the rage of having a child with terminal illness and all the money or anything he can do have absolutely no value on the realm of health. Or what about you; surrounded by people day in and day out and yet this solitude is so cold it burns your bones and the steps forward in a world of ambivalence are simply an ironic laugh of life as to remind you that almost 8 billion people right here right now in your lifetime and yet this journey is for you to walk all alone and in the darkest nights of your despair you realize that you have absolutely no one, no body in this world left for you to draw strength from and therefore some days you are BARELY hanging on by a shaky string that shows with that said empty smile you put on because you are about to snap but you try to draw strength from yourself but you're tired and all you can do is smile but you know that ANYTHING will set you off. Then the creator, and his love drag the minutes into hours next thing you know the day is over tears of solitude run down your face but you're so numb you don't even notice them anymore, confusion because a day gone means tomorrow YOU have to do it all over again.... Well wax made me realize all this, but sadly and regretfully I wanted to understand all this solitude, all this pain each and every single one of my forgotten tears, to what end? ..... What's worse; I'm still waiting for the answer, for the enlightenment, for the comprehension that all this blood fire and pain are not in vain and actually have some sort of value for which I have to go through it, because God is love, right? Because He loves me and is trying to bless me..... Only to realize that is been 3 years since this epiphanies and I know now that my answer will never come. So what is the purpose of this trip, this information this epiphanies if there's nothing I can do for/with them...... With that said, please be careful with what you put in your body. What people do not realize is that once you are able to SEE/FEEL that realm, the door is open and you simply CANNOT close it ever again....",2년 전,0,

@babajaiy8246,"I have found psychedelics from a 'spiritual benefit'/personal growth to be of no more value than that of having a good meditation practice. In other words, the insights/results from a good meditation are no less than psychedelics. The only thing psychedelics have on 'meditation' is that they are more entertaining, e.g. beautiful visuals, being in a completely different 'universe', like a fantastic vacation, etc. A good meditation has a better result in terms of Balance and long term results. Since you're optimizing the the most hi-tech device that there is - The human body. To me psychedelics are good for 'initiating' when one is new to the path of learning to cultivate the possibilities you have with your physical body. But if one doesn't pursue that path without the use of psychedelics, one is missing out on much benefit that psychedelics can't provide.",2년 전,0,

That person taking those same mushrooms of say 15-25 grams won't have a more intense experience.

@foldngtme,"Many people wish to be touched physically, emotionally, and spiritually during these profound experiences. If you are considering this work, please don't let Dr. Johnson’s limited presentation of what's possible limit your confidence in choosing guides and priestesses who possess the capacity to offer these experiences at the highest standard of professionalism.  He says “We need to even more tenaciously cling to clinical boundaries. We need to limit the use of therapeutic touch. [sic] On the big metaphysical questions we have to be silent.” The we he's speaking about is psychiatrists. Psychiatrists mustn't touch their clients. Psychiatrists mustn’t offer wisdom. Ok fair enough, that's their business to decide if they wish.   The ethical standards he describes serve psychiatrists’ training, scope of practice, and intentions. It's appropriate for the medical model and works well for some.However, he does not speak on behalf of all psychedelic guides.   Quite notably absent from the history he presented is that The Beatles were introduced to mushrooms by a curandera named Maria Sabina in the hills of Oaxaca, Mexico. I cannot know for sure, but I doubt Señora Sabina would've considered it an ethical violation to put a comforting hand on their heads or backs if they needed it. I doubt she would've hesitated to answer a big metaphysical question where she had the wisdom to impart.

I could look into moments in my past without feeling the desire to look away, and I was able to make decisions about how I wanted to feel about the situation. I could feel differently about something without it feeling forced or sarcastic in some way. Everything felt sincere and that's something insanely difficult to achieve. It's really hard for anything to feel sincere when you have depression--even your own inner monologue. That's the real therapeutic value here.

@gweedohatsis8404,"I feel the same. My brain physiology is not normative.  When I tried psychadelics in my youth I didn't have any grand revelations. As a matter of fact the experiences were quite mundane, the hallucinations were more vivid than I usually experienced in day to day life (huh, didn't realize everyone didnt get them until then), I figured out I have synthesisia because one of my tripping buddies tried to describe to me about how he could ""feel"" sounds.  Bass sounds were a feeling in his hands, high pitched noises were a tingling on the top of his head etc. I was like ""what do you mean you can't usually feel sound? What type of sound do you usually hear when you turn to look at things quickly out of the corner of your eye? I get the sound of the ocean compressed into an instant"" because my brain does that when I'm not on drugs.  I have a feeling when normies take psychedelics their brain looks something like how mine fires on a day to day basis.   When I take them I do get giggly. The closest thing I get to ""consciousness expanding"" and ""oneness"" is I get a tinge of the melting body feeling, it's like the opposite of my natural tendency towards disassociation and up tightness, it's like my brain is saying ""It's OK to not put up the defenses all the time, here enjoy melting into this tree.""

@FromNothingICome,"​ @lfgogre   I can almost guarantee it's dose related. One of the recent studies actually found that low dosing doesn't produce the ""brain reset"" effect seen with higher doses... tho IIRC the ""lower"" doses in that study were closer to the ""micro"" range...   Anyway I do suspect a lot of people under-dose with these, tho it can be a bit tricky... because one strain can be much stronger or weaker than the last, and may even vary somewhat from batch to batch within a single strain...   Plus some people seem to respond much more strongly than others.   Anyway all that being said, the best protocol is still to work your way up from a lower dose, rather than trying to jump in at a high level when you're very inexperienced.   For average strength cubensis,   around 3 to 3.5 grams (dried weight) should be a pretty fully psychedelic dose, where you get to see most of the range of effects, but it's still not TOO crazy intense.   ""3.5"" used to be the standard recommendation if you wanted to see what it's all about... but a lot of people have said that 1.5 - 2.0 is a pretty enjoyable trip. Not too intense and good for dipping your feet in.   5g is pretty intense, and definitely in that ""this may have long term impact"" range... lol  7g is hella intense. Some may get some come up anxiety in this range lol... at 7g and up it's not uncommon for me to have some ""open eyed visuals"" of blatantly hallucinated colored lights... and I've also seen white light split into a prismatic rainbow, on a 7g dose. lol  (That trip was a rollercoaster, but I realized I was God, and in the end it was pretty enjoyable lol)  TBH even 7g will be too intense for some people.   Highest I did was somewhere around 9-10g, and that was kind of too much even for me... tho the circumstances were a little screwy, and those were also an unusually potent strain / batch, which I didn't realize at the time I ate them... lol  Anyway all of that info is for cubensis of average potency. However with increased legalization, some growers have developed some new strains that are easily 2x the avg potency, or more!   ... at which point 1.5g is closer to a ""buckle up buttercup"" dose than just dipping your feet in!   So it's a good idea to know what strain you're working with, and how strong they are.   On this note there are some dosage calculators you can find online, and there's a really good one that lists individual strains, and gives a much better idea of how they compare.   ANYWAY... I have found that the higher doses definitely give more of a reset / rebirth feeling... but even those average 3-ish gram trips can get you there...   I suspect a large part of this effect is neurochemical, however I still wouldn't discount the role of therapeutic insight...   IMHO one of the best ways to do it is to obtain or create some playlists of appropriate music, and lie in a darkened room wearing headphones, listening to music.   A- music is completely awesome on psychedelics, and maybe one of the most interesting and enjoyable things you can do.   B- Sometimes you'll focus on the music, because of how strange and awesome it sounds... but your mind will naturally start to wander...   And I find if I let it wander, I come up with various insights, and thoughts about my life. Sometimes random, but sometimes directly triggered by the music.   For this reason I think it's good to select music that is either uplifting, or reflective. Though I listen to a pretty wide range of stuff... but I have some playlists specifically intended for this purpose, that I built up over time.   (Actually usually I listen to a Beatles mix on the come up... which works for me because I'm a pretty big fan of their music, and most of it is pretty upbeat and positive... then once I'm fully immersed I usually switch over to a more eclectic mix... )  So I'll usually listen to music through most of the peak effects...   Then usually when I'm past the peak and approaching the come down phase, I'll usually smoke some weed (which kinda brings the intensity back up a bit - but forewarning, cuz THC can also make it a bit more confusing and spacy if you're still tripping) and then I'll put on a movie.   Usually something I've chosen beforehand... and using principles similar to those used for music selection. Something that may be a little trippy or visually impressive is ideal... but something that will encourage me to think or become more reflective, is usually what I'm going for...   One of my favorite trips and more memorable experiences, on the come down I watched Blueberry / Renegade... which is kind of a psychedelic western... and that one blew my mind. lol  BUT, because of the nature of psychedelics, you're more likely to become reflective no matter what you're presented with...   One time I decided to watch Donnie Brasco (which, if you haven't seen it, is the true story of an FBI agent who infiltrated the Mafia) and not only was it super fascinating and wildly entertaining... it also made me think A LOT... about the paths we take in life... morals and ethics... relative morality... identity... social groups, and how social ties impact our identity, etc etc.   And in that case it was a movie I threw on, on a complete whim - didn't plan that one beforehand. Just kinda felt like watching something, and that's what I picked...   🤷   (Oh and while I'm on the subject, watching the right comedy is a great way to end up with sore abs the next day! lol)  Your mileage may vary, but I've gotten quite a lot out of solo tripping, using roughly that method.   Anyway, start low and be safe...   🕉️☮️🕉️",10개월 전,0,
@FromNothingICome,"​ @TheGoIsWin21  ""...either trying to fight against the experience... or from being in a high stress environment...""    Yeah that's what they call ""set and setting.""   As in, your mind state as you're going into the experience, and the environment you use in. Ideally you want both of those things to be fairly safe and comfortable.   (And yes, if you start to freak out, you need to remember to ""let go"" and let the experience carry you, rather than fight it, if it starts to feel ""too intense."")  Obviously tripping when you're already feeling suicidal and/or psychotic is a bad idea lol... but don't underestimate the effects of your setting. Even an experienced user who is confident, can start to feel overly anxious in the wrong environment or situation. And once that anxiety gets going, it can produce a runaway reaction, where next thing you know you're staring down the barrel of a psychedelic panic attack!   And who you trip with (if anyone) is a very common way for setting to go bad.   You don't want to be around anyone who doesn't understand psychedelics, or someone who's immature, or an a-hole, or likes to ""mess with people"" for fun, etc etc.   Also if the other person is tripping, their trip can go sour, and then you have to deal with that...  Actually for all those reasons (and more) I usually mostly prefer to either trip by myself, or maybe with a trusted romantic partner.   I've also had a few great trips with very close friends... but I also tend to hang out with relatively intelligent and mature people, who aren't d-bags, so there's also that... lol  Anyway, you are absolutely correct about ""fighting it"" though. That is another of the common ways people end up in a bad state... you start to worry... either you're tripping much harder than you expected, or you're coming up fast so you don't know yet how intense it's gonna get... maybe you start to question your dose... did I take too much? Maybe you start to question your physical safety...  If you took a very high dose, you might even start to wonder if you're dead... maybe this is the afterlife... maybe you're in hell...   Interestingly, these are not uncommon thoughts.  One time I smoked some DMT and thought I died, and I was in hell, stuck in a time loop. That was pretty terrifying.   If you're tripping hard enough it's also possible to start to worry that you broke your brain, that you're permanently insane now, or that you're going to be tripping forever...  (For this reason I find it's helpful to make a note of what time I dosed... and then a rough estimate of how long I expect the effects to last... because once you're tripping hard enough, you may have a hard time remembering what ""2 AM"" means, and how that relates to your current mind state... but when I can look at my note and see that I should be normal by 6AM, and it's still only 2AM, I know that it's perfectly ""normal"" and expected that I'm still effed out of my mind, and I've got several more hours to go lol...)  More rarely, but still possible ... is getting stuck on a certain thought or mood, and having difficulty snapping out of it. This has only happened to me a few times, but ime / IMHO this can be one of the more unpleasant ones. Even relative to ""am I dead / broken"" because it can be harder snap out of.   (And I think this is the one that's actually dangerous for those of us that struggle with depression etc.)  One time I somehow ended up in a state where I just felt like everything was phony and hollow, and had the hardest time snapping out of that...  Another time I made the mistake of stopping on the history channel when I was flipping through tv.. and a show about WWII quickly prompted me to start thinking about the fact that humans have been killing each other in organized brutal fashion for many THOUSANDS of years... and how many human lives ended in terror and agony on some battle field, or being graped to death by some pillaging soldier... and I just couldn't get the death and carnage back out of my brain, nor stop thinking about humans as an evil / doomed species...  So yeah, there's an element of cognitive hazard there as well, depending on how your mind works, and what cues it has to pick up on, or bounce off of...   But that's only happened to me a few times, across dozens of trips... and I'm a certified over-thinker with a pretty morbid streak!   So those are all the ways a trip can go bad... lol  But set and setting are the two big ones you have to account for...  I also feel like it helps, to start with a prayer and set an intention for the trip. Even if that's as simple as ""I want to have a fun and relaxing night"" But usually I'll pray that I have a safe trip, and ask for guidance and clarity of insight... and then if I have something more specific in mind, I'll mention that.   But I definitely feel like it helps to start from that more reflective, more spiritual, humble state, where I have a clear intention of where I might want to end up, and/or why I'm choosing to do this in the first place...",10개월 전,0,
@linamarie84,Ya and exactly where does anyone actually get these,9개월 전,1,
@FromNothingICome," @linamarie84  Well you can grow them, which isn't actually that hard if you do a little reading and preparation. These days there are even methods that work for the extra lazy beginner lol   (For example doing the ""Uncle Ben's"" technique and then fruiting directly from the bag.)  And spores are legal in something like all but two states in the US, so unless you're in one of those two states you can order them easily and legally.  If you didn't want to go that route... there are an increasing number of people sending dried fungi and related consumables (chocolates, gummies etc) via the net / post.  There are some sites based out of locations where laws are relaxed or legal (Canada, Washington DC, parts of Colorado and California, iirc...) that are a little more liberal in terms of where they'll send to... I've heard of and seen a handful you could easily find with a little googling...  There are also tons of people these days operating through services such as Telegram etc. However there are also tons of scammers and probably a honeypot or two as well, so I'd be extra careful if considering one of those... (both net and messenger apps. Do your research. Check trust pilot and similar resources, and see what others may have said about them. Always keep in mind however that ""word of mouth"" reviews can always be gamed by ambitious scammers!)  Anyway good luck out there and worry not, especially if you're in the US - more and more places are starting to decriminalize if not legalize, and it's only a matter of time on this stuff, as more people become aware and more educated on the subject...",9개월 전,0,

Within 2 weeks I had quit drinking or doing any other drugs except weed. Within 2 months of micro dosing everyday I had quit everything except weed. I smoked cigarettes for 12 years and quit cold turkey one day. Just decided I was done. It's been like 3 years and I've drank maybe 3 beers and nothing else except cannabis...... well maybe a lil bit of dmt. But nothing like before I had used shrooms. The urges are gone. It's really crazy how much I believe this mushroom kept me from going down a darker road than I was already on. These things should not be illegal. If its natural and needs no chemical alterations to reap the benefits then it should be 100% legal. But you can't tax things that grow naturally so it'll be a long time until we will be able to cultivate them legally. Plus the pharmaceutical companies want to make sure they can twist it to benefit them. I personally think it should be used for drug rehabilitation programs instead of substituting hard drugs for another one like methadone.",2년 전,2,

@sophiemilton5939,"I am so glad that these substances are finally being properly investigated and brought into use. Unlike pharmacutical products, psychadelics actually CURE, not just blot out the symptoms for a few hours until your next dose.  Treating the symptoms instead of the cause makes billions of dollars for the pharmacutical companies, so they have little enthusiasm for an actual cure, particularlt one which is impossible to patent Meanwhile, you have to just live with whatever nagative side-effects happen - and some will, they always do, some worse than others. Psychadelics have either no side effects at all or at such a low level that they are insignificant. When I said ""cure"" I do concede that an annual ""top-up"" might be needed    :-)  What I would like to see is the doctors running these programs take some for themselves so that they knew what they were talking about.  How can you advise someone when you yourself cannot properly empathise with what the patient is actually experiencing? You do not need a mega dose. Just take 90mcg of LSD or 3grams of dried mushrooms and you'll have a ""half-a-tab"" type experience so that you at least actually understand ""where they're at""  The ""We are the authority, we will guide you"" approach might work quite well as I assume that your patients have had no previous ""trip"" experience? Were I to come to you, I would have no faith in the supervision of any person who has not themselves ever tripped at all.  I would trust you to safeguard my physical health of course. When two friends trip together there is in most cases a deep bonding and empathy.  A strong shadow of that link persists long after the trip is over, possibly forever.  You two alone shared that deep experience. Having had a trip yourself, you have a much deeper and more instincive ""feel"" for how to handle a person who is struggling with a trip. ""Vibes"" are a real actual thing and can be strong when you are on a trip.  That's what I should have mentioned above when I was talking about trusting your supervision...... I think you'd give me the wrong vibes.  Not bad, hostile, whatever...... just I would KNOW that you did not know youself. Trust is essential - you can't trip with folk you do not trust.  I do realise that as a doctor, you cannot flout the law etc and if you had done you would not be able to say so  🙂   As your remarks above indicate, the Law, whilst ostensibly about protecting health is often driven more by political goals.",2년 전,0,

There are no hard times, or disease, or animals trying to kill us or worry over storing and growing food. Child mortality basically non-existent. Drugs for every mental issue ranging from PTSD to minor sadness or boredom. In short, we're weak now. Soft. People live in their own sterile isolated little world and drug their minds into oblivion over the slightest emotional hardship instead of facing their issues and working through them. People have become sniveling cowards. Look into the age ranges that people are medicated for some imagined mental illness. The number of older people on antidepressants is basically non-existent. Because in their time it was harder. They didn't have pharmaceutical crutches to help them every time a bad mood popped up. They worked through it with the help of friends and family. Life was hard for them and it made them hard people. Able to weather the difficulties that life is full of. Drugs aren't the answer to our so called ""mental health crisis"". Telling people to get the fck over it and a slap across the face is what they need. There are people around the world who are enslaved or starving or living in trash or getting bombed on a daily basis. Some upper middle class brat who fails a midterm or god forbid has someone tell them the world doesn't revolve around them doesn't constitute a crisis.

There are times where they can make you think you're gonna die, but you wont, as long as you can stay calm though it, and not go do something ret-arded like take a walk into traffic...  if your doing some soul searching take them  by yourself in the dark, If you just want to have a nice time and relax, take a walk in the woods on a beautiful summer day. Don't expect shrooms to cure any serious mental issues though, thats just not gonna happen. Shrooms definitely are not for everyone. I personally never had a bad trip, but I have witnessed some who have, and it's not pretty. The key to it is all about acceptance, if you try and fight it you're gonna have a bad time.",2년 전,0,

@ruby-cn5qe,"​ @rarecandy9473  I think ""bad trips"" are feared and can manifest when unconscious trauma comes up if you don't know how to process it, and it can cause anxiety and panic attacks (which I've experienced a lot of). It's hard to give advice without much insight of course but I'd recommend if you can, writing down what you're scared of beforehand and trying to figure out ways you can remedy or self-soothe, even affirmations can help. I'd suggest mushrooms over acid and maybe one or two smaller doses a week or so before a bigger trip so you can consciously tap in and out of certain emotions without it being too overwhelming. I've tripped with intention and helped myself reflect and recover from certain things in my life by focusing on that thing and how I can move on from it/ forgive etc. I used to experience severe panic attacks in the beginning because I had no sort of guide or good influences around or had even been to therapy before. From my experience, it can be overwhelming for older people who haven't delved into their trauma before so it can be confronting and overwhelming because it all just suddenly surfaces after years of compartmentalising/ believing that they've gotten over it or are a different person now. That's why i think easing into doing a big trip might be good for you if you've been prone to panic attacks. But coming from someone who had panic attacks and severe anxiety and depression I've never had anything else help more than psychedelics and by experiencing severe emotions or situations on them it improves your reality by developing stronger processes and soothing techniques. Hope that was at least somewhat helpful lmk if I can be more specific .",2년 전,1,

I will say, I've ate a half once of shrooms, taken 5 hits of lsd and got nothing from it, before you say it was bad or weak stuff, it was not. I watched people crawl on the floor talking to hallucinations while I just felt like I smoked to much weed.   I went on a trip for 8 days, the first time, then over the course of 3 months I continued to hallucinate on it while I was forced to either ignore my problems or work through them. I wont go into the experiences in detail, but the moment I stopped hallucinating, and the drug did nothing for me was the moment I accepted I was the only one who could control my mind and understand my experiences. I did this by standing up and made all the bad things a joke. I ended up creating a dragon as a friend, he protected me from all the evil and negativity. I manifested a joke that used laughter to attack all that held me back. The moment I created this dragon, it only took a few days before I completely stopped being troubled by everything that plagued me and the drug no longer makes me hallucinate. I also no longer use it.  even to this day, when I begin to feel scared or lost, I remind myself ""Egor the dragon"" who is always there to protect my self from my own mind and  remind me that I'm ultimately in control of how I perceive myself and what can really hurt me.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

@jmanj3917,"I'm a combat veteran who has been diagnosed with fairly severe PTSD and its associated depression. Micro-dosing with psilocybin has been hugely beneficial, but it is not something to be done by the patient alone. I can't stress it enough: Just like antidepressants and all of the other meds used to treat these issues, simply ingesting certain compounds is not the answer. The patient absolutely must be actively participating in ongoing therapy as well. This includes such approaches as one-on-one counseling (think of the Freudian approach, with the patient lying on a sofa and talking through their issues while guided by a licensed therapist), CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), which teaches the patient how to reorganize and reprogram their thought processes, to other specific courses of treatment. But the ongoing input of a properly trained staff of therapists and doctors is the only way I have found to even begin unraveling the ""rat's nest"" of nastiness and negativity that takes up residence in the patient's solar plexus (the spot just below the center of the ribs, where even a slight impact can cause a person to ""have the wind knocked out of them""). And the use of small doses of psilocybin, when combined with proper counseling, has provided me with some serious personal breakthroughs in my treatment.  One further caveat, regarding the correct dosage of psilocybin: If you can tell that you have the drug in your body, then you've taken too much. Remember, you should be trying to heal your mind and body -- and your soul, for those who subscribe to the existence of a soul. You should not be attempting to ""trip"" on psilocybin, as this could potentially lead to the worsening of your symptoms.",2년 전,3,

My theory based on hundreds of hours of research and self reflection is my dopamine receptors were dormant and unable to process my bodies natural dopamine. The drug over loaded my brain with dopamine to the point it had to activate and process it.  The biggest physical change I went through was digestive. I relied on medication to eat. Ingestion was horrible, and my stools were loose for most of my life. I no longer need medicine for that. The second biggest change was my ability to sleep all night long.

They made me quit drugs, and think of how I acted from the perspective of someone I love, and truly made me realize how important I am to that person and how much I hurt them, the things they want and the things I want and what I could do to improve our happiness. It's quite spontaneous with its insightful nature as I wasn't expecting to have those thoughts at all. But how can you say that someone who is a ""bad person"" will turn into a murderous psychopath after 1 experience. I've certainly had bad thoughts in my teenage-hood before but I didn't turn into a murderous person, nor an immoral person. And in an age with addictive drugs being everywhere even in school this might be exactly what we need, remember when I said psychedelics made me quit drugs, it happened after 1 dosage completely randomly, and its being used to treat alcoholism right now. And a study in Africa found that 1/3 people who took a psychedelic drug during a ceremony with a psychedelic called ibogaine, quit their opioid addictions. So this fentanyl problem can be helped with these substances. And as for what a school shooter type person will do after taking a psychedelic, I cant theorize on that. They may change or they may not. Some people don't change after psychedelics while others do. Also how is 99% of society criminals?

@narvi5779,@onehundredfifty  wow was that during an experience? And 8 hours that doesn't sound like mushrooms and that sounds intensely terrifying. I've had scary experiences where I thought an evil entity was messing with me or God was trying to kill me for taking drugs but that sounds much scarier. But I'm specifically talking about trauma or lasting effects after the experience and ptsd kinda falls under that category of after effects.

Always do it in a comfortable setting where you don't have to interact with strangers/sober people who aren't already trip sitting you (please only let someone trip sit you if they know what they are doing. Never let someone who don't know how to act around someone who is tripping to affect your trip badly. its better to do without one or to also trip with a person or multiple people who you trust well than have an inexperienced sober trip sitter). Once the setting is all great as mentioned, remember to let go on your trip. When you trip don't resist anything that it's trying to show you because the more you resist, your mind will start thinking ""this is bad"" which is what most of the time causes a bad trip.

@Jesus.HChrist,"I disagree about the concept of a ""Bad Trip"" I've had hundreds of mushroom trips over the course of the last 5 years. And I've learned one thing for sure. They will force you to confront all the things you've ignored, repressed, or convinced yourself aren't in your head, whether you like it or not. I've had trips where I felt physical pain from the things I was thinking about, I've had trips where I've puked and felt scared. I learned to open myself to those feelings, sickness, pain, fear. Feel them fully and deeply in my heart. And when those trips ended? I felt amazing, weightless, uplifted. The only time I had a truly bad trip where I felt terrible afterwards was one where I went in with the expectation of sex from someone who wasn't interested in me at all, and I had convinced myself that they were, I treated the mushroom trip not like medicine, but background music to the shit I wanted to do. One of my earliest trips. I never made that mistake again.  If you respect the mushrooms, and what you're doing, and go into the experience with the understanding that you cannot anticipate what will happen in your head and you absolutely have to roll with whatever occurs, you'll be fine. Better than fine.  Its not recreational. It's medicinal. Use it with no fear, an open heart, and no expectations, and I promise you. You'll be okay",2년 전,1,

We need to tell people the truth and leave them free to make up their own minds, to explore their own healing. There's no such thing as a ""bad trip.""

I don't really see the need to do it again but glad I did because there are revelations to be seen. A tip for people who may take a big dose and start to get paranoid about dying, the best and only way to deal with it as far as i know is to sincerely accept death if it should come and once you've done that you will rejoice and a whole new world will open up  and you'll be able to join with what could be as close as we can get to the afterlife while still living in this body.

@Mr.MT3,"Very true. Though we're miles away from really understanding ourselves. We produce DMT quite naturally, in higher doses it can lead to some of the more ""out there"" psychedelic experiences there are, but when you look at exceptionally healthy minds, the pineal gland and DMT are playing more of a role. The monks who use ""100% of their brains"" etc etc etc. All these other psychedelics are great but therapeutically micro dosing folks with DMT helps to re-regulate the brains natural function. Essentially you do not need to spend a lifetime in a monastery to get there. There's some dietary components as well but for the most part DMT is something our brains are meant to be utilizing more than a lot of us presently are.",2년 전,0,

@hugs4drugs205,"Here's my breakthrough experience, 7g dried mushrooms with some tolerance from dosing a few days before hand, 2 sugar cubes of LSD of unknown Ug (who can truly know anyways). After going through a loop of laying in bed under a blanket getting too hot ripping my shirt off going to the sink chugging water attempting to vomit getting cold putting my shirt on getting in bed under the blanket rinse repeat who knows how many times I eventually couldn't get up, stared at one spot on my bed and poof, everything's black. An orb of light begins to materialize in the black slowly, and I realize I am that orb. I accept that this is death, I've somehow overdosed on psychedelics.Then a web materializes, made of what appears to be electricity. I begin to move along the lines of this web and when the orb hits an intersection I'm transported to a childhood memory so vivid I'm living it, but I have no control. This repeats for a number of cycles, then it stops being ""my"" memories. I start to experience moments foreign to me, as if they're my memories, of people in previous time eras.

@joeputnam627,"Here is my fullest experience the first time I took mushrooms: “It started with some very “trippy visuals”. Everything looked very clear and slightly distorted. I moved my hand in front of my face and could see a trail of hands moving behind it. I went to go to bed and heard a chime. Like a bell in a town square. I heard this bell three times over the span of a few minutes. It felt like the bell was in the distance, then near me, then in my skull. I went to bed and put some music in my ears. There was a small blue dot flickering and zigzagging across my field of vision. Suddenly, it vanished. It kind of “popped” away, like a bubble. I was listening to music and staring at the dark wall in front of me. I was laying down. The wall started to expand forward, then come back, then go a little further, then come back. The wall expanded forwards to a point where it made a hallway. A hallway from an old mansion or old hotel or something. Hard wood floors and darkly painted walls. Sconces on either side of the hallway in pairs, all carrying a dim flicker of light emanating from a wax candle wick. I was still laying down. My bed started moving down the hallway. The flickering flames were moving past me as I moved down the hallway. After a few minutes and passing many doors and candles on the sides of the hallway, I came to a door at the end of the hallway. This door was illuminated by a bright white light behind it. It opened and I moved through. As I entered the door I saw a great white flash of light and I appeared in a garden. I was in the middle of a green garden with two very old trees on either side of me. Lots of bricks and stone patterns on the ground. And beyond the trees were these massive hedges or shrubs, they must’ve been 50 feet tall. In front of me was a series of archways, with plants and vines and leaves and flowers growing around them. I walked down the stone path through 3 archways and came to a maze. The shrubbery was all around me and still about 50 feet tall. I spent what felt like 15-20 minutes trying to find my way out. There was a very small amount of golden sunlight coming through the shrubs, illuminating my path. I came to an archway at the end of the maze and walked through it. Next thing I knew, I was out on this huge terrace. One solid slab of stone, with stone guard rails all around. There was a fountain in the middle of the terrace and many stone statues but I couldn’t make out who they were statues of. I went to the edge and leaned on the rail. The sun was very bright and warm for a brief moment, and then the clouds all around started becoming dark. I felt the rumble of thunder and saw the flash of lightning. The wind picked up and I was blown over the edge. I was falling and falling for about 5 minutes. I first fell through dark blue stormy clouds with bright lightning and slashing rain all around me. The clouds eventually turned to a pale yellow. Here, I was falling from heaven, into the pale yellow which seemed to be earth. I was falling through these pale yellow clouds with objects and people whirling all around me. Earthly things. A few minutes later, the clouds started to change into a subtle orange and then a really deep and scarlet red. I saw a flash of red and was in a very rocky, hot, and fiery place. I appeared behind a small stone structure, and beyond it I could see a silhouette of a giant creature, in front of a flickering flame. The creature got closer and became easier to see. It must’ve been 100 feet tall. It was a dragon, with deep green scales and huge sharp claws. It was walking on all fours. The dragon had the wings of a bat, and the head was a combination of a black lion’s head with the fangs and tongue of a serpent. I felt fear for a moment, and suddenly my fear disappeared entirely. I was no longer afraid of this creature, and in turn, no longer afraid of death. Then I was warped away. I imagine that place to have been hell. I went through a vortex of bright lights and subtle colors and next thing I know the sky in front of my cracked and broke like a mirror. Behind this were three giant hooded figures. Bigger than any skyscraper I have ever seen. They were looking over me. Almost inspecting me. I was warped away one more time and ended up back in the room and in the bed I was in. I turned my music off and went to sleep.”",2년 전,2,

For some reason, the general public seems to only get the two extreme ""fringe"" versions of our own history. On the ""left"" it was the peaceful educated youth protesting the Industrialized war machine & preaching the benefits of vegetarianism, cooperation & caring for our fellow man.   On the ""Right"" it was violent riots, bombings, fires, rampant STI's & the huge spike in overdoses & psychotic breaks occurring in the ER's,  that seemed to resonate.  To this day most, people seem to skim over the 2,500 bombs detonated in the late '60s in this Nation, and the simple fact that there was legitimate reason for middle America to become very Leary (pun intended) of the use of psychoactive drugs by their kids.",2년 전,0,

I microdose now but there is a huge difference when I don’t microdose which is how I know this works. No antidepressants can give you the results of mushrooms.

Not saying its impossible that aliens are coming to earth and whatnot i just think everyone should be careful about what they accept from psyches and especially the insights they give us about external things which in my experience tend to be us ascribing our own personal thoughts about things to the outside world and then interpreted as something extremely meaningful since, yk, drugs.",2년 전,1,

@michaeldapardo,"20-35mg of psilocybin is about a 3.5g dose of mushrooms at 1% tryptamine content. A hero dose is over double that: 7.5g of potent dry mushrooms, more or less depending on the tryptamine content. During my hero dose trip, my reality had completely melted away as I transcended through the dimensions; I became one with music and God's love; I traversed the galaxies, and then was bombarded and brought to my knees by God's love and listened to Jesus Christ speak to me about existence, in the presence of God (whom i could not directly see, He was as bright as the sun, 10,000x brighter), and the devil lurking in the abyss below us -- just above the Earth's atmosphere. I call it the Pinnacle of Truth. He told me ancient lessons of life, the meaning of it, and reassured me of my path in life. Shortly after, I had tomes of ancient knowledge transcribed into my mind from the Golden Libraries of the Universe, these were golden scrolls of ancient text that looked like cuneiform being channeled into my brain -- the downloading of knowledge that taught me lessons of individualism, equality, love, and selflessness.  A hero dose is like a DMT trip for 4 hours -- funny thing is, psilocybin is DMT with a hydroxyl (-OH) group -- take enough of it, and you'll blast off. I've had 20 hits of Orange Sunshine LSD, and its nowhere near the incredible teachings of 7.5g of mushrooms. Acid unleashes the mind. Mushrooms unleashes the spirit; trust me, I'm a chemical engineer.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@raymondr7769,"The way I describe it to people is this: After feeling cold, numb ,and grey inside from dealing with years of stress - it felt nice to notice how the sun felt warm on my skin. That feeling had always been there, but it had been drowned out by all the negative thoughts over the years. Feeling and acknowledging that warmth on my skin reset my view on life; I began to notice and appreciate the beauty in life and it felt like that gray cloud of stress and depression that had grown in my head slowly dispersed, revealing clear skies. Edit: I didn’t expect this to get as many responses as this did. Thank you to everyone who interacted. To clarify a few things, psilocybin was not the sole reason I was able to pull myself out of that really low point in my life. I was worn down from engineering school and failed relationships (those mainly failed due to my dedication to my schoolwork). Before engineering school I had been putting myself through the wringer for 5 years prior, all to focus on my goal to be accepted into engineering school in the first place. So about 10 years of just being stressed left me feeling emotionally numb and disconnected. Even after I graduated, started my career, and continued with therapy. I felt empty. I was able to work through most symptoms of depression and anxiety but life still felt bleak. It wasn’t until my experience with psilocybin that I finally made the breakthrough I needed to make my way towards a happy and healthier life. That was on top of the years of therapy and trying different medications. So I was on the general right path, but psilocybin just lifted that fog and reconnected me so that I can really pursue a happiness. It’s hard to find happiness if you forget what it feels like. Psilocybin reminded me of what happiness felt like.  I don’t recommend self-medicating. I’m not a doctor but everyone’s mind and body are different. But if you do, I would start with small doses and increase the dose over time until you are familiar with how your mind and body react to it. You will be confronted with heavy thoughts and emotions so it’s important to be somewhere you feel safe and comfortable beforehand. I would also recommend having someone to call in case you do feel overwhelmed and need some reassurance that you’ll be okay. It’s important to read some different online sources to get an idea of what a good low dose would be for you to try . I’m about 3 years into my career now and I’m living an overall happier and healthier life. It still took work and self-reflection to reach this point but as I stated before, it’s easier to find happiness if you at least know what you’re looking for. Much love to everyone, and I wish you luck on your life journey.",2년 전(수정됨),4.9천,

I'm glad you're able to see the beauty around you and that you have ESCAPED from the shackles that life (the way our world is) can lock our mentality and keep us in a place if darkness. And, from my personal experience, even the strongest, man-made anti-depressants and other psychotropic medications cannot break these shackles. Yet nature has provided many very effective NATURAL medicines that act in a profound way, on our body and mind. We must use them as nature intended and everything in moderation, of course. So, thank you Raymond, for a very eloquent and intelligent way of expressing your experience. I'm always happy to hear things like this, as these plants and fungi still carry a stigma, that is in many ways,  very unflattering to what could be life-saving substances. Your comment is extremely accurate and I'm happy that you had a positive trip, as some can be quite unnerving, especially if not expecting what is to come. God Bless and please be responsible, so our future will allow for these substances to be used, with caution and responsibility, to make our lives and possibly the world (in our lives), a much brighter and happier place.

And you remember it after the fact, even if the world isn't quite as colorful once you've sobered up, it's been instilled in your mind that there is color there, that there's more to life than the mundane, and I think it makes it pretty unique among drugs because I can very easily go weeks without any sort of craving, other than the craving of my curiosity for what my next experience might show me.

People who struggle with introspection & emotional regulation can either have incredibly painful (yet necessary) experiences or full-on psychotic episodes. And then there's people who don't derive any deep insights whatsoever; to them, psychedelics are just another chemical escape from reality they'll use alongside opiates, amphetamines, booze, etc. That said, if you're someone who is capable of healthy introspection & likes to pursue self-growth, shrooms & LSD can be force-multipliers in terms of emotional & spiritual progress. Speaking personally, psychedelics have helped me totally conquer feelings of existential dread & ego rigidity.

We also lived close to SF/Bay Area. I kept a running tally in a notebook, and I took 44 hits, a long with a bunch of 🍄 also. Once I started college, it was only 🍄. LSD was a little too much Crazy Town, but 🍄 allowed me to interact with God, and learn the answers to my questions. Learned how to travel vast distances throughout our Universe. Learned how to bend Time and Space, in order to push out beyond any boundaries, and reach our farthest edges. I stared into and touched Dark Matter. We, as mankind, aren’t meant to be there. It truly is where Pure Evil lies. An energy that is one of the greatest powers I’ve ever felt. Something that may be more powerful than God! It was the most terrifying experience I’ve had, and I had some very scary experiences with LSD, which is why I stopped taking it. Heroic Doses = No Fear! 🍄 are definitely the keys to unlock as many doors as you can find!

He gave her a micro dose once a week for three weeks and he said she became much happier and began to recognize him again by name and brightened considerably emotionally. I wondered if he gave it to her after that and if there were more improvements. I understand the ethics involved in giving someone such a substance when they can no longer truly decide for themselves but...if it helped them in some way wouldn't we also be prompted by way of ethics to offer that help?

@TheExplosiveGuy,"I was effortlessly snatched from the death grip of alcoholism by a heroic dose of psychedelics six years ago. I had tried smaller doses of both LSD and Psilocybin before my heroic dose, I had paddled my feet in the water and wanted to see how deep the water got after doing some serious research on the drugs, so one day out at my friends property in the woods I went for a hike after I ate 8 grams of mushrooms then immediately put 1200ug of LSD under my tongue when I was particularly frustrated with my desire to drink, since my previous trips had given me a short reprieve from cravings (meaning I only drank enough to stop the shakes for a few days, and not get shitfaced drunk, more like heavily buzzed) and made me feel a bit more upbeat. Little did I know the horrendously powerful experience I was in for! Never in my life have I been so tortured by my own subconscious self as I was during that trip, for the first time in my life since I started seriously drinking over a decade before that had I ever had to face the wrath of my own self conscious, looking at myself as if I was judging a different person standing in front of me, seeing all the damage I had done to myself, my body, my brain, my soul, and worst of all, those that loved me. I immediately had my family take me to a detox center where I stayed for two weeks where they drained all the alcohol vapors from my head, and ever since I had that trip and stepped out the front door of that facility I have not struggled one tiny bit with alcohol addiction, not once. These horrible, evil, destructive, illegal and downright wicked non-addictive drugs, in one fucking dose mind you, saved me from one of the worst (and legal!) addictive drugs in existence, alcohol, yet they are the bad drugs? My love for the leaders of country wanes every single goddamn day...  And just to be clear, I haven't attended a single AA meeting or any kind of support group. I took the drugs, went to detox, and now don't have a second thought about alcohol if I see it. I can even have a couple beers on special occasions but that constant urge for more is completely gone, it's like a switch was thrown in my brain and then superglued into the off position.  And aside from being my savior from addiction, psilocybin has done wonders for my mental health too, I used to be dosed to the gills with antidepressants when I was a teen, and I really wish I had the guts to try mushrooms back then because that's the only antidepressants humanity needs, the long-term boost to happiness is incredible when you think about it, it's a drug that keeps you happy for weeks instead of hours, is non-addictive, has no toxicity, and grows in nature. It doesn't get better than that.",2년 전(수정됨),3,
@alecburris4225,"I love psychedelics. To me they are on the same level as technology. Ultimate power, they can create a beautiful new world or destroy it all, it depends on the user. Psychedelics saved me from myself in more ways than one and has given me an unexplainable understanding for art, love, beauty, ect that I likely would've never known otherwise. However, a bad trip can have the opposite effect. One bad trip made me HATE my best friend from childhood because my tripping mind convinced me he stole $10 from me. I've seen ""demons"". There have been stories of bad trips leading people to kill their loved ones or jump out of windows in very extreme cases. I understand as I have felt that on some level during a bad trip.

What started as something relatively focused as building a 'psychic pyramid to connect with the aliens in Saturn' has devolved into this reality not being born yet, where everyones parents are reversed, history is fiction and the mother of his child has been replaced by a demon.  He's tried to build an army of real life astral projection warriors to defeat his enemies, and decides everything through muscle tests, constantly flicking his fingers to figure out what to do next.  He has trouble controlling his emotions and is prone to violent outbursts.  And he absolutely positively can not and does not want help with any of this.

@CM-hp4pz,"A male relative of mine took psychedelics in the 60s and it caused irreparable brain damage. This brain damage is visible on MRI scans taken this year. It spiralled him into a pit of severe depression that began 35+ years ago and for which there is no cure. During those years he irrationally blamed his birth family/siblings for petty grievances and broke off contact with 90% of them (only in 2022 has he mended fences, as it were). He spent at least twenty years sleeping during the day and couldn't keep a single job for more than a year during his ""better"" years, causing the financial burden of the household to fall entirely on his wife. His quality of life is currently maintained by a small, regulated dose of antidepressant medication. When he attempted to go off his antidepressants 4+ years ago, thinking he could be ""normal"", he fought irrationally with his wife and daughters, who went to live in a hotel briefly because the mental abuse he heaped on them was too much. He now understands that he cannot go off his antidepressants. So explain the part where the drugs that caused the irreparable brain damage in the first place somehow have become the cure in 2022? His life was, quite literally, ruined by psychedelics and you want people like me, with this example in front of us, to believe a single word you say or give you a red cent or vote to fund it?

@indigenousdimensions826,"There's reason why our brains have receptors for these compounds. If we as human beings wasn't supposed to experience these sacred journeys then we wouldn't have receptors in our brains. When something so small makes you raise your vibration to match the experience it's going to show you, to where it literally fills you literally full of the vibration of love to the point you love the dust on a window to the dirt on the ground, as it done for me one night when honestly set and setting was completely wrong but I knew for some reason taking the 9 grams I did would change my night. As it did.  Everyone in the house I was at was arguing and fighting. To the point I finally just lost it and I never laughed so hard. My ex showed up and she at some point started hitting me and kicking me. Guess what I did? Laughed even harder. So I had to use the restroom. Went in and did what I had to. Washed my hands. Then looked into the mirror. Anyone who's taken these journeys knows looking into a mirror typically isn't good. This time I was in aww. I loved who I saw in the mirror more than I could ever have imagined. The person in the mirror was as beautiful as anything else that I saw that night and everything that night was equally as beautiful. Then I had the thought of my ex pounding on me and from what I was told I was in the bathroom for about 45 minutes laughing my ass of hard. To me was a split second. When I come out the whole house was asking me wtf  was laughing at and why I'm so happy. Only thing I could say was they needed mushrooms like me. Or of the funnest journeys I've took with mushrooms themselves. Nothing that nigg could change my vibe or happiness. Honestly nothing hit me as being negative for about a month and a half after either. I noticed what would typically scratch me or hit me as being negative in any way didn't for a while after that. Set and setting are everything when taking these sacred teachers. For me myself that night it was needed. I'm a firm believer that when one knows how these sacred plants work and how the journey is going at it alone even with a room full taking the same thing, what most would call a bad trip was truly what the individual themselves needed to experience. The bring so much positivity because how they seem to make the individual themselves face the things they never released by storying them in the closet. Until the individual themselves truly faces these things and accepts and takes full responsibility for what ever it is they can never truly release these things in a way they don't become attachments. Which only brings negativity that stays attached to the individual. If one has what many call a bad trip then it was needed. The individual just needs it interpreted correctly. Like a bad dream. Once it's interpreted correctly they realize it wasn't actually a bad dream. They just had a bad understanding of the experience. It's what I feel is correct anyways. But what do I know?",2년 전,39,

@bobrandom5545,"I want to start this by saying that I am still struggling daily with psychological issues and self-hate. Psychedelics are not a cure all and shouldn't be seen as that. Having said that, I've definitely had life-changing experiences on psy's, particularly LSD.   One particular trip I will never forget was me physically walking in circles, while mentally walking around a truth that I had to see eye to eye. I was ~30 years old at the time and had accomplished nothing of substance that would be viewed as successes in today's society. I kind of knew what it was that I was evading. But at some point I broke through and had the guts to face it; I had the constant nagging belief that my life wasn't worth anything and that probably, I just wanted to die. I was literally circling around a decision point; Life or Death. It felt so real and HUGE and so, so scary. Once I reached the center of the spiral I finally realized, truly realized,  that I did not want to die. That I wanted to keep on fighting.   An immense strange mix of relief, hope, but also grief and intense sadness, for all the missed chances I already had in life, filled me up. I can never overstate how intense and overwhelming all these emotions were. I had always been a person with a fairly flat affect; emotions were very fleeting and most of the time the only real feeling I knew was just emptiness, probably just chronic depression. This was the most emotion I had ever felt and it was so freeing, but so uncomfortable at the same time.  After this realization, probably 4-5 hours into the trip, I just started crying uncontrollably. I've always had problems crying. I can probably count the number of cries in all my adult life up to then on one hand. I must've stood in my bathroom, looking myself in the eye in the mirror, crying, for at least 30 minutes (maybe an hour even), profusely apologizing to everyone I knew, and especially to myself, for treating myself so badly over the years with self-hate and self-criticism after setting myself unobtainable goals and requirements. All out loud I was apologizing to myself and starting to forgive myself for everything.   After this trip, nothing has been the same. I've developed an, although subtle, empathy for myself and others. I have learned to be more truthful to people about my competences and my shortcomings. And about the real reasons behind my actions. And through that I've learned that people are much more empathetic when you're just honest about all these things.  The hard part is the integration, which for me, a couple of trips and 7 years later, is still ongoing. I still have difficulties trusting people, and trusting myself. I still find it hard to get up in the morning to actually do stuff and fight through the lack of motivation. But, I started a job that might give me good opportunities the coming years to develop myself and live up to my potential. I feel a little bit less shame for who I am and actively observe my shame and realize that it's unfounded.   So, to conclude, the trip was an AMAZING experience and has had effects that I feel no other experience could've triggered. The lingering results are subtle, but noticable. It maybe saved my life. It was the catalyst for quite rapid growth over the years. Once in a while I still do an LSD trip for evaluation and I doubt I will ever stop doing this.  EDIT: I feel it's responsible to add that psychedelics are no child's play. Please don't take psychedelics thinking you're gonna cure your mental issues. Educate yourself, also read about the bad experiences (there are tons of them), take precautions, prepare. Heck, go talk to your MD if you're set on doing it.",2년 전(수정됨),285,

DMT which is a super powerful psychedelic that is also found in just about all living creatures/plants like ayahuasca, besides invertebrates. This is referred to as the spirit molecule. Due to the fact it connects you to your self. This attributes to people having dreams good/bad and it acts as.....well I don’t really know. I’ve never taken any psychedelics but yet I’ve had many profound experiences due to natural DMT in the brain. Let’s figure out how to unlock/use that aspect of the natural DMT in peoples brain, before putting people on high doses maybe it’s not the best thing.

@K9Mike,"When I was 19, I was really into psychedelics.  One summer night, I made a pb&j sando with 7.5 grams.  Off I went.  I sang a lot that night.  Performed my songs on my acoustic in a room full of ‘like-minded’ friends who loved listening to me play. Very warm atmosphere. We all drifted off into our own worlds eventually.  Then more music on the comedown.  And then, around 6am, as the sun was rising, buddy arrived with a 10 strip of gelcaps (LSD) and we all ate one. We were at a lake house that had a deck boat and two JetSki’s. I hopped on a JetSki and went tearing ass all over this lake, which was calm as glass. For anyone who has never been on a JetSki in calm water, it’s like being on a motorcycle only you can crash and it’s just more fun. Now imagine that experience while you are frying away lol. After a while, I wiped out. As I lay in the water, staring at clouds waltzing together above me, in the sky, a friend of mine swam up to the JetSki, climbed on it and sped off. Left me alone in the middle of this lake, floating on my back. I probably lay there floating for a good half hour with the sun rising on my face, listening to the sounds of life waking up. After a while they came back and picked me up on the boat. It was just an absolutely beautiful night and beautiful morning. I am probably lucky to be alive. I was a very reckless young man, to say the least lol. But I sure had a lot of fun and I had a lot of amazing experiences.

That trip was far more intense and emotional than I can ever describe and was close to being bad trip but became benificial. I had felt an urge to hurt my nearby friend trip sitting me but I knew it wasn't me that wanted to but rather it was the entity manifest in my mind and by tempering myself it would do nothing of the sort.

I was able to face all the trauma I experienced losing my mom to cancer and cried harder than I think I ever will again in my life... and the next day I felt a million times better, lighter.. I had such a better perspective and understanding of what I'd been through, and what my dad went through losing her, and since then have repaired my relationship with him that was previously so bad we could not even speak for about 3 years after her death.

@moksha6202,"I had my 1st heroic does (plant medicine) exp a number of years ago when I was in my late 30's. I felt like I was one with the Universe and the creator. I felt and experienced a total out of body experience for several hrs.. The Shamans role is just to help and guide you through the process if you have a difficult time. A good Shaman/Guide will never try to influence your exp. Thats your own direct exp. A true Guru will only guide and empower you. However, I was told a story by someone I knew who had gone to different countries in South America to work with Ayahuasca.   He had worked with this plant 100s of times with different tribes in the deep Amazon jungle. These are places where you will not see any tourist as you can only go with the tribe's permission, which is very difficult.  He shared his experience of working with these tribal elders one time.    They give you the brew and put you in a hut by yourself. You are all by yourself for the whole exp. Then the next day he sat with the elders of the tribe and as he was talking to them through a translator he was stunned when the elder, a shaman of the tribe was able to describe his experience in great details and as to what and why he saw in his trip. This just blew his mind, and it blew mine too, to hear this story. Some things are very difficult to explain. I can only say that it sounds like real Shaman, medicine men (who has worked with the medicine for many years, generations) who are very rare to find these days have serious psychic powers as they are able to get into your dreams, thoughts and experiences while you are on the medicine.  I am not sure how you develop them as this knowledge is passed down from generations of practice.

In my life honesty and openness was built in to my genes. So I told the audience the whole damn truth.  (Oh and I never cared what anyone thought about me) To succeed as I did was because of one lucky break after another. I was not the best student, Probation Officer, Law Student, Prosecutor or anything in particular. I’m just a lucky guy who was given a great life. My only advice after saying that was to say work hard to do well, and look for a path that leads to your desired outcome, job or position, and get on that path and stick your thumb out to see if maybe fate will come by and give you a lift and be in a position to take advantage of all lucky breaks that come your way.😎",2년 전,2,

@____ak____, @moodiblues2  would you say the DMT experience helped you stop smoking weed?,1년 전(수정됨),0,
@moodiblues2," @____ak____  I don’t mind admitting it now, but for nearly my first 2 years in college I couldn’t remember a day I wasn’t high on grass. As usual one night I was in the dorm room of my closest friend and we got hold of some DMT. In those days I took whatever we acquired. I am lucky I didn’t get something that killed or sickened me. Anyway we took the stuff and some time it hit me in a flash of intuition. I remembered as a child wanting to be somebody respected like my father, a physician. I remembered how I began to think that if I tried to do something serious, I might fail and how I began to believe if I just didn’t try, I could never be said to be a loser, because I just planned it that way. Crazy backward thinking! I immediately saw how stupid it was to try and be a loser so I couldn’t have the misery of trying hard and failing.  I saw that if I tried real hard, I might possibly fail or maybe  I might succeed, but if I didn’t try I definitely would fail. It sounds so stupid now to actually live my life to fail for sure. It’s hard to explain this experience as it was an instantaneous realization, not a mental discussion with myself. So at 1 or 2 am I called my father and told him I was going to enroll back in college. This in itself was crazy as my father hated to be awakened, especially by me. Anyway, he thought it was a good idea but would not pay for it, as he was upset that I wasted his money when I dropped out twice. I didn’t care. The next day I re-enrolled in the University, and stopped smoking cold turkey. While waiting for the college semester to start, I learned Transcendental Meditation. I got terrific grades, graduated, and got a good job first as a teacher, than a Probation Officer. I went to court a lot on the job and found I had a good head for it. I decided to apply to law school, but only had a 2.69 GPA because my first 60 credits in college were a 2.0. The last 60 was a 3.75 or so. I knew a judge who liked me as a Probation Officer and asked if he’d write a letter of recommendation for me. He told me to write one and he’d sign it. Naturally it was a glowing letter. I got in; graduated with a 3.75, number 3 in my class. I became a Prosecutor. I applied for that job. They said they liked my resume but didn’t need me. I said I would work for free until they did. I was very successful as a Prosecutor. I won’t bore you with it, but 6 years after graduating law school I became a Judge. This outline doesn’t really tell you all I did and accomplished at every job from Probation Officer to Judge.  All of this because of taking that hallucinogenic drug!!! I am retired, a millionaire and happy and healthy! I am not particularly smart nor talented, but I worked hard and never quit. I use to sit at my bench in Court and wondered when everyone would see how big a goof-off I really was and send me packing.  If a drugged out dope like me can do it, almost anyone can!

@tdtrecordsmusic,"Well, let's keep this dialog going & give these miracle substances the attention they deserve.  One thing I would like to add is that these substances still have astronomical benefits outside of the 'treating ailments' setting. I hypothesize that some of the greatest benefits of these psychedelics is in preventing mental problems before any symptoms arise. . . .  in other words >> Partake in these substances to have a healthy mind <<   >> Don't wait until your mind becomes sick <<       One thing I can guarentee with my life experience is when you take them a couple times a year your mind will be well. You will become aware of small things which might evolve into bigger problems. This allows you to steer your life in a better way, rather than waiting for problems to arise THEN partaking and hoping for the best... Yes, it is WAY easier to stay healthy than to heal the sick. Kind of like eating food >> if you eat healthy greens/veggies/fruits/etc your life will be WAY better than trying to skip eating healthy and fixing all the problems which arose from not eating healthy to begin with.       I feel bad for the people whom seek remedy in these substances and sincerely hope they get better :) Sending Love, Prayers and Every Good Thoughts to those people. However, again I hypothesize that these people would NOT have mental ailments if they had partaken casually and at their leisure. I personally do not think ""hero doses"" are wise. I have seen many people mess their minds up. Sorry if that goes against anybodies beliefs, but truth is truth. Truth is apart from belief. The truth is that taking normal doses will not alter your personality or other brain functions. Taking hero doses has observable effects(post/lingering) and I do not think it is wise. I also do not think it is the proper way to respect Earth medicine, but hey everyone is different and other people may have needs for such things. Who am I to judge others?",2년 전,0,

@getfucked3559," @travisumbel6877   Yes, you are correct, to me there is no difference between a good and a bad trip, it's just tripping, but what worries me is individual tolerance. I've done 5g of shrooms and even then just 1g can still hit me like a ton of bricks and don't get me started on acid which can completely melt your sense of reality on higher doses. When I first did psychedelics and it eliminated my depression I also thought ""why doesn't everyone do this"", but after more experiences and seeing how crazy it can really get I realized that someone who does a low dose might still get a very intense trip and they might not have the mental fortitude to not reject it and freak out. This stuff isn't candy or like smoking weed, it can be extremely pleasurable or just straight up agony for several hours. I think these things shouldn't be done unless you feel it deep inside that you are really ready for it, when your head is clear so nothing would pollute your mind and that you are ready to let go of your normal understanding of reality, because no words or youtube videos can really prepare you for the experience, it really feels like straight up magic. But for first timers always trip when you're in a good mood, always trip in a place where you feel safe and know nothing can go wrong and always trip only when your body says yes, if you have any doubts or if you second guess , then your experience might be vastly different to the one you are hoping for.

@nicholashale6620," @kohakugawazy  That's now how it works, in terms of ""achievement"".  We are dealing with differences in perspective, really: Seeing things differently. The easiest analogy is that having experience in psychedelics is like having read a book someone else didn't: You have a perspective and knowledge they do not, for not having read the same things. What you do with that knowledge or how that knowledge manifests in your own life will vary by individual.   Two different people with two different lives take the same dose...both experience an intense connection with their surroundings, the people in their life, and see themselves without any doubt or fear as they truly believe themselves to be, at their core...the next day, one person realizes ""I need to do more with my life!"" and the other says ""I need to slow down and work less and spend more time on the little things""...and neither is wrong. It's all relative and there are no magic answers for everyone (other than ""Be kind and love yourself""). The ""knowledge"" or information you gain from psychedelics is personal and intimate and not applicable outside of you and won't result in a single measurable change...you just gain a new perspective, and that perspective may help other things in your life make more sense, or become less of a worry.",2년 전,3,
@nicholashale6620," @ryandavids1129  What if, as a hypothetical example, your ""bad trip"" was the only type you could experience, at that time, because of an abundance of fear and doubt in your mind and an inability to surrender control over your surroundings and thoughts...whether you were cognizant of those issues going into the trip, or not? That can be just as telling as someone walking outside and feeling connected to the grass beneath their feet or the birds moving through the sky.  I think when people say it would ""benefit anyone"" it is a sincere belief...there is just an asterisk* that needs to be stated: What benefit you derive may not be enjoyable to experience and may surprise you and you may be unprepared.  Whether someone can benefit from what they experience doesn't undermine the nature of the experience or the value it can offer...not unlike how you can lead a horse to water but cannot make them drink. If it wasn't a good time and you learned nothing from it that can be your take away...but that doesn't speak to the molecule or the experience itself, just how you reacted to it during, and after. Whether you choose to think about or learn from what you experienced, and why, is up to you and if you can derive a benefit from that is up to you.",2년 전,3,

While it definitely has an effect, the main part of whether or not its for you is your mentality. Some people just don't have the capacity to undergo a trip and come out with a meaningful experience regardless of whether it was a good or a bad trip and some people do. I personally still think everyone should at least try a low dose once in their lifetime to determine whether it's for them or not because there is no way of knowing what it's like and what experience you'll have without ever trying it but once you find out if it's beneficial for them or not then they can move forward with that information.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

@mattsomeonewithansrt3948,I’ve done LSD more than a dozen times when I was younger. Had a lot of great trips. Mushrooms personally is kind of confusing. I felt lsd had a much clearer high. You get tracers but you’re totally in control of your mind. Mushrooms that level of fear can creep up on you pretty quick depending on your dose. Everytime I took mushrooms there was always a period of the trip that felt negative. One time that I actually got high on saliva 10X that was insane not recommended. It was really dark out and my eyes 👀 dilated everything went pitch black and I was hovering above my body looking down at me and my friend so scared that I would never get back to my body. Felt like I died and I was like a ghostly soul I couldn’t operate my mouth to speak either it felt like days passed by me but it was only a few minutes peaking. It’s all about the dosage with psychedelics. If you’re doing good hits of lsd cut off a sheet. You only need 2 or 3 hits for a great experience. 5 or more unless you have experience doing it half a dozen times or more you’re going to freak yourself out. My one friend did 5 hits and I won’t go on to tell the whole story but he had the worst day of his life. He ended up in the hospital because his parents thought he had alcohol poising and he ran out of the patient room all crazy and security tackled him while he was tripping balls.,2년 전,1,

@aaronbeedle941,"When I look at the world of today, arguably largely a product of the 70s and 80s, and in turn, of psychedelics and a surge in drug-use (legal and non legal), I have to wonder if we're treating a problem within ourselves, or whether we're diluting a healthy response to an unhealthy society. I can't see any correlation between  prosperity, personal or communal, and the use of psychedlics, and whilst a lot of great music and art came from the 70s / 80s, when you pry for information, it seems it was also a time in which some of the darkest and most sinister human acts in all our history occurred.  Following an abnormally hopeless childhood, I'm an abnormally resilient person when it comes to my mind. I've tackled my problems one by one, sober, and the key element has been the care and support of the people around me. I'm evolving and prospering as a result. When I look at everyone else, absolutely everyone I see, they treat their problems with drugs, and all I see is people being disarmed and blinded. Many find happiness, but it is not enduring. It requires constant use of the drugs, and many other conditions of comfort and stability. I haven't seen this work for unlucky people.  They're apathetic, disarmed, and disconnected from each other. This leads to ideological isolation, and worse, fear. This seems to cause almost all problems the people I see are dealing with. In the moment there's empathy, 'woke'ness, seeing things that others don't see, but they're also missing blatant truths about our nature and what we are. Social creatures. We designed to be collaborators.   I still know so little about human nature, but I will continue to observe and hopefully learn more.",2년 전,0,

I grew up extremely conservative and narrow minded with racist, misogynist indoctrinations as a child and teenager.

It increased my self awareness as well as my ability to gain perspective for and from others. It single-handedly was the most prophetic moment of my life and I owe my creative career as a chef and now mushroom farmer to that heroic dose.

Before long my apartment was filled with aquarium diy terrariums for fruiting the mushroom cakes.  Eventually I got into mass growing using mini fridges and ultrasonic humidifiers and stepped it up to about a half pound of dessication dried mixed genetics psilocybin cubensis mushrooms of 4 types of spores I'd acquired from a JLF catalog and elsewhere.    The heroic dose came in one night when a friend and my current wife and I decided to go to the Pink Floyd laser light show.

I often use 7-10 grams in order to   really travel.  What he would be giving to patients would be the essence of a micro dose  at 30-40mg.

@adam01120,"This is the story about my experience with magic mushrooms ((S.I. TRIGGER WARNING)):  I first wanted to try magic mushrooms when I heard these kinds of potential benefits that psychedelics could have in treating depression. There were lots of promising stories online of people allegedly curing their depression and finding newfound hope and a love for life. It sounded too good to be true, especially for me. I had no luck with anything to improve my mental illness in the past, and was on the verge of using my way out. So, I was in need of a miracle.  I tried magic mushrooms as soon as I could, on the edge of my depression and s.i.. Someone I knew got me about 1.5 grams and they stayed with me when I took it. When I experienced nothing, no trip, no improvement to my mood (which supposedly last for weeks), I fell even deeper into my depression. I'd been trying to get my hands on magic mushrooms for months since I'd heard of its potential and when it didn't work I didn't know if or when I would just give up and take my own life.  Before that dose, I had already committed to growing my own mushrooms, believing they'd help as everyone would have had me believe. A number of weeks later, my mushrooms were ready and I could try a higher dose. I thought my first dose just wasn't high enough. So, again I tried and I didn't feel anything. The next day I doubled the dose and still felt nothing. The third day I increased it again (I think to maybe 6-7 grams). I still didn't feel anything. I crossed my fingers and decided to try to give myself several days before I tried again. Long story short, that worked. I felt the affects. First it made me really sad, then it made me really happy. This was the only time it made me feel happy. I didn't have lasting positive effects to my mood. From then on, they would only make me feel worse.  Microdoses made me anxious, and trips pushed my depression and SI to its limits. Finding that out, I planned to use it as a way to push myself to go through with my ""plan"". Only, that didn't work either.  My latest trip, a couple of weeks ago, I took more than a heroic dose and I broke my mind. My visual processing was extremely delayed and slushy, as was my sense of space/touch. I couldn't walk or talk properly. Everything I've learned about reality seemed useless, and I was so anxious that I thought I permanently damaged my brain or ended up in hell before I even followed through with my plan. Everything looked and felt wrong. It lasted for hours. On the comedown, I realized it was only a trip, but my visual processing was still completely off and I wasn't sure if my sight would fully restore. I had to sleep with that uncertainty. Thankfully it did restore, else I wouldn't be able to type this out, let alone unlock my phone..  Magic mushrooms have done nothing but cause me more pain as if to mock me. I wanted to write this so others would know it's NOT a ""magic"" fix-all wonder drug (for everyone). Hey, if it works for you, congrats, but it didn't for me. This was just my experience, and people in similar situations to me should know there's that risk.  If you're struggling, you're not alone, and I hope we all find our peace ✌️",2년 전,0,

I should note that Denver Colorado in 2019 decriminalized mushrooms and has recently voted on an initiative that has legalized possession and use. “The initiative allows for the use of psilocybin at state-regulated centers under the supervision of licensed facilitators. It also legalizes personal private use, growing and sharing of psilocybin and psilocin, as well as three additional psychedelic compounds — DMT, ibogaine, and mescaline — by adults over the age of 21.” -NBC News.

I always spent weeks after analyzing from a different perspective and do believe that I found a greater motivation and much needed self discipline. Mushrooms were different. I always had an ear to ear smile while on mushrooms and was generally a much calmer and happier and more loving person for months after. I believe that there are different outcomes for different people and can in no way predict what your outcome or revelations would be. I will suggest though that your stringent self diagnosis could soften but I doubt you will have any life altering revelation if you were to go into it with a closed mind.

If you don’t even like to take coffee then why are you searching for somebody to give you a reason to take shrooms, like tf?! 😂 you have clearly made up your mind about this a long time ago. Ain’t nobody trying to convince you of anything man, this is not Jehovah's witnesses. Go take them and find out, or don’t ever take them, is not that complex. And there’s not such thing as a “quimical balance” in your neurotransmitters, is not like, per se, your serotonin levels are at 1 almost every day and your dopamine levels are at 2 almost every day 😂 you feel what I am saying? production and reuptake of neurotransmitters doesn’t work like that, matter of fact this “balance” that you want to conserve is just an idea in your mind, your NT do whatever they want to do and are altered literally by everything you do in your day: sleep hygiene, diet, sex, physical pain, stress levels, etc, etc, even thoughts! Are you capable of controlling all of this to conserve such “balance”? Because literally every input and output in your day alters your NT’s, shrooms ain’t going to shut down or increase anything in any significant way for more than a few hours. See my man, in reality you are just having a dialog with yourself. Trying to figure out why are you interested in this stuff., It’s just shrooms bro, it’s not crack. You will not see crazy shit and you will continue to live as normal as you were living before taking them. Or you might have a bad trip and continue living as normal as ever.

Those with rare latent psychological disorders like schizophrenia may have problems integrating the experience but I'm even skeptical of that if proper steps and precautions are taken. A big part of the psychadelic experience is actually being receptive to its effects and not ""fighting"" and avoiding what's being presented to you. This takes an open mind and requires your ego check out at the door.

@evzevz06," @r0ckworthy  The Best trips I've had are in my room alone in complete darkness after 11pm. Ive never felt claustrophobic because when I open my eyes the room no longer exists and the distance between me and my hands are in them moments no closer to me than the edge of the universe is. My advice to people is for the first time sure, do a small amount with a friend in the day. But if you want to get past that level 1 recreational stuff. Dont do it with people in the middle of the day in bright lights being studied and watched in an unfamiliar location. After 10pm at night, lights out, alone, in a safe familiar decluttered space where you would be free to leave your physical body while you left it to go explore another realm, is the set for high doses. If you begin your trip around the time you usually go to sleep, and you actively try to sleep when you start tripping, you can enter a state of dreaming while awake, it is akin to entering a deep meditative state, in this state you are completely unresisting to the trip and fall Deep into the rabbit hole.  I have not yet had a ""bad trip"", only 2 trips that had very difficult moments in them, which have actually been 2 of the most positively impacting.

So yeah, never take hero doses without an experienced guide so you don't lose yourself in the spirit realm. And never take a hero dose just to experience it.

I'm not racial or anything, but a majority of the abuses of these medicines mostly come from white people taking it irresponsibly because they did not grow up in a tribal setting where they had elders tell them what these medicines can REALLY do. People don't understand that there are different levels of learning, as well as access to higher information while on medicine. Your first levels of learning is unbounding your traumas and egos with the self. Once you've really done the work and have let go of these traumas, the higher learning you receive will be something like ""what is the approximate geometrical math needed to grow the petals of a rose"" or even access to memories of your past lives(But none of these can be done right if you don't have a guide/elder/teacher to be there with you to hold space and show you where to go while on medicine)",2년 전,2,
@Chipwhitley274,"Studies are showing the rate of psychosis occurring for users of psychedelics is no different than the general population. Furthermore, there is no mechanism in psychedelics that would cause addiction and resulting destructive lifestyle.  I suspect that anyone you knew that had such an experience, was likely due to other factors, other drugs, laced product, traumatic experiences etc... and psychosis was likely already an event that was going to occur... correlation not causation.  While I believe people should be as safe as possible... I think it is possible that the dangers are often overstated, and are deterring people that could be helped. If you have a good set and setting, you have mentally prepared yourself, you are open, and don't resist the experience... and especially if you already have a spiritual/religious framework... you may not need to be as cautious as you suggest. Though it is a good recommendation... it certainly is a reasonable approach, and it would absolutely help, or even be necessary for helping people having anxiety about taking the leap...  Ultimately I trust in the individual's ability to judge for themselves the level of risk they are willing to take... they have a sense of trauma they may face, the strength of their faith based framework, their emotional stability, their level of being prone to anxiety etc. etc. etc.. If more caution is necessary then I think people can gauge that. They need to do their research and decide what they are comfortable with. Some people will never be prepared to try it, and that is ok... some may need to take it really slow, and that is great too... others may be able to handle a more aggressive leap...  Using my experience as a counter example... After years of meditating on the possibility of taking a heroic dose of psychedelics... one year ago I was presented with the opportunity to purchase some shrooms, the next day I took a heroic dose, without a trip-sitter, alone, on my first psychedelic experience. I didn't reach ego death, but I was very close. It was challenging but positive. It went without any negative incident. 3 weeks later I took double the first dose... again, I was alone, no trip-sitter, same setting. My ego dissolved away... I was gone... I didn't exist... But I did.. or something... faced the immensity... the infinite possibilities, overwhelming... then filled with the realization of my infinite capacity to face those possibilities within my self, and being connected to all of life that works in concert... and I was born again... my ego re-materialized... I was new... and had powerful insights as I integrated the experience and the world and myself with new perspectives and understanding.  I've taken probably another half dozen heroic doses but no ego death... some were transformative, others weren't as much, though usually insight is still enhanced. I tend to aim for a level 3 trip, as I find it still produces powerful experiences without the need for full ego death.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

I don’t use them except for every few years and I don’t know if I’ll ever use them again. I never looked for them, they always  found me. It was never a fun thing. It was an awakening thing.

@Moldygreenbean,Mushrooms changed my life years ago. Use to take them every several months to reset my view of the world. It was a “break” from the day to day. Let me slow down and feel “human” again.  Haven’t done them in a very long time. Kinda scared now. But I am introspective enough to know I am slowly losing all sense of who I was. The things that mattered to me no longer do. I only care about work and materialism. I don’t care about the little things; I feel like I’m slowly falling into psychosis of the modern day to day.  Perhaps drugs aren’t what I need. But it was definitely THE answer long ago.,2년 전,0,

@FEV369,"Look, I don't mean to chit on people's beliefs, but here it comes. Artists that do hard drugs often find themselves at a low point in their creativity, that is to say they were already a famous artists or had written some of their best music/painting/whatever... later, after heavy drug use they become either addicted or just caught up in more and more drugs, and often times they literally end up dead or their art collapses. I remember watching something about the beetles (not a fan personally) where they thought they are doing great while high, playing live... they saw the playback and realized how horrible they were performing.  Here's the real point... Weed was believed by many to be this incredible outlet, a view into a new way of seeing the world, and it is... because you're high and your senses are being manipulated... But many of these people claimed that Weed had and or would cure them/us/you of mental disorders, physical problems like curing cancer... Well, after legalizing's weed (I agree with) we started studies and found that no one is being cured of anything... nothing... nadda... maybe it helps you sleep... but at the same time we started seeing all the negative side effects, many we already knew, like losing your train of though, constantly... or causing anxiety rather than curing it.   A cancer doctor (not that I need to drop a title) once said that he treated many people who had cancer that used weed, and yet not a single one was ever magically cured by using weed. none...   Taking mushrooms is a trip, it will have an effect on your thinking and your senses... but getting high won't suddenly make you a genius, we know this because if it did, there would be and near endless supply of geniuses running around solving all our problems, and their own. But they're not.   ----------------   I lean libertarian, I basically hate Government as it by definition exists to replicate itself and act as an authoritarian mafia that steals your money through taxes... tax money that goes to paying low lives who benefit from those taxes to sit around and get high. They know their grant money comes from taking from others but can apathetically get on boards because they get paid from that collection. In the end what do they discover? Nothing... a solid 100% nothing... They fix no problems, cure no disorders, nothing...   Getting high and claiming that when high you don't suffer from say, depression... well no fucking shit you bottom feeder, you're high... but you're not cured, hence ""micro dosing."" You micro dose so that you can be forever high, and sooner than later your dose has to increase, like with all drugs to deal with whatever problem you were pretending to have under control creeping back.   People drink to ""self medicate"" because claiming ""self medicating"" sounds cool... reality is that these people found a way to ignore the real problems in their lives by the use of drugs. That drug can be from a pharmacy or a dealer, grown in your home found in nature.   So please, stop stealing peoples money and pretending you found the keys to the universe through your fucking trip... but lets be real, you like getting money to get high and pretend you're some kind of scientist...

I always suggest not to play music, although it does help, it is a different experience when you listen to the medicine in full silence without music(because you'll be able to hear the actual sound and resonance of the medicine in your body's field). If you also choose to, you can have access to the memories of your past lives or channel spirits of ancestors and loved ones that has passed.(This is the true power of the medicine).

@shoeman6966,"@Jason Smith I hear what you’re saying man, but I’m afraid it’s a bit more complex. While psychedelics have changed the lives of many people forever, we mustn’t forget that they are a trip, and when it’s over, you once again exist in the reality in which you existed prior to taking the psychedelics, even if your notions, beliefs, and feelings have changed. You discuss the idea of achieving full potential, but that in itself is a highly complex philosophical idea that is inherently subjective in nature. What does it mean to achieve your full potential? To assume that one’s potential cannot be reached without the aid of psychedelics is a rather pessimistic view of our existence. You also cannot make generalizations or sweeping statements using a word like “we” to collectively describe humankind, because, regrettably, not everybody’s experience with psychedelics is pleasant. Many people become quite sick to the stomach from taking psychedelics, and have reportedly seen quite disturbing things such as ghosts or demons or creatures. Many of these individuals might have come out of the experience having learned nothing but that they were scared shitless and won’t ever try psychedelics again. So, while I agree with you that uses of psychedelics in science and medicine is encouraging, and that these substances can be beneficial, I do not necessarily agree that they are this miracle substance.

@JasonSmith-we5ls," @shoeman6966  absolutely agree with you, it’s way more complicated than just eating some mushrooms and having things figured out upon sobering up, and I shouldn’t have distilled it down the way I did. My main point was from personal experience for the most part. I was in my early 40s before I tried any psychedelics of any kind, I was afraid of “them” because I’d heard over and over all the terrible things they do to you. Finally conditions were favorable and I tried mushrooms, and it really was life changing stuff. I feel like there was me before, and me after. Cliche maybe but it’s true.  I was locked into a way of thinking that was very selfish and narrow minded basically, me me me me. Literally the next day I feel like I started a journey that I’m still on today. I don’t feel the same. My perspective shifted from focusing on work, money, and other physical shit to buy or try to buy, to more of a general open minded view that I’m a cog in the big machine, and finally recognizing that life is indeed so short and my time here is very precious so I have to spend it wisely. My focus shifted in a lot of ways, I feel like I’m a better father, husband, human for that matter. I used the words “full potential” because I feel like even though I haven’t taken any in months, they’re still helping me find and properly appreciate what really matters in my life. I get that people take psychedelics for fun and to party (which is bananas to me) thus they retain their status of dangerous illegal drugs, and it’s so unfortunate for us because they’re a tool and should be respected and used as such. That being said, they’re definitely not for everyone, but if everyone could somehow experience what I experienced and apply that subtle change to their lives, I know for a fact the world would be a more compassionate, open minded generally better place with people’s priorities firmly in the right place. After my first experience, my basic existential anxiety sort of dissolved, I dgaf about politics, news, or propaganda from either side of the aisle anymore and that was a real problem for me before. I bought into the big lie the Uniparty is telling, and mushrooms helped me walk away and stop playing the game. I just wish more people could experience it. That’s really what I meant by full potential, not that 1 or even 1000 mushroom trips would just fix anyone, but the tools to fix yourself are there if we can look for them.",2년 전(수정됨),3,
@shoeman6966," @JasonSmith-we5ls  i see what you mean and I appreciate the clarification 👍 I have a question for you: Do you think the mushrooms were a tool that helped you better yourself, or do you think there was a powerful subconscious part of you that already knew you wanted to change, and the mushrooms just helped that come to the forefront of your mind?  The reason I ask this is because the compounds in the mushroom don’t carry new data into the brain. They aren’t a chip that you’re plugging into the computer. They merely scramble how you view reality. Do you think the mushrooms caused this change in you, or do you think they instead just helped bring out a desire for change that was already there?",2년 전(수정됨),2,

But it goes deeper than that, I feel differently on almost every level. As I said before basic existential nervousness and death anxiety was absolutely alleviated. That fact alone I’m leaning toward being a side effect of mushrooms because most of my adult life I’ve had issues with that, but not anymore.   I’m not sure if you yourself have tried any kind of psychedelic, if not, it’s difficult to explain it to you. But the well known chemistry of these mushrooms don’t mean shit, science can explain what they’re made up of and why, but their effects are not that simple.",2년 전,1,

And even if I could drive, the state I live in is anti-trans making it harder to transition, and it's expensive as heck. And since I can't get a job or disability income, well...  I think anyone who reads this all the way through will see my point. It's why I don't want medication, and why I don't think any of this would work for me. My depression, all of my mental issues with the exception of my PTSD, are secondary symptoms to things that I cannot change and which will not get better just by ""trippin' balls"" for six hours. Trust me, I wish they would get better. If it were that easy to get rid of my depression, my PTSD, my situation, if all I had to do was take some gigantic frickoff dose of magic mushrooms, I'd at least try it once. But I just cannot see any way in which my life will be improved. All I could see happening would be witnessing some profound hallucination or something, then coming down, realizing I'm still in the same situation which I can't change, and just getting even more depressed after feeling and witnessing what true freedom could feel like, only to go back to feeling like a slave to a society that hates me, a body I didn't choose and can't change in a productive way, a family which thinks I'm a burden but does nothing to help me stand on my own two feet, and a reality which only seems to promote selfishness and greed above all else, but actively punishes it from anyone not already at the top.  TL;DR: If your depression is caused by external factors and not internal perceptions and the like, I personally can't see how this could ever help.",2년 전,0,

However, their use was heavily stigmatized and restricted in the mid-20th century due to their association with counterculture and incidents of unethical research.   In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes, with research focusing on their safety and effectiveness in treating conditions such as depression, anxiety, and addiction.   Psychedelics are known for producing intense and potentially transformative experiences, but they also carry risks, including the potential for ""bad trips"" and the need for careful preparation and support during the experience.",2년 전,0,

@ChrisK0z,"My first few trips enlightened me and taught me a lot about life and the ability to see things through a different lens It was just invaluable..

One of the most special attributes is certainly being able to drift off into almost endless thought.. Your mind seems to wander and almost levitate endlessly and with music It's beautiful because It feels as If you're flying along with the melodies and It can be very blissful, My biggest take Is that you shouldn't fear having a bad trip, Life in itself is full of good and bad and you'll never learn a truly valuable lesson without the mix of the two.. My last few trips brought me back to my original feeling that I seemed to have forgotten again.. Which Is simply that life is the trip and I need to go out there and be more present with myself, my family and my friends - It reminded me I had things to accomplish and It was almost like a kind nudge to come back another time lol..

All this agony I'd buried over decades of living with depression had a light shined on it; but the light didn't judge, or mock, or burn it away. It just bore witness to it.  It saw it, and acknowledged that the pain I had suffered was real, and terrible. And it told me, wordlessly, that no matter how horribly broken I thought I was, that it still loved me. That I was worthy of that love. And that even though I would go back into that dark place it would be with me always, even if I couldn't feel it.  It stayed with me as I wept; as I poured out all this pain and suffering I had just learned to live with, accepting it as a normal part of everyday life. It stayed with me as I wept, wishing it would be present to me always, but knowing that the experience would end, and that I would eventually lose sight of its presence.

@wetwaredistributor6770,"Honestly, I think videos like this are kind of naïve at best, at worst attributing something to drugs that doesn't actually happen. I tripped on acid, shrooms, DMT many times when I was in my early 20's and severely depressed. None of it 'fixed' me. Some of it probably made me worse. I did have some cool experiences but it did not 'change the direction of' my life. I know tons of people who would tell you it profoundly altered the course of their life, but from the external view they still live exactly as they did beforehand.. It's a popular thing to claim, is what i'm saying.  I'm not saying it can't help. I know there is some scientific proof of it being a good tool when used in conjunction with therapy, even going as far as minimizing PTSD symptoms and helping prevent relapse in addiction. The key word there is ""therapy"". Normal people unexperienced with psychedelics should not be running out to try 'heroic' doses of shrooms in an attempt to fix depression or PTSD. Guaranteed some of you are going to have a very bad time if you do this.  You need a pleasant setting, you need sober helpers/friends nearby who are experienced with what you're about to go through, and even then, you may still have a horrible time. It depends entirely on the person. And if you do have a horrible time, a bad trip if you will, it can exacerbate the very same issues videos like this claim it will fix.   I kind of hate that people talk about these drugs as a spiritual experience that can only do good. It can absolutely make you worse and you may be unlucky and find that out first hand if you don't respect it. I would literally never suggest this shit would work for everyone, nor would I suggest everyone should try it. Some people aren't cut out for the experience. It can be uncomfortable, scary, leave you feeling worse than before and for a long while too, after the fact. It's not a cure-all and if you're hoping for mental health improvement, do it in conjunction with therapy. Probably going to get some shit for saying this from the ""hallucinogens are the best!"" crowd but I have roughly 20 years of experience with this shit and the pop-culture effect has worn off on me. These drugs are too strong and have effects that are so different from person to person that you should never suggest everyone try them. One person may have a swell time and the next may jump out of a 3rd story window terrified for their life because they're seeing something that isn't there and have forgotten they're under the influence of a substance, (something I have actually seen happen).  I'm not saying don't do it. I'm just saying the ""it'll fix everything!"" crowd have their head up their asses. There is some medical legitimacy to these drugs helping but the same could be said for antidepressants, and those definitely don't work for everyone. The same is true here. Be safe if you want to test this out for yourself, and the 'therapy' component is more important than the drug in these situations. The drug can potentiate those sessions and help you achieve maximum benefit. On it's own, it's just an altered state of mind. Be safe.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

@brosobloo,"Okay first let me say, everything I say should be taken with a grain of salt, be aude perhaps the subject hits a bit close to home because I've tried a couple different psychadelics under the watch of a couple doctors now, and just feel that there's a lot of misinterpreting that goes on and not enough explananing.  So I'll just start by ask how many people only psychadelics once. Rather I'd like to poll how many people used it ""once"" so it changed them and now they are just doing psychadelic cycles regularly? Cause I feel like that number is abnormally high. And I've found a number of doctors that are into psychadelics science are usually avid users as well (and quite a few of them are poly substance users it seems). So I usually try to understand that they will have a positivity bias. (Which like reminds me of like the early 1800's. Here drink this super alcohol slurry so you won't feel as bad. Then you start drinking alcohol cause a doctor told you, you won't feel as bad...) But I don't think as many people are getting help as they think. I'm not saying there aren't cases where people aren't getting helped immensely, because there clearly are. However I am saying from my experience,  most of the licensed psychadelics psychologist/ therapists that I've talked to, that are psychonauts,really seem to really push clientele and potential clientele to try ""take the medicine"", to the point where the therapy seems second to the ""medicine."" Now this portion could only be me but, I feel it creates this cloud disillusion where, you want to believe a lot of the story's you here about people getting better, but then they just sound like the fake euphoria and eureka moments you hear about frequently when people take psychadelics. ( Like let's remember people abuse drugs including psychadelics because they make you feel good) So I see it like this, if you are going to get therapy so you can change your life forever with one experience, why do so many I know seem to go back so many times? Like if your life changing experience is every few weeks, is your life really changing or are you just in the mind space and thought pattern that you think it is, and you feel better because you under the influence? Or have you been conned into feeling like you have a strong connection to thoughts, people and objects because you were extra vulnerable to stimuli, and told you should feel and think different after taking the medicine. For reference Mother is psychadelic psychiatrist, and  between her the psychadelics doctors, hercolleagues and herself, (I've met a few other psychadelic psychiatrists and therapist that she doesn't know or associate with but the bulk that I have met have been through ber) only 1 out of about 25 aren't frequent users of some kind. Which range from THC, psilocybin, MDMA and ketamine all the way to peyote, ayahuasca and buffo alvarius. And of that group again, only  3 people took less than 2 psychadelic substances in about a 3 month time frame. So again, everything I said with a grain of salt, but I felt I should share my perspective because it's not stays quo.",2년 전,1,

There are herbs you can use to help as well, like oil or oregano, chicory and burdock to supplement daily health. Psilocybin mushrooms play a vital role in conscious awareness and introspect. You will realize, when on a light trip what you have been missing and what you are doing that is toxic. The experience is clean and mustn't be tainted with other drugs or done by people who ""just wanna have fun"". Respect mushrooms, thank them and that energy will ensure you have a good trip. Just having awareness and going in without fear is very important. Work out some of your fears and triggers prior and don't trip with someone who triggers you or has been known to have little self control.

Another time I had grown shrooms in a big jar shroom farm and the last little shroom I ate had like all the psilocybin was in it.   Full blown intense psychedelic experience -- very lsd like.  Everything was alive.  Palm trees were like persons. Cars had faces and eyes and could stretch around corners like a snake.  Buildings were alive and bent and swayed in rythymic union.  Walking was like swimming through jello -- the air was alive like a blob.  People looked like all their dna history was dancing on their faces.

As far as the effects of each drug the experiences are almost identical in that they are both unpredictable and capable of causing the same sensations. I’d say the only real difference is that LSD lasts longer, at least in my experience.  Like you, I also would take psychedelics and wander the world taking to strangers. I made a tons of new friends that way, many of which never suspected I was tripping and were shocked to find out when I’d tell them years later. I was always “high” but not high enough to make other uncomfortable. People were always very receptive to me when I was on it.

I can get down into the smaller picture, but I'm very cognizant that I go there at the expense of the big picture. It has always felt like the lens of a camera to me. If I dial in the lens to bring things up close into focus, the bigger picture goes blurry. I think I like the big picture, because hate, fear, sadness lose their strength in the big picture. One can see their effects there, but they become more abstract. But love, compassion, empathy really come into focus in the big picture.

We took a walk and I admired each plant, from the tiniest sprig of grass in the sandy soil, to the towering pine trees. They were all fascinating. I stared into a small creek watching the ripples of light bounce off the water making wonderful visuals.

@cyrusstark1435," @JesseP.Watson    The biggest culprit has been the spread of toxic positivity since the social media age began.  Because of technology, we always feel under the microscope, so always feel the need to fake a smile and carry on with a stoic acceptance of our suroundings. Which was already a problem in society ever since the 50's when toxic positivity first introduced itself through evangelical Christianity and it's crusade for a ""better world"".   It quickly spread into the corporate atmosphere and you can tell when phrases like, ""fake it till you make it"" and ""smile and the world smiles with you."" Type rhetoric.   And arguably, came about even before then!   But I digress, currently, it's in politics, modern spirituality, trying to slam it's way into psychology.  It's this unhealthy, pervasive notion that everyone has to be comfortable and happy all the time. And as a result, we've become so distrusting of anyone who doesn't automatically play into our echo chamber, that we've began to board ourselves in.  COVID and technology only exacerbated the rate at which it is spreading.   So, we now have an atmosphere where anyone can claim an offense for being ""uncomfortable"" people with status and people with power do everything they can to avoid accountability because it makes them ""uncomfortable.""

@Pnw208,"My experience with 11g of mushrooms;. It was not the typical geometric colors and shapes I was used to. The come up came strong and fast and with it  came extreme agony.  I had taken on all the pain I had ever caused anyone all at the same time. I wept while hypervtilating. I couldnt see because the amount of tears. I couldnt speak for lack of breath.I curled up in a ball and was completely taken over by the experience. My mind unlocked memories going back to childhood. It was like (life flashing before my eyes) but only the pain. I then blacked out (I truly believe I died bit it cont be proven) and went to Hell. It was complete darkness. I had never imagined black could be so dark. I experienced the worst emotional torture you could possibly imagine. Worse that the memories and pain before. I knew the pain  was from being completly seperated from God. I cried out for him endlessly with nothing  but silence and darkness to comfort me. The moment befor Jesus let out his last breath he said ""father why have you forsaken me."" It was at this moment Jesus felt the worst pain of his crucifixion. Worse than all his wounds. The pain wasnt physical but spiritual. God could no longer connect to him because he had taken on all the sin of mankind. This is what I felt weeping and gnashing of teeth but no fire or physical torture. It was something worse. After suffering frlor what seemed like forever I was saved. I was suddenly in a space filled with pure white light and knew I was in the presence of Jesus. This was the most beautiful and amazing feeling. Unlike any drug or experience could provide on earth. It was pure joy, not tarnished by subconcious guilt or shame. Not adultered by the underlying doubts or insecurities that are present even in the happiest times in your physical body.  A euphoria washed over my being with pure extacy. Ive done every drug known to man and nothing compares to this, it can not be described with words. I spent some time there and dont remember much about what was said but i know we where talking. I remember when it was time to go and i remember begging him not to send me back because I was suicidal and extremely depressed at the time. He said my time on earth wasnt done and then I woke up. I ended up going to rehab the next week and remained sober fir the first time in my life. I now have a normal life. I married my best friend and we had 2 beautiful daughters.

Then, in the void I saw a sphere covered in fire. I soon realized I was actually looking at the dark side of the Earth, and each spot of fire were cities, smouldering and billowing smoke into the atmosphere and killing the trees and grass.  Then I started flying extremely fast, and I rotated around the planet. When I came to the light side of the planet I saw massive forests and mountains consuming the burning cities, blanketing them in their green and burying them beneath the mountains as the smoke slowly stopped pouring into the atmosphere. Then, I heard a loud blast of wind, and my body shot back into my body way down on Earth at a thousand miles an hour, I even recognized Chicago (where I stayed at that time) as I was sent down.   During all of this, I felt terror and confusion as I saw the black sphere of fire floating in a void, sadness and guilt at the realization that it was humanity my own people hurting Earth setting it ablaze, and relief and happiness when I understood what I was experiencing, the Earth rebounding from an infection. It was marvelous and terrifying all at the same time.  I took this as a lesson that we can never kill our Earth, it will eventually bury us and our mistakes, just like our distant ancestors who they are still digging up to this day.

I'm confused why he says 30-40mg is a heroic dose.......is that a mistake?  Terrance McKenna took +5g, which is definitely not 30-40mg.  I have taken 3-3.5g on multiple occasions.  The first time was debilitating (I was safe) and I could barely walk from my chair to the bathroom.  But the experience was not life-changing.  I took 3.5g a few weeks ago and it was underwhelming.  I didn't even have a comeup, it didn't even make me emotional, and it didn't ""show me"" anything.  I was disappointed.  I have committed to tripping monthly on the full moon for 12 months, slowly increasing my dose when I feel ready.  I am still waiting for a profound or ""most meaningful experience of my life"" sort of experience.  Maybe I will reach that at a true heroic dose of 5g.  But so far, I am underwhelmed by psilocybin.  I am also disappointed that the trip lasts about 2 hours.  I wish it lasted longer.

@b1nary_f1nary,"Do you do internal work on yourself while in a decent or strong experience? Because I'm learning more and more that the key with real change and healing coming from a mushroom trip is the conscious therapy part. To be strongly introspective and analyse yourself and your problems. By conscious I mean being vocal about it in your mind or even speaking aloud rather than just letting yourself heal. Facing the negative and traumatic thoughts in your head, and talk through them like you are at a psychiatrist but by yourself. In my opinion, during an experience on mushrooms is the only time you will actually be ready to face some negative parts of your mind that need addressing. I used to be under the impression that just having the trip will be healing your mind, which it does, but I'm convinced now that the most important part is having the therapy with yourself at the time and addressing the problematic thoughts, and of course the good thoughts as well. This is coming from a sufferer of sever depression for the last 3 years.

A few days ago, I started taking a high-quality magnesium supplement a friend sent me. She said it had helped others she knows. Every morning since the first dose, I’ve felt very different. I’m shocked that something so simple as a vitamin can have this much effect. I’ve dealt with depression for over 40 years and have taken about 15 different anti-depression medications. Some made things worse, some did nothing and the rest worked but with so many side effects that it wasn’t worth it. This is completely different.

@alistairclark6814,"I wish people would focus on why micro dosing works instead of just saying it works without explanation. Microdosing merely throws us off our game just slightly so we focus more on the present moment rather than repeatedly dwelling on pasts or predicting negative futures. This allows the brain the opportunity to create new, healthy habits of thought and the ability to conciously change our habits of thought. And that is the key. Steering the ship so to speak instead of being a passenger. We choose our habits of thought and emotion when we decide that we have that ability. We can do the same by merely rearanging our routine every day, step on cracks, in puddles and take the inconvenient long way in simple situations. Just do things that put the breaks on habitual reflexive reactions and decide first before reacting. Merry Christmas everyone and constantly make the decision to steer your ship. You don't need drugs to do it but microdosing absolutely helps keep you in the present moment, adds euphoria, hightens senses and opens you up to believing you have the ability to choose your state of mind.🎄🍻😁",2년 전(수정됨),3,

@HeartFeltGesture,"​ @buddahmaster  The psychedelic experience restores Faith, that is its highest worth. To glimpse the uninhibited Joy of Being without obstruction. But we descend back into our pain because the state is unearned in the sense of Sadhana or spiritual work, which can not be by-passed, you cant trick your way into Heaven. To remain in the Native state of Love-Bliss, you must know how you got there, and how you are staying there. This is only possible through the conscious work of self-transcendence. The ego is like the physical mass of a rocket-ship trying to travel at the speed of light, the faster you go the heavier the mass of the object. The ego can not co-exist with the speed of light, the vibration of Consciousness Itself, the ego can only be transcended, the false ego-""I"" identity can only be forgotten in moment-to-communion with Reality Itself.  Faith restored, the difficult spiritual work must still be done, through meditation and trauma work (if there is any), whatever your path is, you can not catch a magic-carpet ride to the end and stay there, using psychedelics. But there is merit in the experience.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

But if a substance increased that by 5-10% or more that would be an unacceptable margin thus such a thing would need to be banned as it would become a major problem in their ability to control the masses given enough time.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@johnnychainsaws5914,"I am a disabled veteran with Bipolar 1 and combat related PTSD. I am greatly improved because of psychedelics. Specifically: Pharmahuasca, vaporized DMT, mushrooms, and ketamine. When the depression hits so hard you stop eating, sleeping all day, barely drink water, and do absolutely zero selfcare, the coping techniques don’t work. I have an 8mg per squirt nasal spray of ketamine. Two rounds up each nostril (32mg total @220lbs) and about 15 minutes, the crushing weight of the darkness is simply disbursed.   I was once experiencing an intense PTSD spiral and was able to dose ~5mg of vaporized DMT to find relief. There was no psychedelic experience. I simply felt the ""afterglow"" of peace and contentment with all existence. In 30 seconds, I went from a hyper-emotion state of spiraling grief to being at peace because of a small dose of vaporized DMT. This was an application I had hypothesized and knew the opportunity would genuinely present itself. Vaporized DMT is a rescue med in this application. I was on the verge of being possibly hospitalized, and definitely sedated, from a core trauma trigger that sent me spiraling (shaking, crying, and suffering incredible emotional pain), and a subthreshold dose of DMT saved me. Within a minute, I had rebalanced emotionally and thought, ""Holy shit. I'm ok."" And truly, I was.  60mg (@220lbs) of Pharmahuasca had me fall in love, and then become love on my first dose. I had tripped about 30-40 times before this on mushrooms and some limited exposure to LSD. This trip was transformative. It changed how I saw the world. Instead of a lens of suffering and emptiness, I saw love in all things, the beauty that exists all around us, and love that it took to create this wonderful existence for us to experience.  Early on, I was so empty and depressed for so long, I forgot what happiness was. I took a 3.5g of baseline cubensis and, for 4 hours, I was happy and free from the depression. After I realized I had a 4-hour window of relief, I started dosing every 7 days, so I would just not be in one stage of crying or another for a few hours during the day. This is not recommended use and was an extreme situation where I was overmedicated and was so empty, I would just sit and cry because I had to endure another day of a miserable existence of suffering and pain. We adjusted my meds and my use went down to once every few months pretty quickly. Please forgive my overuse, but this is what I had to do to make it through that period.  * I would rather someone tolerance-trip on psychedelics based on this anecdotal account than to hurt themselves because of their pain.

@blakebeaton8410,"Hero doses are transformative when done right. Years of chronic pain, depression and minor childhood traumas had twisted me. I wanted to be dead but didn't want to die. I wouldn't admit my shame and I didn't really know it was there. Then I was offered shrooms so I dug up the studies to calculate the ""correct dose"" (~4.5-5g with Cubensis).  The first few trips were euphoric. Years of muted emotions caused their return to feel intense. The feeling exceeded the euphoria of cocaine in almost every way. But no one else I know has experienced euphoria.   Just like in the video, I was in bed with a blindfold and music. But I was cuddling my wife skin-to-skin. Whenever she left for a minute, I felt an intense decline in my euphoria. The same happened when the music would stop. I would not have voluntarily left that state for almost any reason.   But there was no desire whatsoever to re-enter the euphoria once it faded. When it was over, I wanted to explore my new state of consciousness unimpeded by the effects of the mushrooms. I felt clear-headed and emotionally neutral from a state of relative negativity.   I did 6-8 hour fasts followed by hero doses every few weeks for about a month (not sure if fasting changed things). On my 3rd trip, I felt my diaphragm release and I started breathing more deeply. I had (apparently) developed a subconscious pattern of tension that constricted my breathing. I have been mindful to keep it relaxed since then.   Slowly the euphoria faded away though. I no longer feel the same way when I do a hero dose. I think that there may be a special window at the beginning of therapy when your doses are re-wiring your brain most effectively. Having the right setting on the first few trips may be extremely important. I recommend skin-to-skin with an intimate partner or family member. Music and a comfortable place to rest are a must.   On a later trip, I actually perceived tension in my muscles that I could not perceive normally. I spent several hours on one trip stretching my arms and fingers intensely (I looked crazy for sure). I later learned that I had a muscular deformity in my shoulder (long story), which may explain some of those perceptions. It has not happened again on any trip since. Maybe 3 hours of contorting fixed it.   But one of the most important trips ever was when I realized that I carried much shame. Shrooms allowed me to recognize it objectively. The feeling came up and I was acutely aware of what it was. I was relatively aware of why I felt shame, but it also took some thought to fully understand. Luckily, thinking is largely unimpeded even when you are very high. (It is mostly what you care about that changes, so your thoughts focus on those things to the exclusion of most else). By recognizing the shame and its causes, I was able to challenge it, come to terms with it and alter my thinking. I had to accept guilt for some of the shame (another long story), which may not be healthy, but I no longer suffer it: I co-exist with it relatively unbothered with how others perceive me. In a way, I came to understand and accept what I cannot control. The shrooms allowed me to recognize and label an emotion more effectively. There was just no hiding from it actually, nor was it painful to confront.    Overall, mushrooms healed me a great deal. I am by no means fixed entirely, but I no longer want to be dead. Unfortunately, I am still twisted from my childhood. Years of social anxiety (possibly social phobia) caused by childhood traumas has changed my personality (IMHO). I gravitate to solitude because I have learned enjoy it despite its effects on my mental health. Shrooms helped me to recognize that trauma and resulting shame were how I got this way though.   A trained therapist during my trips may have helped to reshape my thinking. I could have gone in a dramatically healthier direction despite the amazing effects. A lengthy course of therapy before shrooms could help unearth issues that could then be explored while high. Then you could really work out the kinks on your trip. It helped that I had been challenging my own thinking since taking psychology courses years earlier (where I learned of mushroom therapy). It could likely work in reverse too: shrooms first then lengthy courses of therapy.   I was thinking of doing another hero dose this Christmas. But I have no skin to cuddle (out of town) and there will be no euphoria to speak of. My relationships are in need of repair (longest story) and that won't happen (in my case) while I am high. But they were not damaged because I was high. If anything, they are much better because I transformed in the presence of my loved one and she got to understand me better.

Turns out later on I was told not to feel guilty about having a bad trip and seeing horrible goblins (because doing shrooms is naughty), not to feel guilty about people's disapproval, not to feel guilty about anything. Talk about a meta trip. That was the positive aspect. It included feelings of extreme nausea (about to vomit), then a few seconds later, perfect physical peace and even feelings of bliss... then back to retching when I saw how I felt guilt, then back to peace when I kind of saw how unnecessary it was. It was intensely physical as well as mental.  On the negative side, I experienced reality melting down. I understood eternity and God, who was a geometric union of good and evil, far beyond our usual comprehension, though I was able to comprehend it at the time.

@lyngeorgy8861,"I think if people start assuming after watching this video that psychedelics is that one stop solution to all mental health problems, and its been kept from the masses with some mal- intent, a lot of the truth that Dr Mathew tried to share gets lost.  Therefore am highlighting the very things he mentions to reaffirm the half that we tend to miss in such videos-  1.For starters if we listened closely to just this video all by itself- he brings out how set and setting is crucial, how sensitively guided the process should be. The ethics of the practice. what I 'm trying to draw attention here is to discard a rudimentary dichotomous way of having looked at psychedelics throughout history as 'good' versus 'bad'. Instead, the a more nuanced higher order wholistic view of its place in ones journey, and how it should be then used and not abused.   2. case in point the issues of abuse- of boundaries - ""the guru complex"" for example  When one enters this altered state safety is of the highest importance and am referring to psychic safety as well.  3. Also to highlight and I quote-   '''I kind of think of all of these disorders as different forms of addiction. So whether it's to a substance like tobacco or alcohol, cocaine, or a way of thinking about yourself, it's this narrowed mental and behavioral repertoire: reality used to be like this, and now your reality is like this. ""   Here  he himself is referring how a NARROWING of REALITY is at the heart of mental illness and suffering,  and ironically if we start having a narrow view of psychedelics instead of a wholistic view , something beautiful and transformative can get twisted and we might find ourselves swinging the opposite end of healing and end up with a new cycle of addiction.

@aliasofanalias7448," @codemiesterbeats  Hahahaha mate I burst out laughing at nomeclametrue. You took yourself on a word journey lol, that's just the kinda trip I take myself on when I start pondering, I'm happy you shared this with me. My most prominent one was a duo trip with my mate, I was having a bad time and he was having a great time, he asked me to come touch a tree, he said after the trip he was feeling the tree, like feeling it's life force, but when I touched his trunk my life force would override what he was feeling, so I had to find my own trunk (it was one of those split trees that seem like they have 2 trunks). My trippy theory at the time for what had happened was I was on an erratic emotional frequency whereas my mate was on earth frequency which our ears can't actually pick up but we swear we felt it when we touched the tree. So basically the tree healed me and took me out of the bad trip by aligning our frequencies, so me and my mate were now operating on exaxtly the same wavelength. I always said you can't trip with someone else, like you can be with someone but you're often having different experiences if ykwim, well we actually tripped together in this moment, it was like our minds became one, so I now realise you can really trip together. Then we started having a realisation about time and how the trees perception of us hugging it was just a blip in it's existence, but we were literally hugging the tree for about an hour 😂😂, was so funny thinking about the steroptypical image we had created. This is when the word thing started happening, I've not been to that place in my mind since and I don't understand it like I did when I was tripping but these are the words I remember: Time, tiles, reality, flipbook, braille. Fuck knows what Braille meant but we were so there at the time, we were just bouncing off each other like ""yeah yeah yeah! That's it! Wow!"" 😂  I'm off on a tangent now but I got in a well weird one the other day, I was thinking about conversation and inciting words, like how can you say something to someone to get an exact desired response, I was trying to make links and I just ended up in a perpetual loop of wondering how one could incite me inciting someone else 😂",2년 전,1,

@ili626,"This scientist’s comment on The Beatles reveals an oversimplified perspective.   The Beatles didn’t have one “big shift” like a light toggle turned on. It was more like a light fader gradually brightening. Beatles for Sale revealed a shift in lyrical themes influenced by Dylan, and Help was when cannabis had an influence.. also inspiring “Got to Get You into My Life” which was developed & recorded later  By the time Revolver came, they also reduced touring and had absorbed song forms and music in general for many years by then (incubated creative influences), and refined their independent writing informed by their unique and fertile partnered writing.   Eventually they stopped touring altogether when they created SGT Pepper’s.. Having all that free time to indulge songwriting and studio production was the main catalyst of change, coupled with George Martin’s expertise at scoring classical arrangements. To say this period of creativity was merely due to LSD is ludicrous.. if that was the case, many more bands and artists would’ve had similar creative breakthroughs, and that’s just not the case.   Conversely, other artists, such as Dylan had his creative zenith prior to that proliferation of LSD .. or as many see it, his creative output was fairly steady throughout, from Blowin’ In The Wind to Blood on The Tracks.    Then there’s LSD casualties such as Syd Barrett, who’s creativity fell off completely after his exposure to it.  Would The Beatles have produced those late albums without LSD?  Perhaps not, but it was only one influence among many in a complex evolution. Similarly, I would argue (as a person has partaken and has had transformative experiences) that LSD works with other influences or environmental inputs.. Perhaps similar in a sense to epi-genetics and gene expression",2년 전(수정됨),0,

It’s all just made up and so can be made differently. No wonder those in power during the 60s were afraid.

It did not lead to a world of peace and love, and most of those folks wouldn't even touch the stuff these days, they have had plenty.. And as part of that plenty, some trips are fun, some seem profound, some are awful. Point being as much as it seems like your speaking with the gods, the truth is your simply tripping.  That's all. Do it again in a few days and instead of speaking with the gods you'll be talking to a turtle.  This is the same way for the last few years we've heard crazy shit like pot cures migraines, or weed cures cancer.. If ya wanna trip, trip. If you wanna spend your days studying each trip and looking deeply into it, then go for it. But be intellectually honest about it and recognize the truth of it is that its no more important that what you might experience in a dream, and then forget just as soon as you wake. In fact that's exactly what it is, and all it is. Its just a fuck'n trip. It's not a message from god. It's not the answer to every psychological sickness, in fact it can agitate some illnesses and even cause other psychological issues to surface. And it's not some sorta profound contact with an ancient alien race.  I'm happy to smoke weed, but i sure as hell know its not gonna cure my hemorrhoids. And maybe tomorrow night I might toss down 4 grams of the mushroom's I have. And while it will be pretty fun, I certainly don't expect my entire life to be profoundly effected the next day.

@kimberknutson831,"Thank you. This was brilliant and profound. It seems to me that this perfectly dovetails with all of the recent work on the effects of childhood trauma and neglect.  People like Dr. Besel Van der Kolk and Dr. Gabor Mate have really changed the way we think about and treat trauma. They both have personal, first-hand experience with childhood trauma, which I think makes their work all the more meaningful and powerful. Having both gone down the traditional Freudian ""talk therapy"" road and gotten nowhere themselves, they both explored and pioneered alternative forms of treatment.  For personal and professional reasons, I have read all of the standard psychological ""heavy hitters,"" like Freud, Jung, Klein, Kristeva, Winicott and others, and I have also personally benefitted greatly from ""talk therapy.""  I have, however, also been reeling for a couple of years since my current therapist recommended Besel Van der Kolk's book, The Body Keeps the Score. The idea that the body carries a ""record"" of our every experience at the ""cellular level"" often unbeknownst to the mind, that ""voice in our head,"" is astounding.  In order to survive certain events in our primary circumstances, we may deny, repress, suppress, sublimate, etc. the traumatic memories, but our bodies remember.  Both of these doctors recommend therapies that target the body specifically, and these therapies must necessarily involve approaches that are ""beyond words.""  I can see how psychedelics could be similarly helpful at untying what Joseph Campbell refers to as ""psychological knot points.""  I have believed for some time that humanity is in the midst of a paradigm shift on every level.  To express this in broad strokes, it seems to me that we are moving away from a time in which our leaders in public positions and in the home rule by fear, domination, cruelty, neglect, exploitation, etc. to a time in which leaders in public and private recognize and appreciate difference, diversity, inclusion, kindness, warmth, generosity, compassion, empathy, and, dare I say it, love. The latter are infinitely better ways to lead and to live for everyone concerned.   The former Orange American president's current circumstances are serving as a kind of symbolic measuring stick of this paradigm shift. No, the fifties was not a better time when anything could happen behind closed doors, and no authority would intervene. The ""nuclear family"" itself is a very modern invention that has never reflected reality for most Americans, let alone the rest of the world. A former teacher of mine, Stephanie Koontz, wrote a book in the nineties called The Way It Never Was in response to the ""Family Values"" BS that Dan Quayle and other politicians were lauding at the time.   I allude to the fifties because people like Timothy Leary and Terence McKenna were marginalized in their time for questioning public and private power structures.   There were many others like them, of course, but while these folks were trying to change the world for the better, others were watching Lawrence Welk while the Vietnam War was happening.  Good grief.  Obviously, psychedelics are scary to dominators because an ""expanded"" mind is much harder to control. Finally, I think that one ""silver lining"" to the whole COVID epidemic is that it brought the mental health crisis to the forefront. My  therapist says that our society has been structured to support insanity rather than sanity for a long, long time. I agree, but maybe this is changing.  A girl can dream. : )   Thank you for this excellent presentation.   I really appreciated it and will share it with others. : )",2년 전,1,

We just ever developed the habit with Lily, although we watched lots of movies and TV shows on DVD together.    Regarding Facebook, I used to tell me students that I already knew more than enough about them and could not care less what they had for dinner and assumed that they felt the same about me. : ) I am not interested in the professional psychedelic experience for myself, but I think my husband would benefit greatly from it.

That occurred - after this experience - I was aware of stealing serotonin for others - and immediately sensed the behavior - I used this not only in relationships but also in a career as a university teacher.  Just as important, this obliteration of my self occurred, smithereens, flotsam and jetsam, extermely disorienting - it took about 8 months for the coalescence - but the transformation is still underway 23 years later....Here is my report of the experience...just so you guys have an idea of what is possible...The Ayahuascero gave me 90 mls of the bitter brown brew. He called it “The Shaman’s Dose.” The “Hero’s Dose” was 40 mls. The other eleven people in tonight’s ceremony choked down only 15 mls. We each were given a pillow, a foam mat, and a little white plastic bucket. We laid in a circle, feet pointing to the center.  	As the nausea drudged in through a swamp of putrid odors, I inhaled as much air as possible and let the exhale out under its own weight - making sure I slipped down below the nausea with each. In this way I avoided puking and was able to fall asleep as the others were filling their buckets.  	Twister appeared. What a gift to assuage my regret. As usual, I mounted bareback and gripped his mane and ribs. He leaped through the threshold. Already at full gallup, down down swerving down the tunnel to a chamber. In total opaque silent dark, I dismounted and fell asleep on the floor.  	My wrist watch burst into flame then melted like one of Dali’s clocks. An eye the size of a basketball blinked at me. In the flash of light an enormous dragon crouched. Black green, a stag buck with a full rack. 	As usual, I mounted then reached around his scaly neck with arms and legs.  Wood creaking way back and to the left end of the chamber, the dragon moved toward the sound. A portal opened. We slipped through and flew down the steam tunnel. Swerve diving he was breathing hard, but not steam: flames. The flames reached around his head. What’s burning?  	We landed in a dank stone chamber. I fell asleep again. In the total darkness, a creaking wood sound woke us up and directed the dragon to another portal. I jumped on. Gripped his neck with arms and legs. We leapt through. Spiraling down, flames from his nostrils lighting our way and burning off more of my flesh. Until a pure calcium skeleton was all that was left on the floor of the chamber. We were on the bottom of the bottom. 	The Ayahuascero and his wife were standing over me. With a look on both their faces like they had just been asked a spelling bee question without a clue as to how to spell the word, and worse yet, couldn’t even guess. (The word must have started with silent letters.) They seemed relieved when I asked to go to the bathroom. I felt relieved I remembered how to use my mouth to speak. 	While peeing I could feel the texture of molecules as they traveled down  and out then fell into the toilet. People said Ayahuasca creates an out of body experience, the truth is: it was the most connected to my body I have ever felt. Returning to the ceremony room, I took my place on the floor pad among the other journeyers, purged into my little plastic pail, closed my eyes, got small and crawled into a liver nephron to learn how to expedite detoxing the caffeine and nicotine molecules waiting in their respective queues.  	Eleven of the twelve of us sat in a circle drinking tea. We were supposed to “debrief” by sharing our “da-vine” journey experiences. Nick said he remembered trying to make love to the Ayahuascero’s hot wife, then paused to watch us all gasp, before he went on to explain the only problem was: she happened to be a plant at the time.  	When the talking stick made its way to me, I felt putting the astounding ineffable experience into words would obviously fall short. I could’ve told them about Twister turning into a dragon and burning off all my flesh but that still wouldn’t measure up to all that was learned. “Look, you know I cant explain what actually happened last night.” They all nodded. “Maybe it would be better if I just show you by using a ritual the Goddess taught me somewhere along the way.” That offer lit up the Ayahuascero’s hot wife. “Please do,” she cooed.  	I dont really know when during the night I learned it. It just seemed natural and felt comfortable to perform. (Sure was weird that something so strange, that I had never done anything like before, would now feel entirely comfortable, as if I had performed it hundreds of times.)  	I asked the journeyer sitting next to me for her left hand. She willingly offered it. Cradling her left hand palm up, in mine, and holding it open with the tips of our fingers, I ever so gently exhaled 4 lung breaths into the center of her palm. Turning my head to the side to deeply inhale then over the center to gently exhale. Not shaping the breath with my lips, not blowing: I relaxed and opened my throat so the breaths would come only from releasing my diaphragm. I forced the inhale, but let the exhale flow into her hand of its own accord. Four “lung breaths.” Then I took her palm and delicately planted four sweet kisses on the same place the breaths went in. (Like you would kiss the cheek of your own infant) Then I folded her fingers closed into a fist. Then gently, in slow motion, placed the fist on top of her sternum. Ever so slowly, gradually withdrawing my fingers with a delicate caress of her knuckles.  	I asked her how she felt. She said, “Good, warm, self-love.”    *   *   *    	A month later, at a child’s guitar lesson, a warm up to the ritual was added so both people are comfortably in the “alternate state” when the lung breathes are delivered. This is done by looking into each others eyes until each person sees two eyes turn into four eyes. This may take from 15 seconds to four minutes. Also, both people should be grounded - standing on dirt or grass without shoes.  	Later I performed the Lung Breath-Palm Kiss Ritual on two people with cancer, one with spastic bowel syndrome, four children (guitar students) with ADHD (and taught their mothers how to perform it), my wife, my father, along with about 30 members of the Jarawa Tribe living in the Andaman Islands of India.

We drunk and ate  more mushroom thea and mushroons then we anticipated for as it was foreseen for 5 adults . Where three of them bailed out last moment. And we us two decied to go for a hike in the nearby Woods  , after we consumed all mushroom related foods. It was autum and it was full of local mushrooms. The thing what strikes us both was that :  We could talk without saying something to eachother . We felt the same , saw and heared exactly the same . As we could hear an occasional thought of eachother☆☆☆☆☆ Truely we where one . Also all mushroom in the forrest  had halo' s of different Colors,  emiting out of them. Every specie had a different hue or intensity.  Truely very wonderfull ! But then still amazed by "" the colors"" of the mushrooms . I felt an very strong pulling force , upward..?! Like anti gravity , i looked up , and saw masive Black clouds turning around in a virtex like a huricane !! I only , and barely could speak following wordt to my friend : "".. lookup phillipe !.."" (my friend) He lookedup ..and saw exacty the same trip ..vision ! A blackhole-a-like tornado pulling him up also ! He promptly said "" john (me) come we gotta get out of this open spot in the Woods!..., ""It"" tries to pull us up in to that massive hurricane !"".... We did and in the pouring Rain , that sounded like 5 times harder than it normaly should , we slowly faded i to reality as we walked on. (4h walk btw)🤩🙃 What i always wondered is , what would happend if i let myself suck up into that massive vortex??... Would like to know that answer ?

@artiescree4241,"I've had quite a few trips over the years.  Maybe 15 or 20 of those were heroic doses of mushrooms of 5 grams or above and of one trip of 8.5 grams.  Speaking from my own expirence, I feel like the risk of bad trips and the idea of a trip suddenly turning from good to bad to be a bit over stated. Generally, it doesn't play out that way. If one knows what he or she is getting into and has done a bit of mental preparation beforehand, the risk is almost nill. The problem arises when a person begins to fight the expirence either out of fear or because he or she has encountered negative emotions during the trip and does not understand that they will pass naturally if not focused upon.   For those that are worried though, there are strategies for coping with a difficult journey. First,  If you find yourself on an uncomfortable ride, change your setting. Turn the lights off or on, switch the song or go get some fresh air. The mood of your physical place can affect your mental state.  Also, try to drink a soda or some juice. Sometimes a cold way too sweet refreshment hits your already over hyped senses hard enough to snap you out of a negative thought loop.  Next, say yes to the expirence. That sounds like woowoo self-help nonsense but things might get weird during your psychedelic journey and fighting it is always the wrong answer.  Let the trip wash over you without resistance and it will pass easily.  Finally, and this is likely controversial and definitely counterintuitive, but bigger doses (of mushrooms and the other classic psychedelics) are easier to cope with than smaller ones. If the trip overwhelms you, you won't have the time or inclination to to worry about cares, insecurities, personal and et cetera because of the profoundly altered state you will find yourself in which will allow you to truly enjoy the expirence.",2년 전,3,

@ximonwhhatt3796, @SahilP2648  It's something you have to go through yourself if you want to seek the answers. The questions you have are very personal to who you are and my questions to life and how I perceive my reality may be very different from yours.   Maybe you might have different views of religion or spirituality and that can greatly affect how you see your existence.  But for a person like me who has been dabbling between Buddhism and taoism. I had a sense of being able to achieve greater meditative achievements. I feel like when there is a collective of people meditating with the similar mindset of buudah we become more connected to the world and we can explore the world that was created by that particular spiritual being.  It's incredibly hard to explain because so many things happen and everything is so incredibly complex. Because there is so much information flowing through my brain.   I feel you will have a better understanding of everything if you want to find out. seek the answers yourself and you'll appreciate it more.  I could write on and on about everything I've experienced. It would be very long.,2년 전,1,
@SahilP2648," @ximonwhhatt3796  yeah if you want to write you can, no pressure. I do think like you in a certain way. From my perspective, there are 4 layers. Think of an onion. Sentience is the outermost layer. It allows you to rationalize, think, imagine, decide, plan and then act. This layer does not rely on the senses to form actions, as in it's not fueled by your emotions. If you are working on a hard engineering problem then that would be an example. Consciousness is the next inner layer. It allows you to feel pain, happiness and all the other emotions and this feedback sometimes overpowers sentience to take decisions. This is also why animals with a primal instinct to hunt will hunt (survival) and prey will flee (fear). So animals are not sentient, only conscious. Then there's proto-consciousness which is what single cellular organisms experience. Even in a single cell they can decide where to move in search for food but they can't feel pain, they are only guided by their genetics to perform those actions along with entropy generating from quantum mechanics. And after that there's the pure essence of energy because without energy there's no life. I have a theory that, in the psychedelic fueled state of consciousness you lose sentience but your consciousness can interact with proto-consciousness and the pure energy essence back and forth (if you imagine a triangle). That allows you to experience a lot of things you cannot because of this onion-like structure without psychedelics. So in this higher state of consciousness it doesn't matter how you look or how much money you have or if you are missing a leg because your physical body is disconnected from this sentience layer. But you can feel emotions like happiness, sadness etc. because of this triangular connected structure of these 3 layers underneath.   Just to talk about the emergence of life though, I don't think it's possible without quantum mechanics. Usually quantum mechanics is 'contained' within atoms because outside an atom it's all classical. But for some reason quantum mechanics bled outside the atom and atoms became entangled through some weird conditions. That led to modern day life as we know it. Life, even single celled is random in nature. Life is a true source of entropy. Quantum mechanics is also a true source of entropy. Thus they are related. Most likely life is only possible because of quantum mechanics, and consciousness and sentience too in increasing orders of magnitude.",2년 전,1,
@neffy321," @SahilP2648  i just want to add my 2 cents^^ In my opinion on lsd (I think its almost the same as shrooms) I dived into the quantum world, your subconscious mind awakes and you can work on it. besides that normally when we are not on psychedelics our brain filters everything with our senses, everything we see hear touch,... but on psychedelics those filters are almost gone and thats why everything is so intense. I also had the feeling I am literally one with everything we are living in one atmosphere were everything is connected. you will feel it, i was in nature and just feel connected with everything.",2년 전,0,
@SahilP2648," @neffy321  yes when I did 1.5 gms for the first time I felt truly one with the universe. It was an amazing feeling of oneness.

I have not done it since but I do plan to go to a psych retreat in Jamaica and in a controlled setting with medical professionals who can take care of my body in case something happens, I can go all in without worrying and see the universe for what it is.

@TactlessGuy," @SahilP2648  For some people they get transported to a higher state of being. They may start seeing the universe as a set of patterns and metrics. For others it's more spiritual. They may start questioning morals and things that really matter to them. But the common experience is a feeling of one-ness with nature or the universe. Your consciousness breaks away from its rigidity and enters a high state of entropy where it ""melts"" with its surroundings and you start feeling as if each part of you is connected to the universe.",2년 전,0,

@RickarooCarew,"no known overdose... I checked... more than once...  do you know why?... psychedelics are neurotransmitters... they work carrying the signals across the gap between nerve cells... we have endogenous neurotransmitters called by scary names by our friends at Big Pharma.. cannabinoids work on the sending side...opiods work on the receiving side... there are 110 cannabinoids in the body.. 2 for each system in our body, an anion and cation... and one extra... THC... which is the component in medical cannabis that makes it work... the endogenous morphinans are called endorphins... there is also nociceptin... found in the cells of the blood brain barrier that carry a standing magnetic field between body and brain and back again that allows us to respond to the environment in real time... what happens on one side of a magnet happens to the other side at the same time... so.. no lag between stimulus and response.. avoiding hungry lions and hot stoves before we get hurt...  I'm pretty sure that's where psychedelics work... and they act like a superhighway for those signals... they are catalysts a catalyst facilitates a process but does not participate in it that means...  a... magnetic fields don't hurt us b... catalysts can't hurt us because they are not participating in the process like absolutely everything else in Life... you get out exactly what you put in... and sometimes a little bit more... not always...  it also depends on the intention going in ...  which depends on your ideas and thoughts.. beliefs.. just exactly like real Life what a trip ✌️",2년 전,0,

@samsel4262,"These people have a completely wrong sense of how trips scale. The “heroic dose” is said to be 5 dried grams taken in silent darkness. That’s more than most people think they can handle, but it’s actually a relatively tiny dose. Anything below 3 grams should be called a micro dose. Lots of people think they’ve had an ego death, when in reality they have no idea what that means, because you can’t know unless you’ve actually had one. And you cannot experience an ego death below ~15-20 grams. If you want to learn about the nature of yourself and reality, you need to macro-dose. Take 10, then 15, then 20, see how high you can go. I promise that there is a world of difference in every aspect of the trip for every 5 grams you add.

It's possible that without support and a positive environment surrounding us, we can slip back in old patterns of thought and rigid states of consciousness. I have experienced trauma directly after a trip that I felt had healed me, and I slipped straight back into the deep dark hole I had been stuck in prior. The trip is just the beginning. We owe it to our minds and bodies to dive deeper and develop habits that ultimately decide our journey. Breathwork, meditation, journaling. The relationship you have with your mind must be nurtured always. Psychedelics don't heal - they simply show you how. When you are lost, they will show you the way. When you are lonely, they will connect you. They will show you love and often that is enough to guide a person in the right direction.",2년 전,280,

@nousvideobusiness, @tanned06  Would you care to explain what you mean?,2년 전,0,
@nousvideobusiness," @christavanw7476  Big question. First I think it should be noted that adding extra chemicals into the equation can cause negative effects e.g. alcohol is probably the worst thing you can mix it with in my opinion. Alcohol lowers consciousness while the mushrooms elevate. I've smoked weed on a trip before - some people love it, others hate it. I prefer not to smoke as I often need the mental stability after a big trip. I also find that weed can create a lot of inner chatter, other times it helps me meditate on the nature of my thoughts and my relation to them, rather than my thoughts narrating for me. It's obvious that having a controlled environment (setting) is so important for guiding the trajectory of the trip. Music plays a big part for me personally. Being in nature is great in the summer, but being able to fully let go is most important, which I find easier to do on my sofa than in public. Feeling safe is priority, only then can you be open and let go. When you resist the waves of energy that move through you during a trip, that is when you will start to feel particularly uncomfortable. When you let go, deep emotions will come to the surface and release. I often experience a lot of laughter and crying at some point during the trip, followed by inner calm. It's all subjective of course, but we should distinguish between a bad trip and a hard trip. Sometimes we will let go and be faced with some really difficult truths about us, others or the world around us. That can be a difficult experience, but it doesn't mean it's bad. Where a bad trip might mean feelings of anxiety, paranoia... a hard trip may entail feeling pain - BUT - it's important that we feel this pain in order to release it from the surface of our bodies. This is essentially how we go about healing deep traumas that have been stored in our cells.",2년 전,8,

@integrativepsychonautics,"As a coach in the psychedelics space, as well as a veteran of 30 years of using them, I take slight issue with this video and videos of it's kind. I realize that this video is intended as a kind of puff piece aimed at a general audience, with the assumption that people are generally clear headed, neurotypical, and going to take this message with a modicum of caution but optimism. The problem is that the message of this video misinforms people either by implication, or by omission, and then when people come to work with someone like me, their expectations are completely misaligned with the reality of psychedelic experiences.   They'll come to me after following the 'advice' of a video like this, taking WAY too high of a dose for a beginner and wonder why they're having difficult and unproductive experiences. Or they'll come hoping that, even though they've never done any therapy or personal development work in their life and  have a lifetime of stuff to process, somehow they can get it all done in one trip and ""rewire their brain"". Then, when that fails to happen, they fall into discouragement or despair, or self judgment, or anger that psychedelics aren't getting them the instant result that is implied in videos like this. For many, psychedelics represent a last hope after every other form of medication and therapy has failed them. As a coach & hypnotherapist in the psychedelics space, I'm CONSTANTLY being approached by people who really aren't doing well-- whose brains aren't functioning optimally, who have been coping through mental and emotional distress for far too long on medications-- who take these types of videos out of context, make sweeping assumptions on the information being presented here, and then rush headlong into psychedelics without proper preparation and support. And to some degree, this mismatch between the reality of the firsthand experience of psychedelics and what is being presented in media like this video adds to the problems that these masses of desperate people end up having.   There's other information that is also missing in these videos, like all the failures behind closed doors in sessions in these studies, the teething pains of developing a clear understanding of psychedelic therapy inside the psychedelic therapy community, and the truth that many of the results touted from these studies don't show a permanent change in symptoms for the participants, but rather a reduction for a period of time, which still implies a sort of consumerist, take this medication to fix it approach to therapy, that ultimately doesn't resolve the underlying issue, but is just a better form of kicking the can down the road. Permanent healing is possible, but these studies don't address that. And the people come away with this confused sense that psychedelics are the new SSRIs or meds, rather than a paradigm that can eliminate the need for meds altogether.  My hope is that as the push for legalization continues, there is a refining of the messaging so that people more accurately know what to expect. Not just the extreme end of the potentials in the positive sense, but the reality of what working with psychedelics for mental and emotional transformation and well being actually looks like for your average person. To not represent this clearly does a disservice to the audience and society as a whole.  Don't get me wrong though; I'm a HUGE believer in psychedelics, and very excited both by the research and legalization!!! It's just that at the very least, we should be accurately representing the reality of using psychedelics to people in order to minimize their suffering. Anything less is unkind at the very least, and I'd argue, unethical.  So here's to hoping that Big Think, Hopkins, Matthew Johnson, MAPS, and all the other visible, vocal mouthpieces in the psychedelic science and psychedelic therapy space start to sharpen their message to be more accurate, because this dumbed down version of the truth is a bit dangerous.",2년 전,4,

I got a lot better in March 2021 (diet change) and considered myself healed from depression since August 2021 (another diet change).

I'm doing keto-carnivore, eating 2x a day, fatty meat and eggs, basically. I love it.  • I have no more sadness for no reason, no more ruminating thoughts or ideations about ending my life. I can bathe regularly again, take care of my appearance, wear nice clothes, and do sports 🙌🏻  • I still experience debilitating symptoms of what appears to be a genetic disease that affects my brain, with symptoms of CFS/IBS/Fibro/MS/Alzheimer.

In this world of mass shootings and manufactured hate I think this medicine could do a lot of good. I think as an adult you have the right to alter your consciousness in my opinion. For some people it's the only way to step outside their own ego and look inwards! The fact that one of the most dangerous drug on the planet is legal says a lot about the situation here. Statistically alcohol kills more people than almost any other drug. Only outpace by Chinese / Mexican fentanyl. People need a safe way to do this because people have been altering their consciousness since the birth of humanity. It's never going to stop ever.,2년 전,13,

@ChiFREAKY1,"The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society.  		 		   Aldous Huxley   I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.  James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time   The cult of self dominates our cultural landscape. This cult has within it the classic traits of psychopaths: superficial charm, grandiosity, and self-importance; a need for constant stimulation, a penchant for lying, deception, and manipulation, and the inability to feel remorse or guilt. This is, of course, the ethic promoted by corporations. It is the ethic of unfettered capitalism. It is the misguided belief that personal style and personal advancement, mistaken for individualism, are the same as democratic equality. In fact, personal style, defined by the commodities we buy or consume, has become a compensation for our loss of democratic equality. We have a right, in the cult of the self, to get whatever we desire. We can do anything, even belittle and destroy those around us, including our friends, to make money, to be happy, and to become famous. Once fame and wealth are achieved, they become their own justification, their own morality. How one gets there is irrelevant. Once you get there, those questions are no longer asked.  Chris Hedges, Empire of Illusion: The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle   The commercial media … help citizens feel as if they are successful and have met these aspirations, even if they have not. They tend to neglect reality (they don't run stories about how life is hard, fame and fortune elusive, hopes disappointed) and instead celebrate idealized identities – those that, in a commodity culture, revolve around the acquisition of status, money, fame and power, or at least the illusion of these things. The media, in other words, assist the commercial culture in “need creation”, prompting consumers to want things they don't need or have never really considered wanting. And catering to these needs, largely implanted by advertisers and the corporate culture, is a very profitable business. A major part of the commercial media revolves around selling consumers images and techniques to “actualize” themselves, or offering seductive forms of escape through entertainment and spectacle. News is filtered into the mix, but actual news is not the predominant concern of the commercial media.  Chris Hedges, The Death of the Liberal Class",2년 전,0,

@thegreatshitstain," @bassaddict1988  from personal experience, I can say ketamine therapy sure has the potential to help certain people, but it also has the potential to negatively effect people. Personally, I reached a point in therapy where, when I was at the peak of my ketamine ""trip"" I basically thought I was dead, and that everyone I loved and cared about were still living happily and doing just fine without me... It felt beautiful. A solid 45 minutes of peace... But then the ketamine starts to wear off, and I would come out of that trance, and realize that I am still alive, feeling the same mental pain as before, still hating myself. When a friend or family member would drive me home from the clinic (no driving after ketamine infusion) I would gradually feel even darker than I did before... I craved that feeling of death (peace) that I felt while I was under. It was somewhat akin to falling in love and losing that love over a roughly 1 to 2 hr period, each time.   But that's just my experience. I have witnessed other patients achieve some real, lasting results.

@bassaddict1988," @douwemusic  I can believe there are some for who it might help. I don't know, maybe short term clinical intervention in an acute crisis. I know very well how big the potential for abuse and addiction is, and therefore I doubt that it's a great idea for people who need help, to get a nasal spray so that they can dose themselves on a constant level. That's not psychedelic at all, that's just a favor for the company who sells the spray. High dose, single or just a few administrations may help. But this nasal thing is simply designed for abuse. Actually that's what people prepare themselves to make party. And i don't see convincing examples of people who gained real change with ketamine. Short term relief, yes, but nothing lasting.

@douwemusic," @bassaddict1988  Well, to be precise, therapeutically administering ketamine is strictly limited to the therapist, and it's very low dosage. No take-home dosages allowed. This is partly due to the hallucinations and delusions side-effect, how fast you build tolerance and, indeed, because of the mild to severe addiction potential.  Some psychologists believe it works by putting down your barriers just enough to be able to make contact with very painful feelings, while making those feelings slightly less painful, so the therapist and the patient can actually work with these feelings instead of being stuck at a complete blockage.

But also, microdosing psilocybin can heal anxiety and depression. Speaking to your comment about trading one addiction for another, I’m not totally sure what you mean? But I will say this, antidepressants don’t work in they way therapists tell you they will work. They’ll start with an SSRI for depression then they’ll want to add a mood stabilizer then maybe a slew aid like clonazapam and if you’ve made it this far, these drugs will literally change your personality and cognitive ability. Then when you try to get off them, the kind of withdrawl your body goes through is really weird. And when you finally get off them, (for me it took two years), you’re left with more problems than when you started. Psilocybin is natural. It helps with illnesses like MDD, anxiety, C-ptsd, PTSD and more. It even helps with chronic pain like fibromyalgia and nerve pain. Microdosing psilocybin on a schedule  along with taking recreational doses can heal all of the aforementioned psychological illnesses. Pharmaceuticals can’t do that.",2년 전,1,

I have such a similar story to yours, and after years of trying different things, going on a pure carnivorous diet and a few other things are the only ‘treatments’ I noticed that helped! Like actually help me.  After 10 years of successfully owning and running my own construction business in Canada, I got hit with bad fatigue! 13 months of 7 MDs including 2 specialists, and all they came up with was ME/CFS with no help in sight!  After a long list of all sorts of treatment attempts, the diet and micro dosing Psy along with the evil EVIL Iv3rMect!n and Red Light Therapy are the only things that showed a great improvement. Though I’ve never done the big dose, just micro dosing, I noticed a big improvement..  I went from letting my employees go, shutting down my business and being basically bed ridden, unable to drive, to BEING HOPEFUL, starting to be productive and starting to work and help out in different places..   Now in the process of starting one or potentially two new businesses, depending on how fast my recovery will continue, all while raising 4 beautiful daughters.

We had about 200 doses of liquid acid and 100 tabs of papers. I took 11 drops of acid the one night, herioc dose for me, and I saw my depression and pain. I saw what it was doing to me. How I was using my grief to punish myself. I forgot who I used to be, I reminded myself of who I was before I lost the women in my life. Don't get me wrong, I am still dealing with that grief, but it is no longer who I am. I met a beautiful women and had a baby since then. I couldn't have done it had it not been for psychedelics.

It’s like a physical empathy, giving our brains the ability to have new and more diverse perspectives on everything, past and present.

I saw a friend go insane and lose the last 10.years of his life in madness after taking it. It is not without danger.  Overall the benefit I got it is the understanding of one self that comes from the experience that was positive for me.  I regard what I got from the experience (I took it about 100 times) as a spiritual epiphany. I don't think about it much. now I simply have a way to understand this experience we call life and existence that doesn't leave me traumatized when I see the world on the way to hell in a hand basket carried by society itself.

@sophiemilton5939," @pigcatapult  I say not. I took LSD 57 times in my youth and that was in 1970-1977 - when you got a dose back then it was strong!  Three times I took more than one tab, the strongest being two tabs of ""Clear Light"" also known as ""Window Pane"". I also took mushrooms a couple of hundred times once I lost my bottle for takin acid.  From all that I never had anything that amounted to a flashback. There were some lasting effects although I would not consider them negatives.  For the following ten years or so, the headlights of oncoming cars had a colour to them as did any really bright light. - if that sounds like a problem remember that there are a great many people who are colour-blind in some way.  Seeing pretty colours in bright lights is no handicap or hardship. Cannabis in large doses is slightly hallucinatory on it's own. The closest I got to any sort of flashback was to feel that if I got really stoned it was more hallucinogenic than it was before I first tripped.  I knew a lot of people who took trips - I never met anyone who had dramatic flashbacks of the type you described nor even heard any second-hand stories of people who did. In the case of a pre-existing serious psychological issue then perhaps such a flashback is possible, but for people in general, I say no.    :-) Nor did I ever see a single person ""totally lose their mind"" on a trip.   I had a couple of bad trips and saw a handful happen to other people.  In all cases, a couple of minutes of calm reassurance and bonding was all it took to fix the problem and allow the rest of the experience to be joyful. Do not forget that the majority of these rumours about negatives were started by the Govt in order to discourage use.

And the same can be said about alcohol but we do not have the same standards, nobody is out there lecturing people about how you need to do set and setting and safety around alcohol and it’s socially acceptable even to be a hardcore drinker in very dangerous ways, even glorified. I get your point but I don’t think we as a community of enthusiasts don’t do what you’re mentioning because we always repeat the same mantras about set and setting, you can always take more but not less etc, if anything it is nightlife culture which has a problem.

@tearsintherain6311," @marlonhengtgen3004  my point is that talking objectively about risks, psychedelics are far lower in every single aspect, and talking about risks in this way is not productive because it’s objectively not the case. Maybe framing it as responsible use is a better way because risk assumes potential for damage which I have never seen in any single person I’ve met who has used and abused them, yet I have seen every time someone takes too much to drink or combines alcohol with other substances.   I think that’s a double standard and stigmatizes psychedelics unfairly because people will compare them to alcohol… and they are orders of magnitude safer even if you have problems (not psychosis) and take a huge dose, compare that to your average alcoholic on the verge of passing out and having a meltdown and wanting to end it, that’s a far FAR more likely scenario because of alcohols depressant and inhibition reducing qualities even if we only talk about psychological risks  Look at the data and its psychological risk profile is almost not existent compared to other substances, we need to make an objective way to compare risks or we need to always talk about responsible use of caffeine and nicotine (which can destroy your dopamine reuptake or aggravate several mental issues or epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s etc) if we are going to scrutinize psychedelics in the same way because if not then it means we are not being objective and we are still stigmatizing them",2년 전(수정됨),11,

Well by law they couldn't arrest any of them for protesting People were allowed to do that, but once they realized they were also using a lot of Cannabis and psychedelic's by making them illegal they now had a way to arrest the protesters they otherwise couldn't arrest. They created a reason to be able to arrest people to prevent them from protesting. It's so sad because it ruined decades of research into the health benefits of these substances.

Indeed the way it interacts with the brain is why it's labeled as a psychedelic. It's one of the strongest psychedelics in the world. And Americans disrespect this planet by smoking it. In history it was not smoked. The shamans would chew 8 to 10 leaves or more and hold the saliva in their mouth for about 20 minutes while chewing on the leaves. You do not swallow your juices that form in the mouth until it's been about 20 minutes. The goal is sublingual here. If you just chew and swallow the leaves, the stomach acids break down the active chemical in it, and supposedly doesn't give much effect if at all. It's related to the mint family, and people doing it should do it the right way. By yourself some plants and grow it and then prepare for your experience. Just research traditional way of ingesting salvia divinorum. It'll be the most awesome thing ever. It's way different than smoking it.

@Jay_Kayy," @marlonhengtgen3004  it really depends on the person. I'm not guaranteeing a good trip for everybody, what brings on a bad trip is the person's mindset. And psychedelics point that out so you can heal the traumas that are held deep in there. That's all that's happening when you get into a bad trip is you fall into a loop of your own fear. Having good people around you can help you pull out quite quickly. I've had a bad trip and that was because I was doing day drinking all day and decided to eat mushrooms later that night in the mushrooms kicked in and told me that I was killing myself slowly with alcohol. I freaked out and thought I was dying. Within an hour later I was able to pull out of it, I played some meditation music and became one with God. Bad trips are not bad. They are just pre-existing energies that are within you and the psychedelics uncovered them. When you come to terms with them and totally just let go and accept, then you can turn a bad trip around into the most amazing mind-blowing trip ever. So with psychedelic trips, setting setting is everything and you should only do it with people you trust and that most likely not 100% but most likely guarantees a really good trip. Even having a bad trip doesn't mean that it was a bad experience. There's something to learn in those as well. I've learned to accept it all",2년 전(수정됨),6,

@iamlovingawareness2284," @tanned06  does it seem like good policy to make “dangerousness”  or “riskiness” grounds for making something illegal? Do you see how many things you’d need to make illegal to make that a consistent position? How many dangerous things do we allow adults to do because we value human autonomy? Do you really want to infantilize the human race in your morally supercharged desire to keep everyone safe?   Are you sure the cherry picked data you’re using to justify your apprehension is the entire picture? There is nothing you’re missing?   The line you need to draw in order to avoid a slippery slope takes a lot of your credibility away. It makes you look inconsistent. People see the inconsistency, and as a result they don’t respect the law.   Drug policy has single handedly fractured the relationship of people to the law and their government. Especially minority groups, and the harm the drug war has caused them.   Drug policy makers start with their conclusion “drugs are bad” and reverse engineer all their justifications for throwing people in jail. They think they are the  parents and us the children (rather than them working for us). Mom and dad get to decide what’s too dangerous. They do this without considering risk mitigation or even potential rewards. Rewards which indigenous peoples around the world have  taken advantage of for centuries. They think prohibition and throwing people in jail is the best policy decision. For those that agree i have to ask what evidence you have to show that this method has worked? This isn’t about the efficacy or safety profile of drugs. It’s about the efficacy of drug policy. If you seriously think the government has the right approach wholesale locking people away, I’d say you were being unreasonable.  The government was relentless in their propaganda campaign. How many people thought they had our best interest in mind? Who can genuinely hold onto that idea at this point in time?   At least they were transparent in their dishonesty. By putting these substances in schedule one and prohibiting any research they show their true colors. They never cared about objectivity or truth. They care about maintaining a narrative. Which you have perpetrated by offering instances of psychosis as if it’s the norm of these experiences.   Obviously anything with risks should be taken with precaution, Rock climbing, driving a car, skating down a staircase, all things that involved risk should be accompanied by some precautions. By relying on the term hallucinogen to make your point you’ve completely undercut yourself. Psychedelic and entheogen are also terms used to describe the experience. If the word itself has some bearing on how we should feel about it then you’d need to concede that these two terms paint the experience in a positive light. The government wouldn’t admit they were wrong even if it were shown to them on a silver platter. And based on the way you talk I have a feeling you wouldn’t either.   These substances clearly have risks. Proponents of these substances should take them seriously and be honest about them. That can’t be where the conversation happens, because then our bar becomes absolute safety.   Given the fact that statistically significant numbers of people kick addictions ,and have “coming to God” moments with these substances I’d say the enormous potential for good should make us seek to control the contexts of their use so that we might lessen the risk and afford people an opportunity to transform their perspective.",2년 전(수정됨),7,

@iamlovingawareness2284," @magnuskallas  The occult is an umbrella term that doesn’t point to any particular thing.

This common thread doesn’t speak to the practice or substance being suspect. All religious/mystical practices involved alternating consciousness in one form or another. This exists in most belief systems, especially the Abrahamic religions. Where your natural state is “no good” you must strive for another state of being that is not your current one. I don’t deny you have personal experiences which bias you to a certain perspective. I have my biases as well.   Therein lies the problem of epistemology, what is a valid justification for knowledge. If in my personal experience I’ve seen 100s of peoples lives being turned around for the better, and you have experiences which say the opposite, how do we go about reconciling that?   The only recourse I can see is to look at much larger scales of evidence, which includes the anthropological history of these substances throughout time.

Most of the negative symptomology in schizophrenia is a cascading effect from the framing we use to interpret the experience. The negative interpretation compounds and the schizophrenic man spirals out of control. You see this in the markedly different experiences of psychosis within different contexts. Whether the experience of losing your mind is “good or bad” relies on a very limited, utilitarian view of good or bad. Are you of use to a sick society? That’s our standard. I hope what im saying isn’t perceived as pushback. Im just looking for engagement about slightly relevant topics",2년 전,3,
@magnuskallas," @iamlovingawareness2284  I'm sorry I'm so fair-worded, but The Beatles caught my eye here. The Beatles and many other British groups back then were hugely influenced by the occult, Egypt and Arabian mysticism and such. Especially the ""magick"" teachings of Aleister Cromwell, and here we see the connection between The Beatles, David Bowie and Led Zeppelin, to name a few. To extend, most of the Western cosmic horror genre has its roots in it! H.P. Lovecraft included... Even Alien, with H.R.

I ate them on a fairly empty stomach and drank a lot of orange juice to speed along the process. 45 mins in and I took some more because I thought they might not be working. 45 kins after that and I was so tripped out that I ended up eating candles, tic tacs, cough drops, paper towels, the rest of my powerful mushrooms, and cat hair. The ultra high doses of psilocin are about 5mg and they recommend safe clinical settings. I took multiple ultra doses unwittingly on my first attempt. My brain was not ready for that and sent me on a very long trip (some of it was recorded), and the greatest lesson I learned from that was that I had no idea what I was doing.

This came to the US via Operation Paperclip although we obviously had knowledge of it prior. We brought them here and allowed them to continue their projects. Microdossing is probably okay, but humans innately lack self control and are impulsive by nature. You don't have to believe me, but I doubt most people have as much experience with taking high doses of LSD as I do. Opening this doorway will 100% bring forth the end of humanity.

@samplatt228," @tanned06 ever aspect of why most drugs are illegal are misguided and dangerous. When you analyze why a drug is illegal by the governments standards you find that many illegal drugs fit into the standards much better than certain legal substances like alcohol or even Kratom which is actually really safe. The government’s standards are does it have a medical use, is it at a high potential for abuse, and does it cause a public health crisis. Essentially all psychedelics fit neatly into these categories. MDMA, LSD, mushrooms, DMT, ibogaine, ketamine and countless other psychoactive substances have a significant impact in psychotherapy contexts, are very rarely habit forming (The exact nature of these compounds makes it actually quite difficult to use these compounds regularly), and they all make the user much less aggressive. That is not to mention that when you make a substance that has a large consumer base illegal all you do is put that substance in the hands of criminals like the cartels rather than a regulated commercial business. This makes the substance far more dangerous because the consumer can easily take something far more dangerous. It also sends money outside of the US with no tax. And all that is not even mentioning the most important part which is every human has the right to do whatever they want so long as it doesn’t infringe upon the rights of others. None of the substances I listed make you violent in any sense, unlike alcohol, and so by no means should any of those substances be illegal",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@Psychonaut-im3zz,"To see this many comments comparing Mushrooms (Psilocybin) to alcohol/smoking  ...justifying its usage/legality...  is.... kinda worrying???  It's like comparing a firecracker... with an atom bomb... not realizing the difference.  The two don't even correlate.  Some really dumb shit.    It's almost as if some people are blind to videos of people on drugs/mushrooms and are here only to lecture bs.  As if they are themselves normal, saying that they've used Acid? LSD (it that typical american? Who even takes LSD? MKUltra?) for years.... The level of stupidity.    The thing with mushrooms is, that you lose control And you could potentially harm someone (as you are not rational) Run around naked. Jump off a roof. Or end up in a psych ward.  It's a direct attack on your brain/neurons, alters your mind/state of being (and according to video, and even commenters, permanently). In case of some of these commenters, they lost a few neurons for sure. Or they haven't passed kindergarten grade. Hence Crazy Frog is the richest artist ever lived (and he's not even DJing).  At least mushrooms aren't synthetic (as todays EDM music).  ...  So what do we have here...  A video on a serious topic (whether or not it's beneficial for some, beside the point, could be). I know for a fact that it does alter your mind (you cannot understand if you never used it) Hallucinations/spiritual are just words, you cannot discribe into words. Mushrooms is classified as 'hard drugs'. Makes sense to me.  A 16 yr old making a stupid random comment. A couple hundred responses from bottomless lowlife rejects, completely missing the mark (attacking tanner for some reason, while he seems the most sensible). Arguing (meandering rather) whether it's dangerous/normal/beneficial.  When I visit coffeeshop, I see zombies (they don't exactly look healthy). When I see videos of poeple on drugs (lds/mushrooms/whatever), I see people doing very (abnomal) weird things. When I see Meatloaf I see the effects of Covid (I could pretend it's a common cold, but I refuse to). I know I (as a skeptic) ran around the streets at night, rang doorbells, uttering complete nonsense to complete strangers, high on mushrooms, while my friends were looking for me.  Making this entire video (comment section rather) moot. And an insult to the maker (who needs to shave his beard).  ...  Flashbacks? Common knowledge:  Smoking weed (shortly after mushroom) can produce flashbacks (as in: you're 'in it again', as in 'in the psychotic mushroom trip', experiencing it, not memories of the ordeal). Not good. I can attest, because I experienced it (as documented).",1년 전,0,

@maddox9511," @joesphschramm3754 This is such a flawed way of thinking. You can’t quantify the damage that prohibition of these drugs have caused and you can’t quantify the potential damage these drugs have caused. You don’t even know the damage that psychedelics have caused because there’s no data on it besides assumptions anecdotal experiences. First of all prohibition of these drugs has worked, you can’t compare the number of illegal users to zero you have to compare it to the number of people who would potentially use it if it was legal. Obviously if psychedelics were widely available legally more people would use it, meaning prohibition works. Do you think less people would use shrooms if it was legal   You just have no idea and no care about how it can affect society, you just like to do it. Making it legal does a lot such as making it far more accessible to children and we have no idea how Shrooms especially at higher dosages interact with children. You don’t know how shrooms will impact criminality and. You didn’t even consider that society and legislatures will have to adapt. You didn’t consider how police will have to learn to handle psychedelics , such a bad trip or violence. Do you have any data on how mushrooms affect violence? Do you have any data on how high ultra high hero dosages affect people’s brains. Most people don’t just do the standard dose of whatever, how many people who drink alcohol limit to two drinks? Do you think shrooms will be any different? How will we handle 10  or 15g trips. We have no long term studies, what if it does turn out to be harmful later in life?",1년 전,0,

@mariozd971,"Every drug should be legal people have free will for their own choises, i maybe wouldn't ever touch heroin if i had psychedelics when i was going to techno parties in late 90s til about 2005. I was smoking weed, taking speed and ecstasy pills , only once i tried LSD, in that time , one blotter and it was incredibly ecstatic. But i heard for other psychedelics as mushrooms, peyotl but even lsd was hard to get, heroin was everywhere in Croatia, i took it first time 20 years old in 2001, but i was just a recreational user of it, till 2006 i was taking only once a month, sometimes even once in a 4 months but sometimes i was taking 5,6 days in a row, but when i first took it on needle in 2005 i started to lose control and soon was totally addicted.  15 years on buprenorphine and methadone, i go at my doctor once a week for the weekly dose of methadone, 75 mg daily but two months ago i finally managed to get 2 kilos of kratom and i almost totally weaned methadone, i was taking 75-120 mg daily, now i take only 10-15 mg. And psychedelics i started few years ago taking LSD, first time after 16 years, LSD is at least for me the most stabile psychedelic, i've taken sometimes enormous doses, like when i took 1200 mcg in drops my mistake but it was very beautiful experience, LSD is safe drug for the most people, dosage about 100 mcg is ideal for beginners. I mostly take it once in month, take sometimes 180 mcg, sometimes 360 mcg in drops most often. Mushrooms and peyotl are great too but it's hard to get here for now, i had maybe 5 times enough mushrooms for the trip, about 3-5 grams, peyotl twice and i really never ever had horror trip, neither on LSD, mushrooms, DMT few times everytime great experiences. There were many trip where i contemplated ans i found inner peace , sometimes i recalled bad memories but never felt bad because of it. People shouldn't take deliriants like datura, crack , fentanyl( except patients who have cancer and other diseases with strong pain) and crocodil. Only psychedelic where people can really lose their mind is PCP, i've taken it 5 times, first time i've taken big dose and was totally psychotic , when i recalled it i think that's how feel people who have severe mental ilnesses, second time i snorted maybe 100 mg  and i was taken into the hospital because i was in pcp-hole, i was anesthesized , i got depersonalization, depersonalation and ego death. And few more times i've taken fool small amounts , and i felt energetic and optimistic. In all drugs you only have to know proper dosage, for street heroin it's almost impossible, i was taking most times about 20-25 % clean stuff. But few times here came cleanee heroin , i can't swear on it but i think it was about 45 % clean, few people i knew died of overdose. And for PCP, literally 20 mg is the difference between good experience and death",10개월 전,0,

@DaleLerette,"Hey hun I think microdosing psilocybin is the next breakthrough for autism research. And it will seem miraculous when they combine stemcell from the umbilical cords. I was watching a video which talked about a recent study that investigated the effects of psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, in mice and demonstrated its long lasting effects on the growth and structure of dendritic spines. Mutations in several genes strongly implicated in autism have resulted in altered dendritic spine morphology, including SHANK35 and FMR1.  An astonishing new science called ""neuroplasticity"" is overthrowing the centuries-old notion that the human brain is immutable. In this revolutionary look at the brain, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Norman Doidge, M.D., provides an introduction to both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity and the people whose lives they've transformed. From stroke patients learning to speak again to the remarkable case of a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole, The Brain That Changes Itself will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential. Typical synaptic development is not linear; rather there is an overgrowth of synapses early in development, followed by a pruning of many synapses.   I suspect that if the autistic brain can be brought back into a state of neuroplasticity, the damage to the dendric spines can be reset with microdosing psilocybin while the child is engaged in A.B.A., much like the Son-Rise program. The Son-Rise Program focuses intensely on entering into the child's world and showing them the way out. This is done by teaching dynamic, enthusiastic, play-oriented methods that focus heavily on social development and social interactions with parents, siblings, peers, etc. I am glad I met you today at the gym.

@ianmeade7441," @Eljose06  well I think people conflate Nihilism with existentialism. Nihilists take the cold and meanless universe and anthromorphize it as though it's making a deliberate statement at you, to affirm the futility of your own life's meaning. But if the universe really is meaning devoid, then there isn't anything that judges meaning but you.  In that the universe is devoid of any intrinsic meaning, it is equally devoid of any ability or reason to invalidate those meanings which emerge from the informational systems it hosts. Ones that reach sentience (or further) are the only environment in which an evaluation of meaning can exist, because they are the only phenomenon capable of defining such things into being. Your own private experince of reality is the only universe your current identity is a part of. The makes you literally the ""meaning"" of the universe (your universe), just like perceivable color is a meaning of wavelengths. The question just becomes one of whether or not your meaning is sustainable to others that might exist.",2년 전,0,

@anywallsocket,"I see that over 100 ppl already agree with this sentiment, but it’s actually very subjective. The idea of us being ‘small’ or ‘irrelevant’ is true in some senses and not true at all in others.   Indeed, if anything the big idea here is recognizing this relativity or subjectivity and our power to choose this perspective for ourselves. That is, we can see the bright side or the dark side and it’s totally up to us.   Naturally then we can begin to recognize all the biases we previously applied to different aspects of our lives, and re-balance those views by looking at them from new angles.   Even this outlook that I’m outlining is not the only way to interpret the psychedelic lesson, but at least I can admit that, for not doing so means you’ve missed the point, or haven’t gone far enough to see your biases.",2년 전,14,

@anywallsocket," @codemiesterbeats  One thing to keep in mind when musing over the concepts of duality and equilibrium is that these motifs are more indicative of the way our brains work as opposed to nature herself. For one, we are inherently bivalent -- meaning we are prone to black n white thinking, due simply to evolutionary efficacy (the panther is either in the bush or it isn't). Naturally this bivalence bleeds over to more nuanced topics, e.g., philosophy or politics, where a more fuzzy logic approach would probably be best, yet we still can't help but truncate concepts as this or that, due primarily to the virility of yes-no memes as well as basic intellectual laziness. For two, whereas equilibrium is obviously essential to biochemical processes, it's also essential for logical linearity, and indeed we could not formulate consistent models of reality (such as those very same biochemical processes) without the logical reversible consistency implied by equilibrium of thought. The boolean space of algebra for example, which covers all simple transformations over the real numbers is completely linear, reversible, and based on the idea of equilibria, and we could not count, or reason (cycle of induction and deduction), without at least approximating these kinds of basic logical functions. All-in-all we perpetually mistake the map for the territory, meaning what we convince ourselves are patterns in nature are actually patterns in our thinking.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Thinking about some things would bring me out and thinking about some other things would pull me back in. I wasn't sure if it was my body that could handle it or my heart or something.
