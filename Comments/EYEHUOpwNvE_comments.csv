Bron was never the best at 3 point shots Steph, Nash, Harden, and  KD, are superior to him efficiency wise. Rose would likely be more efficient than Lebron if he took more shots and had a longer career.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@TashdidKhan," @anonymousperson8903  The Golden State Warriors' ""Death Lineup""—comprising Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Harrison Barnes (later Kevin Durant), and Draymond Green?  Really? During the series, the Warriors struggled with their shooting efficiency, partly due to excellent defense by the Thunder and partly due to their own off-nights. They also committed uncharacteristic turnovers that led to easy points for OKC.  This momentum can often influence games significantly, and it seemed to give them an edge over the Warriors in critical moments. the Warriors had superior depth and a more reliable bench, better ball movement, which led to better shooting.  Ball movement > ISO ball on most nights.",1년 전,0,

@freedbyyeshua533,"God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online sermons!",3년 전,0,

Harden would be just a normal player than Edit: I just hate players who don't think about team, and throw so much stupid shots and then start flopping, it's just unsportman like, I mean when I'm going to be 21 if I do so much attempt per game and flop I'd average probably like 20+ and so will other many players",5년 전(수정됨),13,

@evileyegaming405,"4 years changed the NBA A LOT Derrick Rose gets injured more, makes as many 3s in a season as Stephen Curry does in a game(13) and ends up teaming up with LeBron but becomes a bench player. Kevin Durant wins the MVP award that season and ends up leaving the Thunder to team up with the player to his right to win the NBA finals and finals MVP. Stephen Curry becomes an all star that season, ends up winning back to back MVPs, breaks the NBA record for most 3s in a game(13), breaks the NBA record for most 3s in a season twice, ends up winning 2 championships, becomes LeBrons newest rival, leads his team to the best regular season record in NBA history(73-9), and leads his team to the best postseason record in NBA history later on(16-1). James Harden becomes a finalist for the MVP award  twice but loses to Russell Westbrook and to the player on his left. Steve Nash doesn't work out with the Lakers and gets injured which forces him to retire. LeBron James loses the finals to the Spurs that season and ends up going back to the Cavs to team up with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving and the team which ends up becoming rivals with Curry's Warriors team, losing the first matchup, winning the second, and losing again the third matchup.",7년 전,4,

@evansherman7200,Bolly Boi no he won't stupid ass I think a dude named Russ Westbrook who has got a triple double almost every damn game this season so far is gonna win MVP,8년 전,0,
@holdingsand,+Haley Smith when was the last time a 7 seed won an mvp? i'll wait for that answer!   russ just pads. he has the most uncontested rebounds in the league. he better have 10 assists per game with his highest usage rate of all time. meanwhile harden's team is 21-7 and he's putting up huge numbers as well.,8년 전,1,

@holdingsand,Domino and he led a team to 55 wins without a 2nd superstar or even all star. He was insane this year.  He ran a top 10 offense of all time without a 2nd star. Let that sink in. He's easily the MVP,8년 전,2,

Even with the best of the best noone can guarantee that 100% of those shots will go in at that sequence. Hitting 10 3 pointers in a row is possible for these guys, but doing it with other ppl and timing is like maybe 0.01% of it actually happening. Oh btw its fake.",11년 전,0,

Did you know that Sheriff Arpaio of AZ held a press conference over a year ago that concluded that the ""birth certificate"" posted by Mr. Obama is a forgery? Obama also forged his elective Service (i.e. draft) registration.  The criminals in the ""main stream media"" refuse to tell you the truth, so please don't flame me  - flame them for lying to you. This is likely the biggest fraud ever perpetrated and the US, and it could prove existential if not addressed.   There is a great 1 page document that has links to the official press conference (posted at youtube) and other stuff on scribd.

Players even said that they would like to be able to wear their jerseys outside, but it isn't really practical.  In my opinion, I don't mind the shirts - I think it would help to stay warmed up during games. ",11년 전,0,
