@edgarmaurer7542, @zaarongaming8174  Yeah.. maybe next year,5년 전,4,
@zaarongaming8174," @edgarmaurer7542  Well, we were VERY close to winning semis this year (I consider SKT the better team since G2 only have a stylistic advantage in their defensive play but were getting dumpstered early/mid constantly, and SKT were having weaknesses in that late game through nerves and jitters) and if we made finals would've been favorites. GRF would've made semis if they had their main coach and/or used Doran, and DWG would've probably beaten FNC and would've beaten SPY, so all in all I'd consider this year at world's to be about even between us and the other regions. A lot better than last year, teams like KZ, SKT, and DWG are adapting to the modern style, a ton of new and young talent got experience on the international stage which is really important since Korea is in a state of replacing the old garde with the new garde, and Jin Air is going to win world's 2020, so all in all things are looking bright.",5년 전,3,
@edgarmaurer7542," @zaarongaming8174  korea is no longer the dominant region in my eyes i agree that except g2 eu has not much to offer but china with fpx, rng and ig is probably the best region right now",5년 전,3,
@zaarongaming8174,"​ @edgarmaurer7542  I would rate Korea as the #1 region, but China are very close to them. Korea has the toughest/best soloQ, the best talent pool, good coaching, very strong adaptability since summer, and every playoff team in their league stands an 8% or better chance of winning worlds. They only have two weaknesses: their talent pool is inexperienced, especially internationally, and sometimes they have internal issues (for instance, if KZ kept up steam from rift rivals and weren't bought halfway through the season they're huuuuuge favorites to win world's, if GRF had cvMax and Doran they have a strong shot at winning world's, if JAG don't delete their LCK account to make room for the CK redemption smurf account so that they can have a redemption arc they win world's, etc.)",5년 전(수정됨),2,
@ningzhixie336," @zaarongaming8174  No that much ""what if"". All game lost by Korean teams are convicing and with no excuse. You can expect them to do better at s10, but they were not good at all at s9. Stop hyping them and face the reality.",5년 전,0,

@siegejay6364,Worlds Collide is the only Worlds song i've loved. The latest song Legends Never Die is so boring despite the fact the i'm a fan of Chrissy of the Against The Current.   I hated Warriors (Imagine Dragons) delivery of the chorus; Ignite (Zedd) was executed well but felt their's less lyrics and more instrumentals; Legends Never Die (Chrissy) i feel was too boring and i'm still trying to listen to it over and over again in hopes i'll like it coz i'm a fan of Chrissy.,8년 전,1,

@the.wildspark,"Personally I love this song more than last year's song. Because, ok, Imagine Dragons is and will always be an amazing band, so it was obvious they would create such an epic song as Warriors is. But this year, the artist was no other than a fellow summoner, a person who is no different than all of us here, watching this video. It's not some legend band, it's just a fellow extremely talented gamer. This song makes me feel so hype, it makes me want to sing along, to not be scared that I will ruin it with my bad voice.

The champions, Of a world that we defy. A solemn reign, Of the few who rise up high. And we all fight, at the last light. Hearing voices from afar, join the madness when the curtain falls. Risk it all, hold nothing back, Seize the day, we must attack. Stars arising, countless worlds colliding, only one will take it all. Can we bring to fall the giants, Can we make the final call. We are the ones, To ignite the darkened skies. The champions, Of a world that we defy. A solemn reign, Of the few who rise up high. And we all fight, at the last light.

@Darkaitr,Chinas money beat them down so hard,9년 전,3,
@geass11,"+Diana salem  C9 stomped everyone? ROFL.  S4: They lost in the Quarters and were Second seed out of groups in S4. If Alliance didn't lose to Kabuum, C9 may not have even have qualified to the Quarter Finals. They got 3-1 by SSB. FNC last season even managed to take 1 game off SSB, so that isn't that big of an accomplishment.   C9 were far from good. Obviously they are stronger than Kabuum though (2 easy games) and beat Alliance once. Hence it would have been decided via a tiebreaker, if Alliance beat Kabuum.    S5: They won the first 3 games with the EXACT same tactics. Teams weren't prepared for them and probably took them lightly. After prepeing from them properly, they managed to win. Incarnation even said in a interview, Veigar is what has been winning them the most amount of scrims. If they were losing all their games with Viegar in scrims, you still think they'd pick it?   Scrims matter A LOT. Do you think a team like SKT is losing most of their scrims? Ofcourse not. They're winning most of them. because they're a SUPERIOR team.  Scrims don't matter, if you're playing against WEAK teams and beating them. If you can constantly win in scrims against GOOD teams, then you have a much higher chance of reaching far at Worlds/ beating more teams.   Practice wise: Scrims > SoloQ   Yes, actual game results is what matters the most. But scrims is BY FAR the best way to TRAIN and to get BETTER. If they meant nothing, nobody would be doing it. So don't just count out scrims.",9년 전,5,

@carcasapistacho,"+Heartnet Procg And SSW lost twice, not a big difference",9년 전,1,
@EE12345,"I don't think S4 SSW is necessarily stronger than S5 SKT. SSW was so dominant at worlds because they were a strong early-mid game team playing in a snowbally map-play based meta, hence them showing their dominance through strong snowballs and short average game times. SKT is a strong laning/skirmishing team playing in a much more controlled and objective-based meta, and they've showed their dominance through that outlet just as well (getting to the finals without dropping a single inhib, consistently closing even games in 3 mins after getting a single lead, only struggling in 2-3 games the whole tournament just like SSW, 14-0 streak, etc).  Personally I don't think the two can be compared, as they both brought the absolute peak dominating play of LoL in their respective metas. You can't really say SSW was more dominant because they were better at snowballing and had shorter game times, for the same reason you can't say SKT was more dominant because they were better around controlling and snowballing off objectives. If the two were to play in S4, SSW would probably snowball SKT, whereas if they played in S5 SKT would choke them out of the map. In that sense they were equal in their dominance IMO.",9년 전,18,
@cool3500,"+Hyogetaki Hisame yeah they were good because the battle for championship is in korea, so once they win there, they win at worlds too. Same thing with Skt.

@ViolentMLG,"+Hyogetaki Hisame SKT was in a rough spot.. They were really the only good team, everyone knows only SK wins worlds, and the best team from SK will win, pretty simple, unless the underdog comes through, but no SKT, SKT in a rough patch, yeah, they dominated.. Were they a really good team? Sure.. but look at where their players went, the KDA's of them etc, now they're nobodies, running away with one season doesn't make them top dogs, Look at fnatic, TPA, or S3 skt, so far no team has won two series back to back after winning worlds, they always fall off after, but SKT winning two worlds (whether it was back to back or not) shows their strength as a team.. So no, I don't think SSW would've won worlds, if you don't know they were known as MVP Ozone prior and wasn't a team you probably even knew (they weren't that great). So obviously when the kings (SKT) are in a rough patch and they performed great, they'll run away with worlds, doesn't mean its well deserved or that they'd stomp SKT this season, or they were the top dogs, again, look at where those players are now, their teams, and where they are before, and where SKT was then, and there is your answer simply put.

Another thing that's crazy, Bjerg has always been the shotcaller except 2016 spring split. To be a mid and shotcaller and ALWAYS win lane and always create the most pressure is amazing. I take back Bjerg being better than Faker, but I do fully 100% think that he is equal to him. ",9년 전,1,

@bonesh0ckerz,"Its all about Faker. Easyhoon is just not as good as him. Faker surpassed Easyhoon on his signature mages. But when did  you see Easyhoon surpass Faker on assassins/utility mid laners  ?Sadly for the crusader SKT haters , Faker is the most dominant and successful player in this game since his debut in Spring 2013. And currently, pure Icon for the face of LoL E-sports.",8년 전,15,
