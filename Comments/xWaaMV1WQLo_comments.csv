@aamirchoudhry366,"How come no Draft player ever has any footwork, basketball skill/ OR IQ to their game. I have a higher IQ and more skill than 95% of the league. On the Oath to My Lord, I'm a Top 30 player in the NBA currently right now at the age of 24. NBA Scouts check me out. Contact me; I'm a sleeper; a Hidden Gem. Someone get me an NBA agent or a scouts info, and you could make 10% for life off my NBA contracts.  IA the right people see this. Bill Simmons,  you could change a Generation of Basketball by Having the First South Indian Enter the league and Dominate and Change the way we see Basketball Globally. Brother please check me out. God Bless Your Soul.  I'm a 25 year old Point Guard In my Third year of Medical School. I chose a different career path, but I've been a student of the game since the early 00s, and Just as a student of medicine, I studied basketball in and out since I was a child. I developed footwork not seen in the league anymore, every step I take on the court is efficient and profound. Watch my footwork, how I set a defender up, the concept of angles is unseen in the Modern Era, I mimic Kobe, Rip, Ray, Paul P, with every way I set up my jumper. My IQ is Luka, LeBron Level, as absurd as it sounds. I'm also a pure shooter, Ray Allen's 3 min youtube video moving baseline to baseline in the Garden Gym is PsychoMemorized in my brain since I was a child. I'm a Complete Basketball player with every part of my game refined like a superstar. Assists, Floor Vision, 2 dribble pass, cut off angles, Post moves, ball fakes, side jabs, triple threat. All used more wise and with a greater understanding than even current NBA all stars in the league. I can carry my own team in the NBa Playoffs, and take a team to the NBA finals, I have LeBron James leadership skills. Bill I am going to be a practicing Physician Within a 2 year span, Please Read Me out with Some credibility, As I know This may sound crazy, But I understand and process exactly what I said. Bill Simmons I ask God for your help. Help me get in contact with someone in the NBA. God Bless you and Your Family in this life and the Hereafter.",4년 전,0,
