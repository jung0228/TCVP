They were also very useful for sea voyages because you can literally stack them on top of each other while still alive and they can go for long periods without food or drink due to their slow metabolism. Not only do they provide the crew with a steady flow of fresh and delicious meat, they also have a bladder that stores fresh water, thereby also providing vital drinking water. The way new species were given their scientific names back then was specimens were taken to London, but every time they got back there after a trip to the Galapagos, they'd all been eaten.

@Julia-tk2em," @plucas9324  “Do you labor under the sadly mistaken, yet all too common, belief that the only people who care about, or need to correctly use, grammar are English teachers.” You seem intelligent so you should know that a comma splice error is when you incorrectly use commas to break up what would otherwise be an independent clause.   In the phrase “or need to correctly use, grammar are English teachers.” The comma between ‘use’ and ‘grammar’ is not needed, disrupts the flow of the sentence, and is just visually unappealing. Hell, toss out the comma between ‘common’ and ‘belief’. Reading that sentence out loud is uncomfortable and unnatural sounding.",3년 전,1,
