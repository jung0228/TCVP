Jesus is the main character and is  paramount in justice, humility, service,wisdom , strength, leadership, follwership,  etc. He paid the true price of true value for the rewards of all our souls to belong in heaven if we know and choose him. For the ones that don't know your just doing what the world's hate has done to you so your good. And that up to God not any human. Because every man in a liar unless in Nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti , Amen.  The sign of the cross . Science, athleticism, art made by humans , and technology can never explain or prove what God already spoke into existence.  The eucharist is the most physical valuable thing in the 3rd dimension the physical world.  Then the the family and our bodies. The most powerful object or weapon  or asset we have after that is not our nukes or guns.. it is the Holy rosary. Jesus is the manliest and strongest man, then Joseph, then, Simon. Do everything like everyone in heaven is watching & you'll be okay.

@SaraSteele-l7l,"What Edward says about each person can do something good to contribute to the greater good is important. The part where he says no one person can save the world, but collectively, we can each lay down a brick, upon another brick, step by step, we can create effective changes by working together, may sound idealistic, sappy, if not impossible…. But how do we really know unless we try, fear will keep us in bondage, and as Edward said it will become worse each passing day, so what do have to loose? Temporary illusions of freedom, control, perhaps comfort/ familiarity whithin our lives? Well, personally, I would rather risk an uncertain future with a chance of improvement rather than the eventuality of Yeonmi Park’s daily existential horrible terrors prior to fleeing N.K. That part of the interview showed more admirable character and substance than I initially realized. If we can each focus on what is at stake, like finding ourselves having to survive living as falsely imprisoned, condemned to a futile existence or unspeakable injustices, brutal torture, constant fear of my life, I would prefer simply to be executed, and likely i wouldn’t even be shown such a kindness, as such a regime seems to derive exquisite pleasure from the insane cruelty they can perpetrate on the innocent. Sick sad world. So, either way, I would perish, not to mention that as far as I know, I am mortal, will ultimately expire, inevitably, and those are the options, before which hopefully i can do something useful for humanity before my last day, although, i have no idea what. Its either that or wait for the aliens to come save us, which since theyre smart, is not likey the case they would want anything to do with us, other than extermination like the useless dirt weebils we have become.",2개월 전,0,

There’s a reason the British changed the definition in 1913.  It has to do with the sinking of the Titanic.  John Jacob Astor IV, Benjamin Guggenheim and Isidor Straus were American patriots who were murdered by the British after they tried to prevent the creation of the (not) Federal Reserve.  They were on their way back to the U.S. on the Titanic after telling the British to leave the U.S. alone.  The Titanic didn’t hit an iceberg.

@FrancineW-h7g,"Edward Snowden – In the late 90s, I was in NASA’s database and got as far as to hear video recordings with pilots speaking of not only what chemtrails Mixtures not only consisted of and how deadly they were, but the pilots were actually laughing about how we , The US, hired.8 German scientists to make the chemtrail mixtures for us. They were laughing at the fact that the US was using the German scientist chemtrail mixture on Germany, soaking the hell out of it.  They said this on a few occasions as they continuously laughed as if it was actually a funny act. When I discovered what chemtrails were and they sprayed Germany, soaking them in their own mixture, I then researched more which led me deeper in NASAs database which explained that the US then soaked FL, CA & TX. Then continued the spraying around the whole border of the USA.    When I discovered EVERYTHING, it made me sick to my stomach but I continued to post it on FB, Twitter and Instagram the “real” evidence that is no longer on NASAs database.  Morgellons Syndrome (MD) that I was searching for at the beginning, which is the disease that is caused by the chemtrail mixture that was also researched by the CDC two times. The first experiment stated that MD was an imaginary disease then the second experiment had 5000 people claiming to have all of the same types of strange symptoms that could only be claimed as MD and nothing else due to the severity and strangeness of each step of the disease. Starting by red, blue, black and white fibers protruding out of the limbs of your body to different things coming out of your body from anywhere from slugs to gems and anything in between depending on the person. The CDC, after the second study of 5000 people with these type of strange symptoms, classified MD as” a real and horribly debilitating and painful disease, one that would be very costly“.  When I went on the website a week or two later, both studies were gone, and the only thing it stated was the “I stated above and nothing particular about the study. I went on again a week later, and it was completely wiped from CDC‘s database just as Chem trials was wiped from NASA’s database after posting about that.I discovered NASA‘s blue beam project as well as the blue book project and saw how everything connected. After a little while and NASA’s database, I received a pop-up letter that was supposedly from the New World order explaining their deep population plan of 90% of humans and animals. It shocked me so much at that point I was off my computer computer for a straight 4+ months.  After speaking on social media regarding the New World order plan and the secret projects, I discovered I got a letter from the White House telling me President Trump’s position and how he was against the New World order taking over and even submitted a nice copy of President Trump’s words that he spoke at the United Nations that year.  I posted it on social media to have them make their own informed decision as to what was actually happening and was going to happen.    When I posted about what chemtrails were, what they consisted of with all of the over 50 heavy chemicals, several horrible diseases, nano technology, ‘smart dust’, unknown alien DNA as well as many other things, I also mentioned about the German scientist and how they were getting sprayed with their own creation. Within two weeks, it was mentioned on the news, I’m not sure what magazine, that the eight German scientist were suing the US government for soaking Germany with the chemtrails that they invented.  What happened with the case? I’m not sure however, the reason you’re not finding certain things on databases no matter how good you are is because they cover up things quite well.  Once the people that notify the public of these things become targets themselves things usually just disappear and maybe are forgotten about.   If you look around on social media these days and specifically just on Facebook groups, there are multiple millions of people that do research and know exactly what is happening.  The naysayers will not win!!  The truth is out and much more is about to be out as well!",5개월 전,1,

This long format interview does a great job of revealing 3 things:  1) the man is a well-spoken storyteller 2) the man is aggressively peddling a book 3) the man is laboriously trying to present himself as a virtuous, contemplative, loyal American who acted with pure intentions.  I kind-of expected him to convince me that there was something more to the man than a leaker of classified information for personal benefit, but the longer he droned on, I kept wondering if he took a class on how to speak in the tone of a conspiracy theorist.  I left with the impression that he’s just another nobody in the world who thought he found an opportunity to be seen as somebody.  However, he miscalculated and now he’ll live the remainder of his life as a loser trapped in that communist sh*thole Russia.  He’s right that the FISA “court” is trash and that Clapper is a lying scumbag, but I already knew those facts, seeing how Obama and team weaponized our intelligence agencies against Pr Trump in 2017.",8개월 전(수정됨),0,

I had never heard of Fusion centers until the congressmen brought it up on radio and also when watched a trial on a murder, a witness testified of all the Data on the phones he had from the Fusion Centers. So were the Fusion Centers setup after 9/11 or were they always in operation? We hear that federal grant funding is funneled thru states and states allocate the $ to the Centers.

I just accept it because it allows the government to provide better security to find psychopaths or terrorist quicker hopefully before they do malicious things in our society.

Assange arranged flights so he would fly to Ecuador with a connection in Moscow.  However after landed in Moscow he found out the US government just cancelled his passport.  He got stuck at the airport hotel for days as various parties trying to find a solution.  In the end Russia agreed to grant him a temporary visa.  He never intended to live in Russia.

@syang7775," @gaspardaniel3023  Ha, you'd better get the fact straight.  The secret was out via Wapo and the Guardian long time ago.  Our government was so stupid for not cancelling his passport until he was in air to Latin America via a fight connection in Moscow.

Oh, I forgot, the Soviets no longer exist. Russia has vacated communism.   That is what the Russians wanted the world to believe, especially the west and the USA. To give a false narrative that somehow the Soviet Union disbanded and communists no longer ruled Mother Russia. True, they allowed some areas like the Ukraine to rule themselves but the plan was always in mind that the Soviets would seize such areas back again in a reformed Soviet Union whose name had changed to the Russian Federation.   Snowden lives under constant 24 hour surveillance. His residence is watched, his phones are tapped. Everywhere he goes, Putin's spies follow Snowden around like they're his shadow. Putin gets Snowden's mail before Snowden does. Putin reads every letter and greeting card Snowden sends to his family and friends in the USA and elsewhere. There are more eyes on Snowden than on any other man in Russia.   And Snowden is not free to voice his disfavor with the way Putin rules the nation.

@KenchiManok,Your government left him no choice but go to that country and avoid prosecution of caring about your right to privacy. It took a self sacrifice of another man's liberty so that you can live it without worrying about it. It goes to show how ungrateful you are to people like him that still exists. You should be thankful you live in a democratic world where this kind person matters and makes a difference for the rest of us that don't have that much freedom.,1년 전,2,
@jrbaretta," @KenchiManok  Dear Bleeding Heart, you are misguided, no doubt influenced by Stone's film. The federal intelligence agencies like the CIA & NSA usually hire only pragmatic people, as opposed to idealists who believe and act opposite that of their government.   I would agree with the idea the feds should not be able to spy on whomever the want to without a court order but it happens and when it does, it is usually for national security purposes.   Besides, the feds do not have the time, money or manpower to spy on everybody, just people of interest. And they better have a good reason because the feds are accountable.   There are the military industrial complex companies, the military contractors whose workforce is based mostly in California and various southern states.   Then there is the federal intelligence work force, composed mostly of people who have lived for generation in Maryland, Delaware, Washington DC, Virginia and the Carolina's.   These families, generation after generation, become federal employees and deeply rooted in their communities and in their careers at the CIA, NSA, FBI, Homeland Security, Secret Service and at least a dozen other intelligence agencies. You will never get rid of them and no single man will ever b e able to change the way they do business. Snowden is considered an enemy by these people. Most of them.   Let's face it, federal intelligence agencies sometimes have to act outside the law, by virtue of the fact they are engaged in clandestine spy craft, espionage and saboteur work, as well as assassinations, which no court would ever sign off on but is sometimes required for political or security reasons.   I am not defending the feds, merely understanding where they are coming from. Snowden should have realized he was throwing his life away by committing treason. This is what he did.   The Russians, Chinese, North Koreans, the Iranians, etc. have all gained valuable information from the material Snowden made public through The Guardian.   Now he lives in a communist state, Russia, long known for the oppressive way the government has treated it's own citizens, which seems like just desserts for Snowden. He has become, in some ways, Number Six,  The Prisoner.",1년 전,0,
@CarterM54,"I think he did the right thing. Sure, the Russian government is bad, but the people running things behind the scenes in our government are just as bad. They just have (theoretically) more chains due to the Constitution, which they scoff at.  Edward Snowden is an American hero, and I'll stand behind him 100%, as would our Founding Fathers have done so. Don't believe it? Listen to what they wrote:  ""We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are … endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights…. That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it...""  This government has become EXTREMELY destructive of those ends.

If there ever was an interview where we needed JR interrupt with pointed questions it was this one - it didn't happen.  All I learned was that the government is spying on its citizens - gee so enlightening.  Can I have some specifics, some examples, some facts please.  From what I hear its bulk data spying from the government - The phone companies have phone records, the government finds out a terrorist's phone number, they ask phone companies for all phone numbers in its database that called that terrorist phone number. I am so shocked!  Of course everyone knows the government's power of surveillance is scary, especially lately when they are picking political sides, but I didnt need to listen to ES for 120 minutes tell us the government has so much power and not give any details other than generalities.

The drones and the surveillance are so skewed as far as the priorities right now it boggles my mind. I could lead you to places right now they're literally would save America and inform you of things going on like Federal easements and things no one else knows about yet they're watching me because of what some blonde told them. Of I was 3 weeks out from graduating academy in 09 when I got dui after taking ambien. Still one of my best friends was my roommate who is Lt police officer. This has gotten out of control and I've realized after speaking to my local rural Police department it's not them it's the topic of this video and FBI. I'm 2 seconds away from making an appointment with the headquarters of NSA and San Antonio FBI office. I may still but I want to talk to your producers please 8302853109 I'm not the least bit afraid to give out my phone number they have it and I'm on my fourth phone in 6 months because they quit working and it's literally affected my business",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@ttvvonify1844,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:55 📚 Snowden introduces his book ""Permanent Record,"" highlighting its focus on the changing landscape of technology and government post-9/11. 02:36 🤔 Snowden discusses how the media landscape, especially major network shows, limits meaningful conversations with its short-format approach. 05:39 🕵️ Snowden gives an overview of his background, revealing his role in exposing global mass surveillance in 2013 and his motivation for whistleblowing. 07:32 🛡️ Snowden explains the government's violation of constitutional rights through mass surveillance programs post-9/11, emphasizing the erosion of checks and balances. 11:55 🌐 Snowden discusses how the public lost influence over government policy, highlighting the secrecy surrounding surveillance programs and the lack of informed public consent. 19:46 🧠 Snowden describes growing up in a federal family near Fort Meade, emphasizing the influence of the federal government in Maryland. 22:03 🖥️ Snowden's early struggles in school, dropping out due to a focus on technology, and starting a web design job lead to connections within the NSA community. 24:56 🌐 Snowden recounts his experience at Fort Meade during the 9/11 attacks, highlighting the evacuation order by NSA Director Michael Hayden and questioning the government's priorities. 32:40 ⚖️ Snowden discusses the government's claim that 9/11 attacks could have been prevented through information sharing and challenges it, citing bureaucratic competition among intelligence agencies as a major hindrance. 38:35 🔄 Snowden explains the government's response to 9/11, opting for mass surveillance as a solution, driven by a fear of being held responsible for future attacks and the competitive nature of intelligence agencies. 42:39 🌍 Snowden draws parallels between global political leaders, like Putin and Trump, emphasizing how leaders exploit fear to maintain power and longevity. 44:14 🧠 Snowden warns about the susceptibility of people to promises made during times of fear, urging awareness of leaders who exploit fear for personal gain, even if their actions may worsen the situation. 44:55 🕰️ Snowden provides a condensed overview of his post-9/11 journey, from military service to NSA employment, underlining his evolving role in the intelligence community. 56:51 🌍 Snowden recounts his shift from NSA headquarters to an overseas assignment in Geneva, expressing initial excitement but beginning to question the ethics of intelligence operations, especially in human intelligence gathering. 01:01:45 🕵️ Edward Snowden worked as a private employee for Dell and pitched a private cloud system to the CIA, competing with Amazon's secret cloud system for the government. 01:04:16 🌐 Snowden unexpectedly ended up in the Office of Information Sharing, where he developed the ""Heartbeat"" system to connect intelligence community information repositories for better data access. 01:07:57 🖥️ Snowden engaged in side gigs, including running ""dirty word searches"" toidentify classified information on computer systems. 01:11:18 🔍 Snowden discovered the existence of the ""Stellar Wind"" program, a domestic mass surveillance program, through a dirty word search, highlighting the government's overclassification issues. 01:13:11 📜 The Bush White House, faced with the warrantless wiretapping scandal, passed the Protect America Act in 2007, retroactively immunizing phone companies involved in unlawful activities. 01:17:14 🔄 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments of 2008 (FAA 5-minutes Act) expanded intelligence community powers, illustrating a pattern of making legal what agencies were already doing, rather than ensuring compliance with the law. 01:20:14 📄 In 2012, Snowden had access to a classified Inspector General's report that exposed the involvement of key figures like Dick Cheney and Nancy Pelosi in the Stellar Wind program, revealing the government's disregard for legality and constitutional principles. 01:21:35 🚨 Snowden emphasizes the shift from ""public safety"" to ""national security,"" indicating a transformation where the public is no longer a partner in government but subject to it, raising concerns about the erosion of democratic principles. 01:23:10 🕵️ Real-world conspiracies involve ordinary people, not just secretive individuals, working together for various reasons, such as job security or mutual benefits. 01:25:03 🤔 Governments justify expanded powers by claiming it's for safety, but Snowden questions why, if truly keeping citizens safe, they wouldn't openly discuss and vote on such measures in Congress. 01:26:13 🔍 The concentration of executive power in the White House, involving CIA, NSA, FBI, and DOJ, poses risks as individuals at the top levels interpret broad authorities, leading to potential abuses without criminal penalties. 01:27:53 🕵️ Snowden emphasizes the importance of transparency for public officials, allowing citizens to scrutinize decisions, policies, and programs to prevent abuse of power. 01:37:42 📜 Snowden reveals the broken legal system where attempts to challenge the legality of classified programs are hindered by the government's use of state secrets, leaving the courts unable to rule on the constitutionality of these programs. 01:45:29 🕵️ Edward Snowden discusses a critical moment where Senator Ron Wyden questions General James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, about domestic mass surveillance. Clapper falsely denies it under oath, revealing a significant breach of trust. 01:46:34 🏛️ Snowden reflects on the consequences of lying under oath in a democracy, raising concerns about accountability when officials deceive Congress. Clapper later admitted to the lie, but the lack of correction and consequences is troubling for democracy. 01:47:59 🤔 Snowden shares the internal struggle he faced before deciding to expose NSA surveillance programs. He waited for others to act, highlighting the challenge whistleblowers face in risking their lives, careers, and personal safety. 01:49:21 🌐 Snowden discusses early NSA whistleblowers like Bill Binney, Thomas Drake, and Kirk Wiebe, who faced repercussions for revealing domestic surveillance programs. These whistleblowers played a crucial role in informing the public about government overreach. 02:06:11 🕵️ Snowden's operational security was initially high due to being the ""most wanted man,"" impacting his daily life. 02:06:38 🌐 Snowden's life gradually became more open, and he now lives openly, riding the Metro and going to restaurants. 02:07:32 🕵️ Snowden is recognized a few times a year, even without glasses, by ""super recognizers"" in various public places. 02:09:24 🏛️ The chances of Snowden getting a fair trial in the Eastern District of Virginia, near the CIA headquarters, seem slim. 02:11:10 ⚖️ The Espionage Act, a strict liability crime, prohibits juries from considering the whistleblower's motivations, focusing solely on the act. 02:13:28 🏛️ Snowden urges the government to permit whistleblowers a public interest defense in court. 02:14:35 🇷🇺 Snowden discusses his civil opposition to Russian government policies, emphasizing his criticism of Russia's treatment of opposition figures. 02:20:38 🇷🇺 Snowden acknowledges the potential risk of being kicked out of Russia but emphasizes the importance of speaking out against injustices. 02:22:39 🌐 Snowden encourages individuals to take small actions for a better world, highlighting the collective strength in making a difference. 02:24:23 📱 Snowden notes the shift to mobile-first surveillance since 2013, highlighting concerns about privacy on smartphones. 02:26:12 📱 IMEI and IMSI are unique identifiers in phones: IMEI is in the handset, IMSI is in the SIM card. They help in tracking the phone's presence and identity. 02:29:09 🌐 Constant data collection by phones creates valuable information for big data, leading to privacy concerns and potential misuse. 02:32:08 🔒 Turning off phones might not be foolproof; some can still be hacked to appear off while remaining active. Faraday cages and awareness are suggested for personal mitigation. 02:37:15 📲 Lack of visibility and control over phone activities is a significant issue. Users should be able to monitor and manage app connections, but current systems often prevent this. 02:39:34 💻 Corporations and governments intentionally hide the extent of data collection and surveillance, exploiting legal doctrines like the third-party doctrine to justify mass data acquisition. 02:40:27 💰 The commodification of personal data occurred before individuals fully understood its value, creating challenges in regaining control and privacy. 02:41:20 🌐 The evolution of surveillance from targeted to indiscriminate is explored in Snowden's book ""Permanent Record,"" revealing intentional concealment of data collection activities.

So vital if we're ever gonna see it unfold. Edward Snowden has just transformed my world and given me less a reason to hate as much as I do, I mean it, it really does not play out well if you're in constant fight with your own idealism of what the problem is with the world of today and your place in it simply because of all the BROKEN it's been over our time (Born '87) that I could practically toss out my own mother's loving care in hindsight over a bigger share in society's whirlpool of achievements and status in a heartbeat. Pretty sure I already have but... isn't it the universal law in guaranteeing we keep evolving our beliefs in being a better and more progressive generation than each before..? Uhh, yeah!! Yeah it is! Always is, always has been, it's just that this time we're exposing this much larger leap needed to take in eliminating FEAR INOCULATION by, well... by DECOLATION in your honour, dear US!!

making a difference requires heroic decisions, not waiting for heroes.  02:25:05 📱 Mobile devices, especially smartphones, pose significant privacy risks due to constant connections, even when seemingly inactive.  02:27:46 🗂 Data collection is pervasive, with companies and governments collecting and storing information, eroding privacy.  02:34:57 🔒 While personal mitigation strategies exist, the complexity of modern technology makes complete privacy difficult to achieve.  02:40:00 💰 Data became valuable before people fully understood its implications, making it challenging to reverse surveillance practices.  02:45:32 ⚖ A legal case from the 1970s set a precedent that personal records held by companies don't require a warrant for government access.  02:46:14 📑 This precedent allowed the government to argue that records held by companies, like phone records, don't have Fourth Amendment protection, granting them easier access.  02:46:28 🌐 This legal interpretation was established before the internet and smartphones, impacting modern society's privacy in unforeseen ways.",2년 전,766,

Why do so many idiots find the first argument logical and compelling, while they find the second argument illogical and absurd? Aren't both arguments illogical and absurd?  Do you want to know why the US is broke and subject to an increasingly totalitarian surveillance regime?

That self-centeredness and greed were major problems, but at heart we were good people with noble warrior spirits. Now it’s painfully clear that most people, and all of those in control, are 100% self-interested and that greed is the main and usually only driving force for human beings. And in this situation, people want to vote back in an actual crazy person who almost started a civil war and did cause an insurrection against their own government, almost started a nuclear war to win a Twitter snit, then stole nuclear weapon technology secrets, probably to sell (why else honestly tell me) a crime which would result in executions for you or me but is not even a topic of debate with this monster because the tide of crazed people with teeth thrashing in foamed mouths screaming hate is dangerously close to half the population.

@glennplumb2313,"Edward Snowden is not a good actor he never looks up when he’s giving information he’s remembering exactly how the CIA wants him to release information we already know, Every intelligence agent has no idea what another agent is up to they control parts of a plan not knowing the full plan only the Intelligence director has the power to know the entire workings which ironically Snowden held that position 😂USA intelligence directors are older like Rumsfeld, Powell,w.Clark trusted men who also understand military tactics and have the respect of current Generals who collect all & any information the president requests from any Gov agency CIA FBI CIB Navy army Air Force, Scientist inc virologists like Fauci, Then add in that he says he was Travelling to Sth America when his passport was canceled trapping him where? Russia 😂 instead of letting him continue to Sth America where USA could extradite him he’s fully protected even given a Russian visa so USA can’t touch him, He doesn’t say anything we didn’t already know about Israeli spy software pelican2 & “no click” used by many Governments in 2003 General Wesley Clark told us even telling us Rumsfeld has planned to overthrow 7 foreign regimes in 5 yrs no one blinked, Snowden is a CIA plant who’s job is to reignite attention on Wikileaks backing Assange because wiki is a CIA covert operation to gather information from whistleblowers while releasing documents which become inadmissible in the ICC giving USA immunity from any war crimes Wikileaks exposes, There’s only one reason the ICC cannot hold USA accountable and that’s Julian Assange 😂 All a American operation that’s fooled (Almost) everyone without one single repercussions to USA 😂",2년 전,0,

Snowden may have committed an action against his government, and sought refuge in another country. But what we need to debate here was his intent with releasing those documents. Was he attempting to support Al-Qaida? Then he's a traitor. Was he trying to enlighten his fellow citizens and support the people he was sworn to protect? Then although his actions can be arguably legal/illegal, good/bad, he certainly isn't a traitor- he was trying to help his country rather than betray it.  I think we should be a lot more careful with that word- it delineates a specific kind of intent along with an action, but people tend to just attribute it to the action without the prerequisite intent present.   And the courts make it illegal for the accused to mention what their motives are/were when accused under espionnage. Ridiculous.",2년 전,1,

We had the Pentagon after WWII and there was still had the Korea surprise and 911.  So interesting was the reaction of the CIA and NSA to send everyone home!  Really, it makes you wonder what the mission statement of those agency’s really means.  In comparison, do you think that that the British sent home all the analysts when the Germans were bombing London in WWII?  Or were they at their stations tracking the Germans every movement?

@BrendanPowerMusic,"There's a fundamental irony about Edward Snowdon which unfortunately doesn't get addressed in this otherwise excellent podcast.  The basic urge that drove him to expose the NSA (and still clearly drives him now) is a need to make the American people aware of a creeping totalitarianism in the US government that they were/are unaware of, and which is against the fundamental tenets of their democracy. He's saying ""Look people, this is happening, and here's the proof. We need to fight this or all is lost: our democratic rights and freedoms are gone forever.""   That's wonderful, but look where he's ended up: in the lap of one of the nastiest, most totalitarian regimes in the world, who long since trampled over whatever few rights the Russians had, and use state power in the most brutal way against their own people on a routine daily basis.   It's a pity Joe didn't point that out and query it. (Mind you he could hardly get a word in edgeways because this was basically a monologue, not a discussion).   Furthermore this sinister, cynical, gangster state is only giving Snowdon sanctuary because it serves its purpose well to have a passionate, powerful critic of its secret service adversaries in the West keeping up his eviscerating attack on what they do, and how they do it. What a gift!  And where does Ed choose to make this particular attack? The Joe Rogan show, hosted on YouTube, which is owned by none other than Google - one of the tech giants Edward Snowdon loves to hate, because of their all pervading surveillance of our lives...   Irony piled on irony... It would be funny if it weren't so tragic!  These fundamental paradoxes are something Snowdon should reflect as deeply upon as he does on everything else - but strangely they seem to have eluded his gaze. Sadly Joe doesn't seem to grasp them either. Disappointing from both of them.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

In the case of America, they basically know the public has no power against their capabilities and therefore exerts their will onto them. It's as simple as looking at a fistfight.

That leads to a better ubderstanding ,cause now ppl are more and more asked,hear what is going on. And just by doing that ,ppl will do the right thing and choose the right president for them.

@frodejotnar9899,"They used your god against you. They have you believe we are one nation under god, that people are good and do not sin. That they do not lie, or that they “serve and protect”. They lied to you, they are still lying to you. Maybe what they are lying about is not important to you, but it is still a lie. They take from you, power. They use that power to take your money, if you do not pay they take your homes and belongings. They use that money to buy more power through connections. Then they take your rights to protect themselves from you if you were able to outsmart them or if their cover is blown. It’s not their fault, it’s yours. You gave them exactly what they needed because you had faith in them being good honest people. They used you and your faith. It’s not to late to take America back and build its democracy the way our forefather planned for it to be. How it was before the corruption altered and changed the Declaration of Independence, or worse before they “created” the constitution. Everything they have done has been done to protect them from you. You as an American need to stop listening, stop listening and start talking. Use your guns, they took your voice in the constitution. Speaking against them even if you are right is now “treason”. Ironic that we wanting the best for OUR country is treason. Guns are all you have but once they go, so does everything. An when you do not stand together to shed the corruption, know that it is only your fault. You let fear and foolishness, cost your children or grandchildren or maybe even great grandchildren pay the price. They will suffer for what you allowed to transpire. #makeamericagreatagainnotwithtrumpbutwithtruth",2년 전,0,

He gave all the information he had to the American public in the hopes that the would do something about it (surprise, surprise, nobody did anything).

It actually so much more darker and deeper then the story that he’s selling.    As as as whistleblowers go  There was only who write an memoir manifesto type documented . Of what he’s done and went threw to he come a cia agent and a man in black,  He told the world about the corona virus in the 90’s  early 2000’s he said in the manifesto that an other virus much like a plague was gonna be spread around with out anyone aware of this .  In 2018.    He then said he was a top agent and he had classified access to some of the project they were working on.   And he said the United States isn’t gonna to use there 5D technology to produce a mothership that’s 3 miles long and millions of smaller UFO’s covering the sky .  They will all Look , Sound and Feel,  like the real thing.   And it will all be holograms. Holograms that can actually blew shitt up. They can make it seem like it’s coming strait from the holographic 5Dimensional Fake spaceship alien attack.   He said it will happen in 2024. If that’s really true then we got 18 months or less , before the fake attack happens.  And when it does happen immediately after this happens all the world orders will form there One World Order .  That I’m not sure trump has actually said it or JFK had said it . And I’m not sure if Carter had Talked about it,  from what I understand he didn’t do much when he was president , they  all talk about it in their speeches , the new world order but every other president that I can remember since Ford has talked about it.   He said that over night  they will publicly announce a new world order on the world.  And most people will let this happen because there are scared . And was old Sam to save them .

He didn't CHOOSE Russia, his passport was canceled while en route to Latin America, forcing him to go somewhere where he could travel to without an active passport.  Snowden is a patriot for showing every Joe Blow blue collar worker that his country which indoctrinated you to believe you have constitutional protections, is in fact colluding with your telecommunications providers (AT&T, Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, etc.) to save and store EVERY SINGLE bit of data (phone, text, internet) in the event that something you said or even searched for compromised elected and appointed officials' cash flow or position of power- all under the guise of ""national security"". You're not free. Your political leader(s) are JUST as evil and corrupt as Putin! Snowden is in Russia because people like you brand him as a traitor, whereas he SHOULD be home and applauded for the temerity it took to expose the bipartisan corruption KNOWING that he would have to look over his shoulder and seek refuge in either Russia, Iran, China, North Korea or Afghanistan!  The Clinton's, Obama's & Comet Pizza (in Washington DC) and the sex trafficking of hundreds of thousands of children; Bush and Chaney's bullshit story of WMD's (where Colin Powell owned that he mislead the UN in order to garnish support to invade Iraq). He is a patriot, he didn't betray anyone other than the corrupt politicians who have exploited the American People. You should be ashamed of yourself for buying right into the narrative these corrupt people have fed you, because he should be able to have a FAIR trial, where a jury of his peers could hear HIS conduct. He exposed TRUTH, he isn't a spy, or a foreign actor trying to inform enemies. His conduct wasn't espionage, it was bravery. He shouldn't be condemned because of where he sought refuge. He even says that he doesn't want to be in Russia, and he gave them the same information he gave us. He could still be in Hawaii spying on everyone getting paid salary. He's a good man, and I respect and admire his courage. I think you are indoctrinated and have no concept of critical thinking. Shame on you, I hope you learn to think for yourself and not absorb the information provided by the same conglomerates who are selling out your data.

You are targeted by MK ultra program. A detective or participant alerts neighbors or bystanders you are under investigation and possibly in a watch list or something; for example telling store employees not to assist you with finding what you are looking for and know that they carrie an item , but can’t find it for you.

Side effects from direct energy emf cause your ear ringing high pitch noise while starting calibration.

Find other aware victims to join together and live off grid because the east coast tsunami is next.  Don’t go see a primary care physician because they know you are in the mk ultra program.

Challenge  government corruption and criminality even through offically sanctioned channels, you face financial and professional ruin at the least and many years behind bars.  There have been dozens of whistleblowers (i.e. Binny, Wiebe, Kiriakou, et al) who had to stand alone in secret courts and paid a heavy price for their bravery. And what was the result of Snowden's revelation? Nothing.  Mass surveillance continues but with some window dressing. The corporations are now empowered to do what the NSA and CIA had been doing. Our government sees each and every one of us as a threat. The American people are enemy #1 for Uncle Sam.

LMAO let’s just stop this  large corporations have purchased their rights in this country. when BP had a major spill because done jackass did know how to implement a procedure, BP should have been shut down, because we would have been shut down.  when volkswagen broke the law with that emissions scandal, they should have really paid the price to US, not to the politicians.  this one is one of the worst….when the banks were lending money to people they knew could never pay it back, the banking system should have had a total overhaul….but what happened?

This is destined for failure when protection for the common man is not a guarantee but rather bill paid for by those that only need protection from another government buttttttt I also wouldn’t leak information that could cause harm to those risking their lives to do a job that they don’t have to do.

@winsomewife7112,"Had me suckered for only 45 minutes, then he lost me when he claimed all Trump voters only voted for him out of irrational fear.  In 2016 I was 45 and had been discouraged for decades about politicians on either side causing increasing national debt, illegal immigration including slave dealers & violent young men or fools that end up killing people by accident bcz they're morons, and politicians allowing terrible education then blaming us hard working suburban/rural people for the bad education, poverty & crime in the cities.  We watched politicians getting extremely rich from bribery & insider trading, regular people getting the book thrown at them for tiny offenses while politicians & their children break big laws and totally get away with it, government making it REALLY REALLY difficult to start & run a small business, people jailed over selling fresh healthy milk while violent criminals are often allowed by government to attack women & children.  Mr Deep State Snowden, we didn't vote for Trump out of fear but of common sense.   People can be rational & have healthy fear at the same time.  It's why drivers stop at red lights, it's why people carefully travel stairs & eat relatively healthy or exercise, all common sense at the same time as fear.  They're part of the same coin.  Maybe you started out as an honest whistleblower, but they got to you obviously.  Your 100% lack of support for Trump making government less powerful, making education much better, making small business much easier, it's all very telling.  You really think half the country is totally stupid & vote irrationally, The people that grow your food & do most of the real work you benefit from.  You're so unthankful.  You didn't do enough physical work growing up or as an adult, which is why you are so disconnected from how hard working people think.  According to your ""logic""  you could say that any vote ever cast has been out of fear.  Getting dressed is out of fear, eating breakfast, going to work, planting a garden, turning lights on, hiring security or locking doors, swimming lessons, most anything can be said to be motivated by fear, but not always from irrational fear.  The Constitution was written out of logical fear for tyrannical government developing.  The Democrat Party & fake Republicans hate some babies & lifelong marriage & having mostly educated black/brown people based on how mostly Dems run the schools.  You seem to be for the USA being mostly controlled by foreign leaders.  Trump wants We The People to run our country, but you're a giant government guy claiming that wanting more freedom will make things worse.

But I think he needs a more “fk it attitude”, he needs to act more like a flawed human like the rest of us so we can relate better, instead of acting like a “perfect politician” or in other words, act less like the fake crooks in power who made him a target for checking them.

@DaxsDad,"While I'm sure the ""Messiah"" complex had a part, that is only a part of why information wasn't shared. Other parts include the presumption the ""other"" agencies already had that same information.,  Yet another part is,  that those that DID know (not believing it would be as bad as it was), chose not to do anything simply because they did not want to lose their sources (blow their cover) (We did a similar thing with the Enigma Machine. Since early as The Spanish Inquisition, the importance & effectiveness of data analysis has been known and utilized. Physicists and mathematicians have been used to working on problems (Theories and equations), they know (105 yr average) would not be solved during their lifetime. Often in mathematics especially in trying to figure out the exponents, there are differing thoughts on how to best approach the equation.) But their goals are the same.    IBM built many of the machines to collect and use data analysis in 1939 (before supposed computers even existed). The US has been spying on its citizens (in mass) ever since (though records, surveys, spy planes in the 60's & 70's, Satellites in the 80's & now the internet, the Government has been illegally listening to our conversations). WWII changed the way we do EVERYTHING.    but make no mistake about it, Jung (Psychology) has neen taught in every ivy league school in the world for generations now. Re-action and causality are well established principles. They are used in every chess match.  Don't discredit the understanding of the higher intelligence at play here. Much of this is not just random chance. Similar to them offering either only an administrative or conduct discharge, instead of a medical discharge, and how, that was long term really ultimately for their own gain. They (the system, not necessarily the individual people) are aware of these things.  So, while there may not be some (single) secret cabal, or super villain that we can point to and say, ""Oh, there's the problem"", That doesn't mean they don't exist. It's just broader spectrum.

@motinaja,you are ignoring that all the evidence of what reallly happend on 9/11 was destroyed by the government. This is treason in itself. There was no search for explosives. All the 60+ videos of what really hit the Pentagon has never been published dispite the court ruling to release them. That is the same as helping the terrorists. Most people -including Snowden is clouded by emotional incompentence. There are stacks of evidence that Bin Laden was an asset with the mission to create a reason to increase the US millitay budget that had been cut in half because of the fall of the wall. That could be why NSA and CIA send home everybody under the 9/11 attack instead of hunting the terrorists.,3년 전,1,

I think it gets seriously underappreciated just how much all this manipulates and confuses a person's sense of reality too, and knowing the right thing to do and when to do it is incredibly difficult. He even set it out plainly that the President is subject to what is basically a psyop, their reality is manipulated and challenged to trigger a certain outcome, and if even a person with as much power as a president is subject to this and it can be so effective, that's... Well, I can think of many words, so I'll let you fill the blank. It occurs to me even Biden would have been subjected to this, and I can imagine this could make someone susceptible to a mental breakdown. I'm not saying this happened to Biden, though who could rule this out either? It sounded like govt and these agencies are basically afraid of the same thing Edward is, that they would be judged so severely and perhaps even worse, to end up the way it did in something like the Nuremberg trials, and that is an understandable concern, because people have been violated and upset and their reality was a lie, there was no informed consent of any value, etc... However, someone once said to build a golden bridge for your enemy to retreat across, and I'm not sure there's an alternative that's better or more available. I wouldn't want the people doing this to fear settings things right. That's the outcome I am interested in. That's not permission to keep doing these things, but hopefully a way out. However, for those who simply don't want a way out, they will have pushed the breaking point. I can't see that ending well.

Although often self deprecating, his somewhat bloviated account of his career reveals his arrogance, which I can get past for the most part because I can see how he would be desperate to tell his story, and aren’t we all the hero of our own story? But I do think his storytelling could be condensed minus some of the self aggrandizing. I have to admit though, when his politics peak out and you see how deeply liberal he is (ie his comments on Trump) he loses me a bit. I’m less likely to trust the point of view of any given event when it’s recounted by a hyper partisan narrator. However, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, fuck Dick Cheney.",3년 전,2,

Which means ONE PERSON could drop two accusations against you and suddenly you're literally getting your asshole ripped apart on a Judas Cradle for days at a time; until you died from it. Victims would usually die from infections because they rarely ever washed the device. I wasn't until America was created that we had ""Innocent until proven guilty"" but now all of that is getting reversed and they don't even care if you're innocent anymore. They're not ripping people's assholes apart on a Judas Cradle anymore but they will still spy on you; without a warrant; even if you've committed no crime.

@davidvoigts5077,"@1:31  That's the gist of Movie 43.  I pitch a lot of movie and TV show ideas in comment sections just like this one.  I'm a former naval officer and I do outreach for everyday people who are targeted with the Havana Syndrome weapons.  I was using the comments section to push for more info on the Harvey Weinstein case as I knew it would be a stepping stone to explaining how his contract stalking and intimidation scheme is pervasive among government institutions, corporations, and the Hollywood elite.  I had already pitched an idea for a movie about Jackie Robinson called '42' and Movie 43 was sort of a joke played off 42 and how I had pitched so many movie ideas that had gotten made (how many movies are we up to now 42?  43?).    There's an episode of King of the Hill titled 'Peggy's Fan Fair' that describes some of the pieces parts of my approach toward freeing the people who are targeted in these discrediting schemes.  This was the explanation Snowden is giving at an hour thirty into the video, but in reverse.  The general idea behind Movie 43 is that it was supposed to be an intentionally terrible movie but all these A-list celebrities would be lured in one by one.  As the first one is signed, you use that person's involvement to pitch to the next person and the next person, and before you know it all of these well-known actors are involved and at some point, they realize it was all a big prank and a scheme to talk about contract stalking and harassment.  Any one of the folks in Movie 43 could have spoken up about this scheme publicly and it would have resulted in thousands and thousands of everyday people being freed from a repressive harassment and stalking program.  The Justice Department's 'Operation Foxhunt' describes a similar conspiracy.  The press conference announcing that indictment is on the internet.  If you see any of the following movies in the future, then it got made because I pitched it in a comments section in furtherance of freeing these people:  Alf, One Time Around the Track, Avalon, Ten Pin Drop, or Alf 2.",3년 전,0,

Governments are comprised of imperfect humans, hence the checks and balances system they devised for us.  Human nature is governed by temptation, fear of shame, and a thirst for power.   After our country’s founding it became wildly successful, probably beyond anything the Founding Fathers imagined.  With that our federal (central) government has also exploded. It has become so large that more and more abuses can by hidden and have no real checks against them.  National security agencies, because of their mission, should have triple the checks on them that you would normally have on a government agency.

Unfortunately social media has become a reckless tool of division and has dumbed down the public discourse to where we still can’t have an honest conversation about stuff like this as a society.    John Olivers episode on data brokers is a good follow up to this interview, as to the omnipotent power of the current surveillance system, which you don’t even need to be in government to use.

I can verify due to the nature of my studies that almost every app is always asynchronously communicating with servers if it’s open.  Apple appears to have disabled tracking on a lot of things, good for them.  Google, for all the good it does, is so large and complex and because we can’t get more transparency, leaves it up to conspiracy theorists who virally spread disinformation , knowingly or not.    This video was pre-coup attempt also, and the amount of information they’ve collected investigating it basically proves how powerful these systems are.

@FreedomOnALeash1776,"The US wanted Snowden to do what he did, they wanted him to become a whistle-blower and leak information. Why? It makes sense, because if someone is warning you that they are behind you, that rules out the possibility of you becoming startled to the point of punching them in the face. It rules out any backlash and conflict of any sort that may come their way from being otherwise secretive to the point of startling you and possibility causing a fight. In short, yes they're doing you a service by effectively not scaring you, but mainly they're covering their own ass. Now there's no conflict, no fight, no real need to get involved with you past simply letting you know that they're behind you. They may not even need to explain what they're doing as long as you're comfortable enough to where you won't turn around and question them because of how seemingly aware of your surroundings you are. Speaking of surroundings, hiding in plain sight is the best place to hide because when people see the same things everyday, those things become much less interesting and over time people stop talking about them and stop asking questions. They get used to seeing these same things and become comfortable with what they think they know. So... let me tie this together. Edward Snowden leaks information, people talk about that information and it becomes an opinionated war waged among We The People. An opinionated battle between each individual with what they think is going on, given the information leaked. However, the fact that this information was even ""leaked"" in the first place, better yet provided, was a very clever and intentional move in this secretive game of chess we call life as we know it. Because yes, it was a move made by someone in this world we live in, and yes, this world we live in is effectively a gigantic chess board. After a while people become less and less interested in the things Snowden is leaking, even if they may be true. They stop caring, they quit paying attention and they move on with their lives. Eventually they'll either begin to ignore it or they'll forget about it. Either way, they've effectively become desensitized to the notion, to the idea that whatever Snowden is saying may possibly be true. There you have it, a nation that's heard it all. A nation that has become used to the very idea that they're possibly being watched, without being told directly by anyone other than a ""whistle-blower"". Now it's no longer a conflict for the US, because we've been warned, we've been disclosed and we're no longer scared of the idea of being monitored along with any other tyrannical notions. Now, whatever happens effectively becomes small talk and is easily hidden and confused with all of the murmuring opinions of We The People. It's a mildly difficult concept or notion to explain but in short this is what I believe.",3년 전,0,

In order, so that they can import their votes for a globalist agenda. Snowed outed the NWO spying yet he just threw under the bus the very leaders trying to stop the agenda of the NWO. Snowden must come on and clarify his position on who is opposing this oppressive NWO agenda, including his protector of Vlad Putin and Xi!

@agny369,"This is one of the good ones …. I wouldn’t describe Joe Rogans 2021 collection this way.  I’m neutral on Joe Rogan as a whole but there’s not a question in my mind that he seriously dropped the ball during the COVID era, and his agenda was very much noticeable.    I don’t think he does it intentionally , and he admits his ignorance at times, but he also refuses to take responsibility for platforming grifters, whether it be intentional or not.  I’m not saying every guest is a grifter, I’m just saying that Joe has become a bit too prideful (at least in 2021) and unwilling to admit when he’s platformed a bullshit artist to 7 million people without pushing back on easily available information .  It’s fine when you put a truly intelligent guy like Snowden on, who you can independently verify that was he’s saying is true, but most people who watch do not have the wisdom to actually follow up and confirm that a guest is telling the truth, and that’s fundamentally the problem that snowden talks about in this extremely long but informative talk.    The reliability of any Joe Rogan episode depends on the integrity of the guest he has on, and he failed to vet some of his more harmful guests in 2021, and there’s more people dead because of the absence of journalistic responsibility that Rogan somehow thinks doesn’t apply to him.  Like I said overall I’m neutral on him,  but we have a media literacy problem  and a technological understanding problem in this country and it’s not getting better.  I understood a lot of the nuance Snowden was talking about because I’m also in IT, but most people have no idea .  Joe just doesn’t have the will or the wisdom to press people that should be pressed, and whether he realizes or not, he’s an easy person to take advantage of if the guest has an agenda.",3년 전,0,

'Bio-Weapons of Mass Destruction' !!! It’s a terrible paradox in the life of Colin Powell, who died Monday, October 14th, 2021 .. that the most important moment of his celebrated career came not when he led troops under fire in Vietnam, or when he orchestrated the successful expulsion of Iraqi invaders from Kuwait in 1991, or when he became the nation’s first African American national-security adviser and Secretary of State. ~ It came, instead, on the dais of the United Nations Security Council, in 2003, when Powell, who was then Secretary of State, made the case for the invasion of Iraq, based on the conclusion that Saddam Hussein possessed nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and thus had to be removed by force. The enduring image from that moment is Powell holding up a tiny vial of white powder, which stood for what was supposed to be Saddam’s anthrax, and, mortgaging his esteemed reputation and all the credibility of the U.S. government, telling the world that the U.S. had no choice but to go to war. “My colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources,’’ Powell told the Security Council. “What we are giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.” -  Saddam Hussein launched a large-scale chemical weapons attack against Iraq's Kurdish population in the late 1980s, killing thousands. On at least 10 occasions, Saddam Hussein's military forces have attacked Iranian and Kurdish targets with combinations of mustard gas and nerve agents through the use of aerial bombs, 122-millimeter rockets, and conventional artillery shells. Saddam Hussein continued his efforts to develop chemical weapons: Gaps identified by UNSCOM in Iraqi accounting and current production capabilities strongly suggest that Iraq maintains stockpiles of chemical agents, probably VX, sarin, cyclosarin and mustard. Iraq has not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical precursors and tens of thousands of unfilled munitions, including Scud variant missile warheads. Iraq has not accounted for at least 15,000 artillery rockets that in the past were its preferred vehicle for delivering nerve agents, nor has it accounted for about 550 artillery shells filled with mustard agent. Iraq continues to rebuild and expand dual-use infrastructure that it could quickly divert to chemical weapons production, such as chlorine and phenol plants. Iraq is seeking to purchase chemical weapons agent precursors and applicable production equipment, and is making an effort to hide activities at the Fallujah plant, which was one of Iraq's chemical weapons production facilities before the Gulf War. At Fallujah and three other plants, Iraq now has chlorine production capacity far higher than any civilian need for water treatment, and the evidence indicates that some of its chlorine imports are being diverted for military purposes. --  Colin Powell was right .. but he could never prove it. ~~",3년 전(수정됨),0,

A hero... trapped in a country he initially didn't want to be in. Considering that Ecuador has handed over Julian Assange to the status quo in Britain, the status quo in the USA probably blundered by ""stranding"" him in the hands of our supposed enemy, Russia.  Edward Snowden is a HERO!, in spite of his protesting that he is not. His acts of heroism weren't spontaneous, but deliberate and thoughtful, self-sacrificing, for his fellow citizens and his country.  He should be free to go anywhere in the world he chooses, including the United States of America, the country he loves and he is fighting for, to exist as our founders desired. In this fight he wants to restore to the average American citizen their freedom of speech and right to privacy.  I'm sure Edward Snowden hopes the politically comatose average American will become an active citizen, participating in and becoming knowledgeable about their government and the politics of the world, as well as the corporate fascism that threatens our Constitution and our rights and freedoms...

@extramile669,I'm afraid you probably nailed it on the head! I mean just are president and the whole party not even working for the people it's been proven essentially that large and powerful companies are making most of the decisions so it totally plays to what he is saying how they are supposed to be working for the people with everything they do being decided basically by us and also transparent I've always told people that is obviously why they've brainwashed people into hearing trump I mean like the man or not I don't care but to the level they have gone to try to make him look crazy or like he is out to hurt this country is Ludacris but what they didn't like is him standing between corporate America and their pockets he threw up so many road blocks without even realizing it when he took office and also he was the first to not have 100s of lobbyist and other large corporations funding his campaign etc!  I mean look at the keystone pipeline for example clearly there is a oil company that is already making tons of money and wanted them shut down and it just so happens Biden had one of the large oil company s  controlling what he would do when in office acting as if he cares about going green and having a cleaner America world!!   I could go in didn't mean to go down q rabbit hole but I to get a bit down thinking about where we are at and how I just want them all out of are gov and start fresh with much more transparency and rules that must be followed!    I do agree very depressing to say the least I want to say let's do something about it but it seems they have distanced us from being able to really have a voice they just like to make us think we have one and have the media tell us are opinions  so it must be true lol,3년 전,0,

@devitomichael," @baadlyrics8705      I respectfully disagree that intelligence and articulated speech go hand in hand. As an example I would like to use teachers. Many teachers possess a wealth of knowledge, but how many teachers are actually good at teaching? It’s one thing to possess certain skills or knowledge, but an entirely different thing to be able to actually convey such skills or knowledge to another person. This is why it’s so rare to find that one teacher who actually stands out from the rest. From school teacher to BJJ instructor, the most appreciable difference between people is often their ability to convey information effectively. As another example, consider just how many people have been exited a job interview in favor of another person who could better articulate his skills and knowledge. Elon Musk for example, is painfully aware of how much TALENT that he may have passed over in favor of those who could better articulate themselves. I do agree that there is certainly a correlation between intelligence and the ability to convey information, I just don’t believe that this correlation is exclusive.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@ImGoingSupersonic,"Its impossible for Snowden to answer a question with either yes or no.  Snowden, do you like Taco Bell? Ummm, ahAHAHHA, well ummm. You know with Taco Bell it isn't the powerhouse in fast food as it used to be. The menu has changed many times. If not 100s of times over the years. Locations have been improved on sure, their commercials have been more intriguing only recently aside from the little ahh, the little Chihuahua campaign they ran in the 90s. Which was brilliant by the way, but Taco Bell still wasn't on my mind like say, McDonald's or or or, or even Burger King. And i would ask myself, why is that? Why is McDonald's more of a powerhouse than Taco Bell and for so many years. What is Taco Bell doing or or ahh NOT doing, in my so many words, to where a person like myself or my neighbors or even the local mechanic aren't eating Taco Bell as Taco Bell would hope all Americans would. I've never seen a family picnic where they were sitting down, nice sunny day, few clouds and a nice breeze, smiling and all eating Taco Bell. But i have seen on many occasions McDonald's food being present during the commission of a picnic and a family. So anyone should be thinking, wow, McDonald's HAS to have better food than it's competitors, such as Taco Bell. And as each day passes and people ask me, am i not understanding something about the fast food industry,  which is a multi, MULTI-billion dollar industry, and i wonder how many people think the way that i do about such a controversial topic.

And once I heard him explaining that the federal agencies whom are in charge of our defense at an information and authority based level were sent home, basically no witnesses available to view the tapes and/or real time situations, then the interviews and lack of video evidence at the Pentagon makes total sense and shows even more proof that Sept 11th and the places that were attacked were all orchestrated.",3년 전,0,

@Russ5Tide,Absolutely amazing how Snowden released all this info back in 2013 when it wasn’t as big of a daily issue. He was way ahead of the times and could almost see the future. This guy is smart as hell and is an American treasure. Damn shame he is left in Russia especially right now with the war in Ukraine and not still in America working to help make this country better. Trump should have pardoned him. And Biden should and the DOJ should agree to his terms so he can come back and have a  real JURY TRIAL. Ostracized for being honest. But our media lies every single day. Hardly seems fair huh 🤔,3년 전,0,
@Arcturian1111,"The Pentagon wasnt attacked by a 747. It was struck with a bunker granite missile, which was done by our very own military.  The supposed terrorist pilot of the plane, couldnt pass a small plane Cessna test,  let alone steer this huge 747 into the Pentagon. A seasoned veteran airline pilot said it would take him at least 10 trys to do that maneuver.  Clue: Where were the actual survaillance cameras around the Pentagon grounds when the supposed plane struck it. Very Interesting to say the least that there wasnt any real good video footage, of the worlds most important structure.

@JesusChristEmmanuel,"St. Matthew 7 Judge not, that you may not be judged,  2 For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.  3 And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye?  4 Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye?  5 Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam in thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.  6 Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turning upon you, they tear you.  7 Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.  8 For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.  9 Or what man is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone?  10 Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?  11 If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more will your Lord God, the Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?  12 All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them. For this is the law and the prophets.  13 Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat.  14 How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!  15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  16 By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.  19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.  20 Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.  21 Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Lord God, the Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.  22 Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name?  23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.  24 Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock,  25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.  26 And every one that heareth these my words, and doth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand,  27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.  28 And it came to pass when Lord God, the Great King Jesus Christ had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine.  29 For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes and Pharisees.    Word of the Blessed Lord God, the King.  Thank You Blessed Lord God, the King and Savior Jesus Christ.    All you great numerous enemies; the enemy of the holy death of my Lord God, the King and Master Jesus Christ on the Cross of Calvary; the prince of darkness and iniquity, the father of all liars; I stand on the death of my Lord and Master Jesus Christ and offer His pains, wounds, and the Precious Blood of His left hand to the Eternal Father Lord God for your downfall, your destruction and your scourging. Amen. Precious Blood of my Lord and Master Jesus Christ - reign in me and in the lives of all men. Amen.    O holy loving Father, Lord God, the King of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Who protected the Israelites of old in His holy wings in the dryness of the cold and hot desert; I offer You the holy death of my Master and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the protection of Your people who are scattered all over the world. May the Blood and water wash and strengthen, save and cleanse us that we might find home in the Sacred Side of Your Holy Son that opens for all men. Amen. Sacred Side of Lord God, the King Jesus Christ - be our home for safety. Amen.    Omnipotent and Omniscient Lord God, the King, Lord God, the King of Elijah and the prophets, look at the Sacred Head of Your only-begotten Holy Son and have mercy. Arise and save Your people. I offer You all the shame, the pains, the wounds and the Precious Blood from the Sacred Head of Your Holy Son for all Your children who are living in these perilous times. Strengthen our true faith through the mockery of Your Holy Son, Lord Jesus Christ, and save us through the Precious Blood from His Sacred Head.

Kindly look on Your rejected and condemned Holy Son Who suffered many tortures and will suffer many through the sins of Your people. Look and see what sin has done to your only-begotten Holy Son. I offer for all Your people who are living in these ungodly and wicked days, all the tortures, pains, rejection and shame of your Son, Lord Jesus Christ, to You, for the true faith to withstand trials and holy patience to withstand long torture.

@JesusChristEmmanuel,"St. Matthew 6 Take heed that you do not your justice before men, to be seen by them: otherwise you shall not have a reward of your Father Lord God, the Great King who is in heaven.  2 Therefore when thou dost an almsdeed, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honoured by men. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.  3 But when thou dost alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.  4 That thy alms may be in secret, and thy Father Lord God, the Great King who seeth in secret will repay thee.  5 And when ye pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, that love to stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men: Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.  6 But thou when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to thy Father Lord God, the Great King in secret: and thy Father Lord God, the Great King who seeth in secret will repay thee.  7 And when you are praying, speak not much, as the heathens. For they think that in their much speaking they may be heard.  8 Be not you therefore like to them, for your Father Lord God, the Great King knoweth what is needful for you, before you ask him.  9 Thus therefore shall you pray: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  11 Give us this day our supersubstantial bread.  12 And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.  13 And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen.  14 For if you will forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your offences.  15 But if you will not forgive men, neither will your Father Lord God, the Great King forgive you your offences.  16 And when you fast, be not as the hypocrites, sad. For they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.  17 But thou, when thou fastest anoint thy head, and wash thy face;  18 That thou appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father Lord God, the Great King who seeth in secret, will repay thee.  19 Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth: where the rust, and moth consume, and where thieves break through and steal.  20 But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven: where neither the rust nor moth doth consume, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.  21 For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also.  22 The light of thy body is thy eye. If thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be lightsome.  23 But if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be darksome. If then the light that is in thee, be darkness: the darkness itself how great shall it be!  24 No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one, and love the other: or he will sustain the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve Lord God, the Great King and mammon.  25 Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than the meat: and the body more than the raiment?  26 Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns: and your heavenly Father Lord God, the Great King feedeth them. Are not you of much more value than they?  27 And which of you by taking thought, can add to his stature by one cubit?  28 And for raiment why are you solicitous? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they labour not, neither do they spin.  29 But I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.  30 And if the grass of the field, which is to day, and to morrow is cast into the oven, Lord God, the Great King doth so clothe: how much more you, O ye of little faith?  31 Be not solicitous therefore, saying, What shall we eat: or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed?  32 For after all these things do the heathens seek. For your Father Lord God, the Great King knoweth that you have need of all these things.  33 Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of Lord God, the Great King, and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.  34 Be not therefore solicitous for to morrow; for the morrow will be solicitous for itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.    Word of the Blessed Lord God, the King.  Thank You Blessed Lord God, the King and Savior Jesus Christ.    All you great numerous enemies; the enemy of the holy death of my Lord and Master Jesus Christ on the Cross of Calvary; the prince of darkness and iniquity, the father of all liars; I stand on the death of my Lord and Master Jesus Christ and offer His pains, wounds, and the Precious Blood of His left hand to the Eternal Father Lord God for your downfall, your destruction and your scourging.

Not just need to know, but, should know. There should not be those who know the truth and don't or can't share/exploit it. Especially, when it effects our daily existence or is detrimental to our well being. There shouldn't be secrets. Maybe, if that was the case, COVID, for instance, wouldn't have become a world wide pandemic. Or even if it had, needless deaths or those living with the side effects of, wouldn't exist had someone shared the findings of the vaccine. Which,  is finally being released, after the fact. If a moral obligation became as important as a legal or financial obligation, the elite might possibly still exist, but, maybe not in such a manner that supercedes any idea of correction. What I'm saying is, if people looked out for each other rather then just themselves losing our rights & freedoms (already fought for) wouldn't exist.

@rick4electric,"38:00 - This is why I don't trust Snowden! It is a well known fact that the Patriot Act was written years before 911 happened. They tried to pass it a couple of times but had no success because everyone understood that it was a massive attack against freedom and privacy that far outweighed the good that could be derived from its enactment into law. Papers were even written that admitted that what was needed to pass the legislation was a new Pearl Harbor-like attack on the United States. When the intelligence crossed FBI Director Mueller's desk that an imminent attack was about to happen, he assured his agents that everything that could be done was being done. That was a bold faced lie! Mueller had already been ideologically converted by the Nut-Jobs who believed that Americans had to be sacrificed because only in a state of EMERGENCY would the Congress have the excuse to pass such a removal of so many of the people's Constitutional rights! So the government sat idly by and watched thousands of our fellow citizens needlessly die so that they could increase the Police Powers of our Intelligence Agencies! It was not an oversight as many, including Snowden, would have us believe. It was done deliberately, just like many historians believe the original Pearl Harbor was done in order to convince the American public that we needed to join the soldiers and seamen who were already fighting the wars in Asia and Europe. Until that point Americans were not willing to go to war to save a country that had just 120 years earlier tried to keep us a colony of slaves!",3년 전,1,

But you don't need to work for the CIA or NSA to know that Chemtrails are real. Even now they are beginning to admit that they are testing the efficacy of a program of geo-engineering. That's a lie. It has gone FAR past the research phase. There is legislative proof. There is whistleblower proof, and there is the proof of your own eyes! Contrails disappear after a few minutes. Chemtrails do not! The problem with the chemtrails is that they not only reflect sunlight back into space in an attempt to undo the damage that we have done to our upper atmosphere, but they also have deleterious environmental consequences that are a dangerous and unwanted side-effect!

@gregboehm5827,"Normally I wouldnt say a thing knowing how stubborn many are in their beliefs and typically you become the outcast for trying to alert someone. After reading 31 comments I couldnt take it anymore. Edward Snowdon is a character playing a role. What baffels me is everyone is oblivious to him reading from a teleprompter. In fact he reads from 2 making it more difficult to spot and it wasnt easy catching the 2nd one. Pay attention to how he always looks down the location of 1 of them makingnit very hard to see his eye movement whem reading but you can see this at certain times. The 2nd one if looking from his position would be just below center screen and just lil off to the right (his right) of center screen which he uses way way less. He even breaks character @ 1:23:16 & honestly I sympathize with him doing so because what he said or read was so outlandish but he hurried to jump back in and lay it on thick. Notice his tone leading up to it then cracking up followed by puting emotion into it. Once you spot him the whole persona & agenda come crumbling down like a bad B movie. It was well thought out making you feel lile hes one of you with the dress code lumberjack shirt with the techy aspect always with the headphones and glasses which are real I believe. Checkout his sly ass rhetoric at the same marker or even go back a bit. He of course primes you with facys everyone knows leading up to a revelation that is true just like all lies contain truth within them which to ensnare you by. He trys explaining continuity of Govt and that is what they are all about not caring about much else & going so far to lie to Congress and its citizens in the line of keeping us safe. Did anybody noy know this? He continues letting you know the declassified doc. was a fabrication he laughs out and then has audacity to say this is what real world conspiracies look like & proceeds to lead you saying not always smoking men behind closed doors, its lawyers and poloticians (which is correct but doesnt stop so prepare for bamboozling) its ORDINARY people from the WORKING level to management level. WTF? I don't know about you guys but I dont know and hard working ordinary people who conspire 😆 ESPECIALLY to what take away their own freedoms and take part in domestic spying LMAO that doesnt even make sense no matter how you spin it given the context of the podcast. Lets let him finish his thought. Furthermore, he trys to paint a poor picture in our minds a scenario if not explained a certain way peoples jobs will be gone (bullshit for doing the right thing please) or were gonna get something out of this if we work together. So hes suggesting greed at least will posture you. Finally, he says civilization is the history of conspiracy (does that even make sense) what is civilization but a conspiracy for all of us to do better by working together. That sounds great on the surface or at a glance and he has so many snowed (pun intended) they just just let it ride. No Mr Snow you are wrong the definition of conspiracy or to conspire means a secret agreement between 2 or more people to commit an illegal act, along with an intent to achieve the agreements plot. No how does ones twisted mind compare that with civilization flourishing or was thay just a sneaky way to complete ones accusation of ordinary hard working people you call conspirators and making it sound palatable with that bizarre & inaccurate view of civilization? Id go on but im sure many are ready to stone which is fine but I only hope you wake up to the fact the world is a stage and there are many actors like this one to decieve you. Why? Whats purpose?

I want to decide myself what to think about, instead of  regurgitating other people's opinion as so many »enraged protesters« seem to do nowadays.   Most important in any journalistic work is: never spread one's own (possibly dubious) personal opinion. Just ask and let the other one talk. And that's exactly what Joe Rogan does; he just keeps asking and leaves the talking to his respective interview partner, which IMHO is solid journalistic workmanship at it's best.    If I had to select someone who is casting out garbage left, right and center, I anytime would choose Alex Jones over everyone else anytime, but never People who do nothing but solid journalism like Joe Rogan.",3년 전,5,

Yet constantly brings up many other topics and deflects the truth on those matters. Total psyop.

@law1588,Ok so im going to preface this by saying that mr snowdens disclosures have apparently turned out to be true but lets not forget that he ran to russia and theyve allowed him to stay probably because hes actually an asset to them now .  Propaganda works best if the truth is sprinkled with misinformation lest the sources credibility is questioned .  You would want him to seem like ...well exactly how snowden seems to be .  Im not saying he was or is actually working for FSB im saying its a possibility . its more likely that he brought more intelligence with him than he released to journalists and gave it to the russians so they would allow him to stay.  Its also good propaganda for the russians and it would be very hard for the CIA to get him in russia . most other countries that dont have an extradition treaty with the US would be far easier to snatch him from .  Just remember that the russians are by far the very best at espionage . thats just facts .....theyve never been able to compete financially and we would mop the floor with them in a conventional war despite what some people think ...russia would fight us conventionally which is our strong suit ...guerrilla warfare ...not so much as is evidenced by the fact that we have lost every guerilla war weve been in ( dont get it twisted ....we dont lose on the battlefield.....we just get bored killing people in that country or the other ....we really are that nasty of an adversary ) The russians have beat us in the intelligence realm from the beginning to today ....dont be lulled into a false sense of what is and what isnt .....the general public wont know the real truth for another hundred yrs and im willing to bet that snowden is not the hero patriot people think he is . its alot more complicated than that,3년 전,1,

@clarencewirley653,Why is there no criminal repercussions for people holding offices in the government does that make any sense to anybody does it make any sense to for them to have so much power and then if they get caught there's no criminal liability does that make any sense did everybody forget that it's their civic duty to do to take it office they should want to do it for the country you know to help out not so they can get into office to become rich and powerful and then forget why they're in the office in the first place instead they just get more rich and powerful and do all these terrible things without repercussions the worst that happens like he snowed and says they lose their job will whoop you do that he is anybody going to tell me that's okay I mean why jeez I mean I don't even know this is wrong like it's just morally fucking wrong like it's more wrong than what happened on 9/11 that was bad don't get me wrong but this is this is terrible you should not be doing this to the citizens of your own country I mean got anybody who calls Snowden traitor is  a lethargic devil,3년 전,1,
@clarencewirley653,Like the legislation they passed to spy on us to you know buy and sell our personal information that's like it's uncalled for because it should be the other way around everything that any office holder is doing should be as transparent as a window they shouldn't be there should be no reason for them to be doing anything secret because we pay their fucking checks because they work for us not the other way around they're there in that office to benefit us not themselves this is ridiculous it's gross and it's downright terrifying and where are all to blame if we don't do something about this like soon cuz it's just going to get worse thank you so much Edward you are I can't believe anybody ever labeled you a traitor your like your your Samual adams or something man thank you very much.

It's just a reason to make laws or policy against the people, and get money for these policies that the cause seldom get the money or very little of it. War on poverty: failed, war on drugs: huge failure, war on terrorism: failed: And with the the government wanting the IRS knowing what you have in the bank is not new. My husband did HVAC, the man my son n law worked for needed heat an Air for his mom's house. He knew he would inherit the home one day, and he did construction for a living so he gradually remodeled her home, when it came to the heat an Air he knew J my son n law could talk to my husband about doing it on the side. But out the middle man. My husband got with him, drew out the plans, the house had never had central heat an Air, so it was a start to finish job. They added up the cost of everything, and he wrote a check for the total cost, so my husband could purchase everything. A 500 dollar price for labor and gas was added. Well when my husband deposited the check, he was redflaged by the bank. When I called the bank I was told they had to report large sums of money to IRS, that who knows it could be drug money. I explained that it was to buy equipment for a job my husband was doing for a friend. Well he had to call his bank whom called our bank and told them to deposit it. After all was said and done, and my husband paid our son n law to help him on the weekends, he ended up in the red. But he didn't go after more money, for we were expecting our first grandbaby and knew they needed the money. But come tax time IRS sent us a letter stating that we had to claim the whole amount as earned income. Now there weren't child credits then, and that money hurt us, we had to pay state and federal taxes on it. Poor people or working lower class people never got a break. We worked so hard to just barely keep afloat. Same after retirement. Barely enough to survive. Keeping you in the same old place, between a rock and hard spot. Can't save, and have to do without food to pay for car repair , or some other emergency that comes up. They been doing this since the nineties, I can only imagine what they do now.

@davidharvey1775,"I've watched/listened to the program for 83 minutes and will finish it later but so far it is disheartening to recognize that no information is safe if it is used by a political hack who manages to get into the presidency.  The issue of a 'good' or 'bad' person is spurious in that all of the frightful descriptions that Snowden describes begin when a president or high officer who took an oath to the Constitution asks a person to violate her or his oath to the Constitution.  The oath of office should take priority over any request from a politically based person and any such request should be illegitimate and subject the higher ranked person to legal process.  So much pie in the sky, can it actually be resolved?  Will good intentions of individuals who are of high power and weak mind ultimately be a factor in the decline of the American Republic?

@ClassicRiki,Isn’t it possible that they had most people leave the NSA buildings in order to do some things that are extremely questionable. It seems possible to me that for their own benefit they wouldn’t want most people (even on the inside) to see them get out the really illegal tools? Maybe they weren’t but I do wonder why he speculates so much when his real value is in documented information not his speculative opinion on the motivations on a massive organisation. There’s just a little too much opinion he gives that makes it hard for me to string the information into a semi-solid narrative. I want to hear information and knowledge…less opinion.

When the dissect investigation occurred after the collapsed of twin world trade center, somebody put the airplane wrecked body and a different engine that's not designed for that airplane wrecked body. That means the entire scenario/situation was a set up. That means it's inside job within USA who did this. The reason why? it's connected about the ""Hidden Wealth Gold"" owner of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos of Philippines was bank in that Twin World Trade Center Bank. That generation time era of whoever got interested of ""Hidden Wealth Gold"" of Marcos worth of more than $200 billion. They got interested. The reason why? Back in the Philippines, everything the entire scenario/situation got timing between former President Marcos, Benigno Aquino (wanted to go back to the Philippines, who wanted to candidate for President - got assassinated to frame-up/setup the former President F. E. Marcos),  President Ghadaffy of Libya (got assassinated by their own kind of people who got instigated by US Govt) - due to former President Marcos was bank his gold over Libya bank who handle by former President Ghadaffy. Just because of ""Hidden Wealth of Gold"" owner of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos. The US Military was based on Subic Bay at Philippines nosing around with former President F. E. Marcos's wealth.  After 911 occurred, then went to accused Terrorists whoever (ended up Al Qaeda & etc.) and War at IRAQ that there's no WMD (weapon of mass destruction). When you investigate all what was happening and there was interviewed of a lady that she said the Twin World Trade Center went boom and was about to tell there's no airplane went there but the interviewer interrupted by saying have you seen the airplane hit the World Trade Center?  She ended up saying, she was not sure if there's airplane hit the World Trade Center but ended up got along with the interviewer. This entire scenario/situation ended up it's all a setup/frame. The Twin world trade center knew by the psychic before was going to set up that building. This entire scenario was in fact true.  We can connect all the entire scenario. Snowden is telling the truth that the US Government can break the laws. Who goes to jail when u break the law? Inside job, you do. Who goes to jail when you catch the government breaking the law? Still you. The Philippines got played by the US Govt ended up the Philippines fell behind left behind of their Economy, Industries development (goods & products are so expensive), and Pesos conversions from dollar currency went down terribly while these entire scenario occurred ended up the China took advantage to grabbed, stole, & encroached the Spratlys and Scarborough islands.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Not defending the perpetrators or even saying the USA had it coming, because people died. I'm talking about Iran, and almost every country in South America. And what is ironic there, is that the CIA influenced so much South American politics, and yet, they let nazis hide there and continue their work.

@danielson68,Bizarre how they both bend over backwards to excuse Pelosi involvement and Obama’s corrupt administration for “coincidentally”. making all these programs worst and more pervasive.   Bush started a lot of this true but the differences was that Obama’s administration turned this illegitimate power almost exclusively against political opponents and journalists.  He came out of Chicago politics.   He had already won every election before the Presidential race with dirty tricks and corrupt behavior.   It was hardly Mr Smith goes to washington the way they try to paint it.  He didn’t have to be corrupted.   He saw the surveillance state as a tool for political gain as has now been exposed many times over in the ways he and Clapper and the gang illegally went after Trump and other political opponents.  Meanwhile Trump who was the victims of a lot of this deep state behavior gets no grace when he was clearly the victim of Obama’s administration amd deep state corruption from the Mueller “investigation” and and constant leaking and fake whistle blowers that were just deep state frauds.   Unlike Obama and Clapper who went after real whistle blowers harder than anyone and tries to destroy their lives Trump did not even go hard after fake whistle blowers.  It was Clapper who even removed the security clearance of the heroes of Benghazi essentially destroying their livelihood then whined like a baby when Trump wanted his security clearance removed.,3년 전,0,

Also if they never existed why did the government spend so much time investigating ufos in the first place? Also why does Edward snowden not even mention any of this when he said they don't exist? He left out a lot of information when he said this by not addressing the actual research the US government has done on ufos. The government still keeps coming up with new termonology for ufos and why are they doing this if they know they dont exist?

I have the 'auto-play' setting turned on so it started playing and I've been listening, again, for the last hour or so. I still have the same thing going thru my head - I just don't understand how or why Snowden seemed to be so against Trump. I imagine it was a product of an extremely pessimistic/skeptic view of the government & Presidency in general. I guess it could just be because of a complete & utter misunderstanding & ignorance of reality/the truth, which is the case with most of the people who don't like Trump &/or think he's a bad/evil person. I would've thought that Snowden is too smart for that, but it very well could be that his access to fair, unbiased, accurate etc news/info is restricted so he's only getting the ""Fake News"". A big reason why his attitude towards Trump (in this video at least) confuses me & doesn't compute is because they are on the same page. They seem to have the same attitude, view, outlook, opinion etc. Of all people, Snowden should be able to see, know & understand what the ""Establishment"" (Agencies, politicians, Elites etc) had done to President Trump (and continue to try). He certainly should be able to appreciate what he went thru & is still going thru. They are on the same side, they are for the same things (at least when it comes to these areas), they have many of the same enemies, many of the same supporters and so on and so forth. I, like millions, believe Trump & Snowden are 2 of the biggest Patriots around... so if he is for real I don't see how he could possibly be ""anti-Trump"".

@scratchpenny," @mjjonez4545  The land belongs to who conquers and cultivates it. So the natives lost their land to a superior foe. We could make the argument you are making about any land if you go back in history. However, it is the way of the world to conquer, and no one should feel any guilt about something that they didn't commit themselves. Besides, as brutal as it was, colonization was necessary to get us to where we are today. You can't have human progress without both good and evil events. So this ideology that focuses on this minutia doesn't actually help the improvement of society - it's regressive. It is too caught up in trivialities and emotionalism over past wrongs to focus on future progress. Nothing improves under these ideas and policies - it's about power games for those involved more than real justice.",3년 전,2,
@mjjonez4545, @scratchpenny  colonization and slavery was necessary ?,3년 전,0,
@scratchpenny," @mjjonez4545  Yes. In our reality, we wouldn't be where we are today if it weren't for those earlier actions/practices/circumstances. Was it good? No. But like I said, this is the way of the world and nature. Human evolution and improvement happen with struggle and suffering. Slavery and conquest were practiced by virtually every civilization throughout human history. And historically, land has always been won and controlled by force. The Europeans just took those concepts further with superior technology (at the time). But the very brutality of those practices is what has allowed us to overcome them today. For those things to be deemed evil and wrong, society had to evolve into the right system and circumstances to see them as such. That's our current system (liberal democracy) that achieved that. It's something to be proud of IMO. There was no guarantee that slavery would be almost universally outlawed today if it weren't for our system. And our system is the most prominent force against those still practicing forms of slavery. We've made tremendous progress and have learned from many of our earlier mistakes!",3년 전,0,

He went AMA which is against medical advice and in those situation the Army is no longer responsible for your injury they tell you this upfront and try to talk you out of it. If you take the discharge he is talking about, you have to heal at the base and once you are cleared you are discharged and sent home and have a line of credit they call it for that injury where the army pays for forever for any issues regarding that injury. I have a line of credit but i chose to stay in and heal and return to training. I was offered the discharge and they do everything in their power to prevent you from going ama. Those are two different things. I could have healed and took the discharge and been covered.   Did AMA and took the discharge and not been covered. I was at basic training location for an extra 5 months for my injury so if he was released after one month he did the AMA route. I too had bilateral fractures. They want you on cruches for a month min and some in wheel chairs. Then You have to go to rehab for x amount of weeks. So he was either lied to or is not telling the whole story.",3년 전,0,

When a legal suit is raised against a citizen of this nation and that citizen acquires legal representation, liability and decision making authority does not transfer to their representation, allowing you to alternatively prosecute their attorney. Politicians can fantasize all they want about becoming the king of America but its never going to happen unless We the People recognize their claim to the throne, which is why we need to start kicking out anyone that demands the People's freedom and liberties be sacrificed in payment of a false sense of security, which our government has never once been able to follow through with throughout our nation's history.

@dickhitswater4836,"Incredibly ignorant statement. If you work for the government and find they are breaking the law, in no way should it be considered unlawful to expose them. He criticized the Bush AND Obama administrations, so that argument is invalid. He went on a lengthy speech about how Obama ran on a platform defending whistleblowers then after being elected changed positions. He also has statements about trying internally to bring up grievances about what was going on only to be shut down and not listened to long before exposing anything. Not sure why you’re so OK with your government blatantly violating the constitution and your personal rights. There should never be anything to whistleblow on because there should never be anything going on that the government feels the people should be unaware of.

@dickhitswater4836," @meltedbuttaOG  I wasn’t defending any other governments and I understand all governments do this or a multitude of several other things that violate basic human rights. I disagree with all of those as well. You seem to have taken what I said as a personal attack on you and went on the defensive which certainly was not my intent, I don’t feel anybody should take issue with someone exposing the people who run a country, making the policies, etc. when they are breaking the the law and taking advantage of the authority they’ve been trusted with. It doesn’t matter if it’s happening elsewhere, that shouldn’t make it ok. The people who have done these things are facing no consequences while trying to criminalize the person who exposed them. That my friend is hypocrisy at its finest. Sorry if I offended you, that wasn’t my intent. As in every civilization throughout history the people in charge are corrupt with power, something the founding fathers of the US warned against almost 250 years ago but still happened anyways. There’s a reason they put provisions in to fight against government and that has slowly been eroded away without much challenge, for a reason. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. They broke the law and when it was exposed the issue is if the guy who let the public know was right to do so? You have one of the biggest newspapers in the US willing to not run a story at the request of the White House in order to effect the results of an election? Why do they have that kind of influence?

@datz5593,"A short story, appendix in the back, ha ha. sorry This is so funny, rewatching this 2 years later (hindsight being 20/20) even though I appreciate what Snowden did because the government was/is still so out of control, you just can't stick this Genie back in the bottle, once the government has tasted this kind of power for so long they do not give it up, no matter what. We know this is true because the pandemic has showed us again, that they will either wait for a crisis to act upon or they will create a situation where they can accrue more power and control over the people and this is the perfect example of the government doing just that. Why I think it's funny is that no matter how intelligent you think Snowden is (I think he is very intelligent) he is still, just another ideologue, a smart one but an ideologue none the less. I know from other interviews that he loves Bernie Sanders (as does Joe) and he doesn't like Trump, and that's fine, each to their own. But, Snowden seems to believe all of the lies that the media told about Trump with absolutely no evidence to back it up, like he thinks he's a racist that just hates immigrants, he's an authoritarian that only wants control and to keep secrets, he tried to influence an election by essentially blackmailing a foreign President (which if your honest and look at all the evidence of the first impeachment, you know is bullshit). Trump knew that Biden was definitely corrupt (because Biden did exactly what the democrats blamed Trump for) surprise, surprise. Biden not only blackmailed “quid pro quo’ed” the Ukraine President, but he bragged about it on camera and everyone has seen that video where he joked about coercing the President to fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son Hunter, on the board of directors of Burisma, a notorious criminally corrupt Gas company in the Ukraine, that Joe, just so happened to be given that portfolio by Obama, so Joe essentially has power over the Ukraine, which he had no problem exploiting for his own and his sons benefit, more than likely Obama's as well. So coming back to the evilness that is Trump, who by the way, is the only President in a very long time not to start a war on his watch and also was key in bringing about 4 Middle Eastern peace treaties, 5 in total that Obama and Kerry, Clinton and others said could never be done, but again, this evil person (Trump) showed how wrong they were for, I don't know? The umpteenth time. But anyway, that's getting into the weeds of everything the democrats and the media said was wrong about this evil, war mongering Trump, the guy that “was going to start world war 3”, and who they repeatedly told us that everything he did was “WORSE THAN WATERGATE”. It really is funny that of all the things they claimed Trump was, and was going to do to hurt America (and the world) that history shows that he was the most transparent President in, most probably, all of history. He would take questions daily, from a media that was so hateful and rabid that he showed extraordinary composure and answered absolutely everything that was asked of him, unlike Joe and this current administration who are the antithesis of everything that Trump and his administration was. I wouldn't say they didn't make mistakes because everyone does but they were more open than any administration that I can recall over the last 30 or 40 years but the democrats and the media would have you think the opposite is true. That's one more thing I'm grateful of Trump for doing, showing just how corrupt the media is (the so-called news media especially) Trump not only broke the media, but exposed them to be the purveyors of lies and misinformation that they are, FAKE NEWS is the perfect description of today's main stream media. They are essentially the propaganda arm of the Democratic Party and I have to say that leaving the “left” was one of the best decisions I've made, ever. The hate that is the left today is astounding and the comparisons I can see between now and, well I don't need to say what time in history but, lets just say 1930s Germany and you can see the left is trying to “other” the people on the right, whether it be the “unvaxed” or Jan 6th, a lot of people want bad things to happen to them, and all for no other reason than the media and democrat politicians have told lie after lie about Trump and the average conservative that just wants to live in a fair and free country. Which is ironic because that's the reason Snowden did what he did but yet he's still, wether knowingly or unknowingly (is that a word) is still believing the lies that the left have told. So now after these last 2 years we see that life was much better under Trump (if you take away all of the animus caused by the media’s lies) and obviously those “mean tweets” of Trumps, we can see that Biden's administration is every bit the authoritarian regime that the left tried to make Trump out to be. Also for Snowden, I hope he can see that the policies that this administration is implementing is essentially Bernie Sanders policies, don't forget that Bernie once said that the bread lines of Russia and Venezuela “are good things” still can't believe he said that and people still support him, but I suppose that's what you get when the kids today are being taught by communist professors.

Fast forward, and we have the same bad actors whose actions Snowden exposed in 2013 (Clapper, Brennan, etc.) parroting disinfo on major news networks (and being paid handsomely to do so) as ""experts"", while those same networks calculatively avoided interviews with reputable CIA veterans like Ray McGovern who was also a lefty, but an honest dissenter on the matter of Trump-Russian collusion as being a now-proven cabal by Hillary with three acquaintances being indicted/arrested in the Durham probe. If you're a victim of leftist group-think and think me to be a shill, please don't take my word for it and search it out.  Reference: Greenwald on Rumble: ""For years, Obama officials, including senior national security adviser Ben Rhodes, spread a blatant lie about Edward Snowden: that he ""fled to Russia"" and chose Moscow as his destination to seek Putin's protection. Yet in Rhodes' own book, he inadvertently proves that he, along with Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice, lied. He admits that it was Rhodes himself who blocked Snowden's attempts to leave Russia on the day he arrived.

@andreeaalexandru7811,"There was something interesting about how was Edward Snowden was thinking. He said around 1:02:00-40 about how these big guys in CIA where trying to figure out what projects to make to get money from the government and yet during the interview he kept saying it was Bush who was behind all this. 9 11 happens and it is fair to say that someone in the intelligence community had this idea of this Stellar Wind program and it didn't came out of a GOP agenda. Common sense i'd say that after 9 11 Bush was in meetings with intelligence agency people a lot being briefed about this and that and what solution they where thinking and what programs they should run. In my opinion, the establishment/ the institutional /systemic control is more connected to the FBI, CIA and NSA then the government but if we are to pick a side i'd say Democratic Party is much closer to these intelligence agencies (not only cause they want and have a more powerful control as the government as their ideology says it openly). We keep talking about the Rule of Law being under siege in the west but just imagine in the rest of the world (in East Europe and Russia last century we had like 1 out of 4 people a spy for the government), imagine what's happening now in China when we add technology.    I disagree with 43:50 when he says about Poland and Hungary. They look like they actually are the only countries awake to this leftist nonsense that is pushed by Berlin. If the leaders of Poland and Hungary turn out to have bad intentions it is yet to be decided in the future. After he says later at 44:10 about Trump's White House is actually about the Democratic Party : ""to anyone who promises they make things better even if they have no ability to make things better even if they would actively make things worse [...] but if they tell you they make things better and you believe them in a moment of fear that typically leads to unfortunate outcomes""",3년 전,0,
@andreeaalexandru7811,"Absolutely amazing interview.  What makes me wonder though is why Mr. Snowden doesn't see Trump as a solution against the establishment. I get the idea behind what Bernie Sanders says he stands for but is obviously that snowflakes won't change anything.   Edit (a few mins later): Why i feel that Edward Snowden is thinking the establishment is somehow represented by Bush instead of Pelosi? We know by now in 2021 that FBI, CIA, Silicon Valley, Facebook,  Twitter, Hollywood, 90% of media are all in Democratic pocket. in hindsight now in 2021, with all the Cancel Culture, why would Democratic Party not want to see programs like these work more then lets say GOP would?  FBI said MLK was biggest danger domestically or that was just one out of the multiple files of possible dangers that can occur and it just ""happened"" that it leaked as a mainstream narrative of FBI? Somewhere in some FBI office there is a plan for every situation and yet somehow one of these situations when in theory BLM and ANTIFA would destroy so many buildings that white people will revolt come as narrative for some reason and the virtual situation that white supremacy is the biggest danger in USA became a narrative. I am pretty sure in one of CIA rooms there is a situation where Romania, payed by China is attacking USA for example. Why didn't that made news? Who has to gain from these false narrative type of leaks? Sure not GOP and sure not American people so who's the enemy? Why New York TImes hide that report harming GOP leadership in 2004 under GOP president but also hide Hunter Bidan narrative in 2019 that would have harmed Democrats right before the election (under also GOP president). None is checking these power shifts? Why all the new movies and TV Series talk about Florida like is the worse place to live in - brainwashing young americans - when for everyone else in the world is clear that Florida is best place to live. Do not forget that saying that if it is easy to point out where power lies, it is for sure not in there. Like is so easy to point out Trump's racism and bigotism and sexism. But is it really there?  Imagine the stronger Government under Democrats what it can do. And keep in mind that these awful things CIA FBI NSA where doing (with the mind blowing snowflake evacuation on the day of the 9 11, with the competition between institution, with the secrets etc) are a sign of human nature (evilness, oppression, racism and other stuff who only Democrats - with false sense of moral superiority - think they can measure and judge) not just created by Politics . Imagine the Democrats - with a lot of them thinking of the people as sheeps - decision making when faced with even stronger power as their ideology is meant to provide making a more powerful government under the rule of law .

If Snowdon wants to continue to push the official line and use these (admit to minor crimes to make denial of major crimes seem more credible) tactics then he comes off like controlled opposition as many suspect. There’s perhaps a reason why whereas others like Assange have faced a full MSM blackout Snowdon is apparently their darling receiving full coverage and even winning media awards, and it is therefore quite possible he is only telling us things his handlers want us to know.

Imagine NOT evacuating and getting hit, the loss of lives and the flack from the publication would be extraordinary. Pearl Harbor was not evacuated. It was a very tangible threat. I’m thankful he has come forward with evidence and helped swing the pendulum to highlight wrong doing. Most truth is a mix of fact and lens. That is just reality. It doesn’t have to be one or the other. He can be right and wrong. But best part is his heart is mostly in the right place.

@Lilifors,"hmm that comment about the governments of strong leaders who go out to hurt the right people and claim to get the country back on track is somewhat weak. E.g. Poland. Well, Poland is trying to become more like Germany, where the Ministry of Justice has too much control over all three branches of government (making laws for the public, creating court prodecures, controlling the state attorney). Calling them out on that is somewhat baffeling, since they just want to change their system (which is pretty much like the sovjets left it)  to one that is somehow not regconized as wrong in the rest of the western world.   Btw. Merkel was chancellor of Germany for 16 years. I never had a worse internet connection and i've been to Peru, Nepal, Tunis and Lybia. It has a very old population and those old people have a storng grip on government. The people in charge give the money of their taxpayers to other countries and the voter is ok with that for some reason. They have a horrible government pension system and don't want to change it, although it is heading for a catastrophe. It is the older generation who paves the way for people like Erdogan, Putin, Hitler, Mussolini, Mao and Stalin. The don't want anything to change, because they thing they somehow benefit form the current situation. You are missing that importent part of the equation. I agree with the new class of political people, who are totally detached from the rest of the population but their use that fear to stay in power. But the population is as Steven Hawking said: too many, too greedy and too stupid. We are on track for a brave new world, because the masses ask for it.",3년 전,0,

Hopefully he now knows that Trump was a victim of the deep state and all of the the dangers of the beaurocracy and corrupt NSA, CIAand FBI. THE INDICTMENTS and criminal charges currently being proffered and the guilty verdicts that should follow should induce his acceptance and acknowledgement that his perceptions regarding Trump at this point were incorrect!

Joe tried to keep him on track and snowed in just wants to aimlessly rant about his cushy government overpaid federal job where he had no work and replaced people that also did nothing...    I don't even care about the national security I'm more pissed that clearly. The government has multiple giant sectors that do nothing but collect data and are nothing but a weight on society they don't even help society. That's all this interview brings to light that the fact that there are overpaid government Federal assholes doing nothing sitting on their hands being await on society and it will continue until we just shut it down..    Kind of sad that he's talking about how he was a newbie in the industry and he was able to network the CIA and NSA together... That is sad that a government organization was billions of trillions of dollars hasn't ever tried to do that before and some random Joe schmo it kid can do it...   There are so many other glaring problems with hairs narrative besides national security it's ridiculous that he still focusing on national security... If you would have just focused on how much b***** spending is going into everything he just said the world would have literally had a riot the next day...    George Snowden is nothing more than an overpaid loser that's focusing on the wrong thing... The government just increased the debt ceiling again yesterday and yet we're not any more secure than they were before the NSA and the CIA have been around for longer than I've been alive and we're not anymore secure how long until the American people realize that we cannot keep this up and we have to protest the NSA the CIA the just grotesque overspending by the government.   I don't care if they know where I am I care that money is being taken out of my paycheck so jackass is like Snowden can pretend they're important. I'm pissed that money is taken out of my paycheck so a bunch of federal Jack offs that do nothing and sit on their hands all day can straight milk the American government for money...    The fact that Edward Snowden is an hour into this interview and he hasn't brought it up goes to show that he himself is an idiot to the true problem. It's overspending no one cares what anybody's looking at.,3년 전(수정됨),1,

@patrickgronemeyer3375, @buckibanker  no I'm talking about how the United States government is clearly inflated beyond their own control if jackass computer engineer can make a system that they can't even comprehend... Edward Snowden story is pretty much proof. Most government jobs are overpaid unnecessary and completely blown smoke up their own ass... They literally just added to the debt ceiling in between my last post and this one. Currently printing money as fast as they can. Paying government NSA FBI CIA agents hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to do nothing. Probably millions of dollars a year for these guys to literally do nothing and let terrorists attack us on our own soil... And basically says that if you're of the older generation it is 100% your fault while we're in this mess you guys focused on everything else that didn't matter and look what's happening... Amber 11th instead of looking at the national intelligence agencies the three of them that are supposed to protect you and going why didn't you guys do anything....   I guess what I'm saying is this is just further proof for all f*****... And I hope our government does collapse they are a bunch of overpaid useless just door humpers.    The fact that snowden's information came out and we're still required to pay taxes goes to show how laughable are United States government is.    First-hand account of a person with very limited computer engineering knowledgeable to make a networking system that is able to communicate all three branches of the intelligence community together. Lmao.    Are so many glaring issues in the narrative Snowden is saying and we're just worried about the national security part it's even happening now... Everyone's focused on the stupid bs and not the actual stuff that matters....     Yeah that's basically the problem. His job shouldn't have paid 200k a year most federal agents should get their salaries cut in half clearly just going off snowden's testimonial oh and the countless terrorist attacks that have happened since 9/11 going forward. For real the entirety of the intelligence community should have got their paychecks cut in half the day not September 11th happened... Officially couldn't do their job... Nobody important picks this stuff up.   Snowden's just clearly and entitled Rich yuppie person. If anything he's still trying to play up this situation and make it into something way more than it is... who Cares you know what I care about not that the fact that they're watching me I care that they're spending so much money doing it..

That's the exact reason inflation is so bad and everyone's jumping over to crypto and there's no value in the dollar. Because you choose to see any sort of logical conversation as BS...

Stop being mad at me and be mad at the higher-ups that f*** you and f*** us. Has nothing to do with me. Funny you're choosing to attack me instead of saying yeah you know I was in that war I totally saw it happen why don't we try and hold these giant government agencies accountable. Why hold an agency accountable when we can just get everyone all gung ho and sign up for the military and start a war in the Middle East...

You bag on Snowden for being a spoiled rich kid. Then complainingly ask if you’re the only one with an issue with the mass surveillance and data collection being done. That spoiled rich kid had no reason to do what he did other then he’s a great American and at least a good hearted guy. He already had a solid government job in his 20’s and came from money. He’s now living in exile in Russia the armpit of the world. What did he stand to gain from it? And anything he gained isn’t worth the risk of being brought back to America to face treason charges. Or being a man without a nation like Julian Assange. If it weren’t for this guy you wouldn’t even have the slightest clue about the scale of any of this or possibly it’s existence at all. How many people worked for NSA before him that knew the same things and never said a peep? I’m not sure but it’s a lot I’d imagine. Nobody else was willing to fall on the sword for their fellow citizens. And you asked if it is just you that cares?

@BoyNextDoor1984,I wonder if Snowden is a CIA agent who was tasked with blinding the NSA so that the CIA could run their black ops without the NSA seeing what they’re doing.

@BoyNextDoor1984,"Notice that when real whistleblowers come forward, the corporate media complex either smear them, ignore them, or will silence them & real whistleblowers don’t seem to win Nobel Prizes. That’s how you know there’s more to Snowden than meets the eye. I’d say he’s a NWO/CIA stooge, but who knows… I could be wrong. Just find it interesting how Hollywood made a movie about him (the CIA has it’s tentacles throughout Hollywood) and the media celebrated him (the CIA has it’s tentacles throughout the mainstream media; look up Operation Mockingbird) which never happens when someone actually reveals information that’s damaging to the ‘elite’ globalist establishment agenda. So what Snowden did seems to align with the NWO agenda. Think about it. 🤔. I’m not saying the NSA should be spying on American citizens; they shouldn’t. But this wasn’t about an infringement of our 4th amendment rights. Snowden needed to blind the NSA so the CIA could run a muck without being caught by the NSA and of course big tech (CIA front companies) still spy on everyone for the CIA. Perhaps Snowden was just a useful idiot for the CIA or perhaps he knew exactly why the CIA needed him to knee-cap the NSA & he did it because he believes in the NWO agenda (after all, their agenda is to rule over the world in a global socialist technocratic society where sovereign nations no longer exist).",3년 전(수정됨),2,

@2000labar,"Snowden believes Nancy Pelosi was an unwilling participant?  No doubt Bush and Cheney are pos, but the Democrats have controlled all of the fed gov agencies since at least the mid 90's.  I admire Snowden for blowing the whistle on government spying, but it couldn't have ever happened without the full support of the Democrats, including Obama, Clinton and Biden.  The intelligence agencies were actively working against President Trump along with the FBI and DOJ from the moment he announced his candidacy until the day he left office.  Pelosi and Adam Schiff is still after him.  President Trump is the only president in the last 60 yrs that focused on making the lives of the citizens of this country better.  Snowden needs to take his blinders off regarding the Democrat party.  Very few members of the Republican Party are innocent, but even less of the Democrats are.

Americans have become soft and the government has become bloated. Every single person on Capitol Hill is comfortable knowing that nothing will ever happen.   Both Democrats and Republicans talk a big game, but no matter what, the media will manipulate the story of any “uprising” and make it a political, divisive, destructive “militant militia” who “aligns with neonazi fascism”, and people will immediately back down out of fear of retribution. So who’s holding them accountable? Absolutely nobody. And every single one of them gets kickbacks for ensuring that whistleblowers like this guy never threaten their $300,000/year job to work for 45 days per year.

@ronburgandy1475," @wcgcapone  are you deliberately stupid or just troll stupid? Assange has posted plenty of sort on Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and even Australia (his home nation). He's also published on the Phillipines, India and loads of other nations.... The problem is simple people don't look at Wikileaks they just listen to a 3rd party talking about it because when Wikileaks posts they do batch dumps (so no commentary or opinions, just FACTUAL DATA) this is often too dry and boring for simple minded people to actually read so they go off word of mouth instead....

@VinceBreeze," @ronburgandy1475  Maybe traitor is a poor choice of word for Assange, however he is neither a journalist. Once he lost impartiality he was no longer doing news, he was working for foreign state(s). As for Snowden, I think it's pretty clear why he's a traitor. It goes beyond NDA, all federal employees take an oath.",3년 전,1,
@ronburgandy1475," @VinceBreeze  ok slow down and be a little bit open to opinion change . If you present a rational explanation as to why they are traitors / Assange is not a journalist then I'm MORE than happy to look at my position and change it if it needs to match the truth.  But Assange publishes LEAKED DOCS there is NO OPINION NO COMMENTARY on Wikileaks, just the document dumps. These are grabbed by all sorts of media outlets and then made into news.  The best example of this is with the Iraq war documents, they worked with the WSJ and NTY for months to make sure ANYTHING they published wasn't going to compromise an operative IN THE FIELD (so you know torture and friendly fire which are war crimes were reported, spies on the ground left out that type of thing).  It's very well documented and ALL wiki document dumps have been proven accurate because of this process. IE he just posts the source or papers no comments or opinions on his site.  So once again how is he a traitor or not a journalist??  If say Facebook is hiring illegal immigrants to work and taking their passports until contract's are finished would this not be a news item or would it be something you are ok with ignoring and don't think it's news in any way?  Because this is an example of the documents he dumped regarding Saudi Arabia and UAE building practices 	""Arabtec Construction Company"" .   So how is he biased? Unless you have more than an opinion, I think you are probably biased and as I said I'm open to changing my mind but FACTS do matter",3년 전,1,

Plus what Snowden is talking about was released about made public years ago so it's not like banning rogans interview somehow stops the information from being out there. And finally as much as the US government like to think they own the world, they can't ban or remove something if it doesn't violate any laws. And his actions technically didn't violate any laws until AFTER his leak because the laws were changed to crack down on whistle blowers (remember the government was actually breaking the law not Snowden at the time).  As for the movie, it's the same thing. Can't ban art. If they say ""based"" on a true story instead of a documentary then it's art (an opinion piece) and that's that....  But in just your average person , so who knows really what the limit is before they ban something... Today it seems they just decide laws or not.",3년 전,0,

However buy now this guy would be home with probably a full exoneration and Royal recognition MBE or OBE long ago. I think the difference is our government and security agencies (think James Bond) MI6, are equally as capable and probably guilty of doing things they shouldn’t but are held accountable when they get caught and it’s fully accepted by those who do this work.

Threatening him with life in prison.His information is bound to lead people to distrust their governments, as they see clearly, exactly how corrupt they are.So obviously government don't want to be held to account, and will do anything and everything in their power to get out of their corrupt actions being exposed. What Edward Snowden did was tell people exactly just how corrupt government really are. He really is a Hero.",4년 전,1,

Why is it that guys like Snowden and a lot of “super smart” people who seem to sincerely love to talk about themselves, always have such a difficult time speaking? Like I could name some others but just listen for 2 minutes and count the amount of “uhhhhh” and “ummmm” “errrrr” sounds he makes while saying very simple sentences? Now I’m in no way comparing my level of  intelligence to this young man, but I always did well academically, I graduated high school at 15 and actually English was one of my lesser studies, but if I told a story to someone about my life, I wouldn’t need to pepper in all sorts of “uhh” noises.  And I think I’m decently bright, but socially maybe not as well versed as this man. But I tend to notice that these 1 in a million genius guys have such a hard time speaking wirhout “uhhh” moments.    Like I said, this is such a silly thing to point out, i just keep noticing it in recent videos. And wonder if it is something that super genius guys struggle with or just coincidental.  Has anyone else noticed that he has little mental buffer moments every few words",4년 전,0,

He went on forever before answering Joe's question. At this point I'm loosing interest in the interview all together. I was wondering when Snowden was going to shut up with all of his narcissistic ranting and catch his damn breath. And Snowden has this weird obsessive compulsive chuckle that really. . . really. . . really annoys me!!! Snowden goes into too many details in his long and drawn out stories which made this tiresome for me. I made it to the 1 hour and 7 min mark and had to turn it off. It's just too much for me.

Remember these are spy agencies who want to establish themselves as no one to trifle with in the face of a president who has publicly resolved to put the kibosh on their rampant spy campaign.  They have the deepest dirt on him and the means to gather more and he needs public approval to hold office.  If they didn't out-and-out respond to this with overt blackmail and even if they didn't hint that they just might hit him with blackmail, then I would think that an intelligent person could figure it would be entirely possible and that they aren't above it.

@Far-East78,"There was one point in the discussion where it was brought up that people were not aware that these things happened or were happening, prior to someone telling them that they were or could be happening.   Such a statement could be true, in most cases, involving what people do and do not know or are aware of, but would not always be true. There are those of us--I know that I would not be the only one--where we were aware of something and knew intuitively that it existed in some form, perhaps not the exact form--but only needed an assurance or an appropriate qualification that such things did, indeed, exist; we needed validation.  When I say validation, I am not talking about the twisted form of the word, involving validation of one's own existence, I am speaking of specific validation involving exclusive ideas or methods.   The point is, that many things are already known to some of us, but we cannot prove them and, as Ed pointed out, the question then becomes: ""How do we share what we know with a multitude of others, and how do we provide evidence of its existence?""  Intuition concerning the awareness of the existence of ideas and methods is a mother fucker if one cannot prove the existence of the ideas or methods which one is aware of intuitively.  When Ed initially released his information to the press and the press exposed it to the public, there were those of us whom already were aware of it.  We were aware of it even before Wyden broached it.  We became more familiar with it when studying the Patriot Act.  I became familiar with it when I did a report on the Patriot Act in 2004.   The initial awareness of such things as surveillance possibilities actually stemmed from fundamental religious teachings forced on children by their zealot parents.  ""God knows everything.  God sees everything.  God knows what you know before you know it.  God has a plan for everyone and everything in existence.""  Well...if God had knowledge of these things, then it must be true that Santa Claus really does know if children are good or bad, and his list must be extensive.  Even after a child discovers that Santa is not real, the idea that some 'God' knows what is happening everywhere, at all times, remains in his mind.  At least until the child decides that this 'God' cannot be real either, because if he knows what is happening everywhere, at all times, and he is not doing anything about it, then he must not be the 'God' that his parents claim he is.  That would leave the all-knowing, all-seeing ability to some other greater power, because only a greater power than humans, with their limited senses, could possibly achieve it.   What could that greater power be?  Extra-terrestrial life?  Who fucking knows?  But now, it does not come as a surprise when humans finally achieve these things.  Humans are no longer limited in their 'surveillance' by the position of satellites or how many satellites are in orbit.  Humans are no longer restricted, in observing events and people on earth, by aircraft availability and positioning, or budgets and manpower to do 'intelligence gathering'.  We always assumed, during the Cold War, that the United States knew exactly where all threats to U.S. citizens were and that surveillance would keep us safe from nuclear missile threats.  If only we had known how wrong we were.  Sometimes, being oblivious is a blessing.",4년 전,0,

After some research, and forgive me for this, it was Assange, his lawyeris linked to the rothchilds, meaning his lawyer IS closed associated with the Rothchilds.

I'm not into politics. There's people out there who are and who dedicate there life in indulging in it and thats a good thing. We need people like that.

Ok , so we took them home and asked for them to be developed . They were sent off for two weeks . When we got them back , one of the packets of film from a defective camera had a down facing shot of a guys foot on it ..... wearing flip-flops ......and you could see empty Chinese food cartons and other trash on the floor .

@garyschraa9508,"So I know that when I write stupid shit it goes on my permanent record , and I've said some stupid shit . So heres some more of that . Ever since this virus was allowed into California , and within months every state . Government regulated Indian reservations with casinos began monitoring peoples temperatures with a hand held device  AND  a facial recognition computer camera . Everyone still thinks it's a body temperature apparatus that checks you out thermally , but it's not . Because even after everyone got their shots , and the mask mandate was lifted (btw you'd be asked to pull your mask down when you stood in front of this)  ....they still won't allow you in until you get facially recognized . But it doesn't stop there either . They're also incorporating  'Gate""  recognition which is how you walk . So now , not only do they know who you are , when you arrived , where you've been , who you've talked to , they also know it's you if you managed somehow to get in with a mask on without being checked first ___ because part of your permanent record is the way you walk .  If you ever get the chance to stand behind the laptop connected to the camera used to identify you , you will immediately notice that everything within the screen shot is rapidly being tracked with rectangles around each face , and that some people are [e.g.] an employee have a different colored box around their face .

Snowden opened the door for us to seek out a person more like us regardless of self worth. Trump like Snowden is a person of conviction.

In my opinion they are always to be found here because they know that these shows attract proactive people who refuse to ""Toe the party line"" so to speak.

The trinity thing has existed for quite a long time which honestly strikes me as strange, almost as if the story was passed on for humans to remember something about ourselves possibly (and this is pure speculation) the deified representation of the ego, the self and the higher self, what what seeks to shed and to become. If things fell into place and you had an enlightening experience like a massive dose of psilocybin or DMT how would you explain it to your brethren? Probably through stories and then time passes and metaphors become miracles, personified thoughts become gods and this misunderstanding is truly what destroys us as humans constantly divided we will fail, we were meant to work together.

@austinrichards2569,Ik right! Ok now what I'm going to say about Snowden might not be popular with some ppl but I'm going to say it anyway. I'll start first by saying that I have the utmost respect for Snowden for what he did when he blew the whistle on our government for spying on on our ppl here in the U.S. and for that I thank you Edward Snowden. Having said that though I found this interview to be really tiresome. Snowden just kept rambling on and on and on. I was only able to make it to the 1 hour 7min mark before I had to turn it off. He went on forever before answering Joe's question. At this point I'm loosing interest in the interview all together. I was wondering when Snowden was going to shut up with all of his narcissistic ranting and catch his damn breath. And Snowden has this weird obsessive compulsive chuckle that really. . . really. . . really annoys me!!! Snowden goes into too many details in his long and drawn out stories which made this tiresome for me. I made it to the 1 hour and 7 min mark and had to turn it off. It's just too much for me.

@hotXXXice,"I worked army for many years since I was 18 and I am sure u guys were evacuated because not to take a chance,  to get hit, but it was the reason so you guys can not work and make it not happen. I worked army as EOD. offtime we did take contracts to blow up old buildings.. Did 2 tours in Afganistan. So I have some experience and I am sure 98% that those buildings got hit not by mistake. 3rd plane was just a distraction to guide perspective away from the main coals. Those buildings that got hit by a plane, wouldn't ever collapse for a million years. Those are built-in extreme conditions. They have to survive immense wind, even on the windiest day. The Force of that is 10 times the plane crashing in it. The way the building collapsed, would not take place. for plane  100%, the way they did collapse. Was used specialized, trained personnel who blew them up.  The plane was just a distraction and reason to act on something that I am not competent to talk about. I know how fucked up this world is all useless wars and shit, I stop caring about humans a long time ago.  We let some Mongols take all bower who kills us for more bower and we are like f monkies, who say I know this is happening, I work for you, so you can do more than stuff, I work more give me little money so I can buy a banana, from the shop and but some gas in the car, I  let you take all stuff, and I take loans now also from you so you can rent me this stuff,  what you took, and now I can buy half banana but, I will work even more, so I can but maybe gas in the car, so I can go work again for you. So people say, why you wine u don't even care about us. I did try, but people are so afraid. they don't have balls to stand for themself,  if I talk about something that makes the commander look bad, and he's Joyce and acts, people, know and agree with me, But when the commander shows I can kick u off the army, then everybody fucking piss themself and start licking ass for the commander, so the won't be kicked out or named mentally ill :D. Bad people are mostly always under your nose. Some Random guy who has the most precious thing to lose. don't start terrorism,  Terrorism isn't that someone wants to change something, 70%  happens because they don't have money and no power. People who own everything make people do things for their cause. If not their family will die and if they do certain false promises are made. Like a sum for the family to survive. what in reality does not happen.  And later guys like me, we go war to kill their families, who are named terrorists and we get the nice sum for it. People we let get power are most corrupted and most criminal and dangerous for us. we do not even know anymore who are people in power this is how badly we have fallen into the abyss. The soldiers come home crooked and broken, mentally and physically start making mediocre wining and drama that they lost limbs, friend, etc,, it is like huge promotion, terrorism, and army. and make people believe,  its fine to kill them for money,,, we became veterans, etc,  and still care about that,  For fucking what, we didn't go there to protect our country,   we signed paper voluntarily because fucking sum. Some people maybe who got beaten by colonels huge Jimmy the hammer so strongly in the head maybe did believe such thing but reality u have to be real empty under the eggshell.

A lot of people don't know that using the Lord's name lightly, just as an expression i.e. in vain is a grave matter. It's one of the Commandments (the Second) because our Lord wants us to know what will keep us alive and what brings death. Using the Lord's name lightly without due reverence is a grave matter meaning if done deliberately and with full knowledge it constitutes a mortal sin....meaning if done with full knowledge and deliberate consent one suffers the loss of the life of grace in the soul/hell eternally unless one recieves absolution from a Catholic priest. Any way it's done is a mortal sin but it's even weightier when the holy name of Jesus Christ is used and if you don't say anything or post content in which it's used or are silent you commit the same mortal sin via ommission or tacit approval. Here's one. You see that things have a cause. If you don't assent to this you're simply a liar. IF you don't have a First Cause of all Himself Uncaused you have an infinite regress of causes of effects and never getting to the First Cause you never get in reverse logic to what you see today by neccessary result of this infinite regress. The infinity (i.e. NEVER ending of causes creates an insurmountable gap because if its inherent infinity insurmountable to suffice for the existence of anything you see that exists and has a cause of its existence.

Now is he was selling secrets to the enemy with the motives of hurting the American people deliberately the. this would be espionage, but its not so the government really needs to stop trying to make rules on top of rules to protect those who are keeping secrets from their employer, We the People! Don’t get mad bc your hand was caught in the cookie jar without the American peoples’ permission. If the government wants us to turn a blind eye to their invasion of privacy then they should do the same to Snowden.",4년 전,0,
@aivel3973,"I see the point of both the CIA and Snowden. If I was asked by the President to continue an unlawful program that violated the constitutional rights of others in order to possibly, not guaranteed to save one life, I would do it because at face value, the life of the person(s) I save is important. I would figure it only information and not killing anyone. The only info I would give out would be the info of terrorist. However, of I found out this information was for other nefarious things I would destroy the information. With Snowden’s side of I found out the American people were being deceived for nefarious purposes I would expose it. Bit if it was only for the 9/11 terrorist I would not. For me it would be about who is getting hurt. If only the terrorist is being hurt, captured; etc then I would have zero problem recording the information of the world, I would destroy all info not pertaining to the terrorist acts; period. So maybe I am missing something. I do not think Snowden should go to jail for trying to protect American Citizens and if I was the CIA agent who ciolated rights non violently only listening to something personal things that were none of my business, I would apologize and assure people the non terroristic things were destroyed. On both sides, I did what I did as long as the motives were pure and no one was hurt. It is good to expose things because the next person may not have a pure motive, they may use the info to blackmail people. So, Snowden is like a checks and balances system outside the agency. It should always be done like this to prevent abuse of learning this information. Do I want to be spied on. Hell no! But of you do spy on me and you now know I am not a terrorist then you need to delete all of my information so no one else can put my personal business out there.",4년 전,0,

@Godisabsolutelygood,"100%!  Just about every other interviewer especially on the mainstream media will interject with a question that steers the conversation in a totally different direction than what he/she was going in AND I REALLY WANTED THEM TO FINISH THEIR THOUGHT AND THEN THEY END UP NEVER FINISHING.  So frustrating.  The reason most interviewers do this is because of their self-importance and they want to be the star of the show.  It's like they have to say LOOK OVER HERE, DON'T FORGET I'M HERE, REMEMBER ME?  UGH.  I also really appreciate Joe for allowing Mr Snowden to tell his story in a linear way which is much more effective.",4년 전,2,
@jakobnowakowski1396," @joelbyers7937  i think he does it because he knows that the vast majority of listeners dont really know the full story of the diffrent guest that he has on the podcast, so it benefits both him and us listeners to interview the guest from the point of view of a person who has little knowledge about who the guest is and what the story of the guest.

@iknowihaveanincrediblysmal6103,"It’s a double edge sword. Because someone smart like Snowden can make a long and persuasive argument / narrative for a person to buy into. This method also avoids the “sound bite” system that 24 hour news networks seem to be subscribed to at the moment. So if you have an intelligent, well meaning person on its great! Sadly, that’s not always the case. Joe will often have on fools with easily provable lies that get to wax lyrical about ideas that are dangerous. So I wouldn’t call this interview style the best. However, It certainly works in Swoden’s favor because he has to simply a monstrously complex topic so people can understand what the hell he is saying.",4년 전,1,
@TheRebelmanone,"Exactly, there is no reason or justification in doing so, Edward is not a bad communicator. In fact he is very good at communicating, so good i suspect he might have been chosen by the agency to leak this stuff in this way.   There would be psychological reasons in the agency purposefully leaking truth, in which will take me a book to explain. Bottom line is they want you to know what they are doing, but they want you to be in a position where you feel like you are helpless in changing it, and you(the majority) are in that position. But in a nutshell, it is now legitimate consent on your part, because you know what they are doing, yet you keep voting for government anyway, you keep funding it anyway, you keep blindly believing you NEED it, you keep using its fake money and obeying its fake law that opposes REAL LAW, Natural Law.  So it is legitimate consent and there is nothing you can morally do about it, except one thing, STOP!  They KNOW the majority can't stop, at least not right now, that is WHY they WANT you to know, this way it is LEGITIMATE CONSENT by NATURAL LAW, if you continue voting, funding, propagating, and enforcing its deceptions! And this is what puts you in hell and nothing anybody can morally do about it, your legitimate consent to your enslavement(prison/HELL). Once it gets too bad, you won't be able to break free, no amount of me trying to educate you about the truth of your own consciousness will help you, because they will have you so unbalanced and broken you won't have the ability anymore, so STOP consenting NOW please.

Of course this is if they really care about the welfare of that people.  Is it that the people of Cuba do not realize that they are being manipulated to do the dirty work of an empire that wants to come to clean the remains of blood and bodies, occupying a country enslaved for more than 400 years?   The people of Cuba since the Spanish war, until today, have been deprived of a true freedom from an oppressive government… First; Spain, second the United States, and later, the Castro’s regime. I say remove the embargo and let them care for their own business.

@tigerpisces5506,"When Facebook began in 2004 relatives and friends invited me to Facebook. I warned, I see great dangers in Facebook. I called it Smashface. Why don’t you publish “My Secret Diary in the public library or in the post office?   Everyone gets upset if some one reads their “Secret Diary”. But people do exactly this. Why does government love Facebook, Twitter, Social Media and Genealogy etc. They can investigate you with out a warrant or you even let know they are doing it.   If you saw or read “Minority Report” by Philip Dick? The government can accuse you of crimes before you commit them or even know that they are crimes. China is doing this, plus using biometric tracking technology on its citizens. Now they are selling it to a country near you.  In a few years we will all be slaves of a “Big Brother.” This will be a “1984” a dystopian planet filled with totalitarianism regimes and dictators; we did not see how we voluntarily, gave up our freedom, and how we enslaved ourselves by “eating the poison apples, off the tree of fun Facebook.   You have been told by Ed Snowden, and you did not listen.   George Orwell never wrote the Prequel of “1984”. “1983” would have described, how humanity gave up its freedom by subscribing to social media amusement park , computer amusement park, mobile phones amusement park. We are like the ‘Native Americans’ that sold Manhattan Island, for $25 bucks worth of trinkets.   We control the internet, social media, sharing of data, subscriptions to social media. How? Turn it off! I don’t watch cable. I use an old iPhone. Soon I will get a non-PDA a Flip phone. I don’t Facebook, Twitter Etc. Soon I will get rid of this PDA phone when Apple does not update my APPS.  The 60’s had a great meme: ""Turn on, tune in, drop out"" is the counterculture-era phrase popularized by Timothy Leary-LSD guru, in 1966. In 1967, Leary spoke at the Human Be-In, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and phrased the famous words, ""Turn on, tune in, drop out"".",4년 전,2,

@gaigegrosskreutzmissingbic5591," Rezan Sahin  lmao this is what doesn't fit what you're trying to sell..   1) Snowden hasn't said he knows secrets, that he knows such things so valuable to intelligence agencies, he simply said they were violating the constitution. He showed the evidence, he didn't share secrets that might put America in ""danger"". He just uncovered the still running surveillance programs  2) The guy was located in a back channel for intelligence gathering. He was in Hawaii without supervision, and he had intimate knowledge of the systems in which these programs stored their data. He hit the government out of nowhere when he came out. His name was already out there when the story broke. I remember it, the government had no REAL time to prepare for it. His name was already in the paper, people knew about him, and killing him, probably doesn't send the best message.   3) He wasn't a threat, like Julian assange or Jeffery epstien, to the political elite, he didn't know specific facts about politicans that would put him into any real, dirty secret danger. He only knew what they were doing illegally, broad strokes, of how the government was operating, and who knew what, and who started it.   4) Maybe you don't remember, but I do, they did run his name through the mud, they leaked shit about his family, trying to discredit him, they talked about his failed military career, brought up his administrative discharge, I remember that on CNN in June of 2013.   5) I never claimed he was this all knowing being, simply that he exposed a highly illegal, and morally corrupt act that all 3 branches of government were complicit in.",4년 전,13,

Once they came for me. As a teacher, I was taken to the camp to teach Chinese and teach propaganda songs to prisoners. The cell had a concrete floor, walls and five video cameras on the ceiling. 20 people huddled on 16 square meters. The prisoners were wearing uniforms and handcuffs. They were all shaved baldly. In the camp, I also worked in a hospital, where I witnessed how prisoners were given medicines unnecessarily, maybe experiments were being carried out to, for example, make women infertile. At one of the meetings, she witnessed how the guards raped a young woman in front of 200 prisoners. Anyone who showed sympathy for her himself became the object of humiliation and torture in a ""black"" room with an electric chair, where I was also tortured until I lost consciousness. Since I visited the camp, sometimes I cannot even climb onto the bed myself. In the cell, I slept too long on the cold concrete floor, and now I have rheumatism. At 43, I became a sick person, although I was completely healthy before the camp, ”says the book“ Die Kronzeugin ”(The Main Witness) by German writer Alexandra Kavelius and Sairagul Sauytbai about the“ camps ”in Xinjiang.

Everywhere - policemen in uniform and civilian clothes.

The fact that the richest people in the world don't pay taxes, but lower and middle class working families do and have to pick up their slack when they hold a large percentage of the country's wealth is disgusting and doesn't make sense no matter how you try to explain it.

@lorenzoh.17,"I've now watched around 30:40 of this video. My opinion so far: Money for visions against freedom can be covered by money. Everybody can be criticized. When they don t admit it it is for their thing they belive is perfect (ideal). People driven by money are surprised and overwhelmed by it, not questioning the origin of their perfect basis money. When I derive in my inner world from Albert Einstein quotes about imagination and knowledge: Money was invented because of education. Education is made of knowledge. Knowledge can be found in questioning (or even criticizing) observations by the use of your imagination and by the help of yet existing other knowledge. Observation of my and other imperfectnesses tells me that if every human would admit that he or she is not perfect and criticizable we would have a more nearly ideal selfestimation of total humankind. If google algorithms would come to a close conclusion to mine out of other ethics it is no wonder to me seeing Snowden on a google based platform. As amercians want to conquer the space sending Moon-, Mars-or whatever mission, they want probably a preveilling humankind and not a human kind loosing time going into wrong directions because of not beeing able to be criticized and opening war on individuals (poor Edward), drugs, countrys, terrorism, political uncorrectness (imperfectness) etc.. So it could be now people open their eyes. But important to know nobody is perfect. The government works because you have respect. The government was forced by fear of loosing respect to pursue and condemn our and perhaps some of its contained individuals hero aswell. So as I am just a german lover of Sauerkraut and I am really not perfect and would like just to advise to not condemn or beeing aggresive on people of the politics who can t deal with critisism. Show that you want to see the truth without destroying them. Show that if they let Snowdon speak you are not histerical shouting at and condemning them. Give the no ciritisism perfect ones time and space for the opportunity to take action for the good so that they can evolve the system with your help. Not turning it into a disguised capitalism media machine with the aim to claim as much power as possible over people and killing disliked opinions and accounts. I guess the most politicians are not lunatic (ok there was at least an austrian in germany in the past, but who knows if his lunacy would have been curable with todays medicine, technologie or spirit of the time -but probably not..perhaps he would direct with even more power his next ones to build a virtual opposition to him the president the physically one but virtually  just behind the scene 'dictator'..) and just have lost their path, there is no way I would not show my respect if a politican would tell me his/her weaknesses. So the government should not condemn politicians who admit errors aswell then (after having the whole country as respectful but in its individually structure not perfect audience) There is religion at americas basis aswell: Why not test to protect the violators of the law at their foundation not to be hated or sued and let them speak freely to introduce evolution and don t give arguments and freedom to hate to selfhitting/friendly fire implyed revolution, I havn t read the bibel for decades but I guess that the hellfire and the heaven are not made by media and followers or an human made law -it is based on the superior dominant one above our perceivable entire system. Users of media should let their fears for that time in their own secure unknown content-let them talk to see the truth-box and not fire with hate against the ones who are freeed to speech without the greatest fears. Media and followers should consider how lemmings in the aswell so called computer game are following to jump into the abyss as well as to reach the goal gate sometimes when someone is allowed to govern wisely (the gamer putting immediate actions on them, following the laws of the game for him/her and the lemmings). Wrong interpreted self-affirmation: To follow the majority (millions of views, likes, followers) does not imply to have found perfectness or correctness. So people should stop shouting with hate and stop spreading virtual more things to be feared than there are (it is tempting to us all as our live has a limited duration to reveal harmful things with haste, but look what the expierence of the bibel says when noses teeths or what ever are strucked, or stones are thrown by men), the ones above in the hierachy see perhaps interessting things ahead and around them to be feared a bit for real when society not evolves. -I have watched a video on how switzerland managed the drug problems in their country and how Columbia and the US are suffering. Could the US do the same in their country. Not with use of the 'war on', 'sponsored by celebrating media in need for cash' inscripted hammer but openminded and selfreflected. -Dissolving a great part of the market for drugs -helping individual people and whole other countrys out of a bad situation made out of drugs and money. When I personify a country: The countrys should be allowed to speak about things like that there is no perfect political system yet and not to be expected to ever exist and to invite other countrys like China to speak of their fears and give them time and space to say that it was possibly wrong or at least unnecessary to execute an alleged political opponent or other confesses which you can only make without the fear of loosing power to possible opponents. Love and peace. -greetings to Edward - I was born in the same year and I feel for him even I am just an average positioned person in this world.. ..now I am at 35:21 and astonished about the coincidences of political and intelligence behaviour (fear driven aswell) in old Germany and uptodate in the US. Despite the look on advertising campaign and its former initially same meaning partner called propaganda elevating and deciding crucial parts of politics above the individual who wanted to decide in favor of his community which drove along with the one with the costly campaigns (so why stand against the community) and not the ones with wisdom and true care in their words. -A paradise for any lunatic fear spreader or a poor out of that difficult situation fear driven person around 9/11: War on: cheese h...l, choclate h..l and mopeds in Afghanistan. h..l. If you define the word war in a more mental evolving to solve problem way than in the classical physical way we could distinguish better the sources of our fear for our opponents (virtually and physically). There is no evil to be personifyed this time in our ongoing history (the corona-virus isn t even a form of life). Media can have fun with presidents to produce more cash for it but it could be blinded by this money just to feel as a helper caring for the people in need of the most important news and feeling itself and its supporters on top of the foodchain. So Trump can be a person with whatever value in your head which could be in whatever representing position: It is hard to tell him he was completly wrong on media. We are all sinneres occuping space even before that we have shown that we are worth it -e.g. in interest of preveiling live in harmony in the whole possible spacetime. It is an old fashion (forgotten tradition) but: why not ride on love peace and bibel or common sense of all religions to produce cash.. I guess media can package that well again. It is time to forgive and to hug. -Not the time to kill the one by your fear who is defensless and without bad intentions and declared to be evil but just full of fear himself -we all want to be. If money would lure a cat climbing the capitalism tree and on the way back can t leave its position cause of fear you wouldnt like to harm this cat (I at least) and help him/her down.  It is time to cure our headaches. Thanks for reading my dear reader.",4년 전(수정됨),2,
@lorenzoh.17,"There is fear and self defence reactions: is a short term destroy threats (terrorism) view. But there is aswell a long term why is there such a thread and how can we easily prevent it considering as well to be open to slight changes in our views view.  When the persons knowing the least of their job running governments there is no great crime. If they are accumulating fears without solving them on long term they seem to be criminal but are perhaps poor souls (like mine just with another understanding of nature) driven by money and fear. And as it is beyond there is no other evil than misdirected money flows just given as rightful then a government enters or those people even have started their billion dollar election campaign (to show how important it is to elect advertising-face&sloganbook over knowledge and wisdom).  Watching til 1:17:38: The bad radiation catches all what tries to cover or justify the reason why it is in the minds (as a lie for money, power or an escape of a fear). When fear changes essential laws: I would just have thought first of 20th century german history.. with bad consequences.. but this video shows me that some bad parts of history were repeated and not learned from -Luck that Donald Trump finally was not far too crazy .. and political power obsessed -his manner to speak about pushing buttons and nukes needed psychological treatment, lots of his followers didn t turn out to be very diplomatic too -that was sad but still better than some thoughtless declared wars in the past in my opinion.. , but social media was declaring the war on somthing like detected stupid behaviour that time.. to be continoued. Hope social media makes in its frame clear possibilitys to sort opinions and give advice and even mark some users as very individual but without valuing that anyfurther because to have a very individual opinion means nothing bad at all (if you value people further you would create a society class -make a mistake that lead past germany think of putting people into classes and mark them.) But with social media guidance you can help people not to follow hate and aggression (e.g. recklessly urge for power) blindly. I can t tell if the social media ban of Trump was rescuing the world in an act of self defence as the fear that set in with great occupying presence of his not by him directed followers in sights not belonging to them was solved finally -but with tragic events. Technically it should be avoided to value the opinion of Trump in banning him then leaving a of mark them as not supported by  and / or because of... by the the protecters of... with a link to social media  ethics and or wise governer ethics. Once banned it should be made sure that it keeps so (to not let enter frustation and it followers) or better in my opinion dissolve the ban but peacefully with no bad intentions on both sides (agreement without the court) and followers taught to act peaceful without frustration driven hate.",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@lorenzoh.17," l a  thanks to to mark my typing as dribble. Without a joke It is more helpful to me than a like or dislike mark*wanted to write this next why like dislike is a minor value -you definitly said more with dribble and make your position clearer than someone who havn t read it putting a dislike without creating much radiation of a lie in his head. It is potential answerable even if it says somthing like the author can t reach my understanding with his skill lacking manner to articulate and creating consistent content: Stop reading now and ignore it please.  Can you read thid without questioning my basic writing style? Who don t wants to get a day off-still reading dribble? Is it your job to read dribble? Did I catch  you reading my comment entirely and commenting on it (despite of its connection to historic events -they are unimportant now as we can t learn from it (e.g. don t comment on old greeks philosophy and other inventions please). When your word (looked up in media studied for decades has invented pure bad and pure good intentions to be seen clearly and everywhere? -who needs history then? -Then we need you my dear critic to lead us -Can you take some years off to do so?. -pardon my blindness. yeah history of information is dribble for you? So another opinion to challenge your understanding and my to you dribblish writing about something unimportant because it is history: How does your favorite govermment look like? Nodody likes to modify branches of a tree on which he/ she is sitting and if you do so disrespected by todays fear and joy marked that it is 'perfect' media (self 'clasifying 100% perfect' 'rightful' governments, media). Putins elevation to top was nothing more than utilisation of facts like that to begin to tailor things in his manner. And you can t deny that he havn t seen global money flows influencing russia etc. or how to imply power to get to the goal for the 'one good government' in his mind (like Edward for the US) as a former Secret agent. We need time and space to unreveal peacfully sides of the radiation of lies. Not fear induced hate or hate induced fear (media is increasing its income in this manner, income for familys bound by the devil to spread more storys of it, companys contribiting money to support certain politics to create a rally of the privileged inorder to have a future government on its side) -we all have power our environment is what we make of it) to have a long term vision how to govern. And not a short sight self-defence action dominated short term thinking goverment (with its people connected). Dosificated real-self defence without bad intentions for opposing live is good to come out of a fear situation  but a wise goverment or governer of leading social media don t loose the long term goal how to minimize the threat by considering ethically to move position (thats the part we all should be more tolerant to) or dissolve the threat peacefully around its root* not using force on it but changing its environment for example (Switzerland is leading in this I guess). If you read this whole thing: my respect to you. If you can make productive thoughts out of it: lucky me. Else just ignore my comment as I ve written it without wanting to deviate much the view of Snowdon but to add some help. So when it is not helpful I have to keep with it -Ignore me, and optionally dislike this comment if it saves at least some valuable time of the yt algorithm to show you just perfect to your here and now presence with computers, cars and cellphones (they are just there -why think to much? -ah..common media sensed live means today reproduction and being entertained, sorry for entertaining so bad).. My opinion: A few ancient greeks were more creative than millions of seat farting office guys of today. -politics of today are not compareable to politics a year ago.

The cell had a concrete floor, walls and five video cameras on the ceiling. 20 people huddled on 16 square meters. The prisoners were wearing uniforms and handcuffs. They were all shaved baldly. In the camp, I also worked in a hospital, where I witnessed how prisoners were given medicines unnecessarily, maybe experiments were being carried out to, for example, make women infertile. At one of the meetings, she witnessed how the guards raped a young woman in front of 200 prisoners. Anyone who showed sympathy for her himself became the object of humiliation and torture in a ""black"" room with an electric chair, where I was also tortured until I lost consciousness.

It's because our government is nothing but criminals and there is no defense that's going to dissuade people. And they shouldn't be dissuaded with people like Julian Assange and Edward Snowden and this other guy that he's talking about. And others who are not allowed to get a righteous legal defense because the government doesn't want to look bad.

It was all about everything that was exposed, about how it was done, and the only parts he mentioned himself or anything ""he did"" was if and when joe asked something pertaining to Ed particularly, or, when he was talking about a timeline of an event specifically where he was involved directly.  I just got done with watching the whole podcast in one stretch and i can be a 100% sure nothing about anything he said was ""me me me"". He has so much to tell that he was ending up mentioning a lot of things, and everything was valid to what he was talking about/asked about, just that it was a lot of branches to the topics for your brain to comprehend i believe, hence it had to defend itself before you felt a bit too insecure that you couldn't comprehend what he was saying. Hence it felt the need to divert your attention from that and focus on something very unnecessary about him, something like he is shady cause he was all ""me me me"".

""Liberalism endorses war (e.g., colonialism, humanitarian intervention, military occupation) to impose its law (international human rights law) across the world.

Why do so many idiots find the first argument logical and compelling, while they find the second argument illogical and absurd? Aren't both arguments illogical and absurd?  Do you want to know why the US is broke and subject to an increasingly totalitarian surveillance regime?   It is because the American people allowed themselves to be duped by absurd arguments into endorsing the ""Global War on Terrorism"" - spending 8 trillion dollars and agreeing to give the government unlimited surveillance/policing powers in the name of ""fighting terrorism/extremism"" as characterized by the first argument above.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Doesn't mean i think he did a bad thing, but i like to watch things from different angles & not only one side. And he clearly intends to lighten up just one side. And in some parts i question if his opinion should really have the weight, that its given to him. For example: he talks in a big bow about political intents of security systems & declares them all as bad intended overall.

With that said, Edward “leaking” the actions really only told us the truth and put it even closer under our nose… us as a country, I’d say, hasn’t changed much, and if so we’ve only exposed ourselves even more with the technology that they continue to put in front of us.

@TheRebelmanone,"Right, and regardless if he was meant by the agency to leak information or if he went solo against their will it is still being used against you.  He came and told you the truth, and now you know, so any continued consent now is legitimate consent, by Natural Law. And the big wigs at the top KNOW Natural law mark these words.  It is prepping your minds, and your children will obey and consent out of fear and ignorance. You will find out.  Natural Law is immutable and binding. And you people are sitting there complaining but doing nothing to stop consenting, and that is rippling out, and children everywhere are being trained to behave the same by watching you/us, complain but don't ever even consider stopping the immoral consent. They don't even know how to stop, they won't even talk about it, instead they fight and argue with each other over it, and over anything and everything. They think like you think because you trained them, you believe you NEED government so you burn in hell, but i don't think you understand this. NO, you don't need government, you NEED Truth of Natural Law, this is not incorrect, this is not a joke.  Read the declaration of Independence, and/or at least have a intelligent professor help you read and understand what it is really saying to you, and to your pathetic government. Bottom line, it says in other words, there is no logical truthful moral reason to even begin to consider having a government for anything at all, except helping us uphold and protect Natural Law(inherent rights). And this is not only what the founders had in mind, but it is the actual truth no matter who considers having a government, anyone who has a consciousness(mind, body, and spirit). If they understand it yet or not, they don't need government, in fact they NEED to kick its ass out and because of that ONE reason, it don't help us protect Natural Law, in fact it diabolically OPPOSES it! If they understand morality, truth, and logic yet or not, once they do they will come to the SAME conclusion, there is no logical truthful or moral reason to even have government, unless it is ONLY helping us protect Natural Law. That is why i said to have an known intelligent professor help you understand what it means, a professor who KNOWS Natural LAW. It says it plain and clear in the Declaration of Independence, but you need to know what Natural Law truly is, it is truth of consciousness. Don't take this message lightly, go research Natural Law and don't stop until you understand it from top to bottom if you care about life itself, if you care about any life in existence.  I know we can't do much at this point in time, but we can do more than you might think. It begins with sharing the truth of Consciousness/Natural Law, Mark these words. We have to at least begin talking about HOW to stop consenting, and that is how, uphold Natural Law. FYI there is no other way, there is truth of consciousness, and it will never change, it is the only thing that never changes in the entire universe, it is huge deal bro, it is GOD. I challenge you to find something that don't change, and you won't find any single thing that don't eventually change, except ONE thing, Truth of Consciousness. NOTE: manmade history is also a part of the truth of consciousness because it was mans consciousness, and sometimes mans half baked consciousness(broken trinity) that manifested it(history). History is also truth, history is what man manifested with his consciousness, or lack of. Truth is the only thing that never changes, if something changed then it was never the truth in the first place. Never changing is GOD/truth.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@TennisLinguist,"To suggest there are not sleeper cells in America, utilizing the most advanced technologies available, is nothing short of monumentally stupid.  Clearly Snowden could not be described as such.  Consequently, the only conclusion to be drawn is that Snowden is in the habit of fitting the ""facts"" to his individual narrative.  And his stated motive for his massive data dump, that the systems of checks and balances on governmental power had failed, is exposed as bullshit, when you consider the fact that the majority of data he STOLE dealt with military and other subjects...and not the evil of mass surveillance against which he professed to be railing.  And Snowden's claim, that ""no one was hurt"" as a result of his actions, is verifiably false.  It is a proven fact that the perpetrators of the 2015 terrorist attack in France had been able to avoid detection precisely because of information Snowden revealed.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

First of all the ability for something made ""completely"" of two major composites aside from the engines on an airliner are Aluminum and plastic. Then being as intelligent as both of you are to think those aircraft could be enveloped by a structure made of steel-reinforced concrete.  That an airliner can be flown that close to the ground at the Pentagon without crashing because of airflow over the wings. Airliners were never designed to fly this close to the ground making that completely impossible to do. Anytime an attempt to do so is done, the landing gear is in place and the aircraft has touched the ground. Without the landing gear in place, the plane will crash every single time.  Four planes crash on the same day but not one of those crashes leaves any of the plane debris visible at the crash sites.  The video of the first plane into that building shows what can only happen in one aspect of reality and that being cartoons showing aircraft wings penetrating that building as well, you only see in these cartoons. With the intelligence both of you possess, you would think the knowledge of anything portrayed in cartoons has no basis in reality. Both of you disappoint me.   Then seeing them drop with implosion to building 7 around 5:30 pm, when most of America has turned off their TV. Having Jane Goodall reporting for the BBC London with a live feed in New York announcing Building 7 had fallen but was still standing in the background of her live feed.  Then, of course, losing that live feed altogether.  Also having the realization the Patriot Act written well before 911 could never ever under any circumstance be considered without an attack on American soil, needing this Act implemented at any cost.

@MankindFails," @iamfilleg  First of all, the original comment was about the guy not asking questions while mine was about the idea maybe he should have. Everyone talks of it as if it was great while the point of an interview is asking questions. So the example I gave isn't about the guy being dishonest. It's about the fact his claim doesn't make any sense and it would have helped to ask clarifications on that particular claim. You could say it would have been more competent to do so.   As for the guy himself. I dont see how what I think of it matter in any ways. Yet since you asked. You and me both can make claims like he did. If you and I would do it, we'd be laughed at and no one would care. While the US gov want this guy's head on a pike. Which to me seems to be an admission of guilt on the part of the US gov.   Also, based on all I've seen and heard about the USA. The idea they wouldn't build a system to watch everyone like they do in China seems absolutely impossible. Many smart peoples have seen it coming decades ago. Cause it's the most obvious thing in the world. You could think of Cameron with Terminator and Skynet. George Lucas with THX 1138 and his Star Wars movies.   So what I really think of all of this.

He's a liar, his story is inconsistent, and he can't answer what he's done with the 1 million extra files he stole. He said he gave them to Poitras and Greenwald, yet, when Britain intelligence obtained Poitras's thumb-drive, it only had 55,000 files.   So, what do you think his motivation was? Hmm? If the forensic audit shows that he stole 1 million plus files, and he only revealed two damning files, WHICH, by the way was something he found right up to the last moment of him stealing a previous 900,000 files, what do you think he was doing? Oh, and he's now in Russia. Jesus Christ, seriously, the media and Hollywood have really misconstrued this story.  The sad thing is that PRISM was not good. It was damning for NSA, but what Snowden did was more harmful than anything NSA was doing. Do your own research, and don't take everything Snowden says as gospel. Believe me, I wanted to put him on a pedestal, but when I researched it more, this dude is just another guy searching for fame/conspiracy at all cost.

@Livebyfaith117,"Here is a comprehensive explanation of the Mark of the Beast which the Lord has given me to share...  The Mark of the Beast and Sunday laws.   So you may have heard of the ""mark of the beast"" it's a prophecy in the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation (chapters 13 and 14). Bible prophecy uses symbols and these symbols can be defined by going into the other books of the Bible and putting the pieces together. Its kind of like a grand jigsaw puzzle of truth.   It says in 2 Peter 1:20 that ""No prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."" Basically you can't just take a prophetic symbol and make it to mean whatever you think it means (private interpretation), you must go into deep study to put the pieces of the puzzle together.   So first we have to first figure out what a ""BEAST"" means according to prophecy. It is written,   Daniel 7:23 ""Thus he said, The fourth BEAST shall be the fourth KINGDOM upon earth, which shall be diverse from all KINGDOMS, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.""   So here we see that a beast in prophecy = a Kingdom/Nation.   The book of Revelation also tells us that this ""beast"" (nation) will be enjoined with a ""WOMAN""   Revelation 17:3 ""... I saw a WOMAN sit upon a scarlet coloured BEAST,"" What is a ""WOMAN"" according to prophecy?   Jeremiah 6:2 ""I have likened the daughter of ZION to a comely and delicate WOMAN.""   WOMAN = A CHURCH   Revelation says the woman (church) will join a beast (nation). Where on earth do we see a church and nation joined as one political entity today? Daniel 7:23 also stated that doing so would make it utterly unique than any nation before or after it. This fulfillment can only be seen in the nation called VATICAN CITY. Furthermore, Vatican City is also the Roman Catholic CHURCH simultaneously.   So now we know that the Beast = Vatican City we have to find out what a ""mark"" is according to the Bible. It is written that when we commit sin that God puts a ""mark"" on us...   Job 10:14 ""If I SIN, then thou MARKest me,""   Psalms 130:3 ""If thou, LORD, shouldest MARK INIQUITIES, O Lord, who shall stand?""   So mark = sin. The question now is, what is sin according to the scripture?   1 John 3:4 ""Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for SIN IS THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW.""   So sin is the transgression or breaking of Gods ten commandments, his law which can be found in Exodus chapter 20.   Now we know that the ""Mark of the beast"" translated equals ""the Sin of the Vatican""  We can then make sense of the prophecy in Revelation...   Revelation 14:9-10 ""And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship [obey] the beast [Vatican] and his image, and receive his mark [sin] in his forehead [choice], or in his hand [force], The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God...""  Forehead and Right Hand?   • ""And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive A MARK IN THEIR RIGHT HAND, OR  IN THEIR FOREHEADS."" Revelation 13:16   ""Forehead"" and ""right hand"" are not to be taken literal here, they are symbolic just like the other prophecies in Revelation. Many have given there own private interpretation to suggest that this means there will be a literal ""mark"" from a vaccine, microchip or barcode placed in the forehead or right hand but the Bible gives us the true definition of these symbols...   Forhead   • ""And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have SEALED  the servants of our God IN THEIR FOREHEADS."" Revelation 7:2,3 • Did you notice that it says, the Almighty seals them in their foreheads? This is why Christians never remember being stamped, sealed, or MARKED BY GOD WHEN THEY BECOME TRULY SAVED and begin to walk as He has written they will walk. When God sealed us ""in"" the forehead it was not a mark ON the forehead like a tattoo, and it certainly isn't a computer chip under the skin either because I don't recall God doing that to me.   So Forhead = Choice (free will decision). Interestingly enough, Scientists in recent years have mapped the human brain and discovered that it is within the forehead region (the cerebral cortex) that free will decisions are made!   Right Hand   Truth is, much of mankind is not likely to ""freely"" go along with the beast's plans. So, the beast in Rome has to rely on the use of force instead. This is where the hand comes into play.    Notice how the hand is defined in prophecy.   Jeremiah 38:23, ""... thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be TAKEN BY THE HAND  of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.""   Ecclesiastes 9:10, ""Whatsoever THY HAND  findeth to do, do it with thy might; for THERE IS NO WORK, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.""   In prophecy the hand represents being forced against our will as well as our ability to buy and sell, or ""work"" as Ecclesiastes 9:10 put it. As we all know, Jesus will never force Himself on us. He prefers we choose to worship Him of our own free will. That is why He only seals in the forehead where the decision is made in the MIND. The Vatican (Beast) however will seal people in the right hand by taking away their ability to buy or sell if they refuse to go along with the Sunday Law mandate, so they are forced to comply to this corrupt law becuase they don't have the faith that God will provide for them just as He did for Elijah in the wilderness when he was made an outlaw by the Kingdom of Israel and he had to flee to the wilderness, (See 1 Kings 19).  Satan is going to use the Vatican to get the whole world to break one of Gods ten commandments. Let's play devil's advocate, if you were satan which commandment could you force or trick the whole world to break? It has to be so sneaky that most people including most professed Christians will not realise they are breaking it?   Well there is only one commandment which God specifically tells us to ""Remember"" because He knew that it would be forgotten at some point in history. This commandment is commandment #4, ""Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the SEVENTH DAY IS THE SABBATH of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work,..."" (Exodus 20:8-10).   The seventh day (Friday sunset to Saturday sunset) is the Sabbath, this has never and can never change, as declared in the Old Testament (Numbers 23:20) and the New (Hebrews 4:4-11). Yet the Roman Catholic church under Emperor Constantine on March 7th, 321ad decided to change the Sabbath from the 7th day of the week to the pagan day of sun worship, the 1st day of the week, Sunday.   Now at the very end of time just before Jesus returns Satan will use the Vatican to enforce a global Sunday law to get everyone to break Gods law by keeping a different day holy to the day that God sanctified and set apart at creation week (Genesis 2). The Pope will say that we need to lock down everything and rest every week on the Sunday in order to reverse ""climate change"", satan will then appear as Jesus giving power to this Sunday law, working many false wonders, signs and miracles to decieve the people (2 Thessalonians 2:9, Matthew 24:24). Satan will prop up the Pope (Revelation 13:4) and declare that he has changed the Sabbath to Sunday and that we must all keep it as a rest day in order to stop the calamaties and anyone who goes against this global Sunday law will not be able to buy or sell, they will be deemed as criminals worthy of death for refusing to obey the law and save the planet, many thousands of Sabbath keeping Christians will be martyred (Revelation 20:4)   Any of this sound familiar? ""Obey the mask and save lives"", ""take the vaccine or else you'll be killing people"", ""lockdown on Sunday or you'll be killing the planey"". Satan is now getting all his ducks in a row with this fake Covid-19 PLANNEDemic (see the movie titled ""Plandemic: Indoctornation"" on Bitchute). The Vatican is using fake science to tell us that we need to lockdown, wear masks and take a vaccine to stop covid and countless videos have now surfaced of people literally beating their fellow man for not wearing the mask. Imagine the rage of the masses against the Sabbath keeping people of God for refusing to lockdown on Sunday? They will labelled as ""climate killers"" and the ones causing the ""climate change"" for their refusal to obey the Sunday law and instead go forth warning people and preaching the truth on that day.   People are being beaten down with these lockdowns to the point that by the time the Pope and his  New World Order/Great Reset tells them to ""lockdown on Sunday to stop climate change"" they will just obey like obedient slaves. They've already been through long periods of continual lockdowns due to these fake viruses', so locking down everything just one day a week on the satanic sabbath of Sunday will be fine for them. Yet in accepting the Sunday law they will recieve of the 7 last plagues and die the second death in the lake of fire (Revelation 14:10-11)   The Bible tells us that the only ones who will make it to Heaven in this final conflict  between the forces of good and the forces of evil are """"...they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."" (Revelation 14:12) They will have to die to get to Heaven via martyrdom or natural causes, or they will remain alive on the planet until the very end when Jesus splits the eastern sky to put an end to this world and take them home!

Perhaps releasing information on those surveillance programs can be forgiven if they were indeed illegal but this does not excuse the irreparable damage that he did to our country, our US intelligence organizations, and those of many of our allies by releasing almost 2 million classified documents, most having nothing to do with the surveillance programs.   There was no moral justification for him stealing 1.7 million classified documents and turning them over to reporters and others, when 99% of the documents had absolutely nothing to do with the surveillance programs.

All the red folks can move to their country of choice and the blue people can do the same. I am sure we can get along peacefully enough to make this work (and it would take a lot of work). That way none of us will need to leave the physical land that we love or many of the cultural things we believe in by going to a far off land. Oh wait - isn't that sort of what happened in 1776? Also there was that pesky little issue of the Civil War where we couldn't agree as a nation to do away with slavery ( among many other issues). Is that where we are headed if we don't split?  The Constitution was the greatest non religious document ever written. It has allowed us to become the greatest nation the world has ever seen. A great many of Americans don't even have any clue what it says. If they did we wouldn't have nearly as great a division as we have. Then there are those who know what the Constitution says but either don't believe what it says or believe that it is a living document that should be easily modified to reflect the current trend or rage of the moment. IN FACT the Constitution is a living document in that it can be changed but not easily. It was meant to be hard but by no means impossible. But until it is legitimately changed then it is the law of the land and MUST BE ADHERED TO!!!!! It has brought us this far, what reason on earth would we be willing to throw it out and that seems to be what the left, the ignorant, the apathetic and the clueless want to happen!

@WesleyJBullard,"The Comments Have Spoken absolutely nothing Snowden did was for the benefit of others. If it was, he would have gone down the whistleblower act route and been fine. The one thing he leaves out everywhere he goes is 1 he stole WAY more than the US gov spying and the 2nd is he went to China first. Gave all of our government secrets and military secrets to them. Then went to Russia and gave them ALL of the documents as well. The documents he claimed he took and exposed were 0.001 of what he actually took. You think it’s a coincidence that China and Russia’s military advancements greatly closed the gap on the US between 2013-2017? Another thing he always leave out is he did not work for the NSA. He worked as an outside contractor for an IT company that was backing up and moving the NSA databases, this gave him the ability to copy it as it moved over without being detected till much later. He was fired from the CIA for abusing his powers by hacking into things he wasn’t allowed in. Read the book “How America Lost Its Secrets : Edward Snowden, the Man and the Theft” by Edward Epstein.

@VaultHunter666,"To the contrary of most of the commenters. Snowden stole classified information then distributed it to journalists. His justification for his actions is a disillusionment with the programs he was involved with and a belief that they are unethical. This constitutes a crime and treason. It doesn't make him a hero. Every government has spies and spy networks. These networks do things that are going to be questionable. Does that make it right? No. But, you sleep safely at night because they exist. Don't believe me. During the Revolution Washington had a now well known spy ring that kept very close tabs on English movements. I am an Iraq war Veteran, Combat Medic, US Army, I served 13 yrs. I don't sleep any more at night because of the nightmares. I don't leave my house because of PTSD. A quote I have lived by and this country should remember.

Its just hard for me to believe that this isnt a bigger deal than it is, also his reluctantness to skepticism just seemed almost immature, like how could you just have a perfect picture painted of the American government like that, especially with all the propganda during his time, for being as smart as he is it just seemed to naive. Ive questioned the integrity of the government from the time I was 8 years old, mainly because of movies and different literature i had read, but never in my life did i blindly trust them with all my heart, nor did alot of people i know, but i was poor and so were the people i knew, so life was never happy and jolly for us to even get the colors to paint that picture.",4년 전,2,

The witnesses included several ex-Guantanamo detainees that gave testimony on the conditions and human rights violations that were systematically carried out under orders of the Bush administration.

All shops and pubs are closed (pubs may sell food via take away) and it seems that it's gonna stay that way also at least for another month, after 21. hour is curfew (except for dog walks, going back home from places or any emergency) but the movement isn't restricted as in some other countries (although it was suggested by some)   It is tough, people are tired. It takes it's toll on people's mental health but I guess we have to learn how to adapt... as we always had.

Which is why they are the dumbest fucks on the planet. If U.S. citizens aren't a party to it, neither are you dumbasses. Because its a Universal System (Uniform means Universal). UCC Code DOES NOT work without the Constitution dumbasses. ""IF"" it does, that's called Indentured Servitude. (Slavery). Why is the UCC code so important.   These laws literally govern the world multidimensionally, you can start and legalize wars, and control everyone's income on a global scale. Thats why congress studies guides, not law, same as the IRS. Takes unanimous votes and bullshit. They are the first to know about new technology and states of global economies. Think buildaberg group fluctuating gas prices, and all the little things in between. If I know you're name, I got your Facebook. I know your personal business. Know your interests, personal life, political views, what you spend money on, and family dynamic (All from facebook). Add in controlling ups and downs pricing of conducting commerce, its a collective of works through collusion. Very old story.  Biggest assholes on the planet follow a hierarchy that involves a plot to enslave everyone on the planet like Nexus 6 models from Blade Runner and 2049.

A political anthropology teacher once told me they researched what have countries around the world in common when they slowly move from democracy to dictatorship. So all kind of countries Asian African Latin American: what were the steps to go from democracy to dictatorship. It turned out no matter how different the context of each country was, they all had similar steps. The researchers made a top 5 of processes that make democracy slide into another system. Using that “enemy of the state” procedure for their people, without war: is on top of that list. (No longer one law for everyone but two: a political court and the normal crime court: you see the military war court slowly getting a bigger role in society). Other steps are less freedom of press and freedom of speech, and sliding into a mentality of: if your not with us you are against us. Sometimes the threat of a coup is used to declare a state of emergency like Erdogan of Turkey did. But the “enemy of state” court case without press or public is then stretched to people who could not possibly have been at the alleged coup but they “simpathized” (that is the ultimate result of zero sum game thinking: you must say and show you are with us or else you are a suspect). So it also becomes a case of not only what someone really did but also what they could possibly do (preventive attack). And another step on that list is: less and less political parties to choose from. So there might be two but they are the same.",4년 전(수정됨),3,

There is no such thing as a cop, thats just a person. No such thing as taxes or laws or regulations or social security or any of that. It only has power because you give it power. Secondly, there is no such thing as currency. We made it up. Its called fiat money. Its only worth what we as a society choose it is worth. Whether its a shell, shiny rocks or even gold. There is NO SUCH THING AS CURRENCY! Its a tool for poisoning you with greed, hate & bias.  If we are ever going to get anywhere we must lose our respect & dependence on government & currency. We need to learn self respect and respect for each other & operate on unalienable rights. Also, we can not make it enforceable. we the people, by the people, for the people. We must make it like a prison rule and regulate it ourselves. Its only two rules. No more currency of any kind & everyone has unalienable rights and you cant infringe on each others unalienable rights.  Karma is a bitch, an eye for an eye. Ect.  Also, if you think that such a world ""cant"" exist or all the problems it might have that you dont know about. I say look at all the problems YOUR bullshit society HAS .... RIGHT NOW! I say THIS society could never, doesnt, cant exist. No society could possibly be that stupid. I am saying the same complaints right back at you.",4년 전,0,

@michaelpark5439,"He doesn’t seem legit to me, at least not completely.  Critiquing the NSA for sending intelligence people home during a terrorist attack on government buildings seems like a strategically sound move and a BS argument to discredit them, this coming just after he talks of being unfairly discredited in the past. As far as I know he was a low level contractor who leaked massive amounts of information (which there’s no way the public would know the impact of). He wouldn’t have had much insight into the inner workings of the organization from the start because he wasn’t ever in the position to. He’s critiquing the intelligence community’s function and intentions a lot when it seems there’s no way he’d really understand them since he was always on the outside. I want to believe him but he discredits himself early on and quickly brushes off how low level/not informed he was. It’s smells funny.",4년 전,0,

Colin Powell gave them the time to remove them all. Powell convinced Bush to give the World the information that we would wait 6 months before entering Iraqi Sada states in his book that he was the man appointed by Saddam Hussein personally just after shooting Sada's boss the Air Marshall. General Sada in his book and before the UN told that he took over every large plane in his country, including 747s, and Their U.S. supplied heavy cargo planes. He said it took more than 90 plane loads to remove the MWDs. The were flown to Syria and Jordan. Now maybe in Russia. Why was his warnings ignored?

The FBI overseen Fusion Center performs NAZI STASI 24/7 no touch Psychological Torture on innocent American citizens. GangStalking is falsely called Domestic Spying. This means being radiated, poisoned and followed by land sea and air. MKULTRA is still alive and well as you know, just enlarged. A military operation to destroy all an individual’s relationships and all forms of income. I am fighting that daily over twenty years. They just want bodies for cash money. So some female Agents husband may know you at work and doesn’t like you. Your competition to him. So the wife who is a CIA/FBI Agent or another agency or contractor puts you on the the TARO CARD APP kill list. Copy of Adolf Hitler Mein Kampf’. So some people you never met move next door. The woman next door goes to your wife and befriends her while you are at work selling cars with the guy who hates you whose agent wife falsely created fake intel about you and is now trying to destroy your marriage and get you fired from your job. Meanwhile back at my house the fake neighbors spy husband is trying to convince me I should kill myself, he said that is what he would do if he was going through a divorce. Interesting footnote: I am Jewish and these GANGSTALKER people who hammered me next door were Jewish too. I am sure they wish they never messed with this Jewish guy.  20 plus years later, I am still alive and making videos about GangStalking on two YouTube channels. My views and subscriptions are almost turned off and I am threatened by Agents daily while being stalked and harassed by cars and on foot. I videotape them to death. They hate that. I videotape them to death more and post some. Your movie SNOWDEN touches on all the things I talked about. I haven’t seen my children in 10 years for reasons above. They attack your family and friends in the spider web as you have said and lie about you so people hate you even though you are more righteous than any GangStalker,,, and I am. Do I have to be dead before you contact me? There is no profit for you Edward except the moral one. I am fighting for America and the world while government criminals use billion dollar spy agencies to murder me. If I am in insane why am I in good standing? Magic tricks Edward, magic tricks. This is not religious or for God and Israel, or the red, white, and blue. It’s for pure selfish enrichment. Mitzvahs or good deeds is our purpose on earth. I seek God and his righteousness as a normal human being. I am not perfect but certainly more excellent than any NAZI GangStalker. Now we are one big worldwide Virus Operation where we should be locked down and starving to death while governors in all 50 states have just flown to WADC and are enjoying a huge Christmas party with no masks, no distancing and no lockdowns. In other words no one will deal with domestic spying except me. Only me. I am an honest moral ethical spy who devotes his life to studying corrupt governments GangStalking ie domestic spying in %100 self defense. broncoenglish@protonmail.com tonymichaellee.com TonyMichaelLeeTML PI Principle By the way the guy in that story who was put on the Fusion Center Death List, that was me.

@Redbaron3314733,"Regarding potential pardon for Snowden, here's a great article:  https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/edward-snowden-pardon-447263 Snowden is charismatic and really swayed me away from my initial feelings that he was a traitor...to thinking he was a noble patriot and that there are many shades of ""traitor"".  But, after reading the above article, I've started to think that this is a problem of his own making and he mishandled his ""civil disobedience""...badly.  His situation is a result of his bad decision-making and poor choices; however, intelligent, articulate and personable he may be.  No matter how you package treason, it is still treason.  And, if pardoned, it opens the door for any federal employee to take similar actions, even if they are misguided in their thinking, and put the nation's security at risk just because they think something is wrong, no matter whether it is or not.  There are whistleblower channels and protection for federal workers that he could have used.  Do we really believe the Russians gave him permanent residency without something in return?  Even after all of the philosophizing and spin Snowden artfully uses to defend his actions, they still remain treasonous.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@customsongmaker,"I'm listening to him with an open mind, but I keep hearing him repeat the same mindless propaganda that is spoken by the corrupt politicians he claims to oppose.  The Chinese Communist government has been surveiling us for 50 years, and bribing our government officials, and attacking our economy and social stability, but does Snowden care about that?  Why does he only selectively leak what the United States is doing, but he leaves out the most important pieces?    If the corrupt politicians are working for China, then China is the source of the corruption.  Not America.  Is he deliberately misdirecting us?  Marxism wants to overthrow the government, which is treason.  What are some of the common synonyms for overthrowing the government?  ""Ending capitalism"", ""smashing patriarchy"", ""dismantling whiteness"", ""stopping climate change"", and now ""slowing the spread"" of a virus that was here for 6 months without anyone even noticing.  In every case, they're talking about the same Marxist government control, taking away our rights and freedoms.  He supports corrupt Bernie, but he slanders and lies about Trump - the only person resisting the Chinese corruption.  He says Bush and Cheney were corrupt - they conspired to import more slave labor from Mexico.  Jeb Bush tried to be our President in 2016, and he said ""immigration is an act of love"".  Snowden agrees: Trump bad, slave immigrants good.    Does the NSA know anything about the child sex slave trafficking across the border?  We all know it happens, but only Trump stopped any of it.  It logically follows that the rich and powerful people buying the slaves would oppose Trump more than anyone.

Snowden made those lists when he was a spy.  Lists of people who should be watched and arrested.  The only difference between him and a Chinese agent is the reasons people go on the list.  If the list was updated to include ""anyone who ever said anything good about Trump"", he would have put those people on the list to be tortured and interrogated.

The data points that he is giving us are perfectly valid and he makes a lot of good points, but the shape he is giving us to connect between those dots is a total misdirection.

But the things that people worry about on a personal scale are not the things we need to be concerned about. The threat of mass surveillance is a collective one. When our government authorizes the collection of this strategic data, they are agreeing to the eventuality that our enemies will get that data. If you have a Facebook page, the Chinese government has that data. Iran has it. North korea has it. Russia has it. If north korea wants to find its covert activities with stolen credit card numbers, those numbers are much easier to get with mass surveillance on every network. If china wants to steal the software for the ps5 so they can sell a $50 knockoff, they can do that because all of those people's email accounts are being copied and pasted into a dozen different databases. If russia wants to cripple the imminent presidency of Hillary clinton and maybe even install a stooge who is dying for a deal in moscow, then they can have more success than they ever dreamed, because the american electorate is being spied on in microscopic detail by people who lack the competence to do so discreetly.

@RedShipsofSpainAgain,"I remember in 2013 when the humble hero Snowden released his information.  Figured that was clearly the beginning of the end for the rampant government spying and surveillance. Yet here we are a full 7+ years later, and surveillance in society is just as common as in 2013, if not more so:  smartphones are ubiquitous, traffic cameras and house security cameras are increasingly common, Google, Amazon, and Facebook still collect and store massive amounts of data regarding their users' behavior.  So many (rightly) may wonder why the surveillance state still exists today, in spite of Snowden blowing the door wide open exposing such invasive practices. Snowden explains why in his final sentence of the interview at 2:48:12.  ""You can't awaken someone who's pretending to be asleep."" Why does such power and control exist today even well after it has been exposed and everyone knows about it?  Part of the reason is because that power is perpetuated not by the ""big brother"" or shadowy powerful elites, but ironically by *ourselves*.  How, you may ask?  Two words:  self policing. For those who are willing to bear with me for a brief moment of academia, an old guy named Michel Foucault alluded to precisely this kind of control, through a concept of a prison called ""the panopticon"" and ""disciplinary power"".  I'm sure you, dear reader, can check Wikipedia, but taken verbatim (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault):  ""Since the prisoners will never be able to know whether they are being watched or not at a given moment, they will internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior (as if they were constantly being watched).""  The key takeaway is that the people themselves regulate their own behavior.  Anyone ever feel the silent judgement of their co-workers if they decide to leave the office right at 5:00 pm?  Yep, that's a version of the self-regulating behavior that Foucault was talking about.  No one is forcing you to stay at your office desk past 5:00 pm, but the unspoken message is ""If you leave early (or even when you're ""allowed"" to), the boss won't give you that next big promotion.""  And so office-workers frequently stay at work longer than they would like, because of the social regulation through the policing of their co-workers.  ""I can't leave work early or Sally will tell my boss and I'll get in trouble.""  Or think of Dwight Schrute from ""The Office"" episode when he documented the names of each of his coworkers when they left the office a few minutes early on a Friday.   Thus this self regulation also has the added benefit for those in power in that it creates an environment of distrust of your colleagues and coworkers; you never know if your behavior will be observed and reported to the authorities.  How much non-conforming behavior do you think you could get away with around your co-workers if you never knew when one of them would ""tattle"" on you to your boss.  And so in such a way, your behavior in the 21st century America is highly regulated, socialized, and normalized.  And you probably aren't even aware just how extensively it is.  So this is what Snowden is referring to in his last sentence:  you can't help people become free when they acknowledge that they're imprisoned and controlled, but are only pretending not to recognize that they are.  If you'd like to learn more about Foucault's Panopticon concept and how it totally applies to our present-day mode of living, there's a great video explaining it called ""What is Foucault's Panopticon? An Introduction to a Revolutionary Theory"":  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFbywfzu-jI ""It is a regime enforced not from the outside such as Nazism or totalitarianism states, but actually perpetuated *from within*.""",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@N..P..," @Shelleyfg87  There's a few things wrong with...pretty much everything you keep saying.  First, let's talk about ""putting children in cages"". Those places existed under Trump (R), Obama (D), Bush (R), and Clinton (D). Everyone except Trump had 2 terms. So...no, one side alone isn't responsible for that. I'll also note that Clinton, a Democrat, is largely responsible for those places as he signed numerous laws into place that are responsible for them.  Second, let's discuss Trump ""lying"" and his ""illegal activities"". As far as illegal activities, I'd ask you to give proof since you obviously have proof that even their own justice system has failed to gather (and they've been trying for 4 years). Trump lying is nothing new for a politician. I don't know how to tell you this but Scotland has an extremely corrupt government as well. The only difference between Scotland and America is nobody cares about Scotland thus America stays in the world view while Scotland is little more than a tourist destination to most of the world.

@ma1375,"America has fake leaders and news to flag the crazies who overreact in lockstep with the big tech spy grid.  They justify it as proactive policing like in minority report.  They make up all kinds of historical events.  Some have life and educational puns built right into their hyperbole names.  But if you point it out they sick mental health people on you to discredit what they cant literally discredit thru banking and tech errors.  Its corrupt as sht.  I interviewed in the nsa and secret service.   I am blackballed from gainful employment for bucking their abuses and not fitting the 100 percent compliant personality type.  I beat all the candidates each physical test in my group, i am sure others in different groups may of tested higher though.  I also routinely score over 90 percent on the aptitude tests without even studying or trying.  They had every text message and social interaction i ever had archived.  Ive applied to 17000 jobs since being blackballed and never a callback.  Twice on job they tortured me into heat stroke.  They hit me with cars, tried entrapping me for crimes since.  They even called out to their mafia autodealers to not fix my new car under warranty.  The chiropractor tried breaking my neck more on several occasions but i was warned by others of this practice.  They also transreceiver my calls often spoofing legitimate businesses and just place me on long ass hold times.  Ive documented this and sent it to the press for 11 years.  Each time when i get to a judge lawyer or company ceo manager... they say like a mob movie ""dont be mad or hurt me sir, orders come from the top.""  Often we will set up agreements and later the managers say ""sht someone is changing things behind the scenes.""  I proved with bank vice presidents by placing 2 calls to insurance; 1 from my cell phone and 1 from the bank vps office phone.  The phone calls from my phone had the same 2 shthead indian agents disguising voice and placing me on 40 to 50 minute hold times when i was trying to make a car payment and insurance payment.  When i dialed from the banks phone i got the real reps within minutes like normal no hold times or teasing.  The bank manager was shocked and i got a notarized affidavit from him verifying they witnessed it.  They are litetally stifling and screwing some of us through non annonymous cell calls and internet email without the others knowing.  Then tucker carlson noticed.  They are doing it to thousands i assume.  Exploiting the terror annonymous stuff.  So even collection judges cant order the phone logs to prove this.  I recorded the calls on video and was threatened to be sued for wiretapping.  I forward all the confidential emails anyway to the press and beg for relief.  Be concerned.  If they can do this to me, they are doing...have done and continue to do this to others.  You could be next.  Everyone should be very concerned with this.",3년 전,0,
@Freightorious,"Rural Mail Carriers are allowed and admit to opening packages to see whats inside, routinely do and reseal them without customer knowledge.  My mom yesterday during conversation said it was her belief as a 20 year retired postal mail carrier in Maryland that they could open customers packages at any time then reseal them without telling anyone.  She said any mail carrier, postal clerk or post master can open a package and reseal it at anytime for any reason.  She also said they did it routinely with no accountability.  I was absolutely shocked by this.  She said both packages and letters.  The theory being if they are handling them they have the right to know whats inside them.  I told her i was pretty sure this was a federal offense but she raised her voice and yelled at me saying it was fair game and common play.  That her and others did it all the time throughout her career.  I was shocked and appalled.  Can we confirm the legality of this?  Is this true or false?  Can we sue this post office or bring it to the attention of others for inspection or review?  Please note and forward this on.  As privacy is important for all of us.  I found this link that seems like it refers to this shady practice loophole.  Imagine being the son of a postal worker, no privacy at all.  Like a government agent or policeman in family, its a living hell for the offspring.  Heres the loophole they exploit from the official usps policy;  https://faq.usps.com/s/article/Can-my-mail-be-opened",3년 전,0,

@liwendiamond9223," @phantomcosmonaut9127  I'm afraid you're incorrect. The POTUS cannot simply put Hilary and everyone else in jail even though he knows in his guts they are corrupt traitors through and through. There is a process in place, which requires the submission of evidence before the courts. Here are just a few valid reasons as to why Trump couldn't prosecute Hilary and her friends :  1. He may no have had sufficient evidence to prosecute these people in court and win. These people have armies of lawyers on the payroll. Putting them in jail would require inordinate amounts of money and actual hard undisputable evidence of treason. This is not easily done. I'm not even sure Trump could get even Hilary Clinton in jail over her e-mail fuck ups if he put the full brunt of his fortune to bare against hers.  2. Acquiring sufficient evidence would be trivial if you could employ the full power of the intelligence agencies. Sadly these agencies are part of the Swamp itself and will do everything and anything to deny a vindictive president the evidence he or she requires. They may even elect to assassinate the president if push came to shove. Trump obviously isn't willing the risk his life over it all. Just not that kind of guy I'm afraid.  3. Even assuming you have the funding to pursue prosecution of say the top 10 bad actors in government, the backing of at least one intelligence agency willing to supply evidence and the balls to risk being assassinated, the courts themselves are part of the Swamp and will pursue every legal (and possibly illegal and blatantly political) means at their disposal to counter you.   See the thing about the Swamp is it has tendrils EVERYWHERE. No one man will ever be capable of draining it by himself. The cancer is generalized and the patient terminal. This problem will not go away until the American people is willing to pursue the complete and total annihilation of the United States' government as it currently stands. The Swamp will not allow itself to be voted out, will not allow itself to be deposed by a single ambitious despot, well-meaning or otherwise. It won't even allow for the peaceful dissolution of the Union. If you want to save the American people from this blight, you will have to sacrifice America itself, purge the elitists out of the collapsing system through blood, steel and tears (and possibly nuclear fire), and rebuild anew from the ashes. THAT'S how bad things have gotten. The only alternative is submission to the Swamp which is growing increasingly more inhumane with each election cycle. Trump, for all of his bragging about winning big and restoring America to its former glory, is at best little more than a speed bump on the pathway to the ultimate Orwellian World Government these putrid globalists are attempting to install and maintain for eons to come. He is both unwilling and incapable of defeating them, and that is why he didn't bother trying.",4년 전,0,

@NoJoy1980,"There are numerous political problems where the solution appears simple until you drill down into it.  In the case of Edward Snowden, while the actions he took were most likely with noble intentions, they were still illegal under the US legal definition of treason.  Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.  In leaking classified information into the public domain, Snowden effectively provided aid to US enemies - even if his intention was just to call out some rather questionable practices of the US intelligence community.  So for any US president to pardon Snowden, they would have to pardon someone legally branded a traitor. Not exactly a trivial crime. Compounding that now is the fact that Snowden has been based in Moscow for a few years - leaving it relatively undetermined how much information he has shared with Russian authorities in the mean time.  Despite Snowden’s claims that he intended to flee to South America and that the US cancelling his passport once in Russia[1] left him stuck there, the fact remains that he has been a guest of the Russian government for a troubling period of time.  So now, any sitting president looking at pardoning Snowden must take into account the crime of treason (if it wasn’t a crime, there’d be nothing to pardon) as well as his situation in exile, i.e. being awfully chummy with the Russians - even if only out of necessity.  Democrat or Republican, a decision by a sitting US president to pardon someone with that history is pretty loaded and will only become more so as time marches on. It’s just not as straightforward as initial appearances make out.",1년 전,0,

Porque eles nao querem que livros assim sejam escritos, especialmente nao querem que sejam lidos. Entao nos nao sabiamos qual seriam os resultados e consequenças do livro. E a minha editora me insistiu muito que eu dizesse ao publico que o meu livro existe, no caso em que o governo nos pressiona cada vez mais, porque nao sabiamos quais serao as consequenças. O governo esta pressionando muito pra nos processar, eles estao bem focalizados na ""censura financeira"" do livro, no sentido eles querem todos os lucros das vendas do livro, assim isto seria um aviso para outros potenciais escritores. E processando a editora, dizendo que nao me podem pagar e coisas assim. Entao a retirarada o livro do mercado nao é grande preocupaçao deles, nao porque eles aceitam o livro em si, mas graças a existencia  do ""primeiro amendamento americano"", entao eles nao podem retira-lo. entao isso è estranhamente uma boa coisa. Mas de qualquer maneira, eles me perguntaram ""O que voce acha do Joe rogan?. Eu claro te conhecia, mas a unica coisa que eu conhecia de voce mesmo era a sua entrevista com o Bernie Sanders, que eu gostei muito porque muitos nao dao uma oportunidade para ele falar. 02:53 Sim, ouvir ele so em poucos minutos nao nos permite conhece-lo bem  02:58 E isso é uma outra coisa, eu poderia ter ido nos famosos programas televisivos, nos quais alguns eu fui como o ""Morning Show"", e ""Brian Williams"". Mas largamente a imprensa corporativa é exatamente como voce descreveu. Eles querem que voce reponde em menos de 18 segundos. e quando falamos de grandes mudanças nas nossas sociedades, ou de poder. Ou como a tecnologia pode nos controlar e nos influenciar no futuro. Entao voce nao pode falar de forma clara com essas restriçoes. Entao essa pessoas querem descreditar e criticar repetidamente uma pessoa. tenho certeza que algumas das tuas perguntas serao assim tambem, mas eu aceito. essas perguntas sao justas, mas so que nao podemos conversar se nao tivermos o espaço pra pensar e deixar roalr a discussao. Entao eles falaram de voce.... Joe Rogan Joe rogan  Joe rogan... Eu conhecia o teu nome de algum lugar, mesmo antes do Bernie Sanders. E ai eu olhei no meus tags do twitter, e tenho a dizer que os teus fans me incomodaram bastante no ultimo ano. Soo pessoas maravilhosas. "" Vai no Joe rogan, Vai no Joe Rogan"". Ai eu lembrei quando eu tinha acabado de fazer o meu twitter, o Neil Degree Tyson me ajudou e me promoveu. Entao o pessoal me passavam o teu link, ai eu clicava com o mouse, porque eu uso so computador por razoes de segurança, e ai eu via so o teu avatar. E esse teu logo é pior possivel para alguem que quer ser politicamente serio, que é preocupado com a NSA. Porque a figura dum cara careca colorido e com o terceiro olho na testa, entao ai eu me disse ""ah ta esse tipo de show"". Mas depois alguem te assiste e se apercebe do teu otimo material. Mas a minha primeira impressao foi rium, e quase nao vim aqui. Mas todos que falaram com voce, ou te assistiram, ficam com uma opiniao muito diferente de voce. E isso combina muito comigo porque o governo fez uma campanha infinita para manchar a minha reputacao. Por 6 meses depois das minha revelaçoes, eu sei que troquei de assunto mas volto logo. 05:35 De boa. Aqui falamos de qualquer assunto. 05: 40 Otimo.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@soleloveny3385,"🦃HAPPY THANKSGIVING  I want to take a moment to wish all of you and your families a Happy Thanksgiving. This has been a very trying year for every single one of us and I’m giving a big warm thank you for showing up everyday and contributing to this community. It’s meant the world to me to be able to, no matter what was happening in the world, see all of your support on each and every video this year.  My goal of each piece of content has always been to provide value in a way that I myself would want to consume - and would learn from - but what I often don’t give enough thanks for is the value I get from YOUR constant support and encouragement.   As traders especially - we often want to think of ourselves as being the “lone wolves” that fight for ourselves and don’t need nor care about others’ support. But while we are indeed always responsible for our own choices and achieving our own goals - it’s the community around us that can keep us going in hard times and make the good times even better. It’s those around us that can remind us of our passion and refocus our motivation to continue onto higher grounds.   I know that we all come from different backgrounds and oftentimes can even butt-heads on various stock analyses and opinions. I’ve read tens of thousands of interactions over the last few years in our Facebook group, YouTube, discord, and even ZipTraderU- and most folks have been overwhelmingly gracious with one another. But no community is perfect. The enemies in trading are also very present in all of our interactions - we can be corrupted by ego, pessimism, overzealousness, and lack of preparation. We can feel discouraged or even put down by others. So is the case with any large community. But we can also learn from the mistakes of one another and we can discover insights that perhaps never would have occurred to us otherwise.   Debating differing opinions and being imperfect together is like sharpening a spearhead. We must be sharper day in and day out, we must always be striving to be better. The market necessitates that. Collaborating with others is part of that process. We don’t have to do it alone.   So I’m thankful because I don’t do it alone, I have all of you. I hope that you feel this is your community too.  Happy Thanksgiving, Charlie   🚨QUICK REMINDERS:  A. The market will be closing early tomorrow, at 1pm EST.  B. We have our $100 off Black Friday Sale on ZipTraderU (coupon code blackfriday100) that is still in effect.   C. Always Trade Like A Spoiled Brat, and always ravish the button.",4년 전,0,

I realize this is a year old and I'm about half way through it. I want to share a few takeaways so far. First, I have an I.Q. of 132 and Snowden is making me feel so dumb and inadequate it's not even funny. WOW!!! What a brain on this guy. Second, I commend you for letting him talk with a rare interruption that when you did interrupt,  it was actually conducive to the moment in which you had him ""pause"". That was quite impressive and difficult for most people interviewing someone. Third, over the years I never had any opinion one way or the other on Mr. Snowden. And I've heard both sides of the opinionated views...""He's a Traitor"" or ""He's a Hero"". Now, as I mentioned before, I'm about half way through, and in my humble opinion, not only do I feel this guy is a True Hero, especially for all he knew he was giving up, but he did it anyway, because it was the RIGHT thing to do.

@marktoovey1318,"Dear Mr. Snowden, I appreciate, respect and love your action of drawing a line; in a world where you're probably way too far beyond the point where the line really should have already been drawn; due to your own naievity in patriotism to your very manipulative government; that you just had to refuse to cross, regardless of the personal consequences that may arise for you in doing so. I consider the treatment that you, Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange have received from the US political system and the cold, blood-thirsty way they openly hunt you, like you have no rights and they have no conscience to be clear indisputible evidence of their failure to be fit for their roles and all the reason any US citizen needs to have no faith or confidence in their appointed leaders. In the weird scenario (I must add) of where totally destroying Iraq, against the direct insistence of the United Nations that they should not be invaded, due to their full confidence that their inspectors found no evidence and truly believe in there being no WMD's anywhere in Iraq, since the documented disposal of the last known WMD in Iraq decades beforehand, was not already enough to prove to anyone with eyes and ears and access to world media, that your gov't is not only guilty of war crimes causing the mass murder of so many peaceful Iraqi citizens caught in crossfire aswell as patriotic servicemen in defence of their nation under orders of the dictator that you somehow justify your ignorance of UN authority (completely destroying any credibility other nations had in their power and that there was an independant organisation that could govern internationally), as if you were in fact, freeing the very people you were actually killing with an unprecedented display of bombardment that you name ""shock and awe"" which lasted for days and nights on end. A horrid crime I still can't understand why hasn't yet been called out as what it in any viewpoint of any perspective, the most publicised and publically witnessed war crime that ever has been and may well (hopefully) ever be. It's like the cold, heartless act of nuclear destruction of a Japanese city all over again, yet people are convinced that both acts are justified. They're so fucking far from that that it boggles my mind Bush and the allied leaders are still allowed to breath, no less be free! You're a good man Ed, but you're lke so many other US citizens, mostly oblivious that your government is the most evil organisation the world has seen since the Nazi's and possibly worse due to somehow remaining unaccountable, tollerated, trusted and even respected. Seriously America, wake the F up! I'm Australian and I almost want to flee this beautiful homeland due to my shame in our alliance to your war machine and weapons industry that requires the use of massive amounts of military weapons to continue to be used from then and still now, into the future! Muslims are a mostly very peaceful religion, so much so, that they don't drink alcohol because any half sane person can see that it is usually a key contributor to most crime, mental instability or social disruption anywhere in the world. I've tried most drugs and it's very obvious which one the body seriously does not cope well with, yet while most other drugs are considered so disgusting by the mass stupidity and delusionally egocentric ""economically developed"" and ""leaders of the ""FREE"" world"" nations societies, for some unknown F'g reason, while they enjoy their evil beverages that can be very easily linked to almost every horrible thing taking place in the world at any given time. Hipocritical junkie scumbags sipping wine, spirits and brews while they look down on the casualties it created within society trying to ease their ability to see it and inability to cover up with yeast and sugar, so they take something less personally damaging but more socially isolating. Fuck economics! Fuck my country and your cunt tree! Fuck you all for still loving America, I can't stand the very violence in it's anthem, far less their stupidity in global communication and peace keeping being cast aside in preference to hate and destruction without any attempt at reasonable, diplomatic solution while their citizens are manipulated into blind and moronic patriotism to the fact that they came with human slaves, fought a war in dispute of their individual rights to deprive that of others and still commonly kill some of the most innocent of their own on mass, yet consider, Julian Assange, Mexicans and Muslims to be the evil threat to their safety and demand having easy access to weapons to protect themselves from themselves. There should be a right to common sense and self-awareness in your constitution or it's amendments because not only are you dangerous and annoying evil father fuckers, you're fucking insane if you pity Mr. Snowden for having to give up his home. Congratulations Ed, you're as free as you can get without ending up living like Julian. These guy's are our modern day Robin Hood's and Zorro's and due to my refusal of any existence of immaculate conception or a powerful magic overlord conducting this insanity, that false son of that false deity that you all still beleive in after 2000 years where you should have bred intelligence that original christians can be forgiven for not possessing. We need to shut down capitalism despite not having any decent replacement available. We need to shut down economic greed, it's just as retarded as you. The less financial wealth we have, the happier we are! It's measurable by the smile on the face of people with no money. I've become one and I am born for the first time. Free apart from the mess still existing from democratic, capitalist gred that eventually enables communities to be envious of the members who most successfully deprive their friends, family and neighbours out of more money than they needed to, in order to provide them a good or service. Evil C's opressing idiots, then the idiots applauding in envy of it! WTF is going on? FFS! I love all sentient beings and the elements that make up the universe equally. I'm just as stupid as you but I'm ashamed and I'm trying to spread awareness while you all see me as a crazy hating troll spewing a rant. I'm pretty sure you'll think of me as anarchy is taking over after the revolution against our western political systems that just had to happen so that the low class workers no longer feel like the slaves of the oppulent lazy cunts buying realestate and forcing the poor to pay for it while they work six day weeks just to raise a small family in comfort before dying. The rich hires more poor people to raise their rude, entitled cold-hearted yet very attractive seed with no connection to the mass population and the struggles for life they inflict without conscience. But, F, ignore me. Ignore that the shiny shit doesn't make you feel good. Ignore the fact that you're ignorant. We all die in the end, I'm happy that I've tried to do something after finding Buddhism and H.H. the Dalai Lama. Live in the free moment, witness the vast miracle of our only known existence of the slow and unlikely events that allowed our environment to be just the perfect measure of all things to create the possibility for our specific evolution of life and the ability of us being the one species that has managed to harness intelligence while our miracle environment has not yet been disturbed by the huge threats of external objects and even ourselves. Money is what people with some kind of genetic conditioning from more life threatening generations have imprinted on our psyche, drop that insecurity and enjoy the privilage of living in a place that even homeless, mentally ill people, have far greater health and lifestyle of billions of other people around the world and explain how you have a right to be sad, angry, envious, judgemental of others with no real understanding of their position, they may well have more right to hate you, yet show you nothing but respect and admiration. Stop eating things that feel, it's so f'g barbarric that no amount of good deeds can ever balance back our karma for generations. Either way, we have to become smarter and better but then came Facebook! Human devolution is taking place just as secretly as climate change did. We're the plague Earth is trying to develop a vaccine for. Earth is rememberring this billion years to be like we see 2020. Corona virus is far more impressive than humanity though, it descovered a biological transport system around the Earth far quicker than we discovered it's existence, but even once we knew of the danger, it's money and shiny shit along with paper to wipe shit from our arses that we were cncerned with! lol Fuck we're so stupid! Let's kill something? Judge someone else? Blame an arbitrary part of our own division for threatening our stupid ignorant lives. Wear a f'g mask and wash your f'g hands you dickheads. This isn't even a real threat, it is easy not to catch and not to spread to eveyone you know by making tiny lifestyle changes but it's killing millions of people.

@asgeirnilsen6752," Mr. & Mrs Smith  it was not meant as satire. Snowden is interesting. Sadly I think information is like weapon. They who have them, rules. I remember when internet was in its infancy, someone I knew was doing some research. He had been bragging to his father, who told me, a kid at that time. He was working with algorithms for surveillance for communication over the border. The algorithms were listening after ""interesting"" words. This was back in the early 1980s. It is like Murphys law: What can happen, will happen. If it goes sour, we can lock into a very bad development. Basically your communication near something connected to internet, is not private. It were never meant to be. The problem is that more and more of our lives relates to internet. By now there probably exist a lot of personality profiles on me on internet. I would think that CIA could present about 1000 pages on me, an ordinary person. So I think it is brave to let people know. And I think it is brave to interview, for 2,5 hour, a person that  of people from the USA, for a while, was regarded as a traitor. Snowden is an enemy of the deep state. But a friend of democracy. There can be no democracy if surveillance is used to silence people. And to know you are under surveillance and feel the threat, undermines democracy. It is like in Murphys law: It the deep state has leverage, they will use it. What can happen, will happen.",4년 전,7,

@jasonsmith5226,"Funny how he talks about how Trump just wants to hurt everybody. Last I checked, he is the 1st President, in my life-of 44yrs-to start no new wars,& tried to end the wars that Bush/Cheney started,& Obama/Biden arguably intensified. Im not defending Trump, he is a narcissist,selfish,& petty. But this narrative that we heard about Trump was the next Hitler,& would go after his domestic enemies,& start all these wars..proved to be total bs. If he was an outright Hitler esque Authoritarian, do you think he wouldn't have rolled tanks,& crushed the ANTIFA cowardly thugs-who attack anyone who disagrees with,loot, riot, etc.Do you think he would have allowed biased big tech, to continue to censure Conservative voices, while basically allowing any hate or intolerance from the far left? Putting up little disclosers telling us how 100% honest,& clean our elections are, & protected by robust safeguards. Where were those disclosures in 2016? Where were the Twitter warnings, as Hillary runs around TO THIS VERY DAY-claiming her election was stolen-without a shred of circumstantial evidence. The only evidence we do have about 2016, is she,& the DNC did try to sabotage Bernie. Do you think Hitler wouldn't crush media like CNN, or NYT-who spend every waking moment going after him,& protecting Democrats? Or college campuses that silence Conservative voices, but welcome Authoritarian,Marxist ideology?   Im not defending Trump, nor am I saying he shouldve crushed any of these groups. Of course he shouldnt have. And many of the criticisms of Trump are valid. Problem is, the ""accountability"" only goes 1 way, with most the media. Democrats are held to no accountability, only protected. To argue this, at this point, only could be done-with a straight face-by far left cult members. The NYT wont even allow LIBERAL voices anymore. Forget about Independent, or Conservative-if you aren't a radical extreme, fully woke, far leftist-they will run you off, as has been proven lately. Diversity of thought at NYT is mostly Socialists, some Progressives,& a few Marxists. That wouldn't fly in Hitler's day, point is, the comparison is ludicrous. Every bit as crazy, as people who called Obama a Muslim terrorist, or Marxist. Kamela Harris (soon to be defacto President, not figurehead, Alzheimer Joe) is closer to a Marxist, than Obama. I think (& hope), she's a mere Socialist-not an Authoritarian Marxist. But this idea that Authoritarianism,. tyranny is only on thr far right, is laughable,& ignores history. In fact, there's probably been more on the radical left. Newsflash-Stalin was every bit the tyrant,& despicable Authoritarian dictator, as Hitler was.  I believe that all Presidents,& governments misuse their power,& enrich their friends. Trump is no different,& I'm sure he has plenty of skeletons in his closet. But if Hillary, Biden..or even Obama were subjuct to 10% of the media scrutiny that Trump is, my God what would we find. It's not that Trump is this squeaky clean, selfless hero. It's that our corrupt,& biased media only shines the light on 1 side. While they beat the bushes looking for Trump's crimes,& these far right NAZIs that are always on the verge of mayhem supposedly, we have actual ANTIFA,& BLM thugs,& terrorists rioting,looting & intimidating people-in multiple cities, almost daily, for months. While we are always told the GOP is out trying to suppress minority voters-& granted that has happened in the past-we are supposed to ignore all the funny shit that clearly went on in this election,& just believe our elections are totally straight up again..after we were supposed to believe Hillary, Stacey Abrams,& Gore were robbed. (i think Gore might have been, but point is the media was fine with him suing.)  Let me be clear, I haven't seen sufficient evidence-let alone in sufficient numbers-to over turn the election. But I also don't think the general public-or media-are entitled to all their evidence now.  Theres no doubt in my mind, some of the media just want their whole case, so they can debunk it,& craft narratives-whether its true or not. Their goal is to debunk,& discredit it-even if it were true. Now, the onus is on Trump's team to prove beyond a doubt-that this happened in sufficient numbers. I suspect that will be very tough,& I expect Biden will be sworn in Jan 20th. But Trump has every right (just like Gore) to pursue this legally,& has a lot of indications that something shady did happen. To hear the DNC media ripping him,& trying to pressure him to concede-makes me wonder what they are hiding. But none of it is close to enough evidence to over turn anything. Unlike Hillary-Trump has a lot of circumstantial evidence,& clear examples of Democratic election officials & politicians-particularly the PA AG,& Michigan governor-doing very suspicious things,& flat out acting like they have something to hide. But the burden is on Trump to prove this. I have a lot of suspicion, but suspicions..even circumstantial evidence isn't good enough..nor should it be. But if the roles were reversed,& these things had happened to Biden, & we went to bed with sizeable leads, in 5 key states-with GOP governors,& proof that some things did happen-not to mention they all stop counting the votes for 2 hrs-then we wake up,& Trump was easily winning those states (relatively speaking), the media would raise hell, definitively declare that Trump stole the election, etc. I have no doubt Jim Acosta,& Don Lemon wouldve already called for Trump to be arrested.   And thats my point, most of what is said about Trump, probably is true, or has some truth to it. But the problem is the exaggerations, assuming every rumor that makes him look bad must be true,& piling on, for ridiculous things-those things never happen to Democrats. The double standard is so blatant, I dont see how anyone trying to be fair, can even deny it by now. And the soft ball questions that Democrats get, compared to what Trump gets..we can't even get Biden to admit ANTIFA EXISTS! Where's the media ripping him for that? They don't, cuz they want to protect Democrats,& many sympathize with ANTIFA, at the very least. Yet Trump gets asked when he's gonna denounce right wing extremists-despite already having done so-multiple times. You can argue whether he is sincere, but if we had a bunch of far right NAZIs, rioting, looting,& burning cities-let alone for months on end-the media coverage would be far different.We just had an election, where tens of millions of us suspect the fix was in..at least to some degree..yet I see no rioting,& looting. If the roles were reversed, ya think BLM, ANTIFA,& all those ""peaceful protesters,"" would be taking it peacefully?   The ridiculous part is this idea that we need to watch out for all these ""far right NAZI extremists."" No, we need to denounce,& fight against EXTREMISM of all stripes.Cult like behaviour-us vs them, black & white thinking-just cult like behaviour. That can be a religion, political..basically any group of people can become Authoritarian, or cult like. And yes, that happens from the far right,& Trump has some of those tendencies. But so domes the radical left. Despite their propaganda, they are every bit as hateful, intolerant, Authoritarian,& cult like-as anyone on the far right. Only difference is the far left hhas infected,& dominates academia, entertainment, pop culture,big tech,especially the media. So there are very few checks,& balances on them,& they know it. It emboldens them to do as they please, cuz they know the hypocritical, dishonest media will never expose them.",4년 전,3,

@austincummins7712,"Great interview! It was really awesome to hear his perspective on all of this, and hear the story straight from his mouth. I did not agree with all of his assessments and opinions, but they were insightful and well articulated nonetheless. I do have a counter argument I would like to present regarding the evacuation of the CIA, NSA, etc. (just a friendly devil's advocate here).  First, the primary point being illustrated seemed to be that it represents the selfishness (or self-centered mentality) of the intelligence agencies. I do not necessarily disagree completely that this mindset probably exists at these agencies, but you also mentioned at the same time that every one of those employees would have stayed if they were presented the option to do so. That, to me, illustrates quite the opposite mentality and demonstrates a body of employees (at least the ""regular Joes"" at these agencies like Snowden probably was) that recognize their duty and would sacrifice themselves for it. So that brings us to the question of the leadership at these agencies, and what their mentality is in a decision like this. If these agencies are indeed the pinnacle of surveillance capabilities throughout human history (which they are), then it does stand to reason they would be viable targets (and arguably even equal or better targets than, for example, Camp David or the Pentagon). With that in mind, it comes down to risk assessment, exactly as you stated. At some point, the leader of an agency has to weigh if the potential to prevent the attacks of other planes already in the air (which he stated was a tiny percentage of a possibility, which I would agree with) is worth risking their intelligence apparatus to respond to the attacks and prevent future attacks. They have to make this decision in a short number of minutes, and they also know that if they make the wrong decision they will be criticized (and likely criticized either way regardless). I realize that making these decisions is part of their job, and that they should have more constitution to make a decision like this than me or you perhaps, but it is still not an easy decision. In my personal opinion, I could argue for the decision either way, but in this case I would argue that the odds of them being a target for one of the remaining planes is probably a higher percentage chance than the odds that they would have been able to actually intercept and stop the remaining attacks (even with full-spectrum, rigorous analysis). Don't get me wrong, if you want to say that this is their job, and they should stay and do their duty even if the risk of their demise is potentially more likely than the chance of an ""intelligence breakthrough"" to prevent an attack, I cannot completely disagree with that attitude (though I do find it to possibly be shortsighted and arguably reckless), but on the same token I cannot completely condemn them for choosing self-preservation in this particular situation based on the specific circumstances, especially knowing that the employees would have gladly stayed if asked to (not to mention the fact that self-preservation is also, in some regards, part of their duty to maintain a working intelligence apparatus). Please understand I am making this argument for the ""ideal CIA/NSA"" as if operating constitutionally and ""correctly"". I realize that if you take the most evil form of the CIA/NSA that people might have a hard time swallowing that argument, but that is a whole separate discussion. I am making the argument in the context of what they should be to our country.  Thanks to the 2 people who probably read this whole thing!  :)",4년 전(수정됨),2,

@dilisdohdi4587,"[No, Trump Should Not Pardon National Disgrace Edward Snowden] By Rebeccah Heinrichs 12/2/20 in THE FEDERALIST, ""Snowden began stealing America’s secrets shortly after he got into an argument with his supervisor about how to manage computer updates.....Snowden began the mass downloading of information from the National Security Agency, of which only a fraction of the 1.5 million files he stole had anything to do with domestic surveillance. According to the congressional report, the bulk of the intelligence actually pertained to:   M]ilitary, defense, and intelligence programs of great interest to America’s adversaries. A review of the materials Snowden compromised makes clear that he handed over secrets that protect American troops overseas and secrets that provide vital defenses against terrorists and nation-states. Some of Snowden’s disclosures exacerbated and accelerated existing trends that diminished the IC’s capabilities to collect against legitimate foreign intelligence targets, while others resulted in the loss of intelligence streams that had saved American lives.......if we looked only at the domestic surveillance matter, he never once even tried to go through the legal whistleblower channels, and he knew what those channels were.....He claimed to have worked for the CIA as a ‘senior advisor,’ which was a gross exaggeration of his entry-level duties as a computer technician. ......Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said of Snowden: “He put our service members and the American people at risk after perceived slights by his superiors. … In light of his long list of exaggerations and outright fabrications detailed in this report, no one should take him at his word. I look forward to his eventual return to the United States, where he will face justice for his damaging crimes.”   So No GREAT JOD at the RIA subverting the system in my country though!

Anyway from what I gather its a tool the US government is designing to automate the collection of information on people from the internet or texts or emails etc. I could be wrong I only looked for a few seconds but its essentially an automatic spy program supposedly.  p.s  ( hello cool suit man 😎 I do not believe in this I have no idea how I even wrote this out.

FAA officials, military officials, Donald Rumsfeld etc.  All the FBI counter terrorism personnel were at a seminar in Monterey and could not fly back.  The Manhattan Project WAS A CONSPIRACY to commit a terrorist war crime against a Japanese civilian population.   The median estimate is that 150,000 people worked on that project; 99.9% of whom did not know what they were were working on or that 150,000 other people were also working on the same project.  This was accomplished using compartmentalization; every aspect of the project was on a need to know basis.  A machinist machining a bolt did not know what it was to be used for.    People who were unwittingly working with radioactive materials were asked for urine samples and they complied; thinking they were part of a top secret project to produce fuel from urine. Everything was compartmentalized and on a need to know basis.  Vice President Truman was not told about the atomic bomb until he was sworn in as president.  Even the pilot of the Enola Gay was not told he was dropping an atomic bomb.  That is an example of the United States government keeping secret it's conspiracy to commit the war crime of using the atomic bomb to reduce the number of planes and Raytheon incendiary bombs necessary to kill up to 90% of the Japanese civilians in the 67 largest Japanese cities from 1944 through 1945 in an attempt to get Japan to drop its conditions for surrender - by definition, a secret conspiracy to carryout the worst act of political terrorism in the history of mankind.

Winning FL put bush just over 270 to squeak by.  The governor of Florida was Bush’s brother (that’s interesting) and there were over 10,000 votes that were set to be counted in a democratic county.  But the ‘supreme’ court stopped the count with a 5-4 vote.  That’s a stolen election.

Because you prove nothing you said is anything but parroted shit and nothing that shows a mind capable of thought.  A mind based on low level emotional dramatic rhetoric.  Like a moth to a lightbulb, your dramatic narrative is good enough for you, but it’s not good enough for most Americans who are more interested in the concrete logical based fact or something deeper than dog whistling.

I filed an EEO complaint and all it did was make my life miserable. I was placated and given bits and pieces of what I asked for but my career was over. I was blackballed. At that time I was very young and not into politics. That is when I realized that we wee not free. Then people like Snowden, Aaron Schwartz, Anonymous and the like began speaking out. trump was using fascist methods in conducting his presidential duties. People were getting shot and killed by police during traffic stops or while in custody, I realized that we are in the middle of a change. Which direction it goes is very critical to the people of America. The Indians lost it to those lying manipulative people that broke promises and treaties. They are just now getting some retribution. Took them 300 years could you imagine what the descendants of those immigrants, excluding trump, will lose?

Now it is up to William Barr; however, understand if he tries to arrest them and prosecute them it will be a real civil war between right and left. I see no way we will not have civil war unless William Barr does his job calls in the military to arrest the public officials on the left and their criminal network. Now behind all this chaos and madness the left knows exactly what they are doing. They want to first destroy any idea that President Trump is our legitimate president so they can block and obstruct him again with a hoax for four years, and at the same time they are shredding our electoral process to again destroy our republic and dismantle the rule of law so they can usher in their communist manifesto.

Around his third year, he had secured loyalty in enough positions to make more moves. He has rejected all corporate and foreign donations. His business empire was politically independent and he trained his children to operate it in his absence. I always doubted Trump’s integrity. He’s a rough-talking, billionaire, New York real estate tycoon. There’s no way he could survive an FBI investigation. After the FBI conducts one of the largest and most expensive investigations in history, they couldn’t find a single crime. Even several of the demonstrably corrupt agents working in the investigation, with the aid of the intelligence community, weren’t able to stick him with false crimes without getting caught. What I don’t understand is why Trump hired Barr when Barr was HW Bush’s guy, loved by Biden and all of the career politicians, and who has failed to pursue overt bad actors. That, and why Assange is still being imprisoned illegally. It’s disgusting.",4년 전,4,

@frozennorthwoods4401," Random Stuffs  Good middle of the night to you lol. Can’t sleep. Stressed about the current going ons, and my community being extremely infected. I’m worried about my job and children and the health and safety of them and others I love and of course our community and all the communities in our country. Well I happened on your comment. And you seem like a thinker. As I said I’m a mom. I encourage our children to think outside the box and be themselves, no matter what. So while I agree with some very good points you made, I’d like to introduce you to option 3. If only to give you some food for thought and maybe a little bit of hope. My generation being option 3, because my take away of your thoughts was that you’ve only experienced two options😉 We are the self made, middle aged, free progressive thinkers, that still have our faith, empathy and traditional values. My husband and I live in a rural community. We are a self funded community, and we choose to live here. Meaning most of us looked for this little chunk of sanity and purposely moved here. We actually are educated, as are our sons. Both went into I.T. One is also a firefighter. I work for my community in the nearby town directly through the state of Wisconsin. I’m a hyphenate. I go into peoples homes that need help and find them solutions and aid, staff if needed, things like that so they can get back to living a quality life and not just surviving. My husband is a private entrepreneur and a hobby farmer, so he’s a home body, and good thing because about 20 years back I brought my work home with me. So we also do foster care. Our ratio is actually backward of what you described from our communities here. Out here we own our homes, and work very hard. We’re creative and supportive of one another. We get things done and include everyone. Not going to lie, we have a few elderly fuddy duddy’s that don’t like change, nowhere is perfect. But here the city is where we see the most crime, poverty and lack of education because it’s cheap to live in, where as out by us it is not. We pretty much don’t have drop outs or high school pregnancy, and going away to college is just a normal given. It may surprise you to know that our community and the nearby towns and cities mainly voted for Biden. That’s right, us rural folks too. I think we as humans are biased by many factors. Our upbringing, environment and life experiences for example. Demographics is also a big factor in who we are. I’m sorry if you had a bad experience with some country people that were Trump supporters. (I’m not trying to be judgy of them, but they do tend to be In your face and angry folks haha. Just remember there is a difference between a Trump supporter and the average Republican, just as there is from a far left liberal and a standard Democrat)But I assure you, I’ve yet to see one “maga” hat out by us. What’s the difference in good rural and bad rural? I don’t know. I also don’t know what makes a crime filled city vs a productive one. But I do know this. We shouldn’t blanket statement an area or depict country or city being better. Or any race, religion or culture as being better or worse then any other. The key is, to keep thinking and changing and working together as humans until we make the greater part of society the good and then the rest feel like they want to know what we’re about. No one is ever going to nag or force someone into being a better individual, not if it’s going to stick. And we will need some fundamentals of course, better and cheaper education, a fair living wage for all, better healthcare meaning healthier, happier people. All those things are possible only through first becoming a coordinated, like minded society where people actively choose to care. And then the goal tackling will come you’ll see. We claim to be the greatest nation, but in actuality we are not. Are we bad? No. Our society is young when you look at it and we are the equivalent of a rebellious teenager. We just need time to catch up to the mother nations, mine being Ireland and also indigenous to America. Those cultures have their crap more together because they’ve had more time to do so. Many having free education, free internet and free healthcare. And I hope in my lifetime I get to see us catch-up. Progress is hard work and growth. It takes a long time. But anything that takes along time usually ends up a masterpiece in the end. Don’t give up yet. You are the hope of this country. From my generation down, we are the call for change. We are the result of watching what came before us do the same thing over and over again without result, and we are many. As I said before when we finally learn to work together, the rest will come and see why it worked for us and they will want to be apart. So you see, it’s okay to be skeptical or feel scared or hopeless at times, or even just mad or fed up, but don’t ever let one way of thinking become who you are. Always leave your heart and mind open..change will come for the better. It just takes time. God Bless.",4년 전,1,

@JessicaPradoHanson," @kartzzy  I grew up in an elitist academic family of people that included presidents of colleges and Masons. My father has one PhD in material science and only having one in his family makes him the less educated one. Compared to people like my family most people are stupid in an education way since 1-2% of people have 1 PhD and multiple members of my family have multiple ones. I grew up in rural PA until I was 19, then I went away to Boston for college at Berklee College of music that was 30% international. I absolutely can tell you that people in rural places like this are very stupid compared to the average European or Asian person especially if they are from Well off families or nations that have banned private schools. This is also because they are being poisoned with chemicals from plants that are in those areas that also have overlap with trump voters and I think that is so messed up for the richest to do to themselves and others. We do live in a closed ecosystem so those things come back around to us all. The truth is you don’t look at a man like that and think I want him to be my leader unless you have mental issues and the sooner we admit to them the sooner we can get better. Denial makes us blind to reality. I have traveled around the world and yes what she is saying is very accurate from what I have seen and educated myself on from water and pollution data to psychological data. In college I was humbled to learn that families like mine that are smart for the United States are actually pretty average in other countries and that is because we are very uneducated as a nation if you look at the data it is crystal clear. which I realized after hanging out with a lot of international people who are superiorly intelligent to my own family in many ways including emotional intelligence which makes them superior in my opinion to a bunch of rich alcoholic assholes who are a part of screwing up other people from their abuse. Because the elitist culture most Americans look up to and try to emulate is actually really abusive and toxic. The average person in the United States doesn’t realize how much they are actually getting fucked over by families like my own and I think that people like me needs to speak up because it’s just fucked up up-and-down and it actually hurts us all because I see my parents falling apart because this elitist bullshit is actually emotionally retarded and I am fed up, aren’t you? I think we should be judge on our actions and personal accountability for how we impact others.  We should all care about how we think and feel and growing into a healthier world that is more connected than ever, we can grow more educated on how to be healthier if we try. If we pretend we are perfect and don’t try then we will never achieve emotional maturity or stability as a nation. If we don’t hold each other accountable equally no matter income then we are just going to continue to allow the billionaire class to exterminate us and other species of life forms for their own profit. This hurts them AND us because we rob ourselves of the opportunity to grow stronger to speak our truth and it robs them of the maturity being held accountable brings us which actually empowers us all. You can choose to be upset at that but the truth is the United States has a long way to go and that’s why we are in the situation, we created it but being lazy voters for decades has not helped. Good people that want to serve others need to grow strong enough to be leaders and run. And we would greatly benefit from things like removing legal bribes from politics like other healthier nations have had success with doing. And allowing them to make us less educated simply because we didn’t want to do the work hurts us because challenges are actually opportunities if we have a balanced amount of them. When I was younger and I had too few challenges and I was emotionally weaker because of that. Then life hit me on the ass when I was beaten unconscious and I ended up with a severe case of multiple sclerosis from the brain damage. Finally I encountered some thing that money could not actually do shit for especially since we have less than ever and now live paycheck to paycheck. But because I have enough money to survive and some basic ways I can actually find my mental center and I find myself emotionally stronger and more centered than ever. That is because being a millionaire wasn’t going to bring me any sort of mental stability, if anything it made me less mentally stable and I was trying to kill myself during that time that we were the richest. Our country is really messed up and the United States clearly values money above life and I stand for life above greed which is why I feel a responsibility to share that because most people act like having money makes life perfect and its bullshit, they are the most lost of us all. That is why I am grateful for the challenges I can transform into opportunities for myself and others. Hopefully that helps uplift more of us because when we are in healthy places we want to uplift others to where we are now that we know how. We only want to put bad actions down to keep peace, not put down people with things that don’t matter.",4년 전,0,
@JessicaPradoHanson," patricia white  Indeed, and their manipulative ways have US fighting against each other instead of fighting against the root of the problem- The people with power. Every nation is a reflection of the people they have in power, when they blame the weakest in society they are projecting their own actions onto those who literally don’t have the power to pull it off.

@JessicaPradoHanson, @NexuizIncarnate1  And trump increased it to give MORE to the rich when they already had more than they need. At least Obama was trying to give us health care even tho the corrupt people took his plan and made it suck as badly as they could. So few pay attention that most don’t realize that Obama was going for so much more for us. But the insurance companies weaseled their way into writing parts of the law and so WE THE PEOPLE got fucked by the corruption. Time and time again throughout our few thousand years of written history we have seen that if you give the resources to a few the whole group suffers starting with hunter gatherers. When you invest in the weakest and lowest of that society you uplift the darkest parts which uplifts us all faster. When you uplift those who have the most they tend to get less emotionally intelligent as they get further from the poor and delusional thinking can easily take hold. Suffering brings us back down to earth and gives us an emotional weight to work out with. Denial can rob us of the opportunity of an emotional workout and if we avoid them we get emotionally weaker. The more I learn the more my emotional body and muscles are just like physical ones and they need work to be nurtured. I hope the internet brings more education for us all as more get online and we learn to adapt to larger groups that are more resilient emotionally.,4년 전,0,
@JessicaPradoHanson, @DennyCraneBostonLegal  If you don’t think it’s both republicans and Democrats that are the problem then you are not paying attention. Things would not be this bad if it was not both parties doing bad corrupt things. The truth is our system has been corrupted which is what Edward Snowden is talking about. We need to shift our culture and emotionally grow so we could see the truth of what is actually happening and then know what we can change as we educate ourselves more. But the truth is most of us are not emotionally strong enough to fully see that it’s all of our favorite people who have been corrupted. Because the problem is the elitist abusive culture that we have always had. If we change our culture and emotionally grow I think we actually could grow into a healthier nation but if we keep pretending we know that we are right while being in denial we are just blinding ourselves to reality while hurting us all.

Even when his subordinates defied him, the press attacked him as a dictator when he fired them. He tested people, removed some, promoted people who proved they deserved his trust. Around his third year, he had secured loyalty in enough positions to make more moves. He has rejected all corporate and foreign donations. His business empire was politically independent and he trained his children to operate it in his absence. I always doubted Trump’s integrity. He’s a rough-talking, billionaire, New York real estate tycoon. There’s no way he could survive an FBI investigation. After the FBI conducts one of the largest and most expensive investigations in history, they couldn’t find a single crime. Even several of the demonstrably corrupt agents working in the investigation, with the aid of the intelligence community, weren’t able to stick him with false crimes without getting caught.

By Christmas! There's one extra way!  Please consider! Young folks must employ this, too!  ""We"" needs you!   (A vet asking you millions of other Vets, to provide our backbone!)!  Here; in a 21st century context!  [Note: paraphrasing!]!    For comprehensive contingencies managing!   ""Civil defense is emergency [contingencies] management!"" (EMI / FEMA)!    Using; CEM / [Comprehensive Contingencies Management:  cyclical phases of: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery (EMI / FEMA)!   Through an IEMS / Integrated [contingencies] Management System, which includes all sectors: private, public, and government (EMI / FEMA)!   FEMA recommends we maintain secondary EOCs ( [contingencies] Operations Centers)!   ""We"" can use that !  To build our own, for ""We"", as the ""4th Branch!""     And; ""We"" don't need anyone's permission!    Over the decades, our govs have claimed everything ""civil defense"" as under ""Civil Defense""; thus, under gov's authority and controls!  And, ""they"" are not likely to let go of such absolute power!    Thus; now it's called, ""DHS / Dept. of Homeland Security, which is in authority over FEMA!"" [Note: your local DES Director can launch an FBI investigation on anyone, from spite, alone!  Thus; Nazi capabilities and tactics!]!    Folks, ""civil defense"" is ""civilian"", thus, any human cashing a government paycheck, may be ""civil government"", but that $$$ represents a serious conflict of interest, especially for any person appointed as DES, or DHS Director, by the newly elected ""party!""    [Note, instances: A good FEMA Director, James Witt, ousted!  Or; ""Project Impact"", w/ the goal, ""to build disaster resistant communities!"", ended by GW Bush!  (Yes! It needed improvement; but, it focused on getting folks actively involved in our community's ""civil defense"" system!]!   Thus; how to get back in, to take it back, and make it a good, civilian, perpetual, social system!    Your/ our system is simple!     Build a neutral / objective, liaison / logistics, ""matrix "" NGO!    Where We"" can plug in all the basic systems we need: internet capabilities, data, academics, etc.   [Thus; a suggested name must equal it's goal, mission, and objective s!  One that connects all sectors, again... Clean and democratic!   I highly recommend, the name: DES Support Systems!  More later.].    (Imagine having your own NASA type control center capabilities; with, hands-on learning potential, within academics!      Imagine clicking an icon, that takes you to your own contingencies management site, for any issues: maps, charts, graphs, reports, studies, data, surveys, polls, etc!  A place to plug in your views!)!     Start with, we millions of Vets, for a quick backbone!  We are civilians, who know stuff, like tactics, strategies, a professional system!      (And; I might add, the reason most of us departed after our first tour = hate for anything smelling like tyranny... bullies holding power !  Vet are only a quick place to start, where all can get involved, as part of a system with nominated / elected leadership, from among our best!  Folk won't follow anyone less, in this!).    What I'm proposing is the contingencies management system FEMA recommends!   It's our back way, back into, ""their"" system; while, such actually belongs to ""We""; since, ""we"" ain't welcome through the front!   ""We"" got lazy, and let ""them"" take over our responsibilities!    ""We"" can take it back, very quickly... Basically, over night, from our homes!    This NGO will provide us with an easy projects management capability, where we can all pick our areas of interest, and can contribute our voices!    Where """"We"" can map our governments, pick them apart, streamline them, clean out the excess, the filth, for an efficient respectable republic!     From within a ""Project"" (eg, voting), ""we"" can then choose a ""Mission"" area to study, and to contribute (who, when, where, what, which, why, how...)!   Reviving this system will restore gov. oversight for ""We""!    = Project - Whistles Blower        - a buffer!     = A place to speak our minds, in complete continuous safety, with folks we chose to be available trusted options, to represent them, as middle buffers, who work to resolve issues.  Not appointed by gov, ""to help!""    Note, the spy saying, ""safety in enemies midst!""   This is our way, to send in trustworthy folks, to ""infiltrate"" ""their"" systems, to end corruption!   Thus; the legally accepted way!  Point blank, and deliberately, in ""their"" faces!  Now!  By you and me!  Over night!    Again; ""their"" system belongs to all of you!  By birth!    However, ""We"" must preserve a system of ""Professional First Responders"", too!  Thus, ""We"" needs both!   Thus; those under paycheck type restrictions, with the rest of us helping out, as we should be, anyway!    ""DES"" is ""Disaster & Emergency Services"" (= gov / ""Professional Responders"").     While;...      We can be the DES ""Support Systems"" (thus; access, again!)!    However, it's for humans, which means, inclusion!  Thus; all !!!     (I recommend a movie, for understanding. While the movie excludes ""politicians"", our's can not!  In this, ""We"" must stomp ego out of it ... = no titles, labels, etc.   When the movie ends, I invite you to help to create a contemporary version of that portrayed system!   I suppose, in a great way, ""We"" can take up where they're drama left off, but I real life!   ""Meet John Doe"", w/ Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwick).  Note this!     DHS is potentially illegal, because it's built on ""the Civil Defense Act of 1950.""  Which states nothing of the private sector!  Thus; along the way, we got lazy and let gov take over our responsibilities in ""civil defense!""   And; bad leaders have turned it into a gestapo, against us, in the name of ""emergency management!""    Also note, the old 1964 Civil Defense manuals!     Thus; ""active and passive civil defense being integral to national security posture!"" - ""active"" = ""armed"" ""Minute....."" - ""passive"" = facilities, personnel, Coms, etc.   Thus; I highly recommend the Swiss example, built into our republic!  Immediately!    The gapping hole, the way in:  FEMA is desperately trying to get folks involved in community [contingencies] management, to help!    They created the CEM, the IEMS, EOCs, for all of this, to serve us    Which is their plea for ""all sectors to be involved: public, private, and government""!     (Find a dictionary: - ""civil"" = non military, non police, non eclesia,  ...! - ""civil defense""...!)  However; note the 1776 concept!  ""Minute man, woman, kid, elder"" = neighborhood incident management ! = comprehensive contingencies management...   Bring it into a 21st century context!  Among us! To provide a simple basic way to have voice!   Thus;   ""A well regulated [ comprehensive contingencies management system s]] being necessary to the [national security posture] of a free state, the right of the people to [employ a Swiss type system won't likely be] infringed!""    [Note: I'm a Vet, '73-78, age 64, but I have not ever owned a firearm!  Thus; I can't be call militia, since such is kind of a prerequisite... ! ... Or not???   I managed Armories, so l must claim, knowledge and experience, thereof! Nevertheless; stand the f... by, if ""My Lady's"" liberty is threatened!   I'd rather do so through our accepted legal way!)     This is the only way, to be accepted by DES, for us to gain complete access!   ""Their"" system actually belongs to ""civil defense""! To you!   Look into the different titles it's had, since the 1940s!   Read the dissertation about it, by:  Boyce Wayne Blanchard.  And; about his ride in FEMA, at EMI.   Thus, FEMA development of grad degrees in such fields; and, requiring BAs, for EOC Directors...!    Along the way, ""their"" system was no longer interested in ""civilians""!  You'll usually find the door bolted, now.  The only way in is by invitation or appointment, by gov officialdom!    We can build our own.  They need us, too!    [I'm old and tech ignorant! But, I have tons of incredible info you need!    I need to pass it on!      I can support all I've written here, and have support letters and recommendations!]    Also; most military personnel receive NCB Warfare Recon, in basic!  ""We"" need those capabilities:  to monitor, detect, contain, decontaminate, and rescue humans from it!    Use us to initiate a backbone... A standard!    Please note: to those who have served in FET !  ""We"" need you to help us set this up, here, among mother's, sisters, daughters, grandmothers, families, neighborhoods...!   Help us recon this virus, as well as other diseases, and to ""clear areas"", until ""We"" are safe, and beyond!  Help us contend with contingencies!    ""Project"" examples: ... operations, personnel, projects, admin, finance (grant writers, for goodies ""We"" need for nailing down truth), our web sites (for info and participation, in this ""4th Branch"" system), surveys, polls, voting, community profiles [utilities, transport systems (roads, rails, shipping...), medicine, S&R, liaisons, security,, sewage, power, solid waste, storm drains, logistics ,(personnel, supplies, equipment, livestock, transport, storage, e), map government (so we can itemize where, and to who, our tax dollars go .....!...

@notatheist,"For a while after Trump was elected, he had little to no control over many aspects of his office. Even when his subordinates defied him, the press attacked him as a dictator when he fired them. He tested people, removed some, promoted people who proved they deserved his trust. Around his third year, he had secured loyalty in enough positions to make more moves. He has rejected all corporate and foreign donations. His business empire was politically independent and he trained his children to operate it in his absence. I always doubted Trump’s integrity. He’s a rough-talking, billionaire, New York real estate tycoon. There’s no way he could survive an FBI investigation. After the FBI conducts one of the largest and most expensive investigations in history, they couldn’t find a single crime. Even several of the demonstrably corrupt agents working in the investigation, with the aid of the intelligence community, weren’t able to stick him with false crimes without getting caught. What I don’t understand is why Trump hired Barr when Barr was HW Bush’s guy, loved by Biden and all of the career politicians, and who has failed to pursue overt bad actors. That, and why Assange is still being imprisoned illegally. It’s disgusting.",5년 전,5,

And he's a rich NYC real estate developer! They might as well be the Sith of local politics given how much their industry requires them to politick with the municipalities where they operate. So he is far from someone outside ""the establishment."" Through the investigations into the actions of many Democrat AND Republican politicians over the past almost 4 years, the amount of corruption that has been exposed, documented, and made publicly available is flat fuckin astonishing. Congressional investigations into private companies, industries, and yes even Big Tech has again, brought to the public availability a shit ton of damning evidence pertaining to the erosion of our privacy and position in the global economy in exchange for short term payouts made by openly hostile govts and multinational corporations.  Very little has been published, even in mainstream or popular right wing outlets, and Jack fuckin shit has entered the public consciousness at large. Love Trump or hate Trump I couldn't give less of a shit. We can discuss malfeasance without making excuses or accusations based on party affiliation. Given that, as a country we heard 150x a day that Trump was the favorite of the Kremlin, no the Kremlin actually interfered with the election, no no wait! The FBI is investigating Trump for flat out colluding with the Russians to cheat our elections cloak and dagger style, but wait there's more! Then we had retired brass of the foremost intelligence and investigative agencies in the nation making public statements that Trump was a straight up Russian asset. All day. Every day. Constantly. On 2 of 3 24hr cable news networks, and every single one of the national broadcast agencies, and 6 of the 10 most popular online media outlets. Constant drum beat. 3.5 years of exhaustive investigation later, we find out that the entire basis of this investigation was a document paid for by his political opponent Hillary Clinton and the DNC, produced by a foreign intelligence asset who had been repeatedly documented as a source of false information at the behest of hostile govts and every agency knew it. The whole Russian collusion crisis to our democracy ended up being about $30k worth of Facebook ads and some poorly timed meetings of zero consequence that didn't look great with all the hysteria. Thats ok though, in principle, better to dig and find out there wasn't any there there than to let a scandal slip by, right? Damn right. Our journalists and political class were acting in good faith to protect our democratic republic (not a fucking democracy!!!!) the patriotic god fearing patriotic patriots that they are. Until that is, we have hard drives full of incredibly rich troves of verified, validated, corroborated communications showing the current challenger for the Oval Office has sold his testicles to China, Russia, Ukraine, and countless other less than reputable govts. There are videos and emails proving his son and brother have broken a myriad of laws, not just on technicalities, but laws that exist for damn good reasons, not implying anything about the pedophilia investigation currently ongoing I need to see reports on the evidence  PROVING that one to the same level as the rest of the info that has been released so far. There are 4 close family friends and business associates turning over evidence and corroborating the information that has been released. Goddamn! Given how rabid our heroic patriotic patriot journalist corp in this country was over Russiagate, this shit has got to be a fuckin blowout right? Fuck no. Twitter has banned the paper that broke the story, they suspended the White House spox, deleted tweets and users who brought too much attention to it. The heros of the media have asked Biden about the evidence against him only a handful of times, count em on your fingers, and sit back quietly as he cuts them off midquestion and lies his fuckin balls(property of CCP tm) off saying its all been disproven when NONE of it has. They let him get away with it. Im sure they are just waiting for the right moment to spring the trap.  It doesn't matter who you love and hate, what color you bang for your political gang, whether you think Trump is a fascist or the messiah, this kind of dereliction of law enforcement and journalistic duty is 100% unacceptable. If Trump really is the goddamn worse-than-literal-Hitler devil, then we can damn sure beat him without allowing overt corruption to not only be accepted but encouraged, and without voting into office the definition of a pathetic puppet who has spent almost 50 years spreading his legs for every nation to ever utter the words ""death to america."" If THAT is the only way to beat Donald Trump, then I say fuck it, let him win. I loathe Joe Biden, he is everything I think is wrong with our political class, and absolutely feel giving him the public stamp of approval despite everything we have seen over 47 years will do serious damage to a nation already in decline. I think Trump is a complete asshole, ruled by ego, an ego so large the only way he could justify it is if he used his cock for a walking cane. None of that matters when stacked against the long term survival of this nation, and whether we as a people will explicitly applaud depraved corruption, or whether we will tolerate some boorish bombastic bullshit to allow more of these fools to fuck up and expose themselves in an attempt to take Trump or a member of his administration down. I know what I'm choosing, but I also know the average person only knows what they have heard at the water cooler and 99% of the good things that have happened, and the corruption that has been exposed in the past 4 years due to the unending din of orange man bad. Funny how that works. We should reward thatthough, just ask half of this cluntry..,",5년 전,7,

No victim no crime. The war on drugs/man. Is just that the war on man. They declared drugs illegal at the end of prohibition because our prisons emptied out and they must stay full. Well, it worked. This country has one law. The supreme law. The law that they swore an oath to protect and to serve against all enemies foreign and domestic. If code interferes with said law it is and was void Ab Initio at its conception. By enforcing said codes they are guilty of subversion/treason. All military and Police and almost all civil servants that carry a gun, but all District Attorneys, Judges swear an oath to the supreme law of this land. On almost a daily basis they brake Article VI. All debts contracted and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.

Shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or maybe sentenced to death. FFS Wake the hell up. !913 is when all this shit started. In 1913 on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia was the meeting place were they contrived the scheme that we are all paying for today. They finally had a scheme that would work to make the American people think the banks would be theirs. They asked, how? They replied we will call it The Federal Reserve. But the President will not even be allowed in. On June 4, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed to strip the Bank of its power to loan money United States Federal Government at interest. President Kennedy declared that the privately owned Federal Reserve would soon be out of business. The Federal Government Murdered JFK. When asked by Jim Lehrer what should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and The President of the United States, Greenspan said: Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means, basically, that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take. So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't, frankly, matter. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjBvdLSk9Ms",5년 전,0,

The coming collapse of our empire from decades of spending on wars of domination resulting in massive debt, crumbling infrastructure, increasing poverty and despair - the imminent collapse sped  up by a virus called Covid19 that we were ill prepared for.

@markford2227,"Faith is one of those words that is commonly used but not always understood. Some of that confusion comes from the many different ways the word faith is used in everyday conversation; a quick look at Dictionary.com shows seven different uses! One common way that people use the word faith is to refer to belief in something despite lacking any evidence for it. But is that what the Bible means by faith? The answer is a resounding no! So, when the Bible uses the word faith, what does it mean?  The closest that the Bible comes to offering an exact definition is Hebrews 11:1: “Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” From this particular passage we see that the central feature of faith—confidence or trust. In the Bible, the object of faith is God and his promises. A clear example of this is Abram's encounter with God in Genesis 15. In response to God's promise of countless descendants, Abram “believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness” (Gen 15:6). Commenting on this, the Apostle Paul writes, “No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised” (Rom 4:20–21). Thus, faith means putting your trust in God and having confidence that he will fulfill his promises.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Faith is more than intellectual agreement. To use an old illustration, imagine you are at Niagara Falls watching a tightrope walker push a wheelbarrow across the rope high above the falls. After watching him go back and forth several times, he asks for a volunteer to sit in the wheelbarrow as he pushes it across the falls. At an intellectual level, you may believe that he could successfully push you across the rope over the falls, but you are not exercising biblical faith until you get in the wheelbarrow and entrust yourself to the tightrope walker.  Genuine biblical faith expresses itself in everyday life. James writes that “faith by itself, apart from works, is dead” (James 2:17). Faith works through love to produce tangible evidence of its existence in a person's life (Gal 5:6). Put another way, the obedience that pleases God comes from faith (Rom 1:5, 16:26), rather than a mere sense of duty or obligation. There is all the difference in the world between the husband who buys his wife flowers out of delight and one who buys them simply out of duty.  Faith is so important because it is the means by which we have a relationship with God: “For by grace you have been saved through faith” (Eph 2:8). Faith is how we receive the benefits of what Jesus has done for us. He lived a life of perfect obedience to God, died to pay the penalty for our sinful rebellion against God, and rose from the dead to defeat sin, death, and the devil. By putting our faith in him, we receive forgiveness for our sins and the gift of eternal life. So, faith means relying completely on who Jesus is and what he has done to be made right with God. Faith is choosing to believe First of all, the Christian faith professes an unreserved belief in the Bible, God’s Word to mankind – true, tested and unchanging. Faith is also full and unreserved confidence in God, in His love for me, and in His power to help me whatever comes my way in life. “But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.” Hebrews 11:6.  Faith is a choice. I need faith to become a Christian. I choose to believe in Jesus Christ, that He died for my sins, and that by believing in Him, my sins will be forgiven. The promise is clear. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” John 3:16. It is faith in a Person that saves a believing soul, not faith in a particular philosophy or a code of rules.  Every Christian will agree that salvation is a gift, not something we attain to by our own efforts. “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast.” Ephesians 2:8-9. To acknowledge my sin and repent from it is the first and vital step. But I still cannot save myself! “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Romans 6:23. To receive this gift, I must believe in and personally accept God’s gift to me in His Son. The forgiveness of sins is a wonderful beginning, and brings great joy to every true believer in Jesus. It is no small thing to have the burden and guilt of sin removed from my conscience! What comes next? So I am saved by grace through an act of faith. I choose to believe. Then what? Do I still need faith? Yes! If I want to live a life that pleases the Savior I have believed in. Though the guilt of sin is gone, the indwelling sin in my nature will still be the cause of many temptations. The next verse in Ephesians 2 tells us what God’s thoughts are for us after our initial experience of salvation. “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.” Ephesians 2:10. So God has something far greater, and even more wonderful in mind for us after we have believed Him for forgiveness.  It is also written in Romans 5:10: “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.” Jesus’ life was a life of action. “Though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.” Hebrews 5:8. To be saved by His life, I need a faith that leads me to action. Paul calls it the obedience to the faith. (Romans 1:5)  Jesus is our great Forerunner, and the author and finisher of our faith. (Hebrews 12:2) All the heroes of faith in the old covenant acted on their faith. They did something. Every one of them believed – and acted! By faith Noah prepared an ark, by faith Abraham obeyed, and so on.  (Hebrews 11)  Go to action! John writes simply: “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.” John 1:4. It is this light of Jesus’ life that I need to walk in – go to action! If I really want to obey God’s good laws of life found in His Word, I will soon find myself in a battle Almost all talk of battles and wars when concerning a Christian life refers to the inner battle that arises when a sinful thought tempts you. God’s Spirit and the flesh are at odds. When you have decided to only do... , a battle against the sin the light reveals.  This is the good fight of faith!  To win this battle, I need to believe in a power outside of myself, in the power of the Holy Spirit, in Jesus Who has promised that He can save me, and that to the uttermost. (Hebrews 7:25) This ongoing salvation is a work of faith. It has nothing to do with my feelings, which can go up and down like a yo-yo. But when I believe God, and set my heart to obey, even against my feelings or my human understanding, then God goes to action too! He sends grace and help in time of need, and all honor for the salvation gained belongs to Him!  Faith opens the door to a victorious life! By faith, we can truly overcome as He overcame! “This is the victory that overcomes the world – our faith.” 1 John 5:5. I believe in His power to save. I believe that when I take up my cross and deny myself as Jesus did, or as the Scriptures also put it, am “crucified with Christ,” I will be victorious over sin and self. “I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.” Galatians 2:20.  Faith is a precious possession! As we said to start with, it is not visible or tangible. However, Jesus said to doubting Thomas: “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” John 20:29. Peter writes about this blessedness also. “… whom having not seen you love. Though now you do not see Him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.” 1 Peter 1:8-9. The result of a living faith is both visible and tangible! The disciples saw it and touched it in Jesus, and our calling as Christians is to come to this same joyful and glorious life – by faith!                                        2 Thessalonians 1:7-9 7 And God will provide rest for you who are being persecuted and also for us when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven. He will come with his mighty angels, 8 in flaming fire, bringing judgment on those who don’t know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus. 9 They will be punished with eternal destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power.

@SamuelTheCoello,"And if anybody couldn’t tell, that WAS sarcasm. If you look at the public online data banks and know anything about psychology, you’ll learn that big tech is using social media and tech to get lazy people (Most of the world’s population) to unknowingly give up all of their data for free.  This data is being used to fuel AI projects, and make humans more predictable for elections and many other things.  Whether or not you think people are dumb for accepting terms and services that they didn’t read doesn’t matter. What does matter, is the fact that most of the world is dumb enough to do this.  It isn’t the minority who accepts these terms and services.  Most of the world is on social media now.  And it’s being used against us.  That’s what matters.  Yes, they accepted the terms.  However, it was intentional by the creators of these applications and these terms and services to get people to simply click accept rather than read.  Management & psychology classes taken together really help you understand this.  The goal is to make humans more dependent on the tech, and stay looking at their phones rather than the reality around them.  Again... yes, people are dumb for not reading the terms.  But that doesn’t matter.  What matters is that the data is now being used for cynical, nefarious sting operations and New World Order level projects.  The entire physics community is aware of this because they know how 5g wavelengths work and how certain chemicals caused by TV and phone screens physically change the particle makeup of your consciousness.  However, not everybody is a physicist.  The average person is dumb.  The average person needs helped.  The average person got themself into a situation they were too dumb to understand, and now their data is in the banks for good.  Let’s not judge them.  Let’s help them.  We’re all on this planet together.  So we’re all in this together.  The true great frontier is space.  All issues among humans on our earth are simply too minuscule to be worried about, when we could band together to explore that great frontier among the stars.  Anarchy to the government.

@CornPopPotus,I was with you till the end with the naive nauseating talk about dumping more money into poverty. More money has made it worse. It's not poverty that creates crime. It's a lack of self responsibility that war on poverty has created. Look at the stats. Look at Asian countries were poverty is so much greater and they don't have the crime the US does. There is no welfare system in Vietnam for example where the average income of all people is about 1/10th of what our welfare recipients receive and they don't have a crime problem. The worst that may happen is your cell phone might get taken if your holding in the air in downtown Saigon. People are respectful to each other. We don't have that here and more money is not the solution. It's common respect and decency that is absent due to the lack of family created by the war on poverty.

@ahmadhussein2150,"2:38:04 what he is talking about (a button that would allow you to use a service without companies contacting ad servers and track what you are doing across platforms) is actually being implemented on iPhones very soon. It was meant to come with IOS 14 but has been delayed till early 2021 (I believe February) which would mean that EVERY SINGLE APPLICATION (whether it be Facebook Google, Amazon; or anyone else) would have to ask you permission to track you from the moment you install it, a permission which you will be able to deny while still being able to take advantage of that apps capabilities, just without it being allowed to track you across platforms. Its amazing to see companies actually doing a lot of these things that privacy activists like Snowden imagined would be ideal, however this change has undergone serious scrutiny by the likes of Facebook, because of course, it will severely affect their bottom line. Zuckerberg is against giving people this button from the get-go, as from his perspective people misunderstand what ""tracking"" means, and ultimately basically everyone is going to say no to it. My rebuttal to this is, is that if you are so afraid that THE MOMENT people are given a choice whether or not they want an activity to take place, you know for a fact that they are going to opt out, doesn't that say something about the activity itself? doesn't it tell you that what you are doing is wrong?",5년 전,0,

@LulJJ509xiv," @Ginkoman2  hello friend, I very much appreciate the new ones that you have displayed in your comment about Germany post World War 1 people just think all of a sudden the German people were hypnotized by this crazy otherworldly psychotic Madman evil is Uncle Ike's the entire world has never seen like Lucifer himself was incarnated in Germany.  That is not to defend the man Adolf Hitler but 2 more so I supposed to defend the German people in that time. Similar to Marxists I suppose, Hitler pointed out many of the systemic, systematic, and immediately destructive problems facing his Nation, some of which we're plagues brought on by the war itself, others imposed by the victors with the intention of hollowing out and picking apart the remaining corpse that was his former Nation. But of course just like marxists and communists specifically, just because you can correctly point out the problems does not mean you have the right Solutions. That is why the comparison is so fitting. And I don't believe it's unfair to point out things like the Frankfurt School which was the original College and think tank founded by Jewish Elites and solely focused on the proliferation of Marxist ideology located in Germany. At the time it must have been obvious too Germans former military and intelligence personnel of which Hitler was one that the Allied Nations against Germany in World War 1 owed their victory too the United States involvement and that seems to be in large part due to the Balfour Declaration drafted bye Walter Rothschild who was also helping fund both sides of the war and was likely viewed by Hitler as being traitorous to their cause. The Declaration mentioned was basically a guarantee by England 2 Rothschild as well as all Jewish people living in Europe and North America that they would recognize and assist in creating a new Jewish state of Israel in their recognised Homeland in the Middle East. at the time this was seen as controversial because it was occupied 4 for I believe something like a thousand years by people known to the rest of the world as the Palestinians who were of Muslim faith. All this coupled with the Soviet Union at Germany's doorstep causing a Red Scare in Germany long before there was a Red Scare in America or any other Western Nation for that matter. And at the time it was seen as uncontroversial to recognize the heavy Jewish involvement in the Soviet Union and it's communist uprising. Pretty much Germany got shafted by the treaty and many in Germany including Hitler saw that some very powerful Jewish people where partially responsible so he took to blaming Jews as a whole.",5년 전,2,
