So yes, men do cry and do not find a need in pretending not to. It’s okay to cry, and it’s okay to not be okay. Don’t pretend to happy when you’re sad, it will just make things worse.

Remember, we can't stretch our mouths like Jake the Dog so some considerations must be taken. As for Soul of Lobster you have to buy the lobster live and cook it next to the bread so it can absorb the soul. However im against boiling things alive so your method seems fine. I hear baby tears are the best but my brothers twins weren't nearby. They always be cryin. Bird from a window implies a wild gamey flavor. So perhaps that's the reason. I'm willing to slowly slice one up if I have to. Looks good though and im interested im trying it myself albeit with some modification.",6년 전,0,

@eleventhknight9744,"Love your show man. Glad I found this gem.  I know you said you won't eat pigeon but I thought I might offer a recipe idea that might change your mind.  As my name implies, I am from SC. Small bird hunting is huge down here so eating roast pigeon or quail is par for the course for some of us. They are very lean so they need some help, but are super tender when done right. I hope you can find a way to swing this into one of your episodes at some point.  Regardless of which young bird you use, try this on for size (off camera or on.)  Get one or two young birds  De-skin and cube three or four carrots Half and de-skin four red onions One whole bulb of garlic (peel and leave whole about half of it, crush the rest) Dice one shallot Fresh tarragon important, I don't know if I've seen an episode of you having this on hand yet Tablespoon of malt vinegar Half the juice of a lemon  Melt a quarter stick of butter with your crushed garlic, 1 tbsp parsley and about 2 tbsp tarragon (should be about 3-4 stems if you can find it fresh where you are)  Pre-heat a roasting tray and oil it, drop in the cubed carrots, red onions and the whole garlic cloves. Get them par-cooked. Pour about half of your butter mixture onto the veggies. They should cook through nicely.  Use the remainder of the melted butter, brush that onto the birds. Season them with salt and pepper and lay them onto the veggies and put that into your oven at 400 for about 35-40 minutes.  When you remove them from the oven, take them off to rest for about half that time. Crank the heat on your stove as high it can go for broil. Pull your veggies from the pan, set them aside, and cover with foil to keep them warm. (They'll finish in the pan.)  After resting the birds, place them back in the pan, breast side up, and blast them in the oven, 7-9 minutes. Remove them from the oven, put your veggies back in and the pan with the birds, deglaze it with the malt vinegar and give it all a good shake to mix together.  Plate up and finish it off with fresh lemon juice over the top of the birds.  Hope you enjoy it. This is country style roast bird for a family affair at it's very finest.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@FuckTheseUnskippableAds,"de5letras I mean I suppose you can but most of us don't really care about whether it's healthy or not.

The Great Tree Lord Oalag has sacrificed his spirit to the Gods of Nourishment and on only the March Moon shall the bread be risen the best. The ingredients will be at the peak of their existence right before consumption, as each particle and string of matter inside the sandwich will be aligned in the apex of reality. In this moment, the sandwich shall impact your mouth in such a way that an immediate transcendence of reality will take place and pervade our dimension This shall implode the majority of humanity's brains. With the conceivable world we inhabit now crumbling, we shall undo the fibers of existence and escape through a rift in reality, only to become overlords of time, observing every possible event as a singular, ephemeral moment, our new state being spectral. We wander the spectrums of each universe and harness the power of the sandwich to conquer and recruit other humans, turning them into Sandwich Gods. The Sandwich is the Truth, and as described by Prophet Khaled, it is the keys that shall unlock our universe, and the Sandwich is the culmination. Blessings to you, Ashen One.",7년 전(수정됨),2,

@Tk3997,"Well several things: -Skin is not even close to 100% fat actually  it's around half protein by weight -Second fat is not poison you twit, you'd DIE without fat in your diet. Pause for a moment to engage your brain you just claimed skin is 100% fat. I would hope you can grasp that skin is important for you to be alive, so having determined that something composed entirely of fat (according to you)  is required for you not to die horribly of a zillion infections... where do you think that fat comes from exactly?  -Lastly there are many types of fats trans fats are indeed basically never good for you, saturated fats however are entirely naturally occurring unless you never eat ANY of the following: Any dairy product, essentially any plant based oil, any fish or poultry, SOYBEANS and a zillion other things besides.    You're eating saturated fat every day. Beyond that determining if saturated fat actually causes heart disease isn't as clear cut as once supposed. It turns out it's hard to disentangle the effects of them alone from many other associated life style issues. Recent research indicates that they may not actually raise risk, so much as other diets may reduce it. Regardless a fair amount of these fats occur in even the 'healthiest diets'.   Really though it's just a dice roll at the end of the day. Basically all this data ever appears to indicate is that there are so many factors at play in a given person that it's close to random dumb luck how healthy you are. People that run marathons and eat vegetarian diets drop dead of heart attacks in their 30s, people that live off fast food, cigs, and booze live into their 90s.  One maybe a less likely then the other, but both happen and so at the end of the day you can do everything wrong and win or everything right and loose.   It kind of makes it all seem fucking pointless to obsess over to me. Do what you want, live how you want, because factors beyond any real control could easily already be determining your fate regardless.",7년 전,1,

It may be because I used a different species of lobster compared to the one you used. Just something interesting I noticed when making the oil.

@nbrikha,"Ok, first I want to say that I think there is no wrong way to cook and enjoy a steak. Eat it raw or eat it overcooked, steak is steak. However, there are scientifically better ways to eat depending on what cut you're eating. 115 is techincally not even rare. I think that's called blue. Filet mignon is perfect for that, being a truly lean cut of meat. But a lot of people seem to think that just because a fillet is best enjoyed rare that all their steaks should be rare. Simply not true. On a ribeye, especially a ribeye that's going into a sandwich, rare is going to be tough and gristly. The reason you want to cook it medium, 150, is because the fat starts to render at higher temperatures. This is why filet mignons are served rare, they are the leanest cut of meat. Ribeye by contrast have a MUCH higher fat content and are juicier and more tender cooked at a slightly higher temperature. I'd say try a ribeye cooked sous vide at rare and a ribeye cooked sous vide at medium and then judge flavor and texture. I think people who like rare would be surprised.",8년 전,0,

But, more importantly 2) When you cook meat using the sous-vide method, it cooks differently than by ""traditional"" methods. It's cooked long, low, and at a steady temperature, and browning takes higher temperatures. These are not achieved during this method. The internal temperature of the steak was likely what would be considered medium rare (135.5 degrees). So SHUT THE FUCK UP.",8년 전,2,

This channel has the perfect amount of professionalism and subtle humor, so I wouldn't mind watching this guy make anything from Feast or Fictions channel",8년 전,12,
@lessalazar9068,"Well I'm saying that someone else has been doing this for years, That's literally the purpose of that channel. It's like if you built a really nice swingset and then someone else comes along and builds the exact same swingset and they get all the credit while the other person gets none. I'm not saying no one else can make fictional food but I'm saying that it sucks that someone can start doing this out of the blue and become super popular in a few days while the people who've done it for years are still barely known",8년 전,1,
@RatrickG,"While they may have been doing it longer that shouldn't automatically deem whether or not a newer channel that produces content like it shouldn't prosper as well.  Its not just about the food here its about the way everything is presented, the way the host carries the show. So your swing set analogy doesn't work here that well; while they are making the same end product the manner in which it is done is completely different. If you wanted to really compare it like that it is essentially watching a group of peppy friends build a swing set together vs watching a chill bro building the same swing set by himself. The group of friends are going to being overly excited together having laughing their asses of while the bro is doing the same thing but in a casual and subtle tone. Not everyone wants that lively and high spirited feeling that Feast of Fiction brings. I mean just for this Sandwhich alone Feast of Fiction cosplayed and had an entire skit to go along with that video. If that is your thing by all means go for it, but some of us just wanna see the food be cooked and eaten with no extra cringey humor or antics.",8년 전,5,
@lessalazar9068,"Rickey Golden Okay, you make some good points. Let's put the swingset analogy aside, My main point was that it sucks that somebody has been doing this for 5+ years, and someone else does the same thing (Corny jokes aside) and becomes popular within a few months. And yes, while the style is different and all, at the core it's​ (almost) the same thing. ",8년 전,0,

Along with the Vienna's and Italian Beef, we'd get these beautifully thin 1/4"" or so rib eye steaks, coat it with yellow mustard, salt, pepper, and fire it on the grill with along with sliced onion rounds. I'd mix together olive oil, some garlic juice, and oregano in a squirt bottle and hit both sides of fresh Turano french bread and throw it on the grill. Some people added provolone if they desired. Put it all together and it was unbelievable for $5.00. It really was a hidden gem on a menu full of fine Chicago sandwiches.",8년 전,0,

That sounds interesting, to say the least. Searching the avatar wiki for ""cuisine in the world of Avatar"" should net you some more results from The Last Airbender, too. Flaming fire flakes, perhaps. Or a more typical roast duck. Fruit pie, five-flavor soup, smoked sea slug, lots to choose from.         Watching these has made me want to cook more often. Normally I just get takeout because it's far better then the junk I know how to make. Keep up the good work! These videos are always a treat.",8년 전,0,

After watching only 3 of your videos so far, I have to say that this channel is the best cooking channel on Youtube. Very crisp film work and delicious looking food with a charming personality. I find your videos straight to the point but not rushed. Well done, I hope to see more videos from you. I heard that you don't monetize videos and you only have a patreon. Unfortunately I'm only 14 and cannot support it. But I just hope this comment alone pushes you to create more content. I am now going to binge the rest of your videos.",8년 전,0,

@salrodriguez21,"Hannah Lee it looked pretty rare. Everyone has their own preference as to how they want their meat though, there's no need to sound snobby about it. I prefer medium/medium well myself. It just depends on the person cooking it.",8년 전,1,
@arancienne,"CiCi, that's exactly what I mean, I don't want it to be pink on the inside. Hanna, what exactly am I wrong on? All I've stated is my opinion that I don't like undercooked meat, I don't see what I've said that is wrong, never mind ""so many things"", when I've literally only said one thing.",8년 전,0,
@tuffy1992,"Chicken has to be cooked all the way through because pink chicken meat gives you salmonella. It's different with beef because bacteria can't break through the structure. As long as the bacteria on the outside of the meat is taken care of, it can be consumed raw.  But hey, if that's how you prefer your meat, I'm not one to judge. Personally, I find that steak cooked well done is too hard and stale. The flavor's in the blood.",8년 전,4,
@arancienne,"Ok fair enough, but like you said it's all down to opinion. If I don't like the look of that meat, it doesn't mean I should be a vegetarian, and it doesn't mean I'm wrong about the way I choose to eat meat, like some people in this thread have implied. You're all treating me like some kind of criminal for not liking undercooked, or for those of you who want to get technical: meat that *looks* like it hasn't been cooked properly. I didn't know it was so common for peopel to eat their meat like that, but whatever to each their own.",8년 전,0,
