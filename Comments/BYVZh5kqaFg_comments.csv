@grimmington2569,Honestly I think a balloon dropping your egg from the edge of space onto a target the size of a house would be more impressive than a guided missile strike or a kinetic bombardment weighing in at approximately 8.3 tonnes. The missile strike has a target pre-programmed into it and an engine to ensure it gets there. The kinetic bombardment has a pre-programmed target and is simply too massive to be majorly deviated by wind or weather outside of standard calculation. Comparatively its like dropping a napkin off a roof and having it land in a cup compared to a piece of rebar,1년 전,0,

@ravinraven6913,"this is why I wish I had teachers that actually were trained in the field they were teaching. I had so many math teachers who just couldn't communicate sounds like Ben Stein or the math teacher who was taught in health, The English teacher taught in P.E. History teachers trained in...health.. Moving didn't help, one year the tests were in the next grade, then I move and then they were in the previous grade. So I missed out on Pre Algebra. And who would have guessed, if you don't know pre algebra, you won't pass algebra.   My IQ is 132, I can figure most stuff out by myself. I basically invented quantum physics in my head, I had no teachers to explain these things and Algebra, was a foreign language. And yet Im able to scientifically describe something in its entirety and help work out how its working or happening. I am smarter than most people I know, and yet, I can't pass college level algebra to get into fields that actually don't require math at all. Sure math is everything, but if an archaeologist is excavating a site, sure its x pounds per pressure over y distance. But I don't need algebra to make a grid. I don't need algebra to learn ancient egyptian history or law....  So I figure if I have to learn algebra to go to school, I may as well learn physics in my spare time. And so far, physics is easier to understand than Algebra. Because in physics, those equations represent something not just A5+0=35. It has to mean something, 1+1 doesn't need to since its not unknown. It becomes algebra when you define that 1 as something else...  So if 1 is wind resistance and 1 is weight....then it would be 1+1=1xsquared....or...is it 1+1=-1xsquared but if 1=1 and the second 1=100 than 1+1=101.  So now I want to be a doctor in archaeology physics and double masters in law and linguistics. but no, I need to learn algebra even for the stuff not to do with math, oh how our public education fails us.",1년 전(수정됨),2,

А сравнивать между собой решения разных разработчиков будут по массе - выиграет то решение, которое легче. Разумеется, оценка по весу производится только среди тех решений, которые выполнили главную задачу - сохранили в целости десяток яиц после падения на бетонный пол с высоты 2 метра.",1년 전,0,

@천체물리연구소,ㅎㅎ 나? Korean ㅎㅎ당신들은 헬륨 풍선이 하늘로 떠오르는 이유를 알긴하나요? 뭐 헬륨이 질소나 산소보다 가벼우니까  떠오른다고는 하지마세요. 헬륨풍선이 떠오르는 이유는 따로 있으니까요. 헬륨은 본시 산소보다 네배가 가벼워요 따라서 지구는 중력인 repulsive force가 헬륨을 하늘로 못 밀어냅니다. 즉 핼륨이  가벼우니까요. 밀어내지 못해요.  하지만 헬륨을 풍선에 넣고 압력이 만들어지면 지구의 중력은 헬륨 풍선을 하늘로 밀어내게 되는데 이유는 풍선 내에서 헬륨이 헬륨과 부닥트리면서 지구의 중력 가운데 하나인 repulsive force가 작동되기 때문이예요. 즉 헬륨 하나하나가 거대한 한개의 헬륨으로 인식이 되기 때문이예요.알겠죠? ㅎㅎ 번역해서 이해하길 바래요?,1년 전,0,

@ehur-s8u,"By programming the miss- I mean egg rocket to know where it is by knowing where it isn't. By using the programming and information of where it is and subtracting where it isn't you get a deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective Commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a Position where it isn't, And arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, Is now the position that it wasn't, And it follows that the position that It was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that It wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, The variation being the difference between Where the missile is, and where it wasn't.

@Harry_James_Potter, @rikripper5767  вот как раз законы физики говорят что предметы разного веса и разной формы падают одинаково - потому что земное притяжение одинаково на них влияет. Если сбросить с высоты одновременно булыжник и банку с кока колой - при разном весе и форме они приземлятся одновременно. Это давно проверено. Но вот с пёрышком другие законы - там от набегающего воздуха и сверх лёгкости - парусность меняется. А у булыжника нет такой парусности. Поэтому пока пёрышко будет преодолевать воздух - камень давно приземлится. Но человек и яйцо это всё же относительно физики одинаковые тела. У них нет парусности перьев чтобы приземлиться в разное время и с разной скоростью.,1년 전(수정됨),0,

@Dorecha,"Я занимаюсь конструированием русских боевых ракет и первая половина ролика была очень забавна для меня) Во первых вы допустили серьёзные ошибки в самом начале создания проекта. Стоит понимать что направление гражданской и военной (к которой ближе этот проект) космической инженерии, имеют огромные отличия.  Как например, конструкция направляющих не подходит для данной задачи.  1. Направляющие имеют слишком большой зазор, что недопустимо.  2. Они имеют некорректную форму.  3. Они делают слишком резкие повороты.   Вообще такой механизм сам по себе никогда бы не использовался для подобной задачи.   Ну и просто смешно смотреть как кто-то делает оружие, сам того не понимая. Хотя у нас в стране такой проект был бы вполне законным, если бы не имел боевой части.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

Draw with the power of thought. This is hardly possible since we have not yet learned how to read a person’s thoughts into a program code that would draw masterpieces contained in the human brain from ones and zeros. I am an artist, and I dream of someday drawing the perfect work that will match the whole picture in my head.  2. It is impossible to arrange the brightest fireworks at night, at a height almost reaching space. At the same time, so that this salute could depict a picture at least close in colors and shapes, for example, to Vangogh's painting ""Starry Night"".  I think these would be the most beautiful and beautiful things that could be created if it were possible.",2년 전,0,

@sentientdogma1206,Why does everything filmed in space have to have a fisheye lens. They really are trying to cover up whether the earth is flat or not. I’m starting to question that it is because of their vehement efforts to say it’s not. If it really isn’t why would they care so much and try and disprove it. No one has to tell me trees exist. If I heard someone say trees don’t exist I wouldn’t spend anytime trying to disprove them because it’s obvious to me. So if it’s so obvious then why would they try and disprove it. Also there’s no real footage of the earth m’s curvature. And how come every NASA employee has to bring up that they’re a “friend of science” it sounds like they’re trying to convince the public and themselves that they know facts. Really all that says to me is they’re professional hoaxters. “Trust the science!” Meanwhile trusting the science gets people harmed. I don’t trust these professional liars.,2년 전,0,

@alynjones9626,"I have a few questions, please.  Since the rocket is only using the power of gravity to accelerate, does that make the rockets terminal velocity Mach 1, as that is what you predict the speed of the rocket? (First design of rocket)  If the rocket is already traveling at Mach 1, why do you calculate the terminal velocity of the egg? Unless you know the egg will decelerate to its terminal velocity after being released from the rocket in just 300 ft? (First design, it shows you releasing the egg at speed, before the parachute slows down the decent)   Why do you only need to calculate the wind directions to account for drift, and not rotation of the earth underneath the balloon as it floats up? What is the force that keeps things suspended over that area on earth, while things float or hover in the air or space above said area? Why does the rotation of the earth not move under the floating object, just like a train would move under me if I jumped up while on said train?",2년 전,0,

@Interesting_Failure,"""First supersonic egg"" got me thinking. After a quick google I'm unsure if any whole eggs were present on Concorde flights, but I suspect not. They definitely served scrambled (and possibly deviled) eggs, but I would assume all eggs were sufficiently prepared prior to loading so as to not really qualify.  I did find that the Russians put fertilized quail eggs on multiple space flights to test the effects of space on their development; these would naturally have traveled much faster than Mach 1 to reach orbit, but the video specifies ""first chicken to lay an egg that will go faster than the speed of sound""  However, there were viable chicken eggs aboard the space shuttle Discovery that reached a top speed of around 7.7km/s (lower than escape velocity as it only ever went to orbit, but still well above the speed of sound in air, which is around 0.34km/s). So I'm sorry to say that the eggs involved in this video don't get to claim that PARTICULAR world record.  Of course, telling a former NASA engineer about the history of space flight feels a little like...well, teaching your grandmother to suck eggs, I suppose.  EDIT: I really hope the composer for Plants vs. Zombies knows their music ended up backing this video. The trajectory for that happening is almost as wild as the trajectory for the dang egg.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

But depending on the detail in your video and the composition of your team you could potentially run afoul of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Basically, as a US person you could be exporting technical information needed to make a ballistic/guided missile by featuring it in the video.

The boxes were then sealed shut and dropped from an airplane to the ground, (I don't know from what altitude).

In keeping with the idea of continued learning, I would like to offer one small correction in your language in the video, and I hope you take it as the constructive criticism it is intended to be.  Just after the 25 minute mark, you are speaking about what can be achieved by taking failures as an opportunity to learn, and when you say ""us humans"", it should actually be ""we humans"". Try saying the sentence ""By learning from your failures, coupled with a bit of tenacity, us humans can accomplish a feat as incredible as the world's smartest Martian robot."", but take the word humans out. ""By learning from your failures, coupled with a bit of tenacity, us can accomplish a feat ..."" should be ""By learning from your failures, coupled with a bit of tenacity, we can accomplish ..."".

We were only allowed to use straws and hot glue. Other than that, design away. My first thought was some type of Gyro-Copter but elected to go with a Glider instead. I learned ""more"" about CG (Center of Gravity), wing shape, and surface controls. I was big into paper airplanes growing up so I already taught myself some stuff. Well, when I got to school and revealed to the teacher my ""egg cradle,"" she was stoked! It had compressable landing skids and everything!  It could take up to two or three eggs and still have a shallow enough glide slope to land just fine.  It survived the few launches we sent it on and the teacher asked if she could keep it. I let her keep it and she said because of me she'll have to modify the rules of the experiment to either exclude such designs or allow for a separate class of contraption. I had fun and learned a lot but unfortunately school and I never got along so as opposed to being in the class of Mr. Rober and his friends, I've been a bum my whole life.",2년 전,0,

You'll use the numbers to determine your ETA and fuel requirements more than what altitude to fly at since the winds aren't much different at 40,000 feet than 45,000 feet, but the fuel burn on a jet is worse the lower you go.

@inmanmark," @howder0375  It's not that it can't ""break through"" the atmosphere. The reason that the balloon is rising is that it is less dense than the atmosphere around it. That means that it rises, despite the fact that there is a downward force (due to gravity). When it gets to a high enough altitude, the concentration of atmospheric molecules around it will mean that the atmosphere has the same density as the balloon itself. At that point, it will stop rising, but there is no barrier. To keep moving at that point, you would need another force to overcome gravity. As there is precious little atmosphere to create a reaction force against, rockets would be the only way to go - but even then, you are not breaking through anything - there's no surface tension or anything like that.",2년 전,3,

Yes, the type that lowers the payload by cables and fancy equipment looked cool, but the fact is a simple system that cost way less did the same thing.

@EliasHasle,"I doubt your original plan would work even if you could hit the matress, because: 1. The calculation of an egg's terminal velocity looked extremely sloppy with the units... (The result could be OK anyway, though.) 2. Unless the egg were dropped at large altitude, it could hit the ground even faster if the terminal velocity of the ""rocket"" were higher than that of the freefalling egg...  The beach ball was a great solution, with the padding material also serving as thermal insulation and the low density combined with large drag area efficiently limiting the speed and eliminating issues of drag heating (it takes less work to balance a low weight during the fall, and the heat from the work is dissipated over larger area and more time than with the ""rocket""). 👌🤓👍 You were kind of lucky that the rocket that was suspended above it did not puncture it on their way down, though... 😬",2년 전(수정됨),3,

Our goal was to design a vehicle that would return weather balloon instrumentation to a more easily recoverable location. One person on our team was advocating for the terminal guidance solution (guided missile), but we were pretty sure the FAA was never going to give us clearance on top of our suspicions that the deceleration forces would likely break the payloads. We ended up with a parafoil design, while the team from the year before did a blended wing body airplane design. This was back in 2007 when the electronics to do such things weren't so readily available and we had to pretty much design everything from scratch.",2년 전,5,

@alexstyborski1009," @arjungutta7762  getting (and then keeping) something in a stable orbit is something that takes many thousands of dollars due to the hardware and knowledge required. While most countries can send a satellite to space, only a few can deorbit something in a predictable manner. Hence the earlier part of the video where the main powers won't tell you how.",2년 전,13,
@adamkirsteins5646," @arjungutta7762   TLDR: its like dropping piece of lead from a hot air balloon vs firing one from a gun. One is all about the up and down of gravity, the other is going fast ""sideways"" and only needs gravity to ensure it comes in to contact with the ground.  To put something in to orbit (at the distance from earth that proposed orbital weapons would operate) you need to launch the payload on the correct angle at about 8km/s. A helium balloon cannot put anything in to orbit since the angle it rises is straight up. (Plus a lack of buoyancy as you leave the atmosphere behind and a tonne of other issues).  The vast majority of the kinetic energy of the impact doesn't really come from gravity, it comes from the rocket that got it up there to give it a massive lateral speed which causes it to smash in to the ground at a very low angle. The egg isn't ""propelled"" to earth by the balloon, it gets all its speed from gravity has ~0 lateral speed and drops directly down (highest angle).",2년 전,18,

@ianbates9320,"One of the main rules to weather balloons is that if it creates a hazard to a person or their property they are not allowed to test upon the balloon going to space. In this case Mark sent a balloon in a rural place somewhere in the western United States. Where he is is most likely an urban area with low aircraft congestion comparing it to Los Angeles or the East Coast. Second weather balloons are always tracked from radar to gps signals from the people that launched it. Anyone is allowed to launch a weather balloon as long as you take the neccesary precautions. In this case we know Rober took the precautions. He was very prepared especially when working with NASA workers! Third, weather balloons are tracked with SDR, a system that tracks anything in the air from Cargo planes to birds to nuclear weapons, flying in the air. Each weather balloon is REQUIRED to have a SDR transmitter that track weather balloons. They were also approved by the FAA because they have permits to fly over 12 lb (5.4 kg) total of payload NOT INCLUDING BALLOON. In this case they did not exceed a package weight/size ratio of three ounces per square inch. No weather balloon can be used to drop objects if only the radius of 50 miles of inhabitant over 300 peoples. This concludes why the FAA approved it! Thanks for listening to my TED talk!🫡",2년 전,0,

Technically, objects in low-Earth orbit are at an altitude of between 160 to 2,000 km (99 to 1200 mi) above the Earth’s surface. Any object below this altitude will begin to suffer from orbital decay and will rapidly descend into the atmosphere, either burning up or crashing on the surface.

This is used because at an altitude of about 100 km (62 mi), as Theodore von Kármán calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself.[8][9]""""  This next part might be what you are confusing as America designating space.

In all my launches I never once was able to retrieve my balloon or radiosonde, until that very, very lucky day in Antarctica. The winds were perfect that resulted in the balloon and radiosonde being found less than 7 miles from the launch site on the snow/ice covered landscape.

@Alan_Hans__,To be accurate you weren't the first to have an egg go supersonic. There is probably dozens if not hundreds of female pilots who have eggs who have gone supersonic. As far as as chicken eggs go if there was ever any fresh eggs on the Concorde then they would have potentially been the first chicken eggs to go supersonic. The first documented chicken eggs to go supersonic would probably be the 12 on the 1986 Challenger flight. There were fowl eggs in space in 1979 but they were quail.,2년 전,0,

I know Crunch labs is for 8-12+ and can be used for adults to learn things too. But thought it would be cool if there was something that was more orientated towards teens to adults where it’s a bit more complex and dives into more electrical or programming side while still having the fun and exciting feel like crunch labs while still learning the basics and more!  Edit: I just noticed it sounded like I was mostly talking about only digital but was thinking of a more hands on and building while having programming and electronics.,2년 전(수정됨),4,

@daltonduree,Possible solution to the controls. You are just guiding by drag as there is no lift generated by those wings. Something that could collect air and channel it into the middle of the tube that would have to go through a jet nozzle similar to a jet ski. That way you might be able to generate enough pressure to control it.,2년 전,0,

@psieonic,"I'm actually glad the first attempt at building a precision style rocket got scrapped.  Not just because of the fact it was basically designing a missile.  I feel like it's actually a bigger accomplishment to create a solution that was self-contained.  Precision dropping an egg onto a mattress, the mattress did all the work protecting the egg, with a separate delivery vehicle.  In the end, the delivery vehicle also protecting the egg was a much bigger achievement, and truer to the Egg Drop Challenge's core ideology.  Build something that can safely land an egg anywhere, not somewhere specific.  Small concern, just how hot did that egg get?  If the egg started to cook, it was no longer raw by the time it made touch down.",2년 전,1,
