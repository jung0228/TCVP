@kperry5000,"I once saw an interesting thing happen to a presidential motorcade. After the regular civilian traffic resumed behind it, a woman pulled out of a gas station and accidentally hit another civilian car. All of a sudden all traffic stopped and it was clear these were not all civilian cars, they were secretly still part of the motorcade. The woman's vehicle was instantly surrounded by about a dozen or more ""civilian"" cars with full tactical police getting out with automatic weapons. Then a bunch of plain-clothes people who looked like spectators standing on the street were on walkie talkies and it was clear even many of the plain-clothes public  ""spectators"" were actually part of it as well. Once they realised this was just an honest traffic accident and not an attempt on the president they sped off to remerge with the traffic following the motorcade. Poor woman, it's bad enough getting in a traffic accident, but to then have your car instantly surrounded by police with automatic weapons suspecting your trying to assassinate the president.  Eventually they let her go but I'm sure she had quite a story to tell her friends later that day. So yea, there's more to presidential motorcades than what's in this video.",2년 전(수정됨),6,

@weukk," @joedatius  okay so your clearly an American national trying to protect your country’s pride. I get it man whatever, let’s talk first about wealth, majority of America’s money goes to the government where it is stored for government funding, such as military, and government. The people of America are actual some of the poorest in the west, A little saying I like to say is “America is just a third world country masked by its city’s”. Majority of lower class people struggle to even put food on the table, now that’s something not a lot of other country’s can say. Now let’s talk about military power, the American military is a very good one. However is pales in comparison to that of Russia and chinas military, as well as North Korea. Most of America’s enemy country’s far out weigh it in wealth and military power, for example, if America went to war with China, and only China, then America would lose in every scenario. So yes America has a good military, but compared to other military powers it’s pretty shit. Then you want to discuss government, I mean do you really want to talk about your government when the last president is Trump and the one now is Biden 😂 don’t even get me started on the American governments greed, I could go on about it’s healthcare but we would be here for weeks. Not to mention the American tax system is completely whack. So if you want to talk about how great America is just read a few news articles, it’s not all “god bless America” if you do your research. The movies just make it out to be the most wonderful place on earth when in reality it is hell for poor people, even Russia has a better homelessness care plan than America. so much for “the American dream” hey?",3년 전,0,
@thundurr," @weukk  Dude you're just trolling stop it, the USA is ranked 1st in the world for military power and it's citizens are the richest in the west, the US beats out China and Russia in literally 90% of military scenarios.  The USA has the biggest navy, air-force and spends more on military than Russia, China and Europe combined, the USA's navy has more aircraft than Russia and China's airforce alone...  The USA spends nearly the entire Russian GDP on military a YEAR",3년 전,0,
@weukk," @thundurr  bro I ain’t trolling, the US citizens maybe the richest in the west but that’s not to say that the west isn’t already poor as it is, so them being the richest in the west is just being ordinary in other countries. I agree that Americans have the biggest military because almost all of their budget goes into it, but that’s where majority of the budget goes, so people who are struggling to get by have to live on the streets so more aircraft can fly and ships set sail, at the end of the day it comes down to, “should my citizens be happy or should I have a good military” and America has made their stand point pretty clear. As far as America as a whole being the best single military power with the allied forces of Russia and China and all those north Asian regions who will almost definitely team up against them if something were to happen, once again America can’t handle all their heat. I’m not saying this to support Russia, China or North Korea at all, in fact I think America needs to step up its game if it wants to have a chance against these forces. So yeah I ain’t trolling at all.",3년 전,0,

While time effective is achieving the targeted amount of time without limitation on the amount of input, as long as the target is achieved as expecyed.   This, wasting millions of dollars to get 20 miles point A to point B proven that this was not time efficient because of the excessive waste of energy, money, and other resources.

There are plenty of experts in any area of governmental matters who can take over. Only the idiots will care about the “figurehead.”  And I’m talking about everyday people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, or close to it, where they don’t have even $1K in savings. I was asking what THEY’D notice to be different logistically.  All you need is competent people to do their jobs. Sometimes (in politics, MANY times), the wrong people are put into office, as they aren’t qualified for their position.  There have been at least a few times in presidential history, where the prez was incapacitated, and their wife or someone else took over, temporarily. The nation only found out retrospectively. Again, any competent person for the job can take over, and in our present situation, it’s better that that occurs,",5년 전,0,

It’s ok to admit that you don’t know, but just letting you know that you’re not making a very cogent argument.)  Regarding not being able to fake a death, ever heard of DEEP FAKES?  If people have valuable knowledge and skills to offer, and can present them in the form of goods or services, they can always make money again. It happens everyday, all around the globe. LOTS of people have had to start over, and it’s worth a useless (actually, worse than useless, as he’s created lots of pain & destruction) fucktard dying.

Of course, there's also debt, which comes from 3 sources: private investors, other countries (some of which are deeply in debt themselves, like Japan) and even other US federal gov't agencies (such as the Social Security Trust Fund). IIRC, the percentage that comes from only domestic sources (US gov't agencies and American investors) is about 60%. Of course, the US gov't also sells things, but that isn't terribly significant, compared to the whole budget - a few tens of billions of dollars at most. If we only consider the part of the budget that came directly from taxpayers in the same year that the gov't spent that money, than $350 million would be closer to 0.01% of the whole US annual federal budget - i.e., one ""basis point"" - still a rather insignificant amount, relatively speaking.",2년 전,0,
@jeffbenton6183," @edp-xo1on  It was when I wrote that 2 years ago (if by ""it isn't"" you mean to refer to the statement ""$350 million is 0.00875% of the US budget""). If you look at how much money the US federal gov't spent in the year 2019 and then look at how much it spent in the year 2020, then you could say that the US federal gov't spends approximately $4 trillion dollars each year (in FY2020 dollars). 0.00875% - that is, 0.0000875 - of 4 trillion is 350 million. The figure is rather different now, due to inflation pandemic-era spending and the like, but my statement was current when I first wrote it.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Fr tho, the main problem with this system is not someone finding out on the spot, but someone finding out beforehand, namely from hacks, leaks, tipoffs, and other cyber security problems.  If someone, maybe someone inside the whitehouse (idk), someone hacking into president files, or someone who even just predicted beforehand where the president is going finds out, then the president is in serious trouble.  Now not only is someone after him, but now he has litteraly almost no security, which means that he is seriously in trouble.  Since he lacks all the security and guards, it would be way easier to attack him, which makes this system, although it may seem good, rather risky and reckless.",5년 전,67,

Honestly, should anything happen to a sitting president while in the motorcade, I’ll be sending anyone I can think of to this video. Again, it has nothing to do with who’s in office, this is a direct exposure of security measures in place to protect whoever is in charge of this country at any time. I’m sure protection measures will be updated with time but this amount of info is insane in my eyes. The fact that you’ve put so much research energy into what the antenna are on which truck of the motorcade (signal jamming) is crazy. It’s just another small piece of info someone would want to learn if they wanted to stop the cars and kill the commander in chief.

Compare to US$156K per hour flight cost. 🤷‍♀️ I am an auditor in one of the big four accounting firm and by just looking at the figure, we can immediately say it is overpriced and US citizens shoulder this unreasonable cost instead of putting it into health insurance to help the lower-middle class families or the people with pre-existing condition.

The US also flies all the tanks and transport vehicles over on cargo planes...   the waste in fuel and cost is astronomically absurd.

That's impossible on a President's salary so it's clear America was HIS piggy bank. The fact remains that extra security was needed for Hussein's yearly Christmas trips to Hawaii and cost taxpayers BILLIONS. Btw if it weren't for the hysterical, violent leftists making death threats to POTUS he wouldn't need all the security. No one threatened Obama's life. The level of your your hypocrisy is astounding.

I have many international friends and acquaintances and in my travels, I've never heard so much applaud from most that it's sounding like an echo when anyone is in ear reach if they think I'm an American. Fortunately the majority of American citizens can see what a great leader he is and that he doesn't speak smart talk, making grand promises with no intention to keeping their word, instead he speaks in a language not polished but with a truthfulness and with not so much caring what the detractors say, his tremendous results are recognised by millions of people around the world and in your country who have the intelligence to see past his often unpolished remarks and statements enough to see and witness the dedication and strength emanating from this man who is motivated by doing his best for not only Americans but for all and everyone who can only benefit from such a strong and steadfast leader.

@sirapple589,"Admiral Ackbar’s adopted son   I’m going to need a source on women’s rights improving “dramatically” as soon as Islam arrived in Arabia.  At what point did I say that atheists didn’t kill people? There certainly have been a few instances of atheists killing the religious, monsters exist in each and every facet of life.  Do you know what has killed more humans than anything else? Religion, if someone follows a religion than it’s easy to convince them that killing those that don’t believe is okay.  Religion IS brainwashing, every facet of our lives from the day we are born is brainwashing.  It’s how we learn about our world.  I stand for equal rights for all, regardless of gender or race. Islam does not.  Why is it that in countries where Islam is the ruling doctrine women are treated horribly? Remember how it was a big deal that women in Saudi Arabia can drive now? All human beings are equal, no matter what some book may say, believing in something does not make you a better person than someone that doesn’t believe.  Show me one country in the world where honour-killings are a thing that isn’t Islamic.  I was raised Christian, I eventually developed a mindset of logic and fact, this new mindset started poking holes into what I had been taught. I eventually gave up Christianity and became an atheist.  My nan is the most devout Christian I have ever met, I still talk to her and see her often even after she became aware that I became atheistic.  Islam does not work like that, Islam works like a cult.  If you leave Islam, you can be killed for it, look at Sudan they literally have the death penalty for the “crime” of leaving Islam. Show me one Christian country with that type of punishment for leaving Christianity.  Even if you are not killed, you will be socially cut off, like a dead branch from a tree.

@Free-g8r,I think it's for when they're moving the limos around when they're empty. Like in the Manhattan example the limos have to go to the heliport earlier so they can be waiting to take president from there to UN. So I'm guessing the drivers pay the tolls when they're driving the limo from the airport to the heliport.  Even if they never pay tolls the window would still be needed whenever the limo is accessing a secure location and the driver needs to be identified. But I'd be surprised if it's ever used when the president is in the car.,5년 전,21,

@tomekstec981,"@Dlox Exactly, and thats just one of the options.

Black budget programs have insane funding. The president has top secret clearance, sure, but there are 4 levels of clearance above that - even goes up to cosmic. So there are people who actually know the US capabilities, and can do things go without the president knowing with ultimate secret technologies. And if you start looking at this..then you also have to look at Russia's secret technology. Many people think Russia has nothing besides nuclear weapons, but that's an extra strength. They manipulate countries through financing and psychological warfare, while the US goes in with military might. Which one is more powerful? You could argue psychological warfare (I'm sure the US does things with this also). And then there are people who control mk ultra soldiers etc",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@shwjrmrk7619,Behalf of these stupid Americans making us look bad Sorry these 2 saying your country sucks is wrong but I don't think you should hate America if you have never lived there and the guy who said all Americans are the same don't generalize people thats just being a douche...,6년 전,0,
@Albanez39," @shwjrmrk7619  They are not the same, but they all have a specific state of mind. As if there were a curtain blocking the mind...  You are people like everyone else, your country is beautiful and you have given birth to some of the greatest minds (and inventions) in history. But your government has been deceiving and enslaving you the last century or so. I've known lots of Americans and I can confirm that a large sum of them are ""brainwashed"" What I mean is, they have a very dangerous form of pride, spoiled personalities, pretentious lifestyles, blissful ignorance...   I know there are thousands of smart, educated and open minded individuals there, but the majority of the population leads Europe and the rest of the world to think badly of you guys...  I hope one day you will be able to achieve free universal healthcare and education. I hope you rise and protest against the corporations that control the government and against the gov's agencies that control the people. I hope you stop sending troops all over the world and pressuring unstable nations to start proxy wars. I hope you start ignoring dumb celebrities and TV altogether...  And I seriously hope you start installing bidets in your bathrooms and wash your asses accordingly. I'm not joking or insulting you, but I can't believe how people wipe and go by their day with dried shit between their buttocks...",6년 전,0,
@Albanez39," @kiDkiDkiD12  It's pretty obvious you're a 12 year old ""kiD"".   America is a the result of centuries of European colonization; a nation built on the Native American genocide and African slavery. Some of the greatest minds in history were born in the United States, there's no denying that.   I'm don't hate ""Americans"", they are just people; I hate your government, it's agencies and all the corporate assholes that have destroyed your beautiful country. Your political system was built and is maintained for the sole purpose of aiding and supporting the wealthy and powerful. The masses are homeless, they can barely pay for food, they keep hoping for the ""American Dream"", without realizing that it will always be a dream. Few are those that had the opportunity to invent something new and become billionaires, and they have been enslaved by their own money and companies nowadays (Jeff Bezos).   I don't believe NASA really sent people to the moon. Everything went from numerous disasters coming one after the other, to a successful trip to the moon and back. Strangely enough, just one year after the 2001: A Space Odyssey came out, we could see Neil and Buzz ""walk"" on the moon. The original footage has been ""deleted"" forever, so we can't analyze it for manipulation. The footage has been recorded on Earth and then slowed down by approx. 2x to create the illusion of Moon gravity. All the astronauts and engineers that took part in the Apollo missions refuse to talk to media and documentarians, frequently snapping and attacking the camera. The suspension cords and CGI effects are pretty obvious in the ISS videos...other videos taken during space walks show air bubbles, clearly suggesting that they were taken underwater. Before you ask: NO, Earth is not flat. It has been proved centuries ago with minimal equipment, but I don't believe for a second that NASA was able to get us out of the atmosphere.   The Internet was invented for the military, and they never planned to make it available to civilians. The same happened with TOR, cryptography and other software-centered solutions that could guarantee our privacy. Thank ""god"" for all the hackers and whistleblowers that have revealed what the NSA and CIA are capable of, while creating ways to mitigate their malevolent practices.   Youtube was created by three engineers; an American, a Taiwanese and a German-Bengladeshi. Before Youtube were born, Vimeo and DailyMotion had already gone online. If it were not for Google, Youtube would have never gained attention and be what it is today. While Google was created by an American Jew and a Russian; and is momentarily being led by an Indian (Tamil) and an Englishman. Diversity is one of the greatest things in the US. Immigrants are what made your country great, and you should be happy to welcome even more..but your current leader is a misogynist, Islamophobe, Xenophobe, Homophobe, racist asshole!   The US has the most advanced military in the world, without any doubt. But it's behind on most other fields...  It's the not the ""richest"" country per capita (GDP) and it's surely not the most developed (HDI). Socially, it's the most underdeveloped in the ""free world"". You gloat about the art your nation produces, but art cannot be produced, it's created. Hence, your perverted and violent music and your action-fueled and dumb comedic films are not art. They are shows, produced to make a profit, by the corporations that own your life.   My country is poor, we are incredibly negligent and never really invested in the good things like art, society, education and health. But I prefer these corrupt politicians to an incredibly organized hierarchical government that gives 60% of it's entire profit to army, navy and air force. You might have the latest and most advanced medical apparatuses, but you have to sell your house to pay for a few tests and a simple surgery. You might have incredibly rated universities, that demand a fortune to offer you education. Most students will finish paying their student loans after getting married and having at least one child. While the elementary and high schools are among the worst you can find in the west. Schools in the poorest neighbourhoods are the least funded, and they are mainly frequented by young criminals. I'm not surprised you have metal detectors and police officers at every entry. American teenagers are more worried about popularity and bullies than actual education...not to mention smartphones and social networks that have aggravated all these issues.   Should I talk about school shootings, the ""war on drugs"", racism, open carry, homelessness, racism, prisons & crime ??? I don't think so, you probably stopped reading after the second paragraph.   When the US makes healthcare and education universally free, when you change gun laws and only sell to hunters and people in danger, when you decriminalize all psychoactive substances and start educating teenagers about them, when you stop funding proxy wars and committing genocides, when you charge every hate crime and educating people on rape, abuse, death, organized crime, when you stop torturing prisoners and start building prisons that are meant to rehabilitate instead of punishing, when you finally abolish capital punishment....I will finally reconsider all of the aforementioned issues and maybe even visit the US.

@deepdive1338," @Albanez39  I think deep down you may believe yourself to be an intelligent and highly tolerable person but you are simply put stupid, bigoted and ignorant. First of all let's get something out of the way, the US healthcare isn't bad, we are not a socialist country, at the end of the day national healthcare is assurrance, you pay the government and they assure your health. Secondly, the National average tax is about 10% in US, the country doesn't take much from you and you don't take much from the government, this is why we don't have free college tuition or free national healthcare except for the poor. 3rd US GDP per capita is one of the highest in world(currently resting at number 7). GDP per capiga by the way is income per family, so your assertation that most people are homeless is completely wrong and ignorant. The U.S. is the most technologically advanced nation in the world and most diverse and least racist nation believe it or not. No the US didn't fake the moon landing, I'm not even going to say anything because any person with a proper brain wouldn't think it was faked. Say what you say about our politics but we are fine, unlike other countries we actually have 2 opposing parties which is a good thing because it introduces intectuall discourse.",6년 전,0,
@Albanez39," @deepdive1338  I'm sorry if you got offended; I'm denouncing your government, not your people. I understand your point, but you should read a little more about other countries before putting your own in a pedestal. For example, in France, they pay just a little more taxes that you do in the US...meanwhile, they have free universal healthcare, tuition, food in elementary and middle schools and lots of other services at no cost.   I lost my faith in you after you mentioned socialism. Of course your country is not socialist, it's a capitalist and elitist authoritarian government. Socialism doesn't really exist in practice; some of it's ideas can be and have been applied to real world nations, but overall, it's pure utopia...just like communism, anarchy and democracy. Don't be surprised...   I never said that most people are homeless, that is just stupid. But the US, has one of the highest (if not the highest) percentage of homeless individuals in the ""western world""...it also has the highest percentage of convicts in the ""western world""; It has the highest percentage of homicide in the ""western world"" and also the highest percentage of suicide by firearm in the entire world. Instead of solving the problems you have right there at home, you go to such great lengths to ""solve"" problems in other countries. The US is single-handedly responsible of all the major wars that have taken place the last 80 years; you have spent so much money funding terrorism, genocide, dictatorships and so on and so forth...  America has given birth to some of the most brilliant minds in human history, which have invented and created lots of important gadgets and tools and ideas that we still use today. America is without a doubt, the most technologically advance nation in regards to weapons of mass destruction, firearms, combat planes and other military applications. While the consumer side of technology is dominated by Japan, South Korea and lately, China.   I just hope you get rid of all the rednecks and hillbillies, the nationalists and the fascists that you so proudly support and defend. Since you are speaking so aggressively about your country's achievements even without having enough knowledge about them, successfully classifies you as a nationalist. Meanwhile, I think it's really sad how such a great country can be completely destroyed and deceived by it's government and past politicians. It's a country made by immigrants, for the immigrants...while, even nowadays, immigrant are being harassed and killed and arrested and deported...just for being immigrants.   I'm not very eager to continue this argument further, but I'd like to ask you a question. Are you living the American Dream? What do you live for? What does really matter in life?   From my point of view, most Americans have been fooled by this dreamy promise of wealth and freedom. Those are the two last things the mundane middle class American will ever have. Be skeptical of your government and question everything. Your country is being held hostage by huge corporation that rule and decide every step of your life. If what you seek in life consists of a job that pays you enough to afford taxes and food, I feel sorry for you, even if you are achieving most of what you want.   In regards to the Moon landing, I'm not going to argue with you. There's no point in talking about it if you have decided that it's true. If you are satisfied by believing in such a lie, be my guest. My advice is simple. Read more science and less propaganda.   EDIT: I'll throw you another ""conspiracy"" to think about. You are conscious about what happened in New York on 11/9, right? You are aware of the fact that the government knew what was going to happen, and actually prepared for the attack? Just not in the way it should have...but the opposite.",6년 전,0,
@deepdive1338," @Albanez39  it's fun how you say you are not going to say more and then go on for 3 more long paragraphs. Umm lets see who reads propaganda here, you are firm in your belief that the moon landing was fake and that that the moon landing is a part of a government conspiracy that US has an excuse to go to the middle east(as if it needs one). You are aware that school up to college is free, including meals right? You are aware of Obama care right? First of all define the western world? And no socialism isn't just a utopian fantasy, socialism is a real political practice that's currently in use in most European(western) countries where you pay about 50% or higher income to government and in turn the government provides you with a safety net, including universal health care. Please provide actually facts. I don't think you understand statistics at all. You can't just claim that the ""US has the amount of crime in the western world"" Because that whole statement is filled with unprecedented factors that you are not taking into account. And no the US is more technologically advanced in all fields except perhaps Japan.",6년 전,0,
@deepdive1338," @Albanez39  there's no clear definition of the American dream but yes I immigrated from Rwanda and came to be a lot happier here. And yes I am nationalistic, as you should be, unless you don't believe your country to be good enough.  US is the most faithful country when it comes to immigrant policies. I don't think you could go netherlands or china as a black African immigrant and hope to have a semi decent life. Should I be against a job that pays me enough? Again the US government doesn't take much from you, and you don't expect much from them. That's how capitalism works. In a socialist country, you can never become better, you are always stuck where you are.

@paulw.woodring7304,"The description of the delay in regular traffic in the DC area for a Presidential motorcade may be a little off depending on the specific circumstances.  In January of 2001, Bill Clinton made a trip from the White House to Ft. Myer, VA (behind Arlington Cemetery) for a farewell ceremony at the end of his Presidency.  At the time, I was a locomotive engineer trainee for CSX and was on my way to Richmond, VA from Baltimore, MD.  We were told by the dispatcher that we would be held short of Control Point ""Virginia"", where the CSX freight line around DC joins the Amtrak line to/from Washington Union Station, located where the I-395 branch under the Mall, joins the main expressway through SE/SW DC to cross the 14th St. bridge to Virginia, and we needed to stay clear of the railroad overpass over I-395 until the Presidential motorcade had cleared.  This was not a brief delay.  I made sure we pulled the lead locomotive up as close to the overpass as possible to get a good view of the motorcade.  It was a good 15-20 minutes from the time that the DC police shut down I-395 before the POTUS motorcade emerged from the Mall tunnel and made the turn onto I-395 South.  When the two Suburbans came by behind the limos, there were at least 6-8 long gun barrels sticking up from each of them in a very deliberate show of force.",6년 전,0,

They also will place snipers on numerous buildings along the route.  The window going down on the driver side of the limo isn't really for tolls. That was based on an anecdote a former driver said when they drove through a very rural area and had to pay a few cents for a toll booth. The real reason is so the driver can communicate and pass tangible items between himself and the secret service agents when they are walking alongside the limo.  Other facts are the limo's tires (which are lined with kevlar) are filled with a gel-like substance (instead of air) so if shot, they don't blow out. Also, the rims are extended inside the tires so they can drive at highway speeds for several miles if a tire loses pressure.",6년 전,1.6천,

I saw the snipers on top of buildings and the roped off roads where they welded the manhole covers and mailboxes all the time. The reason I lived in DC (1998-2003) was because my father was a special agent for the department of justice. He was friends with many secret service agents and would tell me about non-classified secrets that weren't common knowledge. Like for instance the front lawn of the white house has incredibly powerful lights that come out of the ground to blind intruders in-case they try to rush the front door over the lawn. He also called me and my mom during the 9/11 attacks and was able to tell us to get out of the city because it was an attack not some plane accident.

The motorcades are a big pain in the ass for anyone by the route. There is no preparing for it because they keep the specifics secret as long as possible to prevent any dangerous people from planning an ambush. They only notify the public of the the specific day and the general blocks that will be blocked off, but not the specific streets or route.  After a while you start to know when a convey is getting prepared because a week or so before an announcement there will be black secret service trucks scouting out nearby streets to plan out various routes and check out the area.",6년 전,8,

@Mikefeher1313,"Sahil Patel listen kiddo, let me explain this to you. Income tax is paid on what someone makes before any taxes. 25-35% of what someone makes WILL ALWAYS BE MORE THAN 6-8% of what they spend on items. 25-35% pre tax is much more then 8% after tax. Get it? Nobody will spend more than they make and certainly not enough to make up that %. Ex. Someone makes 100k spends 30k on taxes. Say they now only have  70k and they spend it all on items and are taxes 8%. So thats 30,000 vs 5,600. Which is more?",6년 전,5,
@Sahil-iu1ce,"​ @Mikefeher1313  You are right. I get it now. The Sales Tax paid on net Income will always be less than the Income tax paid on my total income (Provided the Sales tax percentage is not greater than income tax percentage). I am not sure about your country but it is possible in mine. Someone earning Rs. 3,50,000 in India would be paying Rs. 5000 as income tax. Sales Tax in our country is currently divided into 5 brackets (0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28%). It is highly likely that this person would be paying way more Sales Tax than Income Tax.

When elected by the American people, US presidents are afforded protection for life even when not in office until they leave this earth. Most prime ministers are stripped off their official protections once they leave office especially in Western Europe. They go back to their daily lives as MPs or private citizens. They may get a car detail but it’s for official engagements only. How long can that continue with all the global treats we face today especially at home nowadays?

Also, I said we should have free healthcare, I did not mention the poor. I don't know why you brought it out of nowhere; healthcare and poverty were not related in my statement.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@de_stroyed,"Basically, you're telling me the RICHEST country on earth is too poor to afford for free healthcare? Congress recently approved a $80 Billion dollar budget increase on the military.  The U.S military spending has now reached: $824.6 billion.  You want more facts? Alright. We are currently spending $3.4 trillion on healthcare right now.  Free healthcare would be at around $1.4-2 trillion in spending. That's a saving of $2-1.4 trillion/a year.   Don't you see? The U.S would SAVE money; not lose.

It’d be difficult to even get into a position like that in the first place. There are cameras all over Washington and tons of Secret Service members that patrol without uniforms. Planning a coordinated assault would be hard to do with the Secret Service looking specifically for signs of that stuff. Not to mention the possibility of overwatch units or the ID car detecting you before you get close. You’d also could potentially get spotted by the Route car or the Pilot car.

Look at what the death of JFK meant for an entire generation, many of whom died in Vietnam, So yes, a president's life is more valuable than anybody else's.  Assasinations of political figures have huge consequences. The assasination of Franz Ferdinand was responsible for World War I.

@PhoenixMaster123,"alnoso, you mad. if the queen dies it is a lot worse than the pm dying. the country goes into a one week long mourning and nothing funny can be shown on tv. And the political status of the world will be a lot worse than the pm dying. bearing in mind that like 80% of the worlds leaders have not seen England without the queen as queen",7년 전,1,
@alnoso,"""the country goes into a week long mourning and nothing funny can be shown on tv"" oh boo fucking hoo. the queen passes no laws and has no real veto powers of any sort either. the PM is the leader of the state, the queen is just a rich old woman. it won't even end the royal family or anything, there's plenty of heirs. they probably wouldn't even change the money.  queen dies: people cry on TV, Prince Charles becomes ceremonial king, nothing changes. PM dies: people cry on TV, the entire political climate gets suspended for entire weeks, even months, as there is no real leader to the country, then the governing party and them alone choose a new PM. this is not gonna be a PM anybody voted for, or one anybody necessarily wants. the queen can't even make herself PM or something, it's the party who leads the country",7년 전,0,

Its apparently rather exhilarating as the motorcade drives at high speed and in tight formation with the clearing vehicles drive  even faster by you to drive back to the front of the motorcade.  If memory serves during certain stretches they were traveling 80 mph with the clearing vehicles whizzing by at 100 mph+",8년 전,6,

@taz874,id argue otherwise. the president is a man who is rather powerful. you realise if the president was killed it could have quite a huge effect on the economy and where the country is heading especially considering that power will be transferring to the vice president without the usual transition period one has to prepare for presidency(eg from election night until inauguration day). its not about what the president is worth but what affects would his death have on the country like the economy. so in order to avoid disruption to the way the country is run its a price worth paying to protect the president,8년 전(수정됨),7,

One of these pieces is actually a howitzer but with all sorts of stuff welded to it to make it seem like just another of your shitty modern art pieces, no one will care. Then when the day comes you fire a couple of shells at the event. If you know your shit and make even a close hit the target is toast. The explosive power of a howitzer shell is just huge, even the armored car would be obliterated.

I was just disappointed to see how easy it can be to cause any harm to the US president, the US is top superpowers or one of them and the most influential in so many ways, and specially powerful. A 'prankster/youtuber' actually did a challenge which has become a trend in YouTube which is the 'overnight' challenge. In a few words, it consists in staying in peculiar places overnight. Such as shopping malls or restaurants, the entire thing is in most cases obviously illegal. This 'youtuber' individual decided to do the previously described challenge...

@kuyaleinad4195,"To all those saying about how your Prime Minister only rides a bike, you have to understand the power of a Prime Minister compared to a President.  A President has more power in a government so losing the president will totally disrupt the Government as a whole.  A Prime Minister has absolutely no power since power is in Parliament itself. Losing the Prime Minister just means that the leader of the most powerful political party just died and they can easily replace the prime minister. Therefore, there's little to no incentive to kill the prime minister. Parliament can actually replace the prime minister as well without public consent since the public voted for the political party and not the prime minister.  Just look at the UK. David Cameron resigned and was just easily replaced by Teresa May without disrupting the functioning of the Government.",8년 전,0,

@IWillSendMyHunters,Beel Almost all the times that Trump has gone somewhere it's been to meet a world leader or political. And he makes up for it for saving about 20 million on the F-15 Fighter Jets that he saved.,8년 전,4,
@seigeengine,"@Josh McDaniels So are you talking about F-15s or F-35s, cause if you don't know what you're talking about that badly, you should probably not be having opinions about issues as complex as politics to begin with.  I can't find any info on Trump saving anything on F-15s, and it would make more sense for you to be talking about F-35s. Trump involved himself in negotiations over some F-35s, and those negotiations resulted in a hypothetical savings, but those negotiations were already happening, and any savings are theoretical at present. Any component of the savings related to Trump are hard to demonstrate. In my opinion, Trump basically swooped in just so he could claim to have saved tax payer's money entirely to make himself look good.  That said, I also have no idea where you're getting $20M from. The total savings are far in excess of that over previous round of acquisitions. The per-unit cost reduction is an order of magnitude less than that.  Trump is the president. Everything he does is political, and he always has political staff around him. Congrats on that say-nothing defense of his egregious and hypocritical travel expenses.",8년 전,5,
@seigeengine,"@Josh McDaniels Threes aren't next to ones, so it's not likely to be a typo. You just legitimately did not know what they were called off-hand.  Fox News? Jesus fuck.  Yes, it also mentions a specific reduction of 7.3%. If you remember your basic math, that means about $7.5M in savings per aircraft, not $20M. Even that is a bit high, as other sources I read suggested that this reduction was only on a certain set of the aircraft, and there were lesser reductions elsewhere.  And even that article mentioned that the price decrease was in line with what was expected given the declining costs per unit over time, suggesting that, if anything, Trump's contribution was putting more pressure on Lockheed Martin to renegotiate quickly, with all their praising bullshit language being a clear attempt to get this shit over with after Trump's bully tactics.  So congrats, you've managed to supply a source that not only reveals your complete ignorance of the subject, but actually refutes the claim you intended it to support. 10/10, this is the level of stupid that tells us why the world is stuck with President Nuclear Dorito.",8년 전,2,

Couple of corrections to your video: 1. when traveling in DC, the motorcycles do not travel in a V formation. Motorcycles and regular police vehicles block all intersections along the route about 10 minutes prior to the departure of POTUS. They can't do this in one sweep because they always have to reroute traffic and get remaining vehicles out of the road. 2. The second limo is not really a decoy - it is simply a backup. POTUS is always in the second limo and it's not a secret. I have only seen them switch it up one time in five years. The Beast is bomb proof so they don't really care if you know which one he's in. People like to claim that you can never know which one he's in simply because they are not used to seeing it and it sounds plausible.",8년 전,8,

@Col_Crunch,"""Marine One is the call sign of any helicopter that the president it on"" - No it is the call sign of any MARINE AIRCRAFT that the president it on. The same with Air Force One, that is any USAF aircraft carrying the president. This applies to all branches of the armed forces. A civilian aircraft carrying the president would be Executive One.  For anyone wondering, the designation of the modified 747s is VC-25A.  Also, I doubt they are using a C5 to get helicopters to NY, more than likely they send a few a head of time. Even with the max of needing 5 aircraft to move the president, HMX-1 could send 5+ aircraft to NY ahead of time (no C-5) and still be able to support the president in DC. (The trip is only 200 miles, which the VH-60 and VH-3D could easily do). So that 150,000 dollar trip is probably closer to $100,000.",8년 전,0,

The various call signs actually don't denote the method of travel, but rather the branch of the military responsible for the transportation at the time. The air force operates several helicopters for various reasons but should the president get on any of them, they immediately become air force one. The Marines operate both planes and helicopters, and though the helicopters are usually used, if the president were to step on any marine plane, it would become marine one. The army operates many helicopters and a few planes, and while normally they aren't tasked with transporting the president, the same rules apply. The same goes for the navy as well. even the coast guard. If the presidents ship goes down, the coast guard helicopter that fishes him out of the drink becomes coast guard one.

And it is arguably the safest place for a president in case of emergency as the US air force can guarantee air superiority and along with anti missile defenses can stop a missile attack.  Nuclear bunker busters can destroy shelters so arguably staying in the Air is the safest place for an american president.

And lets not forget midair refueling capability.  In the small space of a 737, do you honestly believe there'd be enough room to include: Secure communications chamber, infirmary, kitchen, a private bedroom, press chamber, and this isn't even taking into account passengers.  the VC-25 is not just for transporting the president, but its to serve as a mobile command center as well, as a result, it needs all the security and defenses that are in the White House.",8년 전,1,

@russellsmith88,"Jesus Gonzalez Well obviously it's not a black and white situation, as every country is different. Being that the President of Nicaragua was a former guerrilla, it makes sense that he would need protection while being transported, as in many cases guerrillas are associated with controversy. Additionally, Nicaragua is not as developed as the US or the Netherlands and has higher crime rates. In general, however, especially when one limits the scope to Western countries, the US President is more of a target than the leaders of other countries because the US is so powerful, both economically and militarily. If we look back at history, people tend to be dissatisfied with whatever country has the most power and influence at the time. This was the case with the British Empire, Spanish Empire, Rome, Mongolia, and many others, so it makes sense that many people would be dissatisfied with the US, and the President is usually blamed, whether or not they are committed any crime. Additionally, if you look at how divided American society is right now, it is obvious that many people do not like the President (this would happen with whoever won the election) and some take their displeasure to a very extreme level. I would argue this is the most compelling reason to protect the President. These are some of the major reasons why the President needs protection, however they are not the only ones.

The reason he is protected that much is that he is a symbol of the state and thus taking him down would show the state to be weak, not because he would be irreplacable. They could keep him safe enough probably with 10% of the cost.

Usually dictatorships produce sycophants and yes men in the highest rungs whose competence plays no role in their selection for office.  But not to get sidetracked, in 1960s dollars the college tuition is higher than it has ever been while the real wages for typical student side jobs are lower than they've ever been. The consequence is clear; it was easier to work ones way through college back then than it is now. That's a bad sign in a world that'll need more college graduates.

@TS-ev1bl,"I'm not sure this was meant as a joke or not, but I'm going to assume it wasn't.    TL:DR version - Aside from the vast differences in power, function, and risk of assassination between a prime minister and a US president, how many Dutch Prime Ministers would have to be assassinated before he would be heavily protected wherever he went?  I actually want to learn something, long c+p version -  Until the early 1900s, the US president wasn't guarded at all, or very little and not officially, for the first 110 or so years of US history, until after the third successful assassination of a president in only a 40 year span and several unsuccessful assassination attempts.  Until the 1901 assassination of President McKinley by an avowed anarchist (Leon Czolgosz ), US presidents frequently strolled around Washington unescorted, or maybe with only one private, plain-clothed guard walking with them.    The White House was open to the public until the late 1800s even while the president was there.  Anyone who wanted a meeting with the president for any reason (it was usually to ask for a federal job, a pardon for a convicted relative, or some other favor) lined up at the White House door early in the morning, got their  name on the list, and waited their turn to have a few minutes of the president's time in his office.  President Garfield's assassin in 1881, Charles Guiteau,  had personally come to the White House and asked Garfield for a federal position in one of these ""come as you are"" meetings with the president, and took revenge against the president by shooting him in a DC train station a few months later when the federal position he had requested did not come his way.  Ulysses Grant got pulled over twice and the second time ticketed by a DC  police officer for speeding (galloping in a ""no galloping"" zone) while driving his carriage alone on DC streets while president in the 1870s.  It was only after the third assassination of a US president (1901) that the president began receiving Secret Service protection, and that was only because the US Secret Service, who are actually Treasury Agents, were the only armed  civilian agents in the federal government in sufficient numbers at that time (the FBI was still three decades in the future).   Even after 1901, US presidents still rode in open carriages and convertible automobiles until the 1963 Kennedy assassination.    Although it makes the Secret Service very nervous when it happens, the president appears in public quite often and wades into crowds to shake hands and pose for photos.  Also, it's still a tradition for the newly inaugurated president and his wife to get out of the limo and walk part of the way to the White House during the president's post-inauguration parade.  And even though Reagan was shot and almost died while emerging from a DC hotel in 1981, the victim of a would-be assassin who had been stalking Presidents Carter and Reagan for months, TWO thwarted assassination attempts against President Ford just days apart on the same trip to California in the mid 1970s, and two president candidates being shot (one killed and one paralyzed for life) during the 1968 and 1972 elections, US presidents still regularly appear in public and mix with crowds.   Bottom line, the Secret Service can advise the president on security, but ultimately he can do what he wants.  If the president tells his driver to stop the limo so he can get out and meet people along the way, that's what happens (see YT videos of President Trump recently jumping out of his limo on a city street to meet a group of very surprised bystanding firemen and pose for selfies with them).",5년 전(수정됨),0,

Having an extra man in the cockpit would cost extra for the country as there is one person to pay.

There's only advantages for an upgrade of the plane. Also to the guy saying that the current Boeing VC-25 was introduced in 1990, thats true. Though you have to consider that the design of the 747-200 is older then 1971, since it first entered service there.",8년 전,1,

@spacemarketeerkelly8469,"Ryan Keller you're missing the point I clarified. If you took all the costs of upgrading and upkeep for all the technology installed AFTER Boeing handed them over, it would have dozens of flights at double the cost before it would be equalized. I understand that's now how payments work it's just a way to put it into perspective. But then if that still isn't enough for you the there is the hundreds of millions per plane for their production which excludes the previously mentioned classified upgrades that would be installed before the potus even stepped foot near them...",8년 전,0,

@DaybreakPT,"Have you even seen how Trump does a handshake? He keeps you and doesn't let go for 20 whole seconds and to top it off he yanks your arm with a smug grin on his face, he even did it to the PM of Japan, Shinzo Abe and he rolled his eyes out, and these are guys that generally agree on some policies, just face it, Trump is not nearly as good as he let himself out to be when he has the social skills of a fucking child. Not even Trudeau wanted to be a part of that mess and that should tell you something.",8년 전,0,

@gruffyddgozali,"A.J. Deutsch, why don't we take a look at what he has accomplished so far shall we? 24 days in his head of national security resigns over talk of removing sanctions from Russia. Declared the court system a threat to national security. Used the executive branch’s immense authority over border control to inflict arbitrary cruelty on thousands of Muslim immigrants, create chaos at airports all across America, and sour diplomatic relations with the rest of the world, which generally creates a worse look for America in Muslim countries, giving terrorists opportunity for propaganda and an easier job in recruitment. Signed a bevy of executive orders that were drafted by the White House’s Breitbart wing — and no one else. Prepared to radically reduce American funding to the United Nations. I don't even live in the US, certainly glad about that",8년 전,0,
