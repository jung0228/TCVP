Yes, I am aware the disputed Kuril islands above Hokkaido are included in each ""Country cutout"" of Japan in this episode. By the time we finished it was too late to fix it. Sorry.

@NejisMate,"Please don't go to the Fox Village. There are many photos of these cute foxes online so unfortunately many people add it to their list, but as a travel consultant I have to keep crushing people's dreams when it comes to this. Foxes are not treated great in the Fox village.  People draw the line in different places when it comes to morality but I think that if you have to ask whether a place treats animals well or not, then it’s not a place one should want to visit. A “grey area” isn’t on the good side when it comes to animal rights.  Obviously they don’t like being touched by people, and so they shouldn’t be (some are chained to the wall so they can't run away when people approach and others are put in ""petting cages""). Foxes are not pack animals either and there shouldn’t be so many living together in one place either, that’s not how they live in the wild. They often fight among themselves and are almost obligated to fight for food that is thrown at them, many times this results in injuries.  Many of them are also in tiny cages. People like to point out that the foxes in cages are pregnant or sick (though not all), however that’s still no excuse to trap them in such tiny spaces. If it's true that the foxes are put in cages when pregnant, that's two months that they will be locked up there.  I wouldn’t go if you like animals. Beyond cute furry animals photos, here you can see ""the other side"" of the fox village:  Reviews: https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Attraction_Review-g1023408-d7388189-Reviews-Miyagi_Zao_Fox_Village-Shiroishi_Miyagi_Prefecture_Tohoku.html  Photos: https://preview.ibb.co/juQamQ/Screen_Shot_2017_05_08_at_21_26_19.png  Also, while we're on the topic of animal rights, note that Miyajima island also has a ban against feeding deer. This would seem fine in another situation, but these deer have been fed for centuries before and this law is newer. The deer are tame and are not able to hunt or look for food on their own, resulting in many of the island's deer being very underfed and sickly-looking. If you like deer, I'd recommend Nara instead.  The mentioned Okunoshima, the rabbit island, and Jigokudani, the monkey onsen, are good places to visit if you want to see animals, as both live in liberty and are treated well.",8년 전,7,

I wouldn't necessarily say that they act as ""word dividers"" (@9:30)  because some words are conjugated verbs that require both kanji and hiragana, e.g. 行きます = I'm going/I will go. It would be awkward to think that the kanji character isn't ""attached"" to the hiragana in this case because if they were read as two separate entities, or ""word dividers,"" it wouldn't make sense. Once you begin to learn Japanese, hiragana is used not only for vocabulary words, but for grammar as well. Just some constructive criticism. :)",6년 전,0,

Japanese names, verbs, adjectives and basically anything else thats actually japanese is written in hiragana. Also hiragana characters all have a katakana variant.   Romaji: the englishified version of japanese. Like itadakimasu is romaji as it uses japanese sounds but is written in english",1년 전,1,

@pheaenp,"Thanks for putting the effort into this video, Japan is a beautiful country with rich culture. However, this video was shot six years ago; now i want to caution something In October 2023, Japan dumped radioactive water into the pacific from Fukushima. Because of how the Japan government covered this and did not report it officially to the world, most people who did not have the access to this information do not know this. 'Officially' Japan announced that the water is safe, it won't damage either the environment or human, and the water is even safe enough to drink. But funny enough, just a few days after this announcement, a group of Japan technicians accidently spilled a tiny amount of radioactive water when carrying it and they all got sent to CPU straight away although they were wearing layers of protective clothing. I mean, didn't you just say you could drink it??? Another fun thing, Japan government spent around 10 billion 'japan money'(i don't know what its called) into hushing up all the news instead of spending the money on cleaning and processing the water. (The reason why Japan decided to dump these water was that Japan has always used nuclear power stations like loads other countries have, but the only problem with nuclear power stations is that they get very hot. So you need to pour water on the outside to cool it down. And the radioactive water that japan had been dumping was this water. ) But don't get me wrong, I am not blaming/criticising/accusing Japan for doing this, because almost all of the world's most developed countries have dumped radioactive source/water into the ocean before without causing much attention. eg. the UK, America, Germany... The only reason i am saying this is that if, by any chance in the future, somebody mentions it and somehow twists the country who did it from Japan to any country nearby (eg, china, korea) as I expect Japan to do it due to its nature, PLEASE TELL THEM ITS NOT...",1년 전,0,

In Japan, we learn about Hiroshima and Nagasaki much. That’s why they talking about atomic bomb much. But you should remind of how many citizens died here, and some people still suffer. Yes, Japan did bad things in WW2. But that’s not only about Japan and Nazi Germany. US and other Allied countries did bad things. We should keep peace because we can’t repeat like this sad history. Pls don’t fight here. We like to keep relation with US.",1년 전(수정됨),2,
@inakanotami_yusha_nagasawa,あと、コメ主が言っているのはおそらくアメリカさえ邪魔してこなければ勝利し日本はもっと発展していたということだろうけど、アメリカが介入してこないことでファシズムのような考え方がドイツや日本で維持され続け、ずっと大日本帝国憲法のままだと思います。アメリカが多くの民間人を◯したのは事実。戦争においてそれが1番やってはならないこと。でも敗戦を経験し、民主主義国家日本となったからこそ、今のような平和な世の中があるのではないか。実際大日本帝国のままで進み続けてたら、もっと多くの人が亡くなって今からもしれない。歴史ってのは少しでも傾くとすぐに大戦争に発展したりします。なので日本がもし勝ち続けてたらWW lllなんて言うものが起こっていたかもしれない。,1년 전,1,

@cheche097, @L4y1nn  機械翻訳で読んだから認識間違いがあるかもだけど返信します。 確かに日本では宗教は帰属意識を持って普段の行動に反映されるものというよりは、一つの文化や行事と結びついているものだと考える方が近いと思います。  神道に改宗する人がいたとしたら、それなりに強い帰属意識があると思います。 個人的な考えですが、「宗教＝葬式のやり方が何式か」だと思っています。代々仏教のやり方だったら、自分も仏教だと答える場合が多いと思います。そして日本では仏教式の葬式が9割ほどと圧倒的に多いです。 ですが、大抵の日本人は葬式が仏教でもクリスマスや初詣などを普通に行います。複数の宗教が並立できる程度の宗教観なので、帰属意識がないならわざわざその宗教を変える必要がないでしょう。  帰属意識がなくても、それぞれの宗教のいいとこ取りをしてしまうところが日本の良い点でも悪い点でもありますね。,2년 전(수정됨),0,
@cheche097, @L4y1nn  クリスマスはキリストの誕生日（？）を祝うものではなく、クリスマスという単なるイベントです。ケーキを食べたり、チキンを食べたり、恋人と過ごす。そういったことを行うイベントだという認識なので、キリスト教が元だということを知ってはいても、キリスト教を意識して行動はしていません。  神社を訪れることも、神様を崇拝しているからお参りするというより、正月は初詣をするのがオーソドックスな過ごし方だという考えから神社に行きます。日本では万物に神（というより精霊の方が近いかも）がいるという考えは自然と身についているので、神道を信仰していなくても何か大事な時には神頼みをしたり、罰当たりなことは避けようとします（食べ物を粗末にしたりとか？）。  仏教と神社参拝は特に関係はないです。神様と仏が別物であるように、両者は全くの別の宗教です。個人的に神社は受験祈願や今年一年がいい日になりますようにとお願いしに行く場所だと思っています。 仏教は自分というより、亡くなった先祖が安らかに眠れますようにとお祈りする場ですかね。 神仏習合といって双方が一つになったという歴史があるので、そのあたりから宗教観が曖昧になったのかもしれません。,2년 전(수정됨),0,

@Aonata-channel,"Very interesting!!! Since others have made various comments, I have a message for those who say, ""I can't remember any kanji!"" I have a message for those who say, ""I can't remember any kanji at all! In Japanese elementary school, it takes six years to learn 1026 kanji (80→160→200→202→193→191). So, if you are not able to learn as much as you would like, there is no need to be in a hurry at all! There are some kanji that you may not agree with (e.g. ""four""(四), which is included in 80), but if you get used to them little by little, you will be able to learn them all at once. Perhaps you may find it interesting to write Kanji characters neatly. I hope this comment will be useful to someone.  p.s. Japanese can be understood by others even if you ignore grammar to some extent, so I think you can enjoy learning Japanese if you don't worry too much about grammatical mistakes (except for rude mistakes).

Japan has a lot of attractions such as beautiful sceneries, delicious foods, really safety, many facilities, building, trains and Anime.  I’m don’t know much about the opinions foreigners have about Japan but I can say that Japan is one of the countries that people around the world want to visit, and anime in particular is one of the representative cultures of Japan. So what I want to say is that I want all of Japanese people to realize that our cultures are needed and loved more in the world.  Thank you",2년 전,2,

Hiragana is born to help Chinese characters, and katakana is used to distinguish the writing style.

Back during the colonial days, Japan's xenophobia towards the rest of the world had one exception: traders from The Netherlands. Which brought not only goods, but also knowledge and science. Which they used to lay the foundation of science education.  The Japanese and the Dutch get along surprisingly well despite having completely different cultures. You can rest assured they think similar things about you/your country. :D",2년 전,6,

As members of the Axis powers, they committed a lot of war crimes in the WWII and were finally defeated and destroyed. After the war, they rised again miraculously and rapidly.  But these two countries are also quite different. For example, Germany pays for their war crimes, while Japan denies the crimes and refuses even to apologize.

@coldwarveteran,"More facts about Japan: 1. Shikoku is called ""shikoku"" because ""shi"" means 4 in Japanese and there is 4 prefectures in Shikoku. 2. The flag 🇯🇵 has a meaning (obviously). White meaning peace and harmony and red representing the sun. 3. Lake Biwa is a hot spot for bass fishing, and is home to the well known shinto shrine in the water 4. The history behind Russia and Japan: When russia, japan and other countries wanted to occupy port Arthur (in china) and Russia made a railway system which the Japanese didnt like. They negotiated with the russians to take the 150,000 men guarding the construction of the railway, the Russians sent more men there, starting a war.  When news of the war spread into Europe, Britain helped the Japanese by supplying them with guns and gear. Back then, Russia was incharge of the baltick States so they sent ships there and when though the suez cannel but was blocked off  having to make them go around Africa.  On the way to Port Arthur, the russians sunk British fishing boats  triggering the British, leading them to supply japan with naval cannons. Japan did have a small navy but destroyed the russian navy. They also were out numbered on a ground battle. Japan only having 300,000 men while Russia had 340,000 men which the Japanese won the battle.  People in Japan say it was a 50/50 fight but many believe that the victory was in the hands of the Japanese.  This war was called the russo-japanese war  5. Japan is the country in most debt. 9 trillion USD to be exact. Thr reason behind this is that during WW2, they committed so many serious war crimes and damage that it led them to the 9 trillion dollar debt, hence why they need money",3년 전(수정됨),1,

In 1945, Russia (the Soviet Union at that time) ignored the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, which was still in effect at the time, and illegally occupied the territory. Many Japanese lived in 1945, but they were all forcibly driven away. The Northern Territories are the islands of Japan that have never been controlled by foreign countries since Japan began to function as Japan. Foreigners think that Japan and Russia are fighting over territorial disputes, but it is a problem that should not even be contested. Japanese students have been taught about the Northern Territories since elementary school. Every textbook clearly states that it is a Japanese territory. Takeshima is also Japanese. The San Francico Peace Treaty stipulates that Takeshima belongs to Japan. The problem with neighboring countries is a big problem that bothers the Japanese.  I think English is strange.

@zoesoa,"※I use a Google translate site. Regarding the Northern Territories issue, Japan claims that the four islands of Etorofu Island, Kunashiri Island, Shikotan Island, and Habomai Islands are Japanese territories. But the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Islands, which are close to Hokkaido as a ""transfer plan"" from the Russian side. The Russian side never considers any of the four islands in the Northern Territories to be Japanese territory.  北方領土問題についてですが、日本は択捉島、国後島、色丹島、歯舞群島の4島を日本の領地だと主張していますが、ロシア側からの""譲渡案""として北海道からより近い、歯舞群島、国後島を譲渡すると述べていたのであって(現在その譲渡案は無かったことになっている)、決してロシア側は北方領土の4島のうちどこも日本の領地だと考えていません。",3년 전,0,

@うゆ-n4y3c, @showUmiracle  領土のことについて詳しく知らないのでしょうか？ ロシアと日本は条約を結びましたよね。その内容を日本語訳で言うと「北方領土と千島列島は日本の領土とする」です。でもロシア語訳で書くと「北方領土を含む千島列島を日本の領土とする」と、このように条約の内容にミスがあり、日本語とロシア語で微妙に内容が異なっ ていました。そしてその後、千島列島は日本ではない。という条約ができたんです。  そりゃロシアからしたら北方領土は千島列島に入っている事になりますよね〜 でも日本から見たら北方領土は千島列島とは別です。 両国で話し合って納得できる落とし所が出来たら領土問題は終了ですよ。 まだ両国で納得できる落とし所がないのにロシアの領土と言われているのはどうなのでしょうか。,3년 전,2,

@パン田-d7k, @nekoha_728  北方領土は微妙ですけど、竹島に関しては明確に日本の領土だと言える理由があり、他国もそう認識していますよ。サンフランシスコ平和条約によって竹島は領土放棄の対象にならずに引き続き日本国に残るとアメリカを中心に連合国が領有権を認めています。では何故日本に戻ってこないのかと言えば、内政干渉に成り得るために、原則領土問題に対して他国は介入せずに当事国間で解決すべきと言う国際スタンダードがあるからです。そのため、国際司法裁判所にて決着すべきなんですが(日米両政府の見解)驚くべきことに韓国は一切応じようとしません。また今更取り返そうとして紛争を起こす訳にもいかないので、漁民を殺害されてから不当に実行支配されている状態が今日に至るまで続いています。尖閣に関しても資源の埋蔵が調査によって分かってから中国が領有権を主張して来ました。この領土問題についても、中国側が提訴せずに領海・領空侵犯を繰り返していることからも自明でしょう。,3년 전,2,

@swis_ab,"Why is South Korea so bullish on Japan? It is because Japan is a warmongering country and if it becomes aggressive toward Japan, Japan will give it money. The Korean government wants to maintain this situation, so it has its people brainwashed and educated. In fact, it is a common practice in South Korea for politicians whose approval ratings have fallen to revive them with anti-Japanese rhetoric. Korea does not want good relations with Japan. All it wants is to make money by pretending to be a victim of war forever. Japan suffered tremendous damage from the US nuclear attack, but Japan is looking forward.

In 1971 most of their shops became open 24h a day. In 1974 they opened their first shop in Japan, also they made Seven-Eleven Japan at this point. It was a mega-hit in Japan, but due to some problems that they encountered, they changed their business into a franchise-styled one. In 1991 Seven-Eleven Japan bought Seven-Eleven (the original one in the USA).   So technically Seven-Eleven was founded in America and grew in Japan.",3년 전,4,

Germany is trying to move forward, acknowledging the past.However, there are many people in Japan who do not reflect on it very much.This is because there are only wreckage of damage in Japan and much of the evidence of invasion is abroad.There is also an attitude that it is okay because I gave a deposit to the victim country.I've learned a lot of history in both countries and I don't think they're good. Of course, it is bad to take an excessive attitude, but I also want you to know that there is such a problem of consciousness. And I'm sorry if my English is hard to understand.",3년 전,0,

Second, it's not Tokugawa Leyaso, it's Tokugawa Ieyasu (with capital ""i""). Third, you put a picture from Yukio Mishima on Osamu Dazai. That's all.

@SuperNemeanlion,"The thing I do not agree with the Japanese is the school system. The boys are forced to have very short hair while at school and furthermore the students are all forced to wear uniforms. I only like schools where students can wear whatever they please.   Also the Japanese focus on only one thing which is studying at school. School is not just for academic purposes, normally it is for both academic and social purposes. Teens in Japan cannot be in a relationship because if they are caught they will be punished and are forced to break up.  Being in a relationship whilst in your teens is perfectly normal to me. The other thing I do not like is when some movies which come from Japan do not have any other language alternative other than Japanese. Face it, not everyone speaks Japanese language.",4년 전,0,

@laijiang5812, @chainchen7094  原来也是革命同志，咱也想到共同之处了，不管是国内国际，各种社会秩序都积压太多矛盾，世界本身向好的发展不断被以美国精英为代表的既得利益者强行打断，强行制造情绪和内耗，把”利益至上“彻底美化成发展的圣经，抛弃历史，欺辱弱国，简直是对”文明“的亵渎。 尤其赞同你提到的深化志向，其实自从大大提出共同体理念开始，我就无比追崇这个理想，世界秩序就应该是共同体，而不是敌对。虽然过于理想化，但是从这个观点出发真的可以帮助树立良好的世界观。当然实践起来更为困难，但同你一样，我对中国以及咱们人民拥有信心。 （有点困意上面的语句可能不清晰，但清晰的一定是打心底高兴遇见志同道合的友人）,4년 전,1,

During the war, Japan slaughtered numerous innocent people, destroyed their language and culture, and looted artifacts.  Until now, Japan has been officially using the Rising Sun Flag, which was used during the war, and it has not changed from the state of war criminals, claiming that other countries' territories belong to Japan.  Soon, Japan will see the consequences of that choice.  It was also chosen by Japan, so it should be accepted.  As a result of a terrible choice...",4년 전,1,

@yomi-5203,"Hello, I'm Japanese. I feel that Japan is now drawing attention from the world. This is because I participate in the events hosted by the world, such as the Tokyo Olympics and the Expo. Japan has become a member of the world as a matter of course, but in the past there have been serious mistakes and tremendous efforts. I am studying history at a Japanese school, but Japanese history is deep and interesting. The grades are not very good. There are various countries other than Japan. Some countries are very rich and some are still developing. Some countries are peaceful, while others are in constant conflict. It's a matter of course, but you shouldn't go to war. This is because it causes damage to the relationships between countries and even to the inhabitants of that country. As the only country that has been bombed, I think Japan should communicate about the war. However, no matter how much I explain to foreign countries, I can't talk unless the other person knows a little about Japan. I would be very happy if you could learn a little about Japan through this video. I'm using a translator to write this comment, so it may seem strange. But I am especially grateful to you for reading this far. Thank you very much. see you.  p.s. Thank you for making such a wonderful video. As a member of the Japanese people, I would like to express my deep gratitude.   こんにちは、私は日本人です。 日本は今世界から注目を浴びていると私は感じます。東京オリンピックや、万博など、世界が主催する者へ参加しているからです。日本も当たり前のように世界の一員となっていますが、過去には重大な過ちやとてつもない努力があります。 僕は日本の学校で歴史を習っていますが、日本の歴史は深く面白いものです。成績はあまり良くないけれど。 日本の他にも様々な国があります。とても豊かな国や、まだまだ発展途上の国もあります。平和な国もあれば、争いが絶えない国もあります。当たり前の事だけれど、戦争はしてはいけない事です。国同士の関係を、その国の住民にまで被害をもたらすからです。 日本は唯一の被爆国として、戦争の事について発信していくべきだと思います。でも、いくら外国に向けて説明しても、相手が日本の事について少しぐらい知らないと話になりません。 この動画を通して、日本の事について少しでも知ってくれたらとても嬉しいです。翻訳機を使ってこのコメントを書いているため、変に感じるかもしれません。でも、ここまで読んでくれたあなた特別に感謝しています。ありがとうございました。では、また。  追伸　こんなに素晴らしい動画を作ってくれて、ありがとうございます。日本人の一員として、深く御礼申し上げます。",4년 전,0,

@mortadasaleh7423,"9:35 ""Why don't the Japanese use spaces and discard the other 2 alphabets"" I think a big reason why is because to fit in sentence size. Japanese sentences tend to be long, Kanji usually saves 2 spaces for 1. So if they use only 1 alphabet and they use empty spaces between words the sentences will take up to more than twice the size.  8:53 ""Japanese is not hard to learn conversationally, but it's nightmare when it comes to writing"" Sure Kanji takes a lot of time to memorize but I wouldn't call it hard, just needs memorizing. The grammar on the other hand ""IS NIGHTMARE"" to get used to. Have to learn how to count things (which is weird), how to correctly use particles, how not to sound rude.",4년 전(수정됨),4,

@adan2099,"The koi mentioned in the video, raccoon dogs, and other animals, in fact, China also has, China also has macaques, and the origin of koi is actually in China a long time ago, Japan did not have written language, more than 1600 years ago, the Chinese brought Chinese language and Chinese culture to the Japanese islands.視頻裡面提到的錦鯉，浣熊狗，還有其他的動物，其實中國也有，中國也有獼猴，而且錦鯉的原產地其實在中國很早很早之前，日本是沒有文字的，1600多年前，中國人將中國的文字和中國的文化帶入日本列島。Trong video có nhắc tới cá chép gấm , chó gấu trúc , còn có những động vật khác , thực ra Trung Quốc cũng có , Trung Quốc cũng có khỉ , hơn nữa nguồn gốc của cá chép gấm thực ra ở Trung Quốc từ rất lâu rất lâu trước đây , Nhật Bản không có chữ viết , hơn 1600 năm trước , người Trung Quốc mang văn tự Trung Quốc và văn hóa Trung Quốc vào quần đảo Nhật Bản .На частотах упоминается, что ГК, Енот, есть и другие животные, На самом деле Китай также имеет, В Китае также есть обезьяны, И оригинальная земля его происхождения была реализована очень рано и очень рано в Китае, Япония не написана. Более 1600 лет назад китайцы привезли китайский язык и китайскую культуру на остров Япония.Los koi, los mapaches y otros animales mencionados en el video, de hecho, también los hay en China, también hay kiwi en China, y el origen de los koi en realidad fue hace mucho tiempo en China, Japón no tenía escritura, hace más de 1600 años, los chinos trajeron la escritura china y la cultura china a las islas japonesas.",4년 전,0,

@Ricky911_,"You forgot to mention the climate and especially the snow. While the biggest cities like Tokyo or Osaka barely get any snow, Japan is still home to some of the snowiest cities in the world. In fact the three snowiest cities in the world (Aomori, Sapporo, Toyama) are all located in Japan. Then, there's also a lot of other cities, some even smaller, that still get a lot of snow like Akita, Yamagata, Hakodate, Hirosaki, Otaru, Asahikawa, Sakata, Joetsu, Tottori, Wakkanai, Niigata, Kanazawa and Fukui. Some of these even get more snow than the ones on the official list of the top 10 snowiest cities but they're too small to be represented. The cities of Matsue and Sendai also get a relatively good amount of snow every year. Probably just a little more than New York does. Then, of course, there's the Monsoon season, where some places (especially in the North) get just over 100 mm of rain in September, whereas in Kochi prefecture (Shikoku) some places even get over 400 mm of rain in September. September is generally the rainiest month in Japan, although it depends. In some other parts, it's July and in Kanazawa it's even December due to the Siberian winds and the sea of Japan",4년 전,0,

@fuzukimaru2,日本では伝統的神道は道徳的な役割を殆ど担ってません。伝統的儀式や行事を担っています。道徳を担ってきたのは主に伝統的慣習と､仏教的方法論と儒教思想です。日本は､キリスト教やイスラム教の国々の様に宗教が道徳を独占している社会ではありません。これは台湾や中国でも同様です。,4년 전,1,
@fuzukimaru2,"漢字､平仮名､片仮名の3つの文字を使い､韓国やベトナムの様に表音文字1つにできない理由があります。 その理由は､日本語の発音に制限が多いからです。5つ若しくは10の母音と14の子音だけ組み合わせて音を作りますが､""n""以外は母音で必ず終わらなくてはならず､子音を""str""の様に重ねる事もできません。その為に同じ意味を表すのに英語の約数倍の音節が必要になります。例えば""building""は""birudingu""です。また同音異義語が非常に多くなります。これは韓国語とベトナム語にはない障害です。 それが理由で､日本語は漢字を使用しています。中国人が漢字使用を止めても日本人は漢字を使わざるをえないでしょう。 よって決して愚かな伝統主義が原因ではありません。 第二次大戦後に試験的にラテン文字だけの教育も一部で行われましたが失敗しました。3系統文字での教育された側に比べ成績が著しく低かったのです。 どの言語でも発音体系を変更するのは容易ではありません。例えば､ニュージーランドに""Ngongotaha""と""Ngaio""という地名があります。しかし英語母語話者は正しく発音できません。""non-gotaha""と""naio""と発音し第一の""g""を消します。英語母語話者には発音が困難だからです。しかし日本人は容易に正しく発音できます。英語の発音体系をマオリ語や日本語と同じ様に簡単に変えられますか？ それに英語も綴りと発音の関係は混沌としてます。英語の発音若しくは綴りを改革してドイツ語の様にピッタリ一致させる改革は日本語より容易な筈です。英語は日本語より遥かに発音の組み合わせが多いからです。しかし未だに実行されていません。改革をすれば綴りを覚える必要は無くなるのにです。",4년 전,3,

@RK-sd7hb,"There is an Edo period between the Azuchi-Momoyama period and the Meiji period, but it seems to be forgotten.  The Edo period, which lasted for more than 250 years, was a stable period under the Tokugawa Shogunate, and it was also an era when many new cultures were created.  Especially in terms of food culture, there have been major changes, and sushi, soba, and tempura were all created or spread during the Edo period.  Oh yeah, regarding the Shinkansen, when the Shinkansen opens in recent years, conventional lines may be abolished or management may be transferred to local governments, which is often taken up as a problem. (I used Google Translate, so it may not be accurate.  For the time being, I will write the original Japanese text below.)  安土桃山時代と明治時代の間に江戸時代があるのですが、忘れておられるようです。 250年以上に渡って続いた江戸時代は、徳川幕府の元で安定した時代で、新たな文化が沢山生み出された時代でもあります。 特に食文化の面では変化が大きく、握り鮨や蕎麦、天ぷらはみな江戸時代に生み出されたり、広まったものです。 そうそう、あと新幹線についてですが、近年は新幹線が開通すると、在来線が廃止になったり、地方自治体に管理が移される場合があり、しばしば問題として取り上げられています。",4년 전,1,

I got a good idea of ​​what people overseas think of Japan.  (In a good way, of course)  As I said in this video, Japan is interesting but complicated.  Especially the letters.  I'm a student, but it's really hard to learn kanji.  You have to remember hundreds of them in a year.  Besides, students have no time to rest because they have to do English and math.  This video was very interesting.  However, I was a little worried that the photos of Yukichi Fukuzawa and Tadakatsu Honda at 12:57 and 12:58 were swapped.  It doesn't matter.  I think most of the people who see this are those who are interested in Japan.  For those people, find out more about Japan.  Especially the railroad.  Japanese railways are the most accurate in the world.  Without a minute delay.  It's interesting.  Thank you for taking up Japan on this channel.  With love from Japan.",4년 전,0,

@gorillakingwang,"0:32 Please I know this is a video form 3years ago but I want to clarify this right. The name ""SEA OF JAPAN"" is wrong. It has to be called ""THE EAST SEA"".  The primary issue in the dispute revolves around a disagreement about when the name ""Sea of Japan"" became the international standard. Japan claims the term has been the international standard since at least the early 19th century, while the Koreas claim that the term ""Sea of Japan"" arose later while Korea was under Japanese rule, and before that occupation, other names such as ""Sea of Korea"" or ""East Sea"" were used in English.  As a Korean myself, I take issues like this very seriously. Just with a little bit more attention from people, we can make history right.",5년 전,1,

Iraq is not the poorest country, but the richest country But America, which seeks its interests and the neighboring countries, made it so Do not talk about what you do not know. Iraq exports 4.5 million barrels per day Of oil, it is the second largest producer of crude oil in the OIC Petroleum exporting ,, OPEC ,, Is the country that owns black gold, oil, poor? Unfortunately, wars and conflicts are what destroyed Iraq, if not, but Iraq is the best country in the world Iraq is the cradle of civilizations, and it is one of the knowledge of peoples to write, the knowledge of your ancestors and your parents, and your knowledge as well As for the Japanese people hate Iraq, this is a nice lie. I have friends from Japan and they love us and are eager to visit Iraq and get to know its presence and its culture. As for you, you should see a psychiatrist because you are mentally ill because those who hate people because they are poor, this is not human, and as I told you, you represent nothing but yourself",5년 전,1,
@ترآنيےمترآنيےم," 秀樹東城   You are really annoying and idiot Moreover, oil is very important, as it is used in the manufacture of plastic, cosmetics, and most importantly in the pharmaceutical industry Our oil is important to the rest of the countries, and they cannot operate their factories and they cannot use electricity or anything without our oil. Not all countries use alternative energy Even your factories with which you manufacture this scrap, which you export to the world, it will not work without oil Also, Japan is the third largest consumer of oil, so you import oil from Iraq So don't be a fool, you just can't do anything without oil",5년 전,0,
@ترآنيےمترآنيےم," 秀樹東城 The next years in which you will dispense with oil are in your dreams only. The world collapses and goes into the unknown. So do not imagine and dream a lot. And most importantly, you still need our oil, and without it you cannot do anything, and the situation in which you are now, thanks to our oil, is this understandable, annoying",5년 전,0,
@ترآنيےمترآنيےم," 秀樹東城   First, you are annoying and arrogant, and secondly, Iraq was the first to write with the pen and taught peoples to write and read, and there was in it the largest library in the world, but when the Mongols attacked and burned books and destroyed everything so that people were from everywhere to learn in Iraq. And French and a little Russian language. You are my mother because you do not read and write. You only work like robots and machines. You are not good at anything. Do you have a job means that you are educated? And read a lot about the countries of the world and know everything completely opposite to you. You do not forgive anything about Iraq or the countries of the world because you work, eat and sleep and do not know what is going on around you, then Iraq is the richest in the world, but our government is corrupt and it steals money and does not give to the people and America is the occupier of Iraq and it supports terrorism in Iraq because my country is an important strategic region, and its location is important, so everyone wants to have it and control it, unlike your country that is full of earthquakes, so it is not as important as the Iraq that everyone seeks to obtain.",5년 전,0,
@ترآنيےمترآنيےم," 秀樹東城  In the end, you continue to sell scrap to people, and we will continue to export oil to the world, and you are on your own, and it does not matter whether you love us or not.

@ترآنيےمترآنيےم," 秀樹東城  If I previously told you that you only represent yourself and it is not important that you love my country or not because it is not important.

You claim that you speak to me politely, where is the literature, and you attack my country and describe ugly words? Do you want me to thank you just as you love your country? I love my country and I am proud of it.

Also lots of ""native"" japanese words are not suspiciously pronounced the same as the Hebrew word with the same meaning.  Another one is that The Imperial Seal of Japan is identical to one that has been in Jerusalem for 2000 years, just search ""Herods gate""",5년 전(수정됨),0,

But Korean gov and court re-raised the issue again and again. as though they wanna get money from Japan when they are nearly broke. Korean is so sad because of President Moon Jae-in. And you are an anti-Japanese right?? And do you participate in No Japan Demonstration?? Then, never travel abroad.

@simscott9659,wh ooo its mean is can do “sea of korea” too If “east sea” doesn’t exist it mean for can do sea of korea too right?  That is why not “sea of japan” not “sea of korea”  “East sea” is right  Sea of japan only can said  ww2 japan Attack korea that at the moment Japanese said “sea of japan” Before long long time ago All asian  And old document(china korea japan)prove it But Japanese gov hide truth  Same issue “dok do”,5년 전(수정됨),0,
@simscott9659,"wh ooo  If You dont give a fucxing about “dok do” You cant talk about “sea of japan” / “east sea” its complicated   In Fact   The problem began in 1929 when the International Hydrographic Organization compiled the 'Limits of Oceans and Seas' to unify the names of the world's waters.  I applied for “Japan Sea” in the name of the sea area and passed without objection.  There were several internal circumstances.  The Republic of Korea at that time was a Japanese colonial rule, that is, a colony of the Japanese Empire , and was unable to participate in the decision of the name of the sea without the sovereignty of the people.  Japan was also a victorious country in World War I and was a permanent member of the League of Nations. Naturally, Japan's permanent member of the League of Nations was very strong in public opinion.  Therefore, the claim of the name ""Sea of ​​Japan"" calling this sea in Japan was passed and listed without any objection.  The second edition of the guideline was compiled in 1937, which was also during the Japanese colonial rule, and after independence was in the middle of the Korean War in 1953, and it was not joined by the International Hydrographic Organization.  The sole notation was used.  Eventually, the Republic of Korea joined the International Hydrographic Organization only in 1957, and at the time of the signing of the Korea-Japan Fisheries Agreement in 1965, the names of the two seas of Korea and Japan could not be reached.  In 1974, the International Hydrographic Organization recommended that the names of all States Parties should be entered in the absence of a name agreement between neighboring countries in a particular sea, but Japan did not accept that it was intended for bays and straits, but not for the East Sea.  Since then, the 11th IHO General Assembly (1977) revised the old third edition to publish a new 'Border of Oceans and Seas', and the Secretariat prepared a fourth edition amendment with maps for each region.  Therefore, it was referred to the vote of the member states in 1986, but was rejected.  As South Korea objected at the 6th United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names in 1992, the issue of naming became a full-fledged issue, and since 1998, the two Koreas have jointly filed negotiations with Japan, but rejected Japan, which did not want to do so.  At the 2002 International Hydrographic Organization's first attempt to raise a problem, it was canceled, and in 2012, Japan requested the sole indication of the Sea of ​​Japan, but the general meeting of the fourth edition of the boundary between the ocean and the sea was postponed to 2017.  And in 2017 there was no change.  On April 9, 2019, officials from North and South Korea met in London, UK, to have an informal informal consultation on the name of the East Sea.  The situation has not been found yet, and the problem has continued since then.  You dont fucxing care for “dok do” But its connection for “east sea”/ sea of japn That is why koreans are sensitive react like that   The Sea of ​​Japan was established as an international official name, and the Japanese Empire was occupied by the entire Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, and some parts of Sakhalin during the Japanese colonial era.  Therefore, in the current situation, it is not possible for Korea to recognize the name set as the basis for Japanese imperialism.  The name 'Donghae' is a historical name in the Korean Peninsula by appearing several times in various archaeological heritages and records, such as the Gwanggaeto Grand Tomb Monument (414), King Seongdeok King Shinjong (771), and the Three Kingdoms Journal (1145) Ministry of Foreign Affairs' promotional video titled National Maritime Research Institute.  We cannot deny it.  The name East Sea also appears frequently on ancient maps of China.    The name of the Joseon Sea, Sea of ​​Corea (Mer de Corée), was used until the 1800s.  It is also referred to as Sea of ​​Corea in the 1726 Gulliver's Travels.  Even in that part, only Japan comes out of that part.  There is also an example of 'Chosunhae' written on a map made in Japan.  Interestingly, Japan referred to the Pacific Ocean to the east of the Japanese archipelago as the “Sea of ​​Japan” until the knowledge of world geography came in, and mainly marked the East Sea as the “Sea of ​​Korea” on the map.  This was mainly caused by copying from the map of the Joseon Dynasty before the 17th century.  Even the opening video from Koei's Online Era Oriente Update PV of the Age of Confrontation marked the Korean Sea (MER DE COREE) in French to coincide with the testament of the times, and was overturned when a protest occurred.   Eventually, the name Sea of ​​Japan became more widely used in the late 19th century.  This was the result of Japan's growing influence in the international community at the time.  Compared to Japan's early opening of the door, Joseon in the 19th century was a stagnant period of Sedo politics, and the openness to the West was 30 years behind Japan, and was culminated in international trends.  However, the name of the Joseon Sea appeared in the Gazette before 1905. #   During the Japanese colonial period in 1929, discussions on the unification of the waters by the International Hydrographic Organization took place. At the time, Korea (Chosun) did not exist due to loss of sovereignty, and the East Sea was similar to the Japanese inland sea except for the territory of the Russian maritime territory.  For this reason, Japan's request to make the Sea of ​​Japan was passed without objection.  ——————   On January 24, 2014, the East Sea Ordnance Act, which was proposed to the US Senate, passed with a vote of 31 out of 38 lawmakers.  On January 30, 2014, the Korean media captured the situation in which the Japanese Ambassador to the US actually threatened the Virginia Governor in connection with the US East Sea legislation.  On February 2, 2014, domestic media officially confirmed the Japanese lobbying status through the US Department of Justice.  The Japanese Embassy in the United States signed a contract with a large US law firm.  The law firm that signed the contract is said to be a large-scale lobbying company located in Washington, USA, with 'McWires Consulting'.  The lobbying strategy described in the contract of McGuires Consulting (Defense against the East Sea)   1. Develop logic to counter the East Sea's weapons and secure friendly forces.  2. Create the logic that the East Sea weapon is wrong and seek experts to promote it.  3. In response to the group of Koreans carrying out the East Sea weapon movement, a group was formed to support the Japan Sea single mark.  4. The media are also targeted.  (Large Strategies against the State Council) 5. Focused on lobbying the key members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the so-called and standing committees.  6. When the legislation passed through the Virginia Parliament came to the governor's desk, the governor of Virginia would veto it.

While it is true that the three countries are geographically and economically inseparable, Japan has invaded China and Korea in the past and does not apologize for it. Rather, they are still proud of the Rising Sun Flag they used at that time. Many Western countries still abhor and taboo Nazi patterns and allow the Rising Sun Flag to be beautiful. Thanks to this, Japan allowed the use of the Rising Sun Flag at the Olympics, and China and South Korea protested, but the IOC has never taken any corrective action against it. Germany bans the use of Nazis and teaches true history, ashamed of its past, but Japan is decorating and selling the Rising Sun Flag anywhere in the country, rather glorifying the past that invaded and trampled on other countries, missing that time and wants to make Japan a war-capable country again. In the meantime, they are distorting history and teaching it to the people. Please don't forget that Japan is a war criminal state.",5년 전,2,

@YS-mn9xw,"Masao Son(Soft Bank, Yahoo Japan) was ethnic Korean, born in Fukuoka Japan, 3rd generation Korean in Japan. He kept his nationality as South Korean before he naturalized as Japanese about 30yrs ago for the request from Japanese government, after his success in business. For the proposal, he made a condition to the government that his family name should be remained and registered as it is. But the Japanese government didn't allowed his condition by the reason that there was no such family name in Japan at the time. Koreans should change his family name as Japanese style at the time(Now abolished). So his wife, who is Japanese, created 'Son' as a Japanese family name(Japanese could create new family name), then he applied Son as his Japanese family name following his wife. It is well known story both in Japan and Korea. His family name Son is as same as the English primier soccer player Heung-min Son.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@piyopiyo-x8b," @babs1277  Outrageous, thank you 😭💓 Really! ? It's hard to hear, but aren't Italians hate Japan or Japanese? Also, I'm sure if I speak Italian, I'll get sick. I heard that Italians are proud of their culture. Wouldn't it be uncomfortable for me to go to Italy and speak bad words? 🤔 I'm a little worried. 😥 If you have any questions about Japan, please ask! 🇯🇵 (* ´ 罒 `*)",5년 전,1,
@babs1277," @piyopiyo-x8b  Some just hate every nation in the world. Italian are actually really proud citizens and a lot patriotic. So it actually happens but not just with the Japanese, they hate europeans and americans too! That's crazy. (ಠ_ಠ) Well, about the language it doesn't matter much. As long as they understand you it's pretty much ok! I have a question too (人◕ω◕) How should I learn Kanji? Vocabulary is pretty much like other languages but Kanji is kind of a problem for me (ﾟヘﾟ)",5년 전,2,
@piyopiyo-x8b," @babs1277  That's right. It's amazing that some people dislike Europeans and Americans. I agree. In Japan, many people see it as European, whether it's Italian or French. I can't tell it apart. I don't have a bad image. I think that we should respect each other on an equal footing. What many Japanese don't like is China, South Korea and North Korea. I wish I could get along well ...",5년 전,1,
@piyopiyo-x8b," @babs1277  It's getting longer, so I'll divide it into two 💦 Is it Kanji? There are many kanji that even grown-up Japanese can't read, and if you like difficult Japanese words or plan to live in Japan, you have no choice but to learn all. 😅 Repeat like test or use word book. I think it's also good to use a kanji practice book for Japanese children. If it's a trip, I think it's good to use it in conversation and study the kanji you see in the city 👍 It's also great to see Japanese movies, anime, and manga. Japanese people are proud of Japanese manga and anime culture, so I think that Japanese people will like it if they know it. 😍 Understanding the origin and meaning of kanji may deepen your understanding! Do you have a book about Japanese in an Italian bookstore? If so, I think that's enough. All I have to do is come to Japan and practice. I think it's good to use Japanese friends as an interpreter. Would you like to ask some Kanji problems if you like?",5년 전,1,
@babs1277," @piyopiyo-x8b  Thanks for the tips, I'll keep them in mind! :D Do you want to keep chatting with me, please? I am trying to find someone to practice my Japanese but I don't know any. :( Also, If you feel unconfortable I understand that but if you would like to, I can teach you some Italian too! If you want to keep texting, can we change app though? writing in the Youtube comment section isn't the best option.",5년 전,2,

I think learning Japanese would be so much easier if they'd just use Katakana. I hope i didn't upset any Japanese people here, but that's just my opinion.

@ckhwanny,"At present, a large amount of rice is still produced in the Fukushima region, which is heavily radioactive in Japan. But the rice can never be sold to Japanese consumers. Radioactively contaminated rice produced in Fukushima is sold at very low prices for making simple food for restaurants and convenience stores in tourist spots in Japan. It is secretly supplied in large quantities through hotels and restaurants throughout Japan, as well as restaurants that are frequently visited by tourists. Perhaps the food you eat at a tourist restaurant in Japan is likely to be radiation-contaminated rice produced in Fukushima. You won't believe it, but this is obvious.",5년 전,0,

@takeru2702,"Japan rescued 765 Polish orphans in Siberia in 1920, 1921 and 1922.Polish orphans lost their family in Siberia and were hungry without food. Poland asked different countries to save Polish orphans. But every country refused to save the orphans.Finally, Poland asked Japan to rescue the orphans.Japan soon decided to save the Polish orphans. Japan found and rescued the orphans who were crawling in Siberia.We Japanese did our best to rescue Polish orphans. Japan sent a total of 765 Polish orphans to Japan.The orphans were weak. And the orphans were ill.Japan gave orphans a warm meal. And Japan treated the disease of orphans. The disease of all orphans has been cured. The orphans have recovered.Many donations were collected for orphans from all over Japan. Toys were also donated.The orphans treat Japanese who take care of them like a mother.Japanese also loved the orphans as their own children. The Empress of that time also loved the orphans as their own children. Polish orphans had a good time every day.The diet of the orphans was nutritious and gave a delicious meal.On the day of parting, the orphans cried crying that they did not want to leave Japan.The Japanese also shed tears at the farewell with the orphans. Polish orphans sang the Japanese national anthem ""kimigayo"" and the Polish national anthem on the ship. All 765 Polish orphans returned safely to Poland. Japan loves Poland.If something happens to Polish children, Japan will help again.Japan handed out the Virgin Mary prayer card to all orphans. Polish orphans who always had it survived the war and lived until they were over 80 years old.And during the Second World War, the Japanese “chiune sugihara” saved more than 6,000 Jews.",6년 전,0,

@patrickscannell6370,"I practice Shinto. It's not actually as unique as is posited here. Its simply a local form of Animism with ancestor and nature worship. Animism is the belief that ""spirit"" or whatever you wish to call it (essence, chi, maori, what have you) inhabits everything. Trees, rocks, rivers, even tools and weapons. Rituals are about honouring one's ancestors and connecting with the forces of nature and keeping them in balance.   It's identical to all ancient beliefs (native american, african, siberian, chinese, polynesian, irish etc.) that are diverse only for its cultural variety, but the belief system is the same.  Also, it's not escapist, because the belief is that the world of kami, or the spirit world, intertwines with our own world. The idea that it's an escape is a western construct, where the world of ""faerie tales"" (faeries and mermaids, who are kami of forests and waters) is supposed to be imaginary. Not so in animism: that world is seen as real and present.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@dpii3927,"The Sea of Japan (or the Japan Sea) is a sea area located along the northeastern part of the Asian continent. It is separated from the North Pacific Ocean by the Japanese Archipelago and Sakhalin.  Historically, the name“Sea of Japan” was first established in Europe from the late 18th century to the early 19th century,and has been used for more than 200 years. When seas are separated from oceans, they have been frequently named after major archipelagos or peninsulas that separate them. The name“Sea of Japan"" focuses on one key geographical feature - the Japanese Archipelago that separates this sea area from the Northern Pacific Ocean.  In fact, without the presence of the Japanese Archipelago, this sea area would not exist.  Because of this obvious geographical characteristic, the name “Sea of Japan” came to be widely accepted throughout the world. At present, more than 97% of the maps used around the world, except for those in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and North Korea, use only the name “Sea of Japan"". This name has been internationally established.  Despite this global recognition, ROK and North Korea suddenly proposed that the name “Sea of Japan” should be changed at the sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names in 1992. They continue to raise this issue at related international conferences of the United Nations and at meetings of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).  They argue that the name “Sea of Japan” became widely used from the beginning of the 20th century, as a result of Japan's expansionism and colonialism. For this reason, they maintain that the name should be changed to the “East Sea,"" as ROK and North Korea domestically use,or at least, that both the “East Sea” and the “Sea of Japan” should be used together. However, the assertion made by ROK and North Korea is unfounded, and there is neither reasoning nor merit behind the call for such a change.",6년 전,1,
@dpii3927,"The survey of historical maps conducted by the ROK(Society for East Sea)in 2004 that asserts ""East Sea"" as its official name counts the terms ""Oriental Sea"" and ""Sea of Korea"" (or ""Korea Sea"") as ""East Sea,"" and compares the number of maps that use one of these terms to the number of maps that use Sea of Japan. It is apparent that ""Sea of Korea"" and ""East Sea"" are different names. Moreover, the names ""Oriental Sea"" and ""East Sea"" have completely different origins and meanings. ""Oriental Sea"" refers to the sea of the Orient from the perspective of the Occident, while ""East Sea"" means the sea on the eastern side of the Korean peninsula.",6년 전,0,

@dpii3927,"The Sea of Japan (or the Japan Sea) is a sea area located along the northeastern part of the Asian continent. It is separated from the North Pacific Ocean by the Japanese Archipelago and Sakhalin.  Historically, the name“Sea of Japan” was first established in Europe from the late 18th century to the early 19th century,and has been used for more than 200 years. When seas are separated from oceans, they have been frequently named after major archipelagos or peninsulas that separate them. The name“Sea of Japan"" focuses on one key geographical feature - the Japanese Archipelago that separates this sea area from the Northern Pacific Ocean.  In fact, without the presence of the Japanese Archipelago, this sea area would not exist.  Because of this obvious geographical characteristic, the name “Sea of Japan” came to be widely accepted throughout the world. At present, more than 97% of the maps used around the world, except for those in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and North Korea, use only the name “Sea of Japan"". This name has been internationally established.  Despite this global recognition, ROK and North Korea suddenly proposed that the name “Sea of Japan” should be changed at the sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names in 1992. They continue to raise this issue at related international conferences of the United Nations and at meetings of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).  They argue that the name “Sea of Japan” became widely used from the beginning of the 20th century, as a result of Japan's expansionism and colonialism. For this reason, they maintain that the name should be changed to the “East Sea,"" as ROK and North Korea domestically use,or at least, that both the “East Sea” and the “Sea of Japan” should be used together. However, the assertion made by ROK and North Korea is unfounded, and there is neither reasoning nor merit behind the call for such a change.",6년 전,1,
@dpii3927,"石川アリサ  Why do you think so, can you please explain me?",6년 전,0,
@dpii3927,"The survey of historical maps conducted by the ROK(Society for East Sea)in 2004 that asserts ""East Sea"" as its official name counts the terms ""Oriental Sea"" and ""Sea of Korea"" (or ""Korea Sea"") as ""East Sea,"" and compares the number of maps that use one of these terms to the number of maps that use Sea of Japan. It is apparent that ""Sea of Korea"" and ""East Sea"" are different names. Moreover, the names ""Oriental Sea"" and ""East Sea"" have completely different origins and meanings. ""Oriental Sea"" refers to the sea of the Orient from the perspective of the Occident, while ""East Sea"" means the sea on the eastern side of the Korean peninsula.",6년 전,0,

When I noticed that other Japanese were angry and were rude to him, he wrote in his native language, ""I didn't listen to the feelings of the Japanese."" I understand Korean because I can read it. He made me sad. Because of him, there were people who said bad things to other Koreans. That's strange, but It's also true that some Koreans pretend to be Japanese and do bad things.

@audioxix,"You missed out Japan being close friends and doing a lot of business with Indonesia. They have a pretty strong bond, considering their past. Also Scotland as well, as Japan and Scotland have been close for a long time. Japanese Tourist attribute to a massive chunk of the annually tourist revenue in Scotland, they also have a fondness for Scottish knitted clothing within Japan itself as we export a lot of it, Fond lovers of Whiskey and had a large export quota and had a deep connection over the brewing of their own Whiskey and I think it was the owner of Yamasaki lived in Scotland for a while to learn from a brew-master on how to make Scotch and now they export a lot of the raw materials so they can make their own and they are one of the many nations that keep the process as a close to the traditional Scottish way as possible as nod to the brew-masters. It was Scotland that was commissioned by Japan to build all the coastal lighthouses in the 1800's. Aside from that we have had a pretty long and friendly history. Our National Museum has honoured Japanese history by having a space dedicated to educating those about this amazing history and culture and also in Japan within Tokyo they have honoured Scotland by having a ""Scotland day"" within one of their museum or galleries celebrating Scottish history.  We used to get quite a lot of Japanese teenagers travelling around Scottish schools  for cultural exchange as well. It's the reason why I've been amazed and in love with Japan since I was 8 years old. Even that young being taught about the country and meeting Japanese natives was great.  When I hit my early 20's I eventually had enough money to visit and was not disappointed. Need to return and travel around more, it's a dream of mine.",6년 전,1,

There’s 90% chance that we have Big Earthquakes within 30 years(more than 3/11 ; if you haven’t known this,please search it.) It might be today,tomorrow or not. We don’t know when it comes.but it certainly occurs. So if you come to Japan,you have to know what to do if an earthquake occurs. Ex)open the door or window, hide to under the table, run to high point,know where is Evacuation site and so on “What’s!? JP is dangerous!?” We have to say “yes.” But Japan is very interesting!!

If they work less, i.e. don't feel like they always need to give 110%, just 100% is fine, they wouldn't do overtime -> they would have more time to have relationships -> they would make more babies -> they would be less stressed and suicide levels would also decrease.

@青ステイ,日本の伝統的なものも、もっとちゃんと世界の人に知って欲しいと思う。  知り合いですごい海外行くし何十年も住んでる人がいるんだけど   その人から聞いたのだけれど  偽物が通販で下駄を安く売っていて その販売してる下駄の歯のところを釘で打ち込んだりして作ってるらしく  歩いてるとその釘が出てきてしまって、すぐ壊れたり、足に釘が刺さったりして怪我をしてしまうことがあって  それで、日本人はこんなものを履いてるの？？って思っている外人さんがおる、と聞いたので 本当は違うんだよ！！！下駄の構造は歯の所は差し歯と言って、 釘を使わずにやってるんだよ！！ 歯が減っても、歯だけを取りかえることが出来て、何度も何度も愛用できるんだよ！！ ってなんだか悔しく思ってしまって、   日本のことを興味を持って着物を着たり、茶道、華道、とかそういうのをしたり 三味線を体験してみたり、刀のこと、とかを見てくれたり、 日本のことを興味持ってくれてもそういう偽物とかのを先に見てしまったり、買ってしまうと、 次本物に出逢えたとしても、すぐ壊れたからやめとこう、とか どうしても、見放されるというかなんというか、、(言葉選びが上手くなくてすみません。上手く伝えられる言葉が見つからなくて、)  日本のその伝統的なものを作っている職人さん達も年々減っていき、 継承しよう！と思う人々も少ない、、 本当に私の体がいくつもあれば、、といつもいつも思います。 これは日本だけではなく、どの国であっても、素晴らしい文化、伝統が消えるのは悲しいものです。  こんなに長くなってすみません おそらく、めちゃくちゃな文章だと思いますし、 私のこのコメントを見て、うーん、と思う方もおられると思います その時は、 ｢ああうるさいやつがだらだらと言ってるなあ〜｣と見過ごして頂けたら幸いです。  そして、下駄の知識もまだまだ浅いもので、正確にこれはこう！！とかわからないところも多々あります。 それはごめんなさい きちんと勉強します,6년 전(수정됨),1,

I can understand why u guys r knowing that that sea is called sea of japan because japan governments r paying a lot of money for example Google and world maps for stating that sea Japanese so that about some years later when almost everybody agree that Dokdo is japanese take the island WHICH CONTAINS A LOT OF UNDERGROUND RECOURCES from korea!!!! (if that sea called Donghae becomes japanese sea than it is easier to rig that Dokdo is japanese) Anyways what i want to say is DOKDO IS KOREAN and that sea comes out at 0:32 is Not Japanese IT IS KOREANNNNNNNNNN sorry guys my English is terrible but pls read the whole sentences i typed and research or learn the story about what i explained.

@繝ゥ繝シ繝繝ウ,留学してる時に、韓国人に携帯を盗まれ、売られました。私にそれを教えてくれたのも韓国人で方法は悪いですが殴って連れきてくれました。確かにその一件も含め今でも韓国人へのイメージは悪いですが、友達の彼らはとても人間味が溢れる子達です。彼らの韓国にいる友達も家族もまた一個人として触れ合えば通じ合えるものもあると思います。確かに広い目で見れば、嫌悪してしまう悪いところがたくさん見えてきます。が、それを一括りして汚い部分を批判するのはあまりに考えが浅はかだと感じます。特に国民性だけではなく同じアジアに住む人たちの人間性を批判する様な人は同じ日本国民として天皇を見習って欲しいです。こう言う、差別ともとれるものは世界中どこにでもありますし無くなるとは思いませんが、尊重するということを少しでも多くの人に考えてもらいたいですね。 つまり、ナニが言いたいかと言いますと… オメェーみてぇーな人間が原爆で犠牲になった無垢な日本国民の魂を馬鹿にすんじゃねぇーよ！！子宮に戻ってからもう一度、考え直せ！,6년 전(수정됨),9,

@tin9558, @kuwamura1234   残念ながら無理です。 理由を述べさせて貰います。 まず、韓国人にいい人がいるなんてのはみんな分かってるんです。あなたの奥さんもそうでしょう。でも、いい人が何人いて、悪い人が何人いるとかそういう問題じゃないんです。「いい人」が仮にも反日から少しでも外れたことを言えば袋叩きにあって物理的被害すら被る可能性もある。こういう未開な社会のままの韓国は国としてダメ。北と違って民主主義なのに国として変われてないのは尚更ダメ。外交、防衛という分野は相手国の国民一人一人を見ながらできるようなもんじゃない。常に国家対国家の交渉。そして国家をつくるのは他でもない国民一人一人である。 だから私はあくまで韓国は国としてバカにする。世界中もバカにしている。あなたには気の毒だがバカにするなと言われても無理。韓国はバカな国だ。はっきりと言える。誰がなんと言おうと韓国はバカな国だ。,6년 전,1,
@姓名-e7p,んち 集団を個人をあげて一般化するなよ 優秀な日本人がいますねって言われて日本人全員が優秀かって話にはならないでしょう？ 韓国人だって文化とかで日本のことが好きな人もいるんだからそれを否定するような発言をするべきじゃない。 あんたはKpopが好きな日本人は日本人じゃないとか言うんだろうな。 悪いけどあんたみたいな勝手に他人を一般化するような人は、個人が存在しない北朝鮮みたいな国がお似合いだよ あなたの方が民主主義的な考え方を持ってないと思うよ,6년 전,2,

@tin9558, @姓名-e7p  「民主主義」ってのは多数決が原則ですよ。 現に韓国人の少なくとも半数以上が異常な反日政策を支持しているのに、極々一部の開明的な韓国人を見よ、日本は妥協せよという方が民主主義に敵ってないんですが..わかります？,6년 전,0,
@tin9558, @姓名-e7p   私が日本文化が好きな韓国人を否定するような発言をいつしました？コメント消したりしてないので批判するならきちんと証拠挙げて批判してください。  「あんたは～言うんだろうな。」は完全にあなたの妄想ですよね？私はそんなこと思ってもいませんよ。勝手に他人を悪者にして叩くのやめたらどうですか？本当に、韓国が国レベルでやってることと同じくらい低級なことしてますよあなた。恥ずかしくないんですか？,6년 전,0,
@tin9558, @姓名-e7p   なぜあなたみたいな人は、特定の集団に対する批判を、その集団に属する全ての人への批判と捉えて怒ってしまうのでしょうか？ オウム真理教は犯罪集団であった、という意見に対して、「オウムの中にも良心的な人はいた！ヘイトスピーチだ！！」と吠えているようなものです。 日本語に限らず自然言語は、集団を主語に取っても、その集団に属する全ての個別単位をそれぞれ指し示すということは普通ありえないんですよ。 従ってあなたの批判は的外れです。特定の国への批判を全て人種差別や民族差別に変換して捉えて思考停止に陥るより、もっと建設的に考えた方がいいと思います。,6년 전,0,

Like white clothes would look like if something veeery embarassing happens during the period.   Plus no one knows the meaning of this sentence which is a great thing. :D (Actually now you know it but I doubt that you really get what I mean.

@佐藤かなた-l7v,こんにちは、私は日本人です！ このようにわかり易く日本のことを解説してくださって嬉しいです！ こんなにも沢山の日本のことをLoveと言ってくれる人がいる事に感動しました。  日本は特定の聖職者以外無宗教と呼ばれる人が多いです。簡単に言うと、仏教習慣を基盤とした生活ですが、神社に参拝に行ったり クリスマスを祝ったり(キリスト教徒ほどしっかりしていませんが)と宗教が混ざったような生活をしています。キリスト教徒の洗礼のような儀式がないため無宗教と言われる人が多いです。 しかし、日本では憲法第20条で信教の自由について規定してあります。 無宗教が多い一方で、様々な宗教を信仰している人も多いです。,6년 전,1,

@nanjarou103,"Great effort in the video. It is a lot of content to fit in and props for getting through so much in a short time. Just wanted to point out some things to work on if you ever redo this video: BG Music - Sounds like distinctly Chinese instruments and playing style. Maybe you can use shamisen, koto or fue instead. 9:58 Kofun Period is 300AD. Himeji Castle used in the picture in that state of development would have been around 1600s. 10:04 Heian Period translate as Peaceful period but you have a picture of a battle. Heian tends to be viewed as a Golden Age in art and literature and aristocratic culture, Although Japan uses a lot of wrapping it also has one of the best infrastructures for recycling and waste disposal. That should have some more spotlight! Random Fact: Maybe in Kill Bill Uma Thurman got a Katana from Okinawa but that is rather irrelevant. When Japanese invaded the Ryukyu Kingdom and subjected it, they issued decrees to ban any weapons to stop potential rebellions. Hence, Okinawa is the birth place of ""Karate"" or translated as ""Empty Hand"", as an art form to train in martial arts.",6년 전,0,

@ken7796,私はポーランド人です。 日本は1920年と1922年に765人のポーランドの孤児を救った。孤児はシベリアにいた。ポーランドは日本にシベリアにいるポーランド孤児を救助して欲しいと頼みました。日本はすぐに救助することを約束しました。 日本人はシベリアでポーランドの孤児を救助し続けました。 日本が救った最小の孤児は2歳の子供でした。 ポーランドの孤児は治療のために日本に送られました。 日本はポーランドの孤児に毎日温かい食事を与えました。 ポーランドの孤児は全員回復しました。 日本はポーランドの孤児をとても愛し続けました。 とても多くの日本人がポーランドの孤児を救うためにお金を寄付しました。 ポーランドの孤児はいつも笑顔でした。 当時の皇后様もポーランド孤児を自分の子供のように愛しました。そして日本は765人のポーランドの孤児をポーランドに無事帰還させました。 私はこの話を忘れません。２０１８年、ワルシャワにポーランド孤児救助記念小学校が完成しました。 日本に感謝します。 日本と日本人に神のご加護を。Dzięki Japonii.,5년 전,34,

The person who did that would had most definitely had been some old person who was aged 50+ and who won't had known any better. The oldest of generations always tend to be alot more racist due to being brought up in a far more national time period. So if you could please not create some close minded image that is completely unrepresentative of the average brit and based on the action of one low scum bag it would be very respectable of you. @katikudorei ,6년 전(수정됨),0,

@ryunevy,"Почему ты хочешь, чтоб Сахалин еще раз частью Японии? Я не русский, поэтому скажи честно все, что ты думаешь",6년 전,0,
@aleksandr1525," @ryunevy  Ладно. Для начала, я углублённо изучаю период Карафуто на Сахалине. В начале 20 века на месте столицы области была деревня Владимировка. А так же ряд других маленьких поселений в других частях острова. Когда юг Сахалина был передан Японцам, они не стали уничтожать дома и храмы русских, а так же выселять самих жителей России. За 50 лет Япония основала новый город недалеко от Владимировки. К концу 1944 года население всего острова достигло 391000 человек (До Японии было 8000 человек. В наше время, население острова составляет 490000 и постепенно уменьшается, 190000 живут в столице). После того, как русские захватили Карафуто, все храмы были уничтожены, а японцам не позволяли остаться на Карафуто из-за советской пропаганды. Большинство оставшихся зданий теперь носит закрытый военный характер, в некоторых частях столицы до сих пор используют старые японские трубы. Без Японии, Российское правительство так бы и не обратило должное внимание на Сахалин и по сей день здесь были бы одни маленькие поселения бывших узников. В наше время в Южно-Сахалинске очень мало возможностей для будущих поколений. Даже мой дед, который воевал во второй мировой войне против Японии, сказал, что будь эти земли Японскими, всё было бы намного лучше",6년 전(수정됨),4,

@rpomusic,"Bangladesh’s national flag was established from the model of the Japanese flag of the Rising Sun. The red circle on the flag expresses the sun that rises, while the green conveys the rich earth. Moreover, the red symbolizes the blood of those killed in the war of independence.  When Professor Nagoshi Futaranosuke, formerly of Takachiho University, asked about the origin of the Bangladesh national flag to Japanese Embassy in Bangladesh, the public relations official said, “Yearning for Japan.”  Bangladesh means “the country of Bengal”. Three Bengalis who pride themselves in their close ties with Japan are: Tagore, a poet who won the Nobel Prize for Asian literature; Chandra Bose, who risked his life for the independence of India; and Radhabinod Pal, a judge. Tagore was a friend of Tenshin Okakura. He visited Japan several times. Because of Chandra Bose, the Japanese supported the independence of India. Pal asserted that the Japanese were not guilty in the Japanese war crimes trial.",6년 전,2,
@mehbubulalam7889,Mr G yep but with the Bangladesh flag it's titled slightly to the left so when it's waving the sun looks as if it's moving to the centre - showing the motion of the sun amidst the lush scenery of Bangladesh!   Fun Fact: the flag of Bangladesh can be seen naturally in sunset/dawn because the sun appears red amidst the green scenery and scattering of light,6년 전,1,

I am at a beginner level but that is only in 5 days, I bought a book that is for complete beginners and I have been doing 1 lesson every day, and I my reading comprehension and understanding of Japanese has increased steadily, Grammar, how to write hiragana so far, vocabulary. I still don't know enough where I could speak it in any way fluidly or even write anything like what I am writing but well now Hiragana is no longer just a bunch of weird letters to me, but rather I can read it now, I can write and think of responses for specific things I have seen so far, like age, question of what is, who is, whose is it, simple descriptions, colours,some basic vocabulary that comes in the lessons so far, how to introduce one self, greetings and farewells, numbers, how to say if I like or dislike something, how to ask if someone likes or dislikes something. I am currently in the fifth lesson of 13 of the first of 4 books, I am planning on going through all of them as fast as possible, trying to continue my 1 lesson per day goal, hopefully eventually getting a good enough mastery of Japanese and the written language so I can start reading texts and consume media in Japanese as a way to reinforce the language skills I am acquiring, and avoid what happened with my french where I can barely even string together a sentence anymore.",7년 전,0,

@whatdamath,"This feels a bit outdated because the reality of Japan now is that pretty much everything there, including the transportation is aging. Very badly as a matter of fact. The country is in a serious denial about its own empirial downfall and its effects become apparent after visiting other Asian powerhouses like China and South Korea or even aforementioned Taiwan.    Japan WAS all this a decade ago, but since early 2000s has been in a constant freefall with the economy/population/innovation being completely overtaken by neighbors and Japan living in the illusion of past glories.   The Japanese transportation for example pales in comparison to its neighbor South Korea or the new developments in China. Its monetary system and financial transactions are also very outdated. Yes credit cards (and even bitcoin) is accepted in certain places, but I can literally pay for everything through a QR code or an NFC chip in both China and Korea. I don't even need a credit card anymore or suffer horrible transaction fees. The work culture and the education has been on a steady decline as well, with most Japanese universities consistently losing ranking to its neighbors. I could go on...but the idea is that... Similarly to how other conservative societies died out because of their inability to adapt and change, Japan in 20-30 years will most likely become just a minor power with glorious past.",7년 전,0,

As of that wasn't enough his girlfriend cheated on him with his cousin ultimately leading him to commit suicide in his apartment in Tokyo. He was my best friend I was going up to visit him this month for thanks giving however now I've changed my mind. If there's anyone out there just having a terrible time I'm sure I can't know exactly what's going on in your life but even if no one else does, I care about you all as my fellow homosapiens even the people whom I don't get along with. You are cared about and loved and if they died they are released from this mortal coil. If she left you or he left you, it's their loss. I know it gets hard but keep your head up find a friend or a child who needs you and encourage their lives you are important to someone out there they need you, they just don't know it yet.

Also, they have ""Koseki"", which is a family register that is very important for marriage and hiring etc.  I know many people who haven't married their love because it might ""sully"" their family register.

The greater Tokyo area includes Kanagawa and China prefecture, which leads to the next fact mistake. Yokohama in Kanagawa is the second biggest city of Japan. Also part of the greater Tokyo area, but should never be put together as the same city.  Sky tree is defined as one of the tallest towers or structures in the world. Apparently, it’s a big difference when deciding tales building and tallest tower. So be careful with buildings.   And last, Mt. Fuji may be seen from Tokyo, on a very clear day, cold weather, early morning. But it’s very small in the horizon. It overlooks the cities in Shiozuka and Yamanashi prefecture.   Sorry for being annoying, you had so much good stuff and amazing facts, but as a citizen of Yokohama, I just had to comment xD",7년 전,0,

@dhruboroy9784,"he is talking about Indian national army, Free india legion or AZAD HIND stupid dumbfuck gandhi was fraud it was subhas chandra bose ,hirohito and Hitler who saved india Don't believe me? well how about P.M Lord Attlee who gave india freedom  Chakraborty, who was then the Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court and was serving as the acting Governor of West Bengal, had written a letter to the publisher of RC Majumdar’s book, A History of Bengal, in which he wrote: “When I was acting governor, Lord Attlee, who had given us Independence by withdrawing British rule from India, spent two days in the governor’s palace at Calcutta during his tour of India. At that time I had a prolonged discussion with him regarding the real factors that had led the British to quit India.”  “My direct question to Attlee was that since Gandhi’s Quit India Movement had tapered off quite some time ago and in 1947 no such new compelling situation had arisen that would necessitate a hasty British departure, why did they had to leave?”  “In his reply Attlee cited several reasons, the main among them being the erosion of loyalty to the British crown among the Indian Army and Navy personnel as a result of the military activities of Netaji,”  Chakraborty said. “Toward the end of our discussion I asked Attlee what was the extent of Gandhi’s influence upon the British decision to leave India. Hearing this question, Attlee’s lips became twisted in a sarcastic smile as he slowly chewed out the word, ‘m-i-n-i-m-a-l’,” Chakraborty added. Okay mate now you can stfu",7년 전,1,

@shakalakaboom536,恕我直言，日本文化没有任何一点点东西是日本自己的。本人就在日本读大学院研究课题就是日本传统文化。 首先语言文字不用说汉字是中国的，平假名片假名都源于中国汉字的偏旁部首。 传统服饰和服，是中国汉服改造的产品。 食物寿司，如果你真的究其根源你就会知道，中国人吃寿司的时候日本人甚至还不会种小麦。 隋唐时期日本的遣隋使遣唐使带回日本的知识形成了日本传统文化的主干。这就是为什么日本建筑和唐朝建筑如出一辙。农田水利政治体制经济教育无不如是。 日本天皇，学的谁不用我多说吧。 都道府县，根据唐制改进而来，恕我直言，我们有都道府县概念的时候日本人真的不见得认识这几个字。 武士，不用说吧。 忍者，刺客和方术师的结合。 日本刀，谁教你打的刀日本人可能都不记得了。 日本是一种文化的代表这话恕我不能苟同。日本文化不过就是从中国文化上扣下来一些残渣碎块稍加改造，自诩自创罢了。,7년 전,7,

@ザクロパイ999,歴史のないアメリカよりよっぽどヨーロッパのほうが数量としては多いやろうしな＞アメリカは当時植民地が少なかったですからね。ドイツ人が言うには、「アメリカは当時フィリピンを獲得したけど、それでも植民地が少なかった。中国は色々な国が駐留している状況、マレー半島も違う国の影響下。じゃー、フィリピンの次に狙う国は何処なのか？を考えた場合、それは真っ先に日本ではないだろうか？」と…指摘していた。まさに、その通りの展開なわけです。パフォーマンスとしてアメリカ自らが東京に帝国ホテルを建設し、後にホームラン王のべーブルースが来日したわけです。そして、領土的に南西諸島が最初に狙われたわけですから、ドイツ人のその分析は正しいでしょうね。,7년 전(수정됨),0,

@fukurou8881,かか＞ああ＞ロシア軍、中国軍、自衛隊がアラスカルートで、アラスカ・カナダを抑え込むことくらい一発なことは中学生でもわかることですが、アメリカはその時点でリーチ状態になるわけです。対アメリカ戦となれば、沖縄基地など役に立たない。アラスカ・カナダ攻略となると、ユーラシア大陸ルートと、キスカ島辺りの海上ルート（東京から女満別空港を往復するくらいの距離で、ロシア軍・北海道の自衛隊にも近い位置にある）に分かれることになる。でも、これは昔の作戦シュミレーションです。今はもっと最新版の作戦があります。必ずアメリカと言う国家そのものを消滅させる手段としてのシュミレーションが、複数パターン化されて分かれています...。,7년 전(수정됨),0,

@fukurou8881,かか＞ああ＞だから、行ってるじゃん。戦争ではなく宗教価値の戦いだと。日本がキリスト教にならなかったのはそう言う事だよ。台湾も。その時の朝鮮半島近くの遼東半島は関係ない。だから、結果として日本の影響力が無かった。朝鮮半島は日露戦争の後だよ。日清は無くても日露戦争はあった。でも、日清戦争は意味的に違う。中国と戦争したわけではない。あくまで欧米側との宗教面での影響力に過ぎない。重慶や北京があるが、これは西洋諸国の依頼でそうなったわけで。中国大陸で何か暴動あった時に、日本が大陸の出先として一番近いわけだし。港に通ずる場所が重要なわけで。,7년 전(수정됨),0,

@名改,@UCTybMSEp4BiNfBKVtUG0sGw 帰化も何もないただの日本人だが何か？ 一向に理解できていない低脳さんの為に何回も言うようだけど清は、宗教の思想ではない。あくまでキリスト教に影響されただけだろ？中国大陸に存在していた国。あなたはビクトリア女王が日本などを誕生させたとか仰っていますがそんな考え改めた方がいいかと。 理解できていないようだか詳しく言うと日本人が多神教派が多いのは分かりますよね。クリスマスもあり、結婚式も教会が多く、お葬式は仏教式が多く、お正月には神社にも行く。このように沢山の宗教感が集まり、日本人は生活してきた。キリスト教の教えは「唯一の神」がメイン。日本人のように多神教派の考えを持っている人が多い為、キリスト教があまり広まらなかった。誰でも理解できるし、そこら辺にソースも転がってます。一般常識としても普通だよね？,7년 전,0,

@CryptoInvestorK,北方領土は第二次大戦時、日本が降伏した後にロシアが強引に占領しました。竹島は、具体的に日本のメディアも占領されているので判りませんが、いつの間にか強引に占領されました。死者も出ています。ガッカリして途中で見るのを辞めました。日本には、「平和憲法」と称する奴隷制度が残っています。（憲法９条）２項までは以下１　日本国民は、正義と秩序を基調とする国際平和を誠実に希求し、国権の発動たる戦争と、武力による威嚇又は武力の行使は、国際紛争を解決する手段としては、永久にこれを放棄する。 ２　前項の目的を達するため、陸海空軍その他の戦力は、これを保持しない。国の交戦権は、これを認めない。,7년 전,8,

@happyone4753,"The DNA tests on 92 LIVING KHASIS by the Genographic Project of National Geographic and subsequently confirmed by other DNA tests prove their ancient age - 57000 years. The DNA tests should be extended to many more Khasis to confirm their real age as Khasis believe they arrived about 120000 years ago at present day Khasi-Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya at the foothills of the Himalayas. They also spread out to modern day Vietnam, China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar etc. Visit the Heritage of Japan website where Researcher Aileen Kawagoe names the Waar (War) of Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya India as one of the Genetic sources of Early Japanese. The name Japan comes from the Khasi phrase 'Ai Ja Pa' meaning 'Give me rice Father'. This gradually shortened to 'Ja Pa' meaning 'Rice Father'. Other Khasi stories tell of 'Pan Ja' meaning 'Ask for Rice' or 'Ja Pan' which literally translates into 'Rice Ask' as the origin of the name Japan. From the Khasi-Jaintia Hills, they landed by boat at the place where stands now the most ancient Kashi ma Shrine and Kashima city so named after Khasi Ma or Khasi Mei or Mei Khasi meaning Khasi Mother. Like their Khasi-Jaintia ancestors who believed that they descended from Heaven, the earliest Japanese Fudoki believed that the Kashima/Khasi Ma Celestial God descended from Heaven. The Khasi have a Sun Goddess 'Ka Sngi.' The Japanese too have a Sun Goddess - Amaterasu Omikami. The Khasis have a white rooster as their most important symbol. The white Rooster is an auspicious symbol for Japanese Shinto. The Khasis never had any written history just oral history. Many secrets were passed down orally among a select few. Now with DNA technology, it is time to tell these ancient stories which would have been laughed at earlier. There are many many more ancient secrets among the Khasis and Jaintias of Meghalaya State, lying at the foothills of the Himalayas. Remember, they arrived where they are at least 57000 years ago. To put that into context, the Hindu civilization is just 5000 years old. Amanda Huang in her writing 'DNA profiles of Han Taiwanese' also links the Taiwanese with the Khasi Austro-Asiatic people. From the Khasi Hills, after arriving out of Africa, about 57000 - 120000 years ago, the Khasis spread all over the world. They set up the Sumerian, Babylonian & Phoenician kingdoms. Their traces are found in so many places. Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian called Britain Cassiteriades or Kassiterides, the Khasi Tin Islands. They were all over Britain but were called different names. They mined Tin, Gold, Silver and grew wheat. Their ancient name for Britain was Ka Dew Lynnong Pyrdain or The Isle of Pyrdain meaning in Khasi ‘The Island of Wisdom’. They also called Britain 'Bilat' after the White Limestone Cliffs of Dover.Julius Caesar names a Cassi tribe which fought against the Romans under their Chief Cassi-Vellaunus. Caesar landed around the Wantsum Channel and crossed the River Thames at the Kew ford. 'Wan Sum' in Khasi means 'Come and bathe'. The Kew or Quay Hoh Gardens are named after the Cassi or Khasi harvest chant Hoh Kew or Hoi Kew. Kew means wheat in Khasi & the Cassi tribe is known to have grown wheat in Britain. The Khasi / Cassi name for the third largest city of Roman Britain was Hangne-ruh-la-mih-Um, later shortened to Uerulamium and then to Verulamium. In Khasi it meant 'Here too water has come out'. 'La Mih Um' means 'Water has come out'. Present day Colchester city was known in pre-Roman times as Ca-mulo-don-um. 'Ka mluh don um' is a Khasi phrase meaning 'There is salt in the water'. The old name of Thames in Khasi is Them Sum. The area around the Thames was then a low-lying area covered in water, much more than now. 'Them' in Khasi means low-lying. 'Them Sum' means 'low-lying area for bathing'. It gradually became Thames. Ask any Khasi. He will say that Cheddar Man looks like a typical rural Khasi villager. THE PHOENICIAN TIN MINES OF CASSITERIDES OR CORNWALL - Tin which was used in many parts of the then world was partly obtained from the Phoenician Tin-mines of Ancient Britain. The Ictis or Mictis name was applied by the Greeks to the Phoenician tinport at St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall, on the Sea of Icht. This Western Tin-land was ""The country of the Kussaia or Kassi people,"" It thus would account for the name ""Cassi-terides""; and Kassi is sometimes spelt with u in cuneiform script. The Greek word for Tin was Kassiteros because it was the Phoenicians otherwise known as the Kassi who were famous for mining Tin. In Britain, they were broadly known as the Keltic tribes. By the time of Julius Caesar’s first invasion of Britain in 55 BC, the Cassi were mining Tin, Gold and Silver not only in Cornwall but all along the coast of Britain. The Cav-Casia or today's Caucasus mountains (Pliny the Elder 's Natural History, 77-79 AD, called them by what the Greeks knew them - Kau-Khasis, the Scythians called the Caucasus - Kroy Khasis) , the Cas-pian sea, the Kassite Kingdom of Babylonia, the Kashi kingdom in Northern India, the holy city of Varanasi was the ancient Khasi city of Kashi, the city of Kashan in ancient Persia around which there was a Kassi tribe, the Catti tribe of Germany, the Casses in France, the ancient Celtic,the Ecossais, Cassi, Picts, Etruscans - all descend from this most ancient Khasi tribe. They were matrilineal & erected Monoliths wherever they lived for a long time. They also wore distinct tartan shawls. Today, the present day Khasis still maintain their Sacred Forests, refuse to sell their lands which have rich uranium deposits in spite of being offered huge bribes, have monoliths all over the Khasi Hills, build awesome Living Root Tree Bridges (MUST SEE), still practise their Khasi herbal traditional medicine, pass their surnames through the mothers, give their inheritance to the youngest daughter, preserve the world's oldest living religion and have a priesthood similar to the ancient Druids. Above all, many specially in the villages live simple but happy lives. Looking at them you would’nt believe that from the Khasi Hills was born some of the greatest civilisations of the world. Just like looking at rural poor Khmer Cambodians (descendants of the Khasis), you would not imagine that they set up the mighty Khmer Empire and the great, magnificent Angkor Wat visited by millions of tourists annually. Many Khasis and Jaintias have become Christians converted by Welsh, Irish, English, Scottish, Germans, Italians, Spanish, French, American and Maltese missionaries. But a significant size of the population remain with their ancient Khasi religion, the oldest living religion of the world.",7년 전,1,

@ヤマトウズメ-c1x,"fromthe Let's make the Co-Prosperity Sphere Japan  It was mid-war day that began one thousand nine hundred thirty-seven years, in Japan is already 1940, already the North China of China, placed under the control of the part of the Central China, the ruledis a pro-JapaneseWang Jingwei(Chomei O)had been left to the Nanjing government ofgovernment. In general it is said that the Sino-Japanese War lasted eight years, but in fact the battle during the day ended in about a year and a half, and the Japanese army did not try to expand the territory any more, and infrastructure construction in the occupied area , I focused on economic construction. In the dominant area, the economy, finances, prices, security were stable, the lives of the people were as different as heaven and hell compared to others. A railroad was also created, making people and supplies easier to move. Often it is said that ""Japanese army plunder and destroy unilaterally"", but in reality it was totally reversed. That is why the Nanjing government of Wang Shi and many other Chinese who supported it supported Japan and collaborated with Japan to work for the development of that area. In the area dominated by the Nanjing government of Wading signs, more than before the war more peaceful and prosperous was enjoyed. The symbol is Shanghai. Even during the Sino-Japanese War, the dance hall and the movie theater were packed everywhere and it was booming. The residential areas of the Jews who fled from Russia were also set up in Shanghai, where they lived safely. On the other hand,the area where Chiang Kai-Shek or Mao was dominating was miserable. Even just as their troops came in, not only food shortages, looting, exploitation rampant, so the inhabitants fell into hellish life. Although Chiang Kai-shek did the ""new life movement"" aimed at a disciplined lifestyle like the Japanese, and tried to correct the disoriented discipline of the Chinese soldier, but still can not bear fruit quite did. during the Sino-Japanese War, Americaso-called ""Chi Chi routeIt is well known thatsent various supplies to the Chiang Kai-shek army in Chongqing through the"". Weapons, ammunition, medicines, food, etc. However, while crossing the mountain and crossing the river, the amount of goods delivered to Chongqing has been reduced to a fraction of the original amount at most. It was because I handed some supplies as a toll to the pirates who control those areas and other armed groups. At that time, in China mainland other than the dominated region of Japan, there are about 20,000 bandits. It is about 10 times the Chinese army. Theyearned a living by plunder. Also, the goods that arrived safely in Chongqing also entered the pocket of KMT executives and did not reach other people. It is famous that the Chiang Kai-shek government of those days was devastating the support of the United States like this. In this way, there was a marked difference in the lives of the Chinese people between the dominant areas of Japan and those not. Japan has already taken great efforts to establish China as a modern democratic nation since the middle of the Japan-China War, and to cooperate together as a companion of Asia to create a co-prosperity zone. However, the hope was also frustrated by Japan 's defeat in the Japan - US War eventually. At that time, Japan did not destroy the factories, facilities, infrastructure etc. made in China, but with all accurate asset lists, it left it for the future of China.These were the foundations of the development of the Chinese economy after the war. When Japan left, the ""Civil war civil war"" again in China, ie the civil war army and the civil war civil war broke out. This was practically a scrambling of the heritage left by Japan. And the dead in this civil war was more than the dead during the Sino-Japanese War. Also, when the Communist Army victorious in this country's civil war and unified China, the Communist Party will advertise the slaughter, looting, exploitation, etc. of the Chinese people they had done to the young people by advertising it as all Japanese troops I started education. When I posted these Chinese history in ""remnant magazine"" before, one Japanese said ""I did not know that there was such a thing, it is different from what is commonly said in the public"" It was. However, onestudying in JapanChinese Christiangave me a letter, but he wrote: ""Theteacher is writing the truth about China,please do your best"" People who know Chinese also know. 大東亜共栄圏",7년 전,0,

I'm assuming this was just a minor mistake caused by the fact that capital i looks like lower-case L. The Japanese language actually doesn't have the letter L, which is why they use R to create a similar sound for borrowed / foreign words (hence why jokes about the Japanese accent always has L's exchanged with R's).",7년 전,18,

@和煕田村,確かにあなたは自身のことを愛国者だとでも思っているのでしょう。しかし、あなたのような発言は受け取りようによっては大きく変わってきます。 まず、韓国人がダムなどを破壊したいと言っているとありますが、それはどこの情報ですか？反日韓国人の方々は言っているかもしれません。しかし普通の韓国の市民はどうでしょう。その施設の恩恵に預かっている人達。その施設で働いている人達も。はたして破壊されたいと思っている人の方が多いのでしょうか？だとしたら住民投票して現地がとっくに解体していてもおかしくないのでは？その破壊されたいという意見は反日の妄言かと思います。それをそのまま現地の意見として鵜呑みにするんですか？  しかしそれよりもあなたの発言で1番眉をひそめたのが「核」です。核を使って破壊？しかも自衛隊が協力？ なぜダムの解体に核爆弾なのでしょうか。そのような実例は聞いたことありません。建造物には詳しくないですがTNT爆薬で十分なはずです。核を使う必要性がわかりません。もし提案ならこんなとこで言わないで公の場でなさったらどうです？ここで言っててもただの妄想と捉えられても仕方ないでしょうに。どちらにせよ唯一の被爆国、日本の愛国者がいうような発言とはとても思えませんが。  いいですか。あなたのような発言を見た時に「恥ずかしい」と思う人が一定数いるわけです。メディアリテラシーの欠けらも無い。軽々しく核を撃てなどと。 そういう人たちからとってすれば、あなたは同じ日本人としては信じられない「反日」なのです。,7년 전,2,
@2456tack,服部蔵人  他国を非難する事と愛国心を同列に論ずる事は出来ません。日本を愛する理由は韓国が嫌いだからです、なんて文章は成り立ちませんよね？  貴方の言う意味が分かりません。,7년 전,0,
@和煕田村,主張です。 ･ダムなどを破壊する行為は、あなたが考えてないにしろ一般人には影響を及ぼす。 ･TNTで破壊するなら別にいい。ただしれっきとした工事として行うなら。ダムの解体工事って恐らくTNTか、その他の爆薬を使うので。核はコストがかかるし威力の無駄。 ･上で「韓国人が破壊したい」とコメントしているので、反日韓国人のことを言いたいのであればそう書くべき。誤解を招くので。 ･メディアリテラシーを身につけましょう。 ･私は嫌韓を非難してるわけじゃない。そんなの人の自由だしあなたのように数々の経験をしてきた方は確固たる主張を持っていることでしょう。けれど「核を撃ってさしあげる」などという意見を言うあなたの心中を知りたかっただけ。恥ずかしいと思わないのか、と。何の不満か…言うならばなぜそういう意見なのかわからないという不満ですね。 ･よって本物の韓国ヘイトスピーカーに文句を言う必要は無い。ヘイトスピーチではなくあなたの意見について議論しているのですから。というかあなたにも文句は言ってません。批判しつつ質問をしただけです。文句を言うことなんてないですもの、迷惑してる訳じゃないので。  最後に質問です。 みなさんコメントに返信する時に、文章の最初には返信先の名前が書いてありますよね？あれは返信ボタンを押すと自動的に出てくるものなのですか？それともいちいち書いているのですか？私は返信ボタンを押しても何も出てきません。,7년 전,1,

@feintatlas8594,"哔哩哔哩战忽局局长 为啥呢？有病是不是。 I’m assuming you speak English considering the fact that you took all these comments over onto Bilibili and presumably translated them. You’re so adamant about not forgiving? Half the world hated Germany after World War Two, but you don’t see people deliberately trying to belittle Germany now. I️ know what Japan did to China, I️ know what Japan did to a lot of countries, and it’s horrible. However, Japan has changed, its not the elitists, blood thirsty, imperial japan from the 1940’s. It also seems some people seriously don’t know how to differentiate the country from its people, like, “I️ hate this country, it’s past actions and it’s government so that means it’s justified to hate all its citizens and people ethnically related to it as well, even though they’re not even remotely at fault for any of it” ha, no. Whatever “cover up” of history their government decides to do is not their fault and therefore should not be pinned on them. A ton of people have that mentality about China too, China’s not exactly an international pacifist and I️ get suuuper pissed off when I️ see idiots in comments sections hating on every aspect about China because of some stupid political debate between China and America, their personal anecdotal experiences with some Chinese people or because china’s done something to their country. Y’all just make too many generalizations 🤦🏻‍♀️. Sure, chinese people are still being discriminated against by some Japanese and Vice versa, that’s literally every single country that’s had conflicts in the past; but, your saying I️, essentially, got “called out” for saying that not all chinese people hate Japan’s guts and for trying to be a decent person?

(My family is full of females.) -Me, 95.7% Chinese. -You should hopefully get the point.  Total: 15 People, or most and close to all of my family. Both dead and alive, there would be about over 550 people.  Surprisingly Zhuang Chinese -My Grand Uncle, who is 21% Zhuang. -My Great Great Great Great Great Great Grandfather, Cai Mang, who was 99.5% Zhuang, and started the Zhuang blood line.  Total: About 4 Zhuang Chinese are left in my family. Both alive and dead, the total would be 10. Only 2 of them were full Zhuang.  Korean -I actually have no idea. Im only 0.7% Korean.  Total: Not sure, but probably 5. Both dead and alive, there would...um...i dont know.  Japanese -My Father, who is 17.5% Japanese. -My Grand Mother from my fathers side, who is 92.7% Japanese. -My Grand Father from my fathers side, who was only 35% Japanese. The rest was Han Chinese and possibly a tiny bit of Korean. -About 7 of my Cousins. Rubi, Mibashi, Amasaiku, Amatatsu, and the rest will be unnamed. -My Great Grand Father from my fathers side, and so on. -My Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Grand Father, who was probably named Mitsuhashi, is the person who probably started my Japanese family tree. Dont know how they married my Chinese ancestors though. My Grandmother from my fathers side has a picture of Him in Her Kitchen and Living room, which is very surprising. How though?  So, in total, There are 79% Han Chinese in my family. 3% Zhuang Chinese in my family. 2% Koreans in my family, dont know how. 16% Japanese in my family, dont know how.  Im about... 95.7 Chinese -93% Han -2.5% Zhuang  Japanese -4.7% Japanese 98% Japanese 1% Ainu  Korean I dont even know. Why waste your time reading this?    By the way, My 35% Japanese Grand Fathers brother is the one who is Zhuang Chinese. Its complicated. Im confused. Stop reading.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

I don't want to assume your nationality, but you're probably Chinese or Korean, so for you, the Japanese Sea is indeed on the east. So if you want to call it like that, do it, but you can't convince me like that. You need a Universal designation for that area of the sea, and east sea is not east to anything except for China and Korea. So it's fine if you call it east sea, but for Japan and the rest of the world, we need a different name. Japanese Sea is pretty self-explanatory, just because it's a sea by Japan, a part of the Pacific that's specified by the Japanese islands. (And the Korean peninsula, before you get offended)",7년 전,0,

I think Japanese Sea is the easiest way to deal with that, and east sea is like an alternative way maybe? I understand that this is how you call it since ancient times, but that doesn't mean anybody has to call it the east sea. Also china, wasn't that the center kingdom? Nobody calls it like that, just because it's not center to anyone except for China.

Yes, you do not care about the small islands that float in the middle of the sea. Do you think you are fighting for the island? Do you know in detail why you stick to that little island? One of the reasons why the resources buried under Dokdo is so great is ...The underground resource of Dokdo is methane hydrate and there is a resource called 'burning ice'. I'll let you know exactly what this support is. One liter of methane hydrate contains up to 200 liters of gas. Methane hydrate contains methane gas which is 170 times the gas volume. Methane hydrate is located in cold regions such as Alaska in the US, Siberia and the Poles in Russia, and in deep seas. The total amount of methane hydrate is converted to natural gas, which can be used for 500 years based on the energy currently used by humankind.That's why Japan is doing hoaxes and distortions with the power to die ... I'll tell you more by reference. How much history do you learn when you are a student? I know that I do not learn the history of Asian culture in detail. So that's one of the reasons you guys know the Sea of Japan, not the East Sea ... To be honest I am sorry for you ... I am really sorry that you do not want to learn your country or history that you will not teach a proper history ... I'm going to let you know to correct your misunderstanding.I am now fighting against Japanese atrocities just as my ancestors once fought against Japan to defend their country.

Ever since the island has been removed from jurisdiction of Japan by the Allied Supreme Command, it has been returned to Korean jurisdiction. The Allied Supreme Command has yet to overrule this order (in fact, the ASC no longer exists since Japan has been granted complete sovereignty), and thus the island does officially belong to South Korea. Unfortunately, there always have been bloody imbeciles who exploit ignorance and subsequent blind nationalism for their own political gains and muddy the reputation of such a fine country.   If the territories were taken over by the three countries, why haven't Japan brought any of the three to the ICJ for the past several decades? The  politicians know that the truth is not in their favor, and are content to merely use it as a spark of nationalism and political support.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

@PXGKOREA,"Oikawa Kohsuke Read this. if you can jaap  This paper reveals the function and nature of Dajō-kan(太政官, The Supreme Council of State, The Grand Council of State) that the nation""s top governing body in early Meiji(明治), and analyzes the meaning and effect of the Dajō-kan Directive (指令) related to the sovereignty of Dokdo in 1877. Dajō-kan was not the highest authority of the administration, which is generally understood in Korea but the nation""s top governing body to supervise the legislation, jurisdiction and administration. Dajō-kan Directive(指令) had made void the decision of the judiciary in some cases. There are the Fukoku(decreed, 布告), Tasshi(delivery, 達), Notification and Directive(指令) of the legislation issued by the Dajō-kan. By the Kobun-shiki(公文式, an Imperial edict) was promulgated in 1886, the Fukoku and Tasshi changed into law, and the rest is absorbed by the Cabinet office ordinance and Ordinance of the Ministry. Directive(指令) is the answer with the nature of an authoritative interpretation to the subordinate institution’s inquiry. Therefore, the Dajō-kan Directive (指令) related to the sovereignty of Dokdo in 1877 can be seen as an authoritative interpretation of Dajō-kan to the inquiries of the Department of the Interior and Shimane Province. However, because the Dajō-kan Directive was concerned with the determination of the territory (sovereignty), it was able to think as the effect on the whole Japan as well as on its subordinate institutions. That Dajō-kan Directive of 1877 can be said with the same values such as a territorial clause of the Constitution. Unless the legislation at that time contradict the current legislation, the effect would be able to be judged that continues even today. Therefore, the Dajō-kan Directive of 1877 that confirmed that Dokdo belonged to Korea can be considered valid even today.",7년 전,0,

@SIG442,"Technically speaking World War 2 is still very much alive between Russia and Japan, even if neither is really acting aggressively towards each other. Not just the 2 mentioned islands in this video are part of the dispute, but also Hokkaido in it's entirety. Russia wants all 3 islands before it's willing to sign a peace treaty with Japan. Japan wants to have the 3 islands back under it's own control for good.  America attacked Japan first by using their own fighters who were based on China's mainland, repainted them to look Chinese and attacked mainland Japan with them. Japan was not fooled and returned the favor with Pearl Harbor, Japan is not to blame that the American's intentionally blocked communication to maximize outrage on America's mainland so that they could legally go to war with Japan. In other worse, it was one of their dirty schemes to be in another war. Another war? Yes, if you thought that America was not present in any other wars after or before the civil war you are seriously misinformed. And yes, they also were present in World War 1 even if it was in minor capacity.  If you were a workaholic, or at least were forced to work insane hours, you wouldn't feel the need to start a family either. Work is everything in Japan to insane lengths, even till death follows due to that job. This all thanks to the older generations that think it's a excellent solution to the problems that face the country. Which obviously seems to fail miserably.",7년 전,0,

I only found out recently, I watched videos of Japanese people singing Bulgarian folklore songs, playing Bulgarian folklore instruments and dancing Bulgarian folklore dances and I was so touched I cried! I've decided to bring little Bulgarian souvenirs when I come to Japan to give to the people I make friends with. Do you think that's appropriate?

@arthas640,"I read a book about the evolution of languages and they mentioned a scale that's used to rank how difficult it is to learn one language vs another (like French to English/English to French). the scale was 0 to 5, 0 being a local dialect such as American English to British English, 1 being a more regional dialect with a thick accent or alot of specific slang like American to Cockney, 2 was a mutually intelligible language where alot of the words are very similar like some of the Scandinavian languages or the Romance language (Spanish and Italian and French), 3 were language outside of the same language family like English to Russian, and 4 were languages that werent even remotely close like English to Swahili. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese were a few of the only level 5 languages due to incomprehensible alphabets, alien syntax, and the languages being almost completely unrelated to any other languages on earth. On average they said it took about 5 times as long (measured in hours of study and practice) to go from most Western languages to Japanese as it did to go from a language like French to English. Even going from some languages like English to Thai or Vietnamese took much less time then Japanese, Korean, and Chinese.",7년 전,1,

@DetectiveRackham,"A bit  late reply, but here it is.    It is objective fact that Japan has stronger economy and thus more money to throw at others. Should this case actually be taken to ICJ, public opinion is extremely likely to not be in favor of the truth. Koreans know how the international politics work. Take a look at world maps, and you will notice that it is common to see the sea east of Korea labeled ONLY as ""Sea of Japan"". Money and military dictates international politics, and diplomacy is merely the means of saving faces and minimizing the apparent role of violence and threat of war/violent methods to achieve goals.",7년 전,1,
@DetectiveRackham,"You can also think conversely; if Japanese government truly believe that their territory has been taken over, than why haven't they taken this to the ICJ against Korea already? Why would someone NOT sue someone who took their stuff without sane reason? Japan know that they are not correct, and believe that it would not be in their best national interest to possibly reveal their 'weak points' they so desperately have been covering up.",7년 전,1,
@DetectiveRackham,"You, personally, are not strange. For your convenience, I will give you an analogy; if China were to claim today that the city of Rome belongs to China and that Italy is illegally occupying the Chinese territory, why would Italy even bother to go to ICJ? There is no reason to bring to the 'ironically ineffective and fair' organization such a ridiculous claim, for doing so would indirectly affirm that the city of Rome indeed is a disputed territory between Italy and China. China has nothing much to lose, while Italy must unnecessarily risk the ownership of the city of Rome should bribery and threats turn the tide in their disfavor.   There simply is no reason to even bother with such an issue, when your act of recognizing is exactly what the persecutors want you to do; similar to how bullies and trolls want your attention, and any act of you giving them attention is their victory, with possible bonus of getting YOU into trouble too. Majority of countries in the world are rational actors, and diplomats are (hopefully) smart and intelligent enough to 'not feed the trolls'.",7년 전,1,
@DetectiveRackham,"Japan's apparent confidence against Korea also comes from their need to appear strong to their own people. Japan is not having an easy time appearing strong against China or Russia (remember that time when Russian military aircraft circled around Japan...again?), so the only source of obtaining nationalistic confidence is the relatively-weaker Korea.   Even then, any attempt by either sides to militarily change the current borders and territories will be met with military action from the US against the aggressor. Currently, regardless of anything else, the Dokdo island is under Korean jurisdiction with approximately 40 inhabitants and coast guard office; any attempt by Japan to capture the island will be regarded as unacceptable aggression and will be dealt with by combined ROK-US forces. Any casualties of coast guards will be regarded as war crime committed against civilians.  In conclusion, all these talks are nonsensical and useless. Borders and territories will stay as they currently are between Japan and Korea, and the US will terminate alliance with whichever one dares invade the other. Unfortunately, Japan has infinite-times more instances of invading other countries on their own and colonizing it, compared to Korea, throughout the 20th century.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

Students in Japan learn Joyo Kanji (everyday-use kanji) which is 2,136 as of year 2010.  I know from my own study and experience (because I live in Japan) that not many Japanese people know more than 2000.    Some words which may have a more difficult kanji might be written in just hiragana without kanji, or written with kanji plus the furigana pronunciation along side the kanji.  For example, hiragana can be written with kanji (平仮名) but most people I know write it without kanji (ひらがな).  And yes, I agree that many Chinese people can understand or guess the meaning of Japanese signs and restaurant menus by looking at the kanji.  I have seen this happen.  Error #2: You said, ""A small 3% are Christian.""  Most source that I found state Japan is about 1% Christian.  However, many pastors and Christian missionaries will say, ""less than 1%.""

@ddlc_monika,"another side note for the friendzone: due to the american invasion and occupation (okinawa, read into it for... an eventual update or second round of these?) the country may have close ties, but the people see americans more as tourists than anything else and kinda like to keep their distance.  They struggle a lot with English since they kinda know they need it everywhere but the letters just don't make sense to them.  On that note, their best european real friends (they all really just romantize france) are Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal. As a German (speaking Japanese which may play into it), I see their faces visibly relax when they find out I am not an American (well, and kinda speak their language), and most old people are actually very interested in my country, and due to them never having the culture of regret that germany went through they still see us as Axis buddies (Italy not so much curiously), some old people even like to sind german war songs in the middle of a train ride (happened three times to me, different ojii-sans).   So maybe it's just an impression, but also regarding Visa Status (we got 6 months travelers visa for quite a while, now it's normed to three) they still love Germany a lot.  Also we kinda taught them how to medicine, and many words for sicknesses in kanji directly translate to german (for instance Sodbrennen which is 胸焼 literally translating to ""chest + burn"" which is what the german word also means)",7년 전,3,

When he was alive they never referred to him by his given name but called him ""His Majesty the Emperor"" or ""His Majesty"".  Compare, ""The Knights Who Until Recently Said 'Nee!'""  The Japanese have a system of honorifics which totally modified the verbs depending on who you were speaking to, and you used the tip-top honorifics when speaking to an Emperor, which are forms of speech the young Japanese have probably forgotten entirely.

The Rising Sun represents Japan's military over, at this point, the last 150 years, all the good and bad included.  Colonizing wasn't for anyone's sakes. Japan didn't want to be bullied anymore, and played the part of the bully to protect itself. Not unlike the current Kim regime.  Their actions are reasonable, but not ethical.  Neither are justified in what they did.  The point, again, is that the Nazi regime replaced the German flag with their own flag. And then they were deposed, the flag eventually returned.

@redfish337,"Japan was minding its own business.   It was forced open by Western powers.  They looked around the world and saw colonization and domination by the west.  Africa was cut up. Colonies were still all around the world. China was subject to unequal treaties. And the Westerners were now interfering with Japanese affairs... indirectly culminating in the overthrow of the +250 year old government.   Unable to directly get the foreigners out of their affairs through their antiquated military, the new government played a long game that would focus on rapid modernization in order to make a Japan strong enough to gain independence from the foreigners. Included in this was the eventual annexation of Korea and Machuria for resources and as a geographic buffer from China and Russia.  They gained a lot of the new territory using similar sorts of slimy methods that the West had used. And they treated the people they annexed horribly. No ethics, and likely fueled by racism and nationalism- there's no excuse.  But the basic point- protect Japan from the land-grabbing and meddling West, even if that meant undertaking their own landgrabbing and meddling, was quite logical.  Now that most borders and such are pretty much settled, this may seem drastic. But they weren't back then.  The US had just mugged Mexico for California and what is now the SW USA in 1848, about 15 years earlier.  European borders were by no means set, especially in areas like Poland and Ukraine that served as a buffer zone between Russian and the rest of Europe. Countries were constantly at war for territory, and if you didn't want someone to take your land, you needed to be able to protect it.  Kyuushuu is closer to Korea than it is to Tokyo. It is more or less indefensible to an invasion through Korea. So yes, the threat was real, and they did what they thought they had to to survive in a world full of wolves.",8년 전(수정됨),2,
@schokolade1833,"Totally agree on what Japan did for their survival method. And Korea or any other country would have done the same thing if we were on a situation you were in. But, again and again, this is about how you face the past so as not to happen again. Well this, is however applied to all humans, who made whole conflicts and war seem inevitable. Any western countries you mentioned are also responsible. Time has changed and it is less likely to happen any sort of war. But clearly we can learn something from, don't we? I believe Korea/ China should move on from the past, understanding the Japan's situation back then. But wouldn't it be ideal if Korea says what you did inevitable and Japan says we are fully responsible despite of that? Not just Japan i am talking about.  For many countries, however, the idea of taking all responsibility often face a massive condemn from their country inside, often by nationalists- well apparently they talk only about their story all over again!  Remember things would have changed if Japan made a small genuine gesture for victims. Some of things you said is, again , true. But that leads to nowhere since you are talking for Japanese sake. If you are talking about all the nationalism going on around the world, then yes. Even though the war is less likely to happen, the basic notion that led to the wars is the same.  And the very idea you mentioned ""the Rising Sun flag is much more likely to be used in the defense of Korea than in an attack on Korea "" evidently shows how distorted your thoughts are. And we will see.",8년 전,1,

Between 1967 and 1978 the ORTF channel also had a ""japanese evening"" program slot, that showed movies like Mirai kara kita shōnen Super Jetter, Hakuja-den and Obake no Q-tarō. Speaking of UFO Robot Grendizer, known in Italy as Goldrake, like many other series the 1978 italian dub was based on the french adaptation and not the japanese original, as the name Goldrake is derived from Goldorak, a made-up name created for the french dub, from Goldfinger+Mandrake.",8년 전,4,

@redfish337,"Japan didn't close until sometime in the 1600s.  Westerners didn't even get to Japan until sometime in the 1500s. The Portuguese were the first, but this was the stage of history when proselytizing was as much if not more a political power play than actually about religion. And since this was a power consolidation stage of Japanese history after a long period of upheaval, that sort of foreign influence was deemed harmful and they were largely removed. Tempura, and probably a bunch of other things, has Portuguese roots though.  Even when they were closed, they still traded with Asia, and had one Dutch port in Nagasaki.  Japan was forced open again in the mid 1800s... ~80 years before WWII. Westerners immediately began meddling in Japanese affairs, and in short order, the shogunate which had reigned over the closed period was removed and the emperor brought back to power. Having been forced open and meddled with, and having seen the global colonization by the West- and where colonization was impossible, unequal trade treaties... Japan underwent rapid modernization so as to protect itself... which eventually led to something along the lines of a better to join the bullies than be bullied sort of thought process that fed the ultra-nationalism that led to the Asian wars up to and including WWII.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

Hiragana is often used for grammar, or you can also use them for words like some kanji end with hiragana you could write たのしい or 楽しい. Japanese hiragana and katakana are very easy to learn as long as you have motivation and writing in Japanese is not that hard either once you get stuff sorted.

They are too obedient, they never complain, they would just suffer instead, and they dont express much opinion, they are not  such a passionate  or close friendlinsess or social people(respectful yes, but not friendly). Every european country is different too. In spain people are extremely chatty opinionated ,,real, open, and social,very friendly.

@animalkindness,"Quantum Witcher  ok , living and visiting Japan is very different. one for example, myself, I have lived in Mexico, Spain, Germany, Japan and USA. Ive lived years in each country, not visited, But lived locally. I also speak   spanish and Japanese and english, but not german. In Oldness, it doesnt compare to Europe lol, the very apartment building your living in in Europe has been there for hundreds of years, the bridges,The alley ways, everything. The difference is that Japan built everything by Wood, Europe by stone, Stone stands forever. Japan reminds me of new york on steroids, Going on a train ride from Hiroshima to kobe all the way to Osaka is difficult to distinguish when your in a new city if your not from Japan, its All a long line of endless  steel concrete buildings.japanese city and architecture is very industrial.Thats very american which Japan copied., European countries have rules to preserve everthing, thats why you dont see industrial type american/japan type cities, steel concrete highrise in europe with the long steel highrise buildings etc. In Spain Alot of towns and cities have rules that nothing can be built higher than the catedrals as to preserve architecure and beauty and not let industrialness overcome. .Japanese are friendly but You dont get what Im saying, Japanese people are not the type to express themselves and relax fully, and be opinionated, and very uptight, They behave way too well, and are much more quiet.   They are not friendly in the sense of being very chatty and warm and close like europeans can be . Also when the last time I lived in Japan 8 years ago, I cant say for now as I dont know if things changed, But I got annoyed often how I was spoken to in broken english  becuz of my face regardless if I was speaking in Japanese when I went to some places, though it didnt happen all the time. I guess its just little things that annoy you when you live in a country so long and want to feel more integrated instead of being treated like a tourist . Atleast in Europe its very used to people coming  from all over the world and to feel integrated.  I like Japan, its nice, but its definatly a more very uptight ,very strict,very  formal society moreso than others, thats my problem with it, Im not saying its some kind of horrible country, Materialistically I love Japan there is no funner place in the world, but it suffers in a  human aspect ,closeness relationship social aspect.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

@lissandrafreljord7913,"Japan is like a mix between Germany, England and France. It is an island nation, where people drive on the left side of the road, and people are overly polite, and they have a royal family, very much like England. But Japan is also very industrious, excelling in engineering and manufacturing, much like the Germans. Big automotive and electronic industries such as Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Hitachi competing with Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes Benz and Siemens. The Japanese are very much career oriented like the Germans, (though they work hell lot longer, and are probably a little less efficient), and have a very serious outlook in life (why else is the suicide rate so high). Their culture is also one that is promotes artistic balance like the French, as seen through their appreciation of good food, traditional architecture and landscaping, modern infrastructure, and traditional and modern fashion. Food such as sushi is served in gourmet style that is aesthetically simple and pleasing, but also very hard to master, requiring particular skills and training very much like French recipes. Japan is also the country with the most number of Michelin 3-Star restaurants.

I would even agree that for most purposes it doesn't make sense to view all of Kanto as being connected to Tokyo. My point is that when Barby says ""After the Greater Tokyo/Kanto region, you have the next largest cities..."" he can't very well follow up with a Kanto city that's already been counted. He does say that Tokyo is the world's biggest city and many would agree with that interpretation, including the national government. But of course there are many ways to measure cities.

In the year -40,000, it was here and you could walk to it; and some people walked to it. Then, it got warmer, some ice bergs melted, it became an island, and now there’s lots of trees because it’s warmer. So now, there’s people on the island. They’re basically sort of hanging out (in between the mountains), eating nuts off trees, and using the latest technology like stones and bowls. Ding dong.  It’s the outside world and they have technology from the future like really good metal and crazy rice farms. Now you can make a lot of rice really really quickly. That means if you own a farm, you own a lot of food. Which is something everybody needs to survive. So that makes you king.  Rice farming and rice kingdoms spread across the land all the way to here. The most important kingdoms were here, here, here,here, here, here, and here. But this one was the most most important. Ruled by a “heavenly superperson” or (emperor) for short.  Knock knock.

@TheCaptainSplatter,Russia earned those islands back.  Can't say the same for Crimea though.,8년 전,2,
@ZachValkyrie,"+sion8 Rhenium is an extremely rare refractory metal, primarily used for rocket and fighter jet engines. It was the last element with any stable isotopes discovered, and it usually has to be extracted from other deposits as a trace element, which is an extremely expensive and time-consuming process.  That's why actually having a steady source of Rhenium Sulfide is such a strategic asset, even if it's in the middle of a volcano or only produces 20-60kg a year.",8년 전,3,
@seigeengine,"According to the internet, Hafnium was the last stable element to be discovered, and since there appears to be only the one stable isotope of rhenium...  I also don't buy that that's at all why Rhenium would be valuable to Russia. Maybe if they don't have another source, but 20-60 kg a year is negligible compared to the 40-50 tonnes of Rhenium extracted a year.",8년 전,2,
@ZachValkyrie,"Whoops, it was second to last after all. thanks for catching that.  Also I think the reason why this 20-60kg/year is so significant is that 1) it's in a very concentrated disulfide form, so there's less refining and processing to be done, and 2) the find is located in Russian territory; according to Wikipedia the largest producers of Rhenium are Chile, the US, Peru and Poland, none of which are sufficiently friendly towards Russia to traffic in a highly strategic resource like this.  At least, that's how I see it.",8년 전,1,

@hitokiri679,"I enjoy your videos, but man, this one is bad.  Badly worded and misleading bits all over the place. Way too many pictures of ""weird"" things and very few representative pictures of food, scenery, etc.  Bad explanations of the things you do choose to talk about: the reasons for the demographic decline (how about non-existence of work-life balance, 25+ years of economic stagnation, and the high cost of raising children?), escapism caused by ""diplomatic isolation"" (where did you even get this from??).  Then there's the writing section. Yikes. First, they're ""scripts"", not ""alphabets. More importantly, instead of stating in 5 seconds, ""Roughly, Kanji are used for ordinary word roots, hiragana for grammatical words and suffixes, and katakana for loan words and technical terms"", you ramble about word boundaries and make it sound like this is relevant to whether the system could be scrapped (it isn't).  On top of this there's the photo error others noted, misspelling and mispronouncing ""Ieyasu"" as ""Leyasu"", and simple factual errors (7-Eleven did not start in Japan).  What happened? It sounds like you usually gather information from natives of the country in question, but this time it looks like you barely did any research and didn't bother running the script by one knowledgeable person.

He was forced to exile himself and most of his followers to Manila, and the Spanish colonial government in Manila even offered him to invade Japan and overthrow the Shogunate to protect Japanese Christians; he refused and opposed to this. He died 40 days after his arrival in Manila, and was buried with full military honors as a daimyo, making him the only daimyo buried in Philippine soil. Today his former residence is marked by the freedom park (which acts like a ""free speech space"") called Plaza Dilao, in Paco, Manila.  Also, the barangay (urban district) of Mintal in Davao City is known as the ""Little Tokyo"" of the Philippines. Back then this place had the highest concentration of Japanese immigrants and basically the town was founded with the help of them, most of whom working for the abaca plantations in the area. After the war most of them were repatriated and those who remained used Filipino names to escape persecution.",8년 전,0,

@NejisMate,"Please don't go to the Fox Village. There are many photos of these cute foxes online so unfortunately many people add it to their list, but as a travel consultant I have to keep crushing people's dreams when it comes to this. Foxes are not treated great in the Fox village.  People draw the line in different places when it comes to morality but I think that if you have to ask whether a place treats animals well or not, then it’s not a place one should want to visit. A “grey area” isn’t on the good side when it comes to animal rights.  Obviously they don’t like being touched by people, and so they shouldn’t be (some are chained to the wall so they can't run away when people approach and others are put in ""petting cages""). Foxes are not pack animals either and there shouldn’t be so many living together in one place either, that’s not how they live in the wild. They often fight among themselves and are almost obligated to fight for food that is thrown at them, many times this results in injuries.  Many of them are also in tiny cages. People like to point out that the foxes in cages are pregnant or sick (though not all), however that’s still no excuse to trap them in such tiny spaces. If it's true that the foxes are put in cages when pregnant, that's two months that they will be locked up there.  I wouldn’t go if you like animals. Beyond cute furry animals photos, here you can see ""the other side"" of the fox village:  Photos: https://preview.ibb.co/juQamQ/Screen_Shot_2017_05_08_at_21_26_19.png  Also, while we're on the topic of animal rights, note that Miyajima island also has a ban against feeding deer. This would seem fine in another situation, but these deer have been fed for centuries before and this law is newer. The deer are tame and are not able to hunt or look for food on their own, resulting in many of the island's deer being very underfed and sickly-looking. If you like deer, I'd recommend Nara instead.  Okunoshima, the rabbit island, and Jigokudani, the monkey onsens, are good places to visit if you want to see animals, as both live in liberty and are treated well.",8년 전(수정됨),23,

Is it disgusting when you think about the victims? Yes, absolutely. But the key about this kind of humor is to not let your brain make the connection. Try not to think about it too deeply, for your own well-being of mind. I love Japan and have a deep respect for the country, but you could show me a number of dark jokes that would be disgusting for an array of countries, and I'd still laugh. I can't control it.

@NejisMate,"Please don't go to the Fox Village. There are many photos of these cute foxes online so unfortunately many people add it to their list, but as a travel consultant I have to keep crushing people's dreams when it comes to this. Foxes are not treated great in the Fox village.  People draw the line in different places when it comes to morality but I think that if you have to ask whether a place treats animals well or not, then it’s not a place one should want to visit. A “grey area” isn’t on the good side when it comes to animal rights.  Obviously they don’t like being touched by people, and so they shouldn’t be (some are chained to the wall so they can't run away when people approach and others are put in ""petting cages""). Foxes are not pack animals either and there shouldn’t be so many living together in one place either, that’s not how they live in the wild. They often fight among themselves and are almost obligated to fight for food that is thrown at them, many times this results in injuries.  Many of them are also in tiny cages. People like to point out that the foxes in cages are pregnant or sick (though not all), however that’s still no excuse to trap them in such tiny spaces. If it's true that the foxes are put in cages when pregnant, that's two months that they will be locked up there.  I wouldn’t go if you like animals. Beyond cute furry animals photos, here you can see ""the other side"" of the fox village:  Reviews: https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Attraction_Review-g1023408-d7388189-Reviews-Miyagi_Zao_Fox_Village-Shiroishi_Miyagi_Prefecture_Tohoku.html  Photos: https://preview.ibb.co/juQamQ/Screen_Shot_2017_05_08_at_21_26_19.png  Also, while we're on the topic of animal rights, note that Miyajima island also has a ban against feeding deer. This would seem fine in another situation, but these deer have been fed for centuries before and this law is newer. The deer are tame and are not able to hunt or look for food on their own, resulting in many of the island's deer being very underfed and sickly-looking. If you like deer, I'd recommend Nara instead.  The mentioned Okunoshima, the rabbit island, and Jigokudani, the monkey onsen, are good places to visit if you want to see animals, as both live in liberty and are treated well.",8년 전,7,

We are also starting to get big on anime to the point where it will very soon reach the mainstream, as well as our biggest and most wide spread book shop now having over 8400 different manga tittles (including different episodes of the same series with Toyo Ghoul being most popular) Of course I am also aware that japan is not just about anime and hope to visit there some time in the near future.",8년 전(수정됨),4,

It would be awkward to think that the kanji character isn't ""attached"" to the hiragana in this case because if they were read as two separate entities, or ""word dividers,"" it wouldn't make sense. Once you begin to learn Japanese, hiragana is used not only for vocabulary words, but for grammar as well. Just some constructive criticism. :)",6년 전,0,

@クリスイワーナテルマン,"The Northern Territories and Takeshima are famous as Japan's territorial disputes. First of all, the northern territory was occupied by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II, and even after the war, it was not returned from the Soviet Union and was taken over by the Russian Federation after the collapse of the Soviet Union and has not been returned yet. Takeshima has been occupied by South Korea since it discovered the resource. Северные территории и Такэсима известны как территориальные споры Японии. Прежде всего, северная территория была оккупирована Советским Союзом в конце Второй мировой войны, и даже после войны она не была возвращена из Советского Союза и была захвачена Российской Федерацией после распада Советского Союза. и еще не возвращен. Такэсима был оккупирован Южной Кореей с момента обнаружения ресурса.",4년 전,0,
