I found ways to make money to buy a hotdog or a pizza. My childhood was not a happy one. I did find fun at times playing in the streets with other children but majority of the time I stayed up nights waiting for a drunk parent to come home and beat us or what we were going to eat tomorrow.

If they had the technology sure. It's a weird situation where they are the only country so cut off from everyone they have not progressed with technology the same way. They need to join with South Korea I'd say, it would force the world to give them technology they havn't got. It's like this: The don't have the technology the world has but they do have the same threat of war so with resource allocation things like starvation happen. I'd say this: South Korea should give North Korea 1000 wheat combine harvestors and something like 1million cattle from vietnam and china as a sign of good faith.

@ych8070,"America and its western allies should be responsible for the famine in North Korea. North Korea's government intended to trade and maintain peaceful relationships with western countries including America but America refuses to cooperate with its social system. It put on mountainous sanctions on North Korea in the names of freedom and human rights for the North Korean people, hoping the pressure will somehow make Kim surrender or lead to a revolution, just like it is doing in Russia and other enemies, while the fact is these sanctions caused famine in North Korea.  So the solution to this problem is not sanctioning that poor country while telling the world that their leader is insane, this is western hypocrisy and would only make this problem even worse. The only solution today is for the western countries to stop sanctioning North Korea, start sending supplies and offering debts for rebuilding their economy and industry just like what China has been doing for more than five decades, apologize for sanctioning the people, and allow North Korea to participate in international trade. Then this country can reform and open up like China in 1980th.   Now, consider this, would these people ever want to invent nuclear weapon and fire nukes at America if they can live in prosperity? Will the government still enforce restrictions if everyone lives a good life? Remember, ""The weapon to kill poverty and restriction is not sanction, its prosperity.""",3년 전,2,

@ikaname4077,"Hi! im here to tell you that Jesus Christ loves you and wants you to repent and trust in Him! He gave up His glory and His throne to suffer and die for us, because we’ve all sinned against a holy and perfectly just God, but He gave His only son Jesus for you. Because we’re all heading to hell, because we’ve sinned (lied, stolen, using God’s name as a cussword, dishonoring your parents, making up your own god, adultery etc. Like c’mon you can’t tell me you haven’t lied atleast once in your life). But John 3:16: for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son, so that everyone that believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Yeah you heard that right! God wants to give you everlasting life with Him, but that’s not possible when you’re still living in sin and because of that you’ll spend eternity in hell. That’s why Jesus came! So now all you have to do is repent wholeheartedly of your sins and trust in Jesus! He will give you a new heart with new desires and you will be made new and holy. But we’ll never be perfect on this earth, because we’re still in our earthly body. But we’ll be deattached to our flesh and we’ll have our focus on Jesus and God’s kingdom that’s coming! It’s coming very soon btw so please repent (confess and forsake) of your sins and trust in Jesus that He may change you and make you new and give you everlasting life in Heaven without disease, lain, suffering etc. Instead of hell and hellfire. So repent and trust in Jesus!! He’s the one that can save you and He loves you so much!! <333 Please think about this :)",3년 전,1,

As things stand now, China may feel that it benefits in some small-ish, intangible way from North Korea's oppression of its people. The west can readily change China's calculus. Through sanctions we can convert North Korean oppression into large, tangible costs for China. China can avoid these costs by forcing reform in North Korea, which is easily within China's power.

It's a total myth when people see an ""innocent"" looking and jovial person + assume they haven't gone through hardship or horrors hard to imagine.   Some people show truma with a grim countenance. Some people it will show up in other ways like having a chronic illness, autoimmune disease, lowered immune system from depression or stress.   Some signs will be even more invisible than that. But it's a pet peeve of mine when people see a ""happy"" person and assume they are only like that because they haven't been through as much as the person who has dark circles under the eyes or a sombre atmosphere to them.   Everyone survives differently. Robin Williams laughed with sparkling eyes until he died. People really need to stop assuming and look beyond the 'cover'.  There's also the fact a strong insistence on a sunny focus is the result of being sick of drowning in horrible memories and images. People like that need a break from the constant grim in their minds and nightmares.   Ultimately they can have a deep appreciation for what people take for granted. Simple things like a walk in sunshine or colourful objects could mean the world to someone who has known so much darkness. Think carefully about why someone is drawn to the light.

@kakaungranduomo2666,"I’m Korean, and these days, North Korean defectors are actively engaged in YouTube and broadcasting activities in Korean society.   According to their testimony, in the past, North Korean defectors were severely punished for joint responsibility for their families and relatives.  However, it is said that more than 300,000 North Korean defectors have defected to South Korea, and many of them have actually disappeared because punishing all their relatives will cause the collapse of North Korean society.  I heard that unless political giants such as Hwang Jang-yeop and Tae Young-ho defected from North Korea, the punishment of joint responsibility for the families of North Korean defectors has been weakened to the level of surveillance.   On the contrary, families of North Korean defectors are said to be among the upper class in North Korea because they make money in South Korea and then transfer money to their families remaining in North Korea through brokers.  Among North Koreans, the ""Mt. Halla stem"" (family of North Korean defectors) is considered the most prestigious rather than the so-called ""Mt. Baekdu stem,"" the Kim family, and the ""Mt. Fuji stem,"" a Korean-Japanese family.  I heard that even North Korean Guards and Labor Party officials who are leading the human rights abuses of North Koreans want to have in-laws with the ""Mt. Halla stem"" family.   However, since the COVID-19 blockade, the cost of defecting has exceeded $100,000, making it difficult for North Koreans to defect.   There are still many serious problems with human rights in North Korea, but what is comforting is that the experiences of North Korean defectors, especially North Korean defectors, are spreading rapidly in North Korean society and many North Koreans are awakening.  I hope the day will come soon when we drive out dictatorship and find freedom on our own like our fathers.",2년 전,0,

@Square-Watermelon,"Jesus is God & He loves you  Jesus will soon be seen by all men, women, and children up in the clouds. Jesus is returning now! Believe and be saved.  Exodus 3:14 (God speaking) And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.  John 8:58 (Jesus speaking) Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.  John 10:30 (Jesus speaking) I and my Father are one.  Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.  Matthew 1:23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.  John 1:1 & 14 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 14 And the Word was made flesh (Lord Jesus), and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  John 8:24 (Jesus speaking) I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.  John 14:9 (Jesus speaking) Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?  Hebrews 1:1-3, & 8 (God calls His Son ""O God"" because Jesus IS God in the flesh) 1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; 3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; 8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.  1 John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.  Titus 2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;  Revelation 1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.  Isaiah 44:6 (God speaking) Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  Revelation 1:8 (Jesus speaking) I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty  Revelation 22:13 (Jesus speaking) I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.  ---  There Are None Righteous / How To Be Saved  Romans 3:10 & 23 10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  Luke 5:31-32 (Jesus speaking) 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.  1 Peter 3:18 (The word “quicken” means “to make alive”) For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:  Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved  Acts 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

@df-zd8vm," @chonkbear8582  This may not seem relevant from a third world country, but this is very relevant information. The people who speak ill of the contents of this video in foreign countries and in Japan are the sympathizers of the dictatorship of North Korea, such as Kiyomi Tsujimoto, Mizuho Fukushima, and the Korean Federation. This is because the content is very inconvenient for them. For many Japanese, they are starved for information about these horrific events in North Korea because they are not reported in the media. I was surprised to hear that if you have a phone made in China, you can contact your family left behind in the North. The 13-year-old girl who was abducted by Kim Il Sung and the Federation of Korean Industries is now 56 years old. If she were American or British, she would have been rescued immediately. However, the North Korean man and woman in the video were half laughing as they talked about ""public executions"" and ""crossing the river at the risk of their lives. I don't think they are normal people. Are they spies? Do they have no emotions? That's what it looks like. Still, it is one of the few pieces of information that is very important.",4년 전,0,

The St. Michael the Archangel prayer is prayed like this  many times during the day.: St. Michael the Archangel defend us in the  battle , be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray. And do you , O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl throughout the world seeking the ruin of souls.

@expmech8773," @leviacker1260  It's not just the West, but the East as well so don't even blame this on western propaganda. There is clear evidence that from what these people say, the harsh regime in NK exists. Notice how almost all of their stories are similar to one another in regards of starvation and poverty. If NK was so luxurious, then why did these people risk their own lives to try and escape?  As for your point on why so many NKs return to their country, it's most likely due to two factors:  1. They fear that their families back home will suffer because of their action to escape, and therefore, submit to the regime.  2. They are more brainwashed compared to other NKs. Think of it this way. Only the upper, and maybe middle class, of NKs can actually afford to travel abroad. And ofc, that population of people usually live in the city, where they don't notice the true harsh cruelty of the country. This means that they are more loyal to the regime. However, people in the countryside (like the two NKs in the video) are more aware of the government's cruelty because they suffer more at the hands of the regime compared to people in the city.  With these two factors, it explains why many NKs return to their country. I believe that you are the ignorant one here. It's fine to have your own beliefs but to call something stupid that is clearly evident just shows how much knowledge you lack on this topic.",4년 전,43,

Even if we'd manage to kill him, they would just replace him with another dictator - and any attempt at his life would be regarded as an act of war and would trigger a military response. No, the incentive must come from within. If his own military would rise up against him. But the soldiers are relatively well fed with other privileges and they don't have any reason to rebel.

Millions could die because he has Bio weapons also. (Funny how no one meantions that.)  China likes having them around for a variety of reasons. Mostly as a buffer and sourse of cheap labor. China will ensure he never uses his nukes. Regime change there is impossible. They cause trouble when more money or food is needed. They get what is needed because the alternative of to terrible to comprehend. Have a nice day if you were really shocked by this.,5년 전,83,

@mrs.c1755,"Laughing doesn't always indicate happiness, though. It is often a defense mechanism. Notice that she also laughed (nervously) when she mentioned the flood that wiped out 100,000 people and then she said she didn't know if her family was alive. That's not funny at all, but the brain is amazing... to keep her from dissolving, mentally, the brain allows for the smile and nervous laugh to give adequate serotonin to handle that incredible stress of intense negative emotions.   She also laughs when she discusses the TV watching, but her life was in literal danger. That may get romanticized in movies, but that feeling she describes in an almost tantalizing way, is not a positive emotion.   This doesn't mean every laugh is due to this, but we cannot presume that constant laughter means they are content and fulfilled, or even happy.   On top of that, those who oppress others sometimes laugh as they abuse those around them, which grooms the abused with gaslighting, which throws them off balance. Nervous laughter can be seen by people who are being cruelly mocked by those who are supposed to love and care for them, and I'm guessing the constant smile on ""dear leader's"" face may come from that same place.   If you convince a people that laughter means happiness, and then groom them to laugh when they experience negative emotions, like we saw, they are less likely to be able to reject the oppression.     Not saying Western civilization is a barrel of monkeys, or anything, but laughter is a complex thing, for sure.",4년 전,3,

@Volatile-Tortoise,"In my opinion the best way to free the people of North Korea is to offer a genuine amnesty to its leaders, despite the fact that they’re heinous murders, tyrants, war criminals etc. Let me explain. The reason the North Korean regime keeps the country as such a brutal Orwellian totalitarian prison-camp rather than allow any freedom or information to pass in or out is because those in charge know that if the North Korean people were ever freed, or if the US or other nations ever invaded and took over, the North Korean leadership would get the death penalty or life imprisonment at best, or simply be dragged through the streets and beaten to death.   If outside powers could ensure (and be good to their word) that the leadership would be taken to another country where they could live in a mansion with anonymity and never suffer any consequences; they’d take the offer. It’s a lot better than living in a country which could revolt against you at any minute and where you know very well you’re starving, torturing, and killing your own people in abject totalitarian cruelty. Now the idea of letting tyrants off the hook may seem unpalatable to a lot of people, who want them to face justice, but look at the big picture.

@Rising_Pho3nix_23," @RBurns80  good point. That reminds me of their internet. They literally dont have an internet infrastructure except for like the ""king"" (let's call him what he is). And its so secret that, according to someone who went undercover, the people who live in North Korea dont even know that the internet is a thing. How in the he'll can you liberate a country like that? You cant exactly send them an email and say heres the tor browser. Or hey look heres YouTube check out the world. Or heres the news. Its totally locked down. Even people in prison can make calls. So when people are born into that life, totally unaware that the earth and universe goes on beyond their borders, they don't even think about ""the great beyond"". Its as if the big bang happened and their country is the edge of the universe. I know they're aware of South Korea, and America. Theyare taught from birth to hate America. My question is, has anyone ever wondered how communication occurs between borders? When tourists visit, they arent allowed to even bring electronics except under very strict observation. Like holy crap. It makes me sad to know that theres a country that may never know things like ecommerce, social networking, freedom, free trade, etc. All they learn in school is how amazing their leader is and read his biography over and over and over. It makes me sick. Their national anthem is ""I'm nothing without you"". How sick is that? And its not the citizens' fault. It's the dictator. North korea has gone under investigation many times by the United Nations for crimes against humanity. I dont know how it keeps slipping through. When you look up the most hated or miserable countries in the world, North Korea is not in the top 10. Which is weird to me personally because places like Pakistan at least know options exist. At least they can seek refugee status. North Korea has such a lid on their country that most people (and their entire family) are shot on site for trying to escape. What can we do? I remember when anonymous stepped in and helped liberate the Egyptians by providing tor. But north Korea cant get that. So how can we help liberate them?????",5년 전,4,

She said the same thing; the oppression, the deprivation and so on create solidarity among the average citizens. I spent time in the former German Democratic Republic,and I am fluent in German. Compared to the DPRK [North Korea], East Germany was a paradise. But all things are relative; it seemed a terribly impoverished place compared to the Bundesrepublik. These two people interviewed seem very bright and articulate. Some of their experiences were ghastly. But if public executions are what you know, I suppose being shot in front of your family for stealing some metal makes sense. I've spent a great deal of time in places like the former Soviet Union and East Germany,  and while it was repressive in ways, it hadn't been anything like North Korea since the 1930's and Stalin's era.",5년 전,0,

Our problems are nothing compared to theirs. On the pyramid of Maslow, our problems are usually around self-actualization or esteem at the top of the pyramid while theirs are legit physiological and safety needs, the bottom. When you face such tremendous problems on a daily basis, you get happier more easily I'd say since you have more possibility to be happy because you lack a lot of things. On top of that, people from the countryside tend to be less educated hence living a simpler life which also helps with happiness. (There's a correlation between intelligence [ the way they define intelligence is to debate but I guess you understand me huh I'm not saying ppl from the countryside are stupid] and depression) etc....  Based also on my own experience I do agree with that, I've spent some years in Thailand and maaaaan, people from the countryside are so kind, happy to share, less worried and anxious.

One does not simply say that because these poor countries that happened to be socialist countries it means socialism is inherently bad without understanding what led to their current situations, especially when one was born with a silver spoon in their mouth talking about why a peasant is poor because he didn't get the right job or born into the right family.

@Volatile-Tortoise," @Gandhi_Physique     In my opinion the best way to free the people of North Korea is to offer a genuine amnesty to its leaders, despite the fact that they heinous murders, tyrants, war criminals etc. Let me explain. The reason the North Korean regime keeps the country in such a brutal lockdown rather allow freedom or information is because those in charge know that if the North Korean people were ever freed, or if the US or other nations ever invaded and took over, the North Korean leadership would get the death penalty or life imprisonment at best, or simply be dragged through the streets and beaten to death.   If outside powers could ensure (and be good to their word) that the leadership would be taken to another country where they could live in a mansion with anonymity and never suffer any consequences; they’d take the offer.

@martaevabetakova483," @benbaselet2026  IMHO you're talking about three different things. Western people who listen to fat guys with Ferraris do so voluntarily, with regard to how they can change their own personal stories. People in NK don't think about their personal stories, they listen to Kim Jong-Un because they believe he's the only source of truth and get punished if they don't listen to him. They would listen to him even if he wasn't rich and fat, because that's the way the country works. And the reasons why people listened to priests changed throughout history. So I wouldn't give churches as an example of this... I'm not Catholic but in grudging fairness to them, that was a slightly different thing.   First, churches were the meeting places, the administrative centres for weddings and funerals, they could provide asylum, some of them housed schools and served as fortresses with underground escape routes when necessary. When my town was sieged in 1434, the people took refuge in the church. So they weren't useless.   Second, for a big chunk of Middle Ages, people couldn't understand a word the priest was saying because the priests spoke in Latin. So the priests couldn't really have fed them any lies in churches. Can you imagine rich guys with Ferraris or Kim Jong-Un only speaking a language nobody understands?    Third, going to church on Sunday was mostly a matter of course. People went to churches for example because they were forced to, because they were used to it, because they wanted to sing and to have a chat afterwards, or because they wanted a bit of peace and quiet, or because they were actual believers. I didn't get the impression most people went to churches to admire someone who was powerful and richer than them. (The priest was a local person and his housekeeper had female friends in the village, you know?... everyone knew the priest's property didn't prevent him from having arthritis or stomach problems. Imagine Kim Jong-Un's housekeeper telling the whole nation ""the boss has farted again, oh sh*t, I'm fed up with opening the windows all the time.""?) So we aren't talking a personality cult here.   Fourth, it wasn't like that for millennia, more like 600 years (late Middle Ages - about the 19th century). Before that, the church fulfilled its function, like the monasteries treating sick people for free, giving people herbs, advice, education and whatnot. So one of the reasons the people flocked there was because they could get actual help. As the level of church riches and hypocrisy rose in late Middle Ages, people's willingness to flock to churches and listen to rich priests dropped (John Wycliff, Cathars, Moravian Brethren, the Hussites, the Waldensians etc.).   You write ""I never understood why but there must be a reason why it works for controlling so many"" - perhaps you could start by studying medieaval and early modern history.

I think it's probable they exist somewhere. It would make a great computer game... not for the entertainment but the actual challenge on how to do it (without just nuking everyone).,5년 전(수정됨),0,

@vickolsss65,朝鲜正经历着中国80年代的生活，中国80年代的改革。但是那时侯的出国的人，不被称为叛国者，而是为了外出学习技术复兴国家。他们是祖国的英雄。我们也经历过用油灯生活的日子，但我们不会背叛国家，更不会在敌对势力庇护下，去辱骂自己的国家，污名化自己的国家。因为这样并不会给自己的国民带来援助，不会带来改变，只不过改变了自己的生活。这只会让北朝鲜在世界面前的形象更加恶劣，这伤害了更多北朝鲜的人。只说自己想说的，这是自私的。你只不过说了其他想知道的，他们不会帮你。真正能帮你的人只有改革。只有继续的发展。你只看到了金三炮对朝鲜的独裁，却没有看到他通过发展核武器的正确决策，打破了美国与韩国对北朝鲜的封锁。朝鲜的经济正在复苏，总有一天会发展起来，这时间不会很长。但是独裁显然是不对的，这一点不会改变，但这只能逐渐开放，不能一次性解决所有的问题。（当然，我也不赞同金正恩完全的独裁，残忍的法制）   视频中的共同点： 配给制度中国也是失败的，这是改革的尝试，失败是肯定的，北朝鲜在重复错误 中国之前也吃不上米饭，经历过贫穷年代 中国农村以前也用不上电，甚至油灯也用的很节省 A片在中国也是不被允许的，但只要不危害未成年人，处罚很小   视频中的不同点： 中国人民对自己的文化非常自信，不会改变 中国会选择最有能力的领导人 中国只有极度恶劣的重大犯罪才会处死刑 14亿人中大部分中国人都认为共产主义是正确的，并不向往资本主义，我们对自己的制度十分自信 北朝鲜没有选择改革开放，北朝鲜可能认为中国的社会主义道路是错误的   （以上仅为个人观点，不回复外国人，反共华人勿喷，国人勿扰，谢谢）,5년 전(수정됨),1,

The famine sprung up, newly ruling Kim Jong-Il handled it really badly and prolonged the crisis. Then NK was without any money, its jewel-the Ryugyong Hotel was put on a hiatus (it is now just a fancy display of news) and never finished. They were left totally drained and couldn't function anymore. But times were getting better, and they were going to be just a strange country.

Stalin was regarded as a horrible tyrant, there was no equal pay, no equal everything. the philosophy Marx proposes is more of a Utopian society where the people have the power. because of Stalin Communism is regarded as terrible and horrible governing philosophies, unpredictable and unstable, that is not because of the philosophy itself, but as a direct result of Stalin's resolve as a ruler and a leader. the thing about Utopian societies is they cannot and will not naturally exist ever on this earth. Stalin's version of communism is truly a variant of socialism. in practice it could work for a given people and that's awesome if it is stable and maintains peace and the people prosper. Capitalism hasn't been any less bad, with the wealthy contently profiting off those in poverty, monopolies controlling how laws are written taking bribes, but with the way leaders are being groomed today they are all probably better than monarchy. when all things are said and done there is no such thing as the perfect government, Stalin was corrupt like the lot of them, and even if you are a Stalin empathizer you cannot deny that, nor can you deny that his version of communism is not the same as Marx.",5년 전,0,
@trazz407," danieljliversLXXXIX  you don't need any further documentation other than WWII on how he was a corrupt leader. he named Stalingrad after himself and out of pride he forsaken his people and his armies, nearly sacrificing his war efforts all for the sake of saving the city that he named after himself. what type of great leader throws away as many lives as he did and nearly threw away the war? that is very well documented and a fact you cannot argue against. that type of greed and sense of pride led to corruption and could have easily been taken over, that's just one example every historian can agree on. it's not just the perspective of the United States that feels he was corrupt, most countries in Europe feel the same, and any evidence provided you will claim as propaganda. don't be so naive and foolish. you don't have to look any further than how he came to power. even human nature suggest every world leader is corrupt in one way or another. no one is perfect and no one knows what the best system is.",5년 전,0,

@Joseph32547," S S  Holodomor was genocide. The russians invaded. The russians took the food and sent it home. The russians searched house to house regularly and took the food and sent it home. There was no famine in ukrane, the famine was in russia. The reasons for the famine are a subject of scholarly and political debate. Some scholars suggest that the man-made famine was a consequence of the economic problems associated with changes implemented during the period of Soviet industrialisation.[52][29][53] There are also those[who?] who blame a systematic set of policies perpetrated by the Soviet government under Stalin designed to exterminate the Ukrainians.[citation needed]  The collectivisation policy was enforced, entailing extreme crisis and contributing to the famine. In 1929–30, peasants were induced to transfer land and livestock to state-owned farms, on which they would work as day-labourers for payment in kind.[54] Collectivization in the Soviet Union, including the Ukrainian SSR, was not popular among the peasantry and forced collectivisation led to numerous peasant revolts. The first five-year plan changed the output expected from Ukrainian farms, from the familiar crop of grain to unfamiliar crops like sugar beets and cotton. In addition, the situation was exacerbated by poor administration of the plan and the lack of relevant general management. Significant amounts of grain remained unharvested, and – even when harvested – a significant percentage was lost during processing, transportation, or storage.[citation needed]  In the summer of 1930, the government instituted a program of food requisitioning, ostensibly to increase grain exports. Subsequently, in 1932, food theft was made punishable by death or 10 years imprisonment.[54]  It has been proposed that the Soviet leadership used the man-made famine to attack Ukrainian nationalism, and thus it could fall under the legal definition of genocide.[55][56][52][57][25][58] For example, special and particularly lethal policies were adopted in and largely limited to Soviet Ukraine at the end of 1932 and 1933. According to Snyder: ""[E]ach of them may seem like an anodyne administrative measure, and each of them was certainly presented as such at the time, and yet each had to kill.""[59][60] Under the collectivism policy, for example, farmers were not only deprived of their properties but a large swath of these were also exiled in Siberia with no means of survival.[61] Those who were left behind and attempted to escape the zones of famine were ordered shot. There were foreign individuals who witnessed this atrocity or its effects. For example, there was the account of Arthur Koestler, a Hungarian-British journalist, which described the peak years of Holodomor in these words:  At every [train] station there was a crowd of peasants in rags, offering ikons and linen in exchange against a loaf of bread. The women were lifting up their infants to the compartment windows – infants pitiful and terrifying with limbs like sticks, puffed bellies, big cadaverous heads lolling on thin necks.[62] You should read the letters and books written by people from Ukraine at that time.",5년 전,7,

@finnbender7168,"danieljliversLXXXIX After Lenin died and Stalin came to power, one of the first things he did was take the land from the kulaks. Lenin was a actually a great fan of them, and thought that they were essential to the economy. Stalin on the other hand didn’t like the idea of independent land ownership. He took the land from the kulaks and turned it into government owned farms. This way, he could control the influx of food into the economy. One of the easiest ways to kill off a group of people is “famine.” By restricting the amount of available food, many people would die of starvation.   Also, the US acknowledges our faults....well...most of the time. In terms of the Dust Bowl, we all agree it was a horrible incident. It was actually one of the contributing factors of the Great Depression. There were no regulations as to how to farm and maintain a healthy land, and so farmers just kept going with no guidance from the government.

The Holodomor was mainly caused by Ukrainian farmers refusing to produce food as a protest against agricultural reforms. The rest of the USSR was dependent on food from the Ukraine, but they actually worked their fields and had some crops. So, the Ukrainians had no food, by choice, and were starving to death in large numbers. Other regions of the USSR had very little food, and people were starving to death in slightly smaller numbers. Should they have sent food to Ukraine, and starved to death themselves, in order to save Ukrainians from the disaster that Ukrainian farmers created?

There are many hardliners still in power over there who believe the propaganda with all of their hearts and wouldn't hesitate to do a lot more than just test nuclear weapons. Of course this would ultimately end badly for them, but much chaos and destruction would occur as a result. As well as many dead innocents. Make no mistake, Kim is a ruthless dictator, but he is a relatively well known variable and not as unstable as many seem to think. It's sad, but there is no quick fix solution to the issues on the Korean peninsula. It will take generations still for true unity to occur.    Even in the best case scenario, should the leader step down peacefully and announce an end to the war (they still consider themselves at war with Western powers), you have scores and scores of citizens who have nothing to eat and no way to provide for themselves. All of whom would flood across the Chinese and SK borders in search of opportunity. It would be a large scale humanitarian crisis. In any case China would never let that happen. In that scenario it's highly likely that they would install a puppet leader to maintain the North Korean buffer and maintain the status quo.

@shindari,"North Korea gets away with this because of China. I'm sorry if the ""truth"" makes you uncomfortable, but this is pretty much fact.   Not because China necessarily approves of what NK does to its' own people (hence why they specifically do not turn back Koreans who flee from NK anymore, like they used to decades ago), but because China, in their paranoia, still thinks that ""The West"" will invade their country at any possible moment, and so they tolerate North Korea as a handy ""Buffer State."" Why North Korea, and not Mongolia, or Vietnam? Because the Chinese view South Korea as the most likely launch-point of any potential land-based invasion of China. And North Korea stands firmly between that, and China's border.   One needs only look at how this works by going back to the Korean War, in the 1950's. American troops, within just a few weeks, had North Korea almost entirely conquered, right up to within ten miles of the Chinese Border of Manchuria, and then, with no warning whatsoever, 150,000 Chinese soldiers poured across the river and reinforced the broken North Korean Army with sheer numbers, and literal mountains of weaponry. America was so stunned by this move, that they were pushed back to where the demarcation line currently stands before they got their act together, and recovered from the surprise. The remaining two years of that war were nothing but a perfectly frustrating ""stalemate."" The idea of using Nukes to silence China's interference was floated several times (but thankfully that brilliant idea was tossed aside as ""insane"" and never implemented... none of us would be alive today if that crap actually went down...).   If any country in the world (doesn't even have to be the USA, if it were ANYBODY not named China) ever tried to ""liberate"" North Korea's populace from the abuse they are administered on a daily basis, China would not hesitate to ""intervene"" with maximum ferocity, once again. Because North Korea ""belongs"" to China (they just refuse to proclaim that out loud)! Any western country, USA, or otherwise, that crosses that demilitarized zone with even so much as a single soldier, will potentially get the entire Chinese Army on their ass in two days flat. In the People's Republic's eyes, an invasion of North Korea is to be treated the same as an invasion of China itself.   This would be like some army landing in Quebec, trying merely to conquer the Canadians. But then the United States Army shows up, full force, and demands: ""Hey there, Clown, what're ya'll doing in our back yard??""",5년 전,18,

Even when there is freedom, they are considerate of their own group and want the best for their own group and country.  For example, White Americans have freedom to cosmetic / plastic surgery, but most of them do NOT abuse the procedure because White Americans want their race to be naturally beautiful.  However, in Asia, for example, South Korea and China, when cosmetic / plastic surgery becomes legal, vast number of people want to take advantage of it and crooked face genes are slowly becoming the majority, ruining the country’s gene pool.

But since you want ""the history of socialism"" taught...let's stumble back to about 1912 and have a look at the socialist political platform: An eight-hour workday at a decent wage, a public-works program for the jobless, safety regulations for workers in the mines and factories,  a child-labor law, an old-age pension, unemployment and accident insurance, a graduated income tax, an inheritance tax, suffrage for women, a direct vote in national elections doing away with the electoral college, the creation of separate departments of health, education and labor, and a convention to revise the Constitution. The first of their political demands was absolute freedom of the press, speech and assembly.   Does any of that look familiar?  Social Security? When it was enacted conservatives decried it as leading the US into socialism and that it would destroy families and cause divorces.

You went on to say, ""having children is a universal urge for all humans and can give meaning in such a bleak controlled country as north Korea"". Again, more disingenuous dross.

My wife and I, and many of our friends, do not have or resist such a primal ""urge"", why would any North Korean not resist such evil to stop the suffering there? They, and everyone other breeder, are not having ""children"" they are making people who are going to suffer a life of hell in NK and then die a cruel, painful, brutal death and for what? Not good enough. Last, no government or anything else can ""simply force"" humans to procreate. Place the blame where it belongs: breeders in NK who could care less about the suffering their offspring will endure simply to give said breeders ""meaning"".

@37thraven," @Ketutar  Actually @Christian Valencia is mostly right. Detachment, dissociation, derealization - these are normal consequences of serious trauma. That's why soldiers develop a messed up, inhuman sense of humour in war (e.g. playing with body parts). They get desensitized. And then years after all those emotions have been repressed, when friends/loved ones are asking them to ""be normal"", they have PTSD, because their emotions have been warped, and instead comes out in volatile bursts. That's repression, and it's *not in their control at all*.  Emotional detachment is designed to protect you psychologically, when there's too much pain to handle. Worst still, if you get pregnant in that level of continuous stress, your stress hormones turn on a genetic switch in your baby, 'telling it' to be highly anxious all the time, to get ready to survive in a dangerous, stressful world.

For example, White Americans have freedom to cosmetic / plastic surgery, but most of them do NOT abuse the procedure because White Americans want their race to be naturally beautiful.  However, in Asia, for example, South Korea and China, when cosmetic / plastic surgery becomes legal, vast number of people want to take advantage of it and crooked face genes are slowly becoming the majority, ruining the country’s gene pool.  In North Korea, cosmetic / plastic surgery is outlawed, and the North Korean people have the most natural beauty among Asians.

(example: yes we've kept slaves, but we also fought wars and bled to death in order to free those  slaves.)   Now if you're going to tell me that talking about the holy word of God makes me sound crazy or whatever it is you were saying, I'm going to tell you that I'm still going to talk about it anyways 😉    Jesus Christ is the Truth, the greatest truth, and no man can deny that.

Republicans are corrupt, no doubt, but the democrats aren't really helping either. They've become another form of the right-wing where they're just as corrupt.     And the thing about Trump is he wasn't really a republican, he was basically a ""modern democrat"" from New York. I personally think the political shift here in the U.S is because of the media because if you look at CNN/MSNBC/NYT, they will gaslight you until the end of the day. Fox News will do the same. And I think Trump ran for the Republican Party was because of what Obama said in 2011 at the White House Correspondents Dinner. Obama said he'll never be president... jump to 2016.

@cpk313," @tr0llbuster292  I'm not a fan of the extreme other side of the coin either but you are kidding yourself if you think they can hold a candle to the level of overt, blatant corruption that is the current republicans mantra. Unfortunately Trump is only a talking head with issues that don't benefit him. If he has nothing personally to gain , then he could care less. If he gets a second term and doesn't end up in jail he will do whatever he can, to a greater extent then he already has, to line his pockets. His God looks like this - $$$, just like all the rest of the republicans that support him as well as a number of democrats. That and looking like he's the best at everything is all he cares about. He's a narcissistic sociopath. He has no interest at all in doing what's best for the country, it's all about what's best for him.    He's owned by Putin from business dealings prior and during his time being President which is why he takes the position he does every time he has a chance to with Russia, which is why we haven't seen his tax returns.    The only way the last two republican presidents have gotten into office is by cheating. Bush Jr. in Florida and the Retarted Cheeto with the help of his lover Putin.

As you have aimed to Governemnt to look for these  signals can be detected  from cell phones  She also gave details of climbing mountains so they know where to look and monitor .  These Good Guy Shows thinking they are  giving light  GET PEOPLE KILLED by ignorance   As afar as the statement about 3 million dying in famine how would a north korean in norther Korea ever know that And how would south Korean ever know the death toll.    When I heard that and a few other odd statements I wondered if the entire video was faked These also laugth alpt and grim death and famine   That seems ODD.   Making it seem like there were actors given scripts  or partially scripted to say certain things  The cuts make it seem like they were scriptued for short segments.  Possibly speaking stories of others   When you at one point say death to all the family if one escapes and is caught then after that nothing is mentioned in speaking of  escapes   Also nothing was mentioned of when defectors show themselves that  the government of NK roundsup faimliy  Which MAKES IT ALL THE MORE DUBIOUS that these are real defectors that have family as this video would lkill off  their entire families   It is dramatic but COMPLETEY  UNRELIABEL  TESTIMONY with scripting  and actors speaking   OR ELSE YOU HAVE CAUSED DEATH OF THEIR FAMILIES for your personal  glorification  NUFF SAID,5년 전,0,

@TodaysSpecialMinis,"This video is old and I don't know if there is any ongoing follow up on these people, but - I have so many questions!     1. So did they just up and decided to escape one day without telling anyone in their family? 2. If so, wouldn't their neighbors ask where they were if they hadn't seen them in several days/weeks/months? 3. If so, what would their families answer? And why wouldn't they be executed immediately because they could not account for a person whom they could normally account for? 4. If the families did know they were going to flee - did they beg them not to do it for fear that they would executed if it was found out? What story did they come up with to explain the sudden disappearance of a family member? Did they have to fake a death? And if so, wouldn't they need some kind of proof someone died? 5. The one girl said she walked into China - well, what happened when she got to China? Did she speak Chinese? Was she homeless for a while? How did she get food, clothes, money for her phone and the phone she sent back to her family? And the NK government was not censoring people's mail? Seems like receiving a non-approved/non-tapped phone in the post could be cause for execution if simply stealing a piece of rope could be. 6. What are all these people doing now for a living? Are any of them activists or are they living in fear and/or under assumed names?   7. What papers do that have that are acceptable proof of citizenship of anywhere? Did they escape with birth certificate, social security card, passport, state ID (or whatever the NK equivalents would be)? How much money did they have to pay in bribery to the soldiers? And how much money, if any, did they escape with?     I'm so confused as to how/why they decided to escape given all the odds against them. They are extremely brave, for sure.

@TheCrazyNekoGirl2123,I feel like they have to laugh a lot otherwise they would cry all the time. So you laugh. I honestly can't stand the people in charge but there is one reason above all others. Your seen KJU right. Now tell me doe she look like he is starving to death? No he doesn't in fact he looks extremely well fed. SO he has people dying in the streets from hunger and rather then send goverment help he sits up in his office. I think he sits up there and thinks how can he make lives more horrible because destroying whole families lines isn't working any more people are still escaping. He has so many people brain washed it's really sad. I wonder how the people who do escape don;t die of shock at how much freedom you can have. My mind goes back to the Olympics that took place in Korea. He of course wasn't there  but his sister was and you know what I saw? They always get a look at the top box to see the reaction of the world leaders to the opening. Now most of you may remember that this was the first time in years that North Koreans were allowed to compete instead of having just South Korea they competed as a Korea team. You could tell who was from NK and who was from SK because the ones from NK were just so overly happy. Why not they are seeing the real world for the first time in ages or ever. Anyway now everybody in the top box was laughing and having great time but her. Now you always clap for your team the loudest but that doesn't mean you don;t for other people teams too it is supposed to be friendly competition. She just sat on her butt with look that plainly said she did not want to be there except when Korea was making their round. She then was all smiles and clapping. After they were done she went back to looking like she didn't wanna be there. I am sorry but of the Olympics are being help in your country (granted it was South Korea but still) I would have have the biggest smile on my face the entire time. Some of you might think wow she's bitter I'm not I just really feel for the people over there starving with hardly any electricity and are freaking scared becasue they are told that the US wants to invade them. We don't want to invade them if anything we want to liberate them so they don't have to walk by the body of a child dying of hunger. Of families crying over a family member being killed and knowing your next. That's not living it's just simply existing. So yes they have to laugh because they have little else,5년 전,0,

Ni hablan de las sanciones de EEUU, ni de que solo el 15% de la tierra es cultivable, que el país quedó completamente destruido tras la guerra, que la mayoría del comercio era con China y la URSS pero desde los 90 solo ha podido ser con la China capitalista, etc. Obvian demasiados detalles importantes para centrarse en dar una descripción del país del tipo monarquía autoritaria del s X para intentar empatizar mejor con el espectador y que quede un discurso victimista. Seguramente huyeron de Corea porque les importaba un bledo el resto del país y querían enrriquecerse aunque fuera a costa de la explotación ajena.

No halfway intelligent person criticizes or trashes the PEOPLE who live in (or rather, are daily victimized by the government of) North Korea. Most of us know the crimes of the government do not reflect the character of the citizen subjected to it.   I really don't like this trend of creating a false ""problem"" just to justify an ""answer."" I hate the North Korean government; I don't hate the people. I criticize and condemn the North Korean government; I don't criticize and condemn the people.   Anyone who genuinely can't make the distinction is in a very small minority and can't be considered a real issue that needs a response.  Also why are you centering solely on ""Young"" defectors? Why not all ages? This is just more Gen Z/Young Millennial baiting. Just kinda phoning it in. Frankly, and I'm sorry if this sounds mean, but I'd rather hear the stories of someone who lived 30 or 40 years in the DPRK over someone who lived 12 or 20 years in the DPRK.  This is just more generation baiting for views, clicks and comments.   Also asking someone why the chose to defect, when they defected at 12? They didn't choose to defect at all, their parents did. I'd like to hear why the parents did. And the responses being given are too samey, too canned. They don't ring of any personal internalization. Again, this is just generational clickbait masquerading as something better than that.   And finally, what really makes me sick, is that there are some things being said in that video that the astute mind will catch on are not true; they are brainstormed ""Hey let's think about a terrible thing that could believably happen, and then put it in the video like it really happened.""

@Kata_Rin,"Commander Xananymous you are just proving their point by being like this. They accused you of being racist, but instead of proving them wrong, you proceeded to act racist towards Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans.   Also whether you like it or not, according to geographic perspectives, countries on the Arabian peninsula are Asian, because the peninsula is considered to be a sub contintent of Asia. I am not saying you are the same as Chinese, Korean, or Japanese people. There are different regions of Asia that have different characteristics overall. Of course you are not going to look, act, or speak like the others. Don’t deny geography just because you think being an Asian means having small eyes and a small body. That is actually racist.  I’m not accusing you of being racist, but that mentality about Asians you expressed definitely is. Not here to offend, but enlighten.  Being an Asian isn’t bad either. Your words about physical characteristics of East Asians came with a very negative connotation, sounding almost like pure hatred and disgust. That is characteristic of racists. I don’t understand why you seem to think all Asians are the same. Surely you don’t think Indians are exactly the same as Chinese people in every way... so why would you think being an Asian just means being small-eyed and small-bodied? And what is so bad about having small eyes and a small body anyway? Everyone is different. Just because you think someone looks uglier doesn’t meant you should treat them meanly.

@kaledkapo,"Cómo mierda piensa la gente que Corea del Norte pueda salir de su crisis económica si luego de que Corea del Norte se quedara sola al perder a sus aliados socialistas, Estados Unidos le puso sanciones económicas (Executive Order 13551/Executive Order 13466/Executive Order 13570), y, sin embargo, Corea del Norte en 1998 logra estabilizar su economía con respecto a lo que le permite los bloqueos económicos. Los Estados Unidos se exfuerza en que nadie de su país pueda comerciar con ellos, catalogando aquello como ilegal. Pero no son solo los Estados Unidos quienes ejercen este bloqueo económico en contra de Corea del Norte, son casi todos los amigos de Gringolandia. y la pregunta es ""¿cómo pueden los gringos expandir su bloqueo a otros países?, fácil, a través de la ONU y el Acuerdo de Wassenaar.

@abhishekmhatre1554," @Devdraco  It's not an excuse, just an explanation. Kim Jong Un is the dictator of a nation which is opposed by America and surrounded by American troops. Now Kim has seen what happened to other dictators around the world who were opposed by America, such as Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Hosni Mubarak, etc. They were all toppled because they refused to court American interests. The one thing they all lacked was nuclear weapons and so the North Korean dictator spends a large amount of money building a powerful nuclear arsenal. The result is the complete lack of spending on the people of North Korea.   On top of this, North Korea gets heavily sanctioned by the West. This leads to even more economic depression and dwindling of public spending. Naturally, the people will complain (even protest) and therefore North Korea then has to maintain a ruthless autocracy in order to keep its citizens from revolting and taking control of the country. They don't have any other option, if they surrendered to the Americans, they would all be hanged and North Korea would end up just like Iraq or Afghanistan.  So, this is all a logical consequence of America's actions - both past and present.",5년 전,0,

@quanfengzhou5252," @Devdraco  I know less about rural areas. My impression is that it depends on the region. In the plain, rural areas have access to electricity and running water as much as most urban areas do. In mountainous region, they may have less.   You began by saying we should take into account all the factors and ended by saying whether or not we have enough resources to take care of the newborn child doesn't matter in the consideration of the policy. It matters and it is the main reason that the policy ever existed. I am not trying to justify it morally with or without context. However, practically, given the social background of China at that time, a hard choice was made between two consequences, that with no birth control and people may starve, and that with birth control. If I understand correctly, from the point where you stand, birth control is out of the question and we may wish for the best for what happens as the population keep grows.   About the censorship, you criticized it on moral ground, like the western media has been doing all the time. That is fine. I want to be practical. How much damage is it going to do to the society when people are mislead?  Internet is not censored in HK. Look at the HK rioters. I know almost surely that the censorship is not flawlessly enacted, nor is any policy. But censorship can, arguably, be an effective solution to maintain stability in the country.   I also want to note that we are not debating whether your knowledge about China is correct or not. It is also not our focus that whether certain policies in China are moral or not. My argument is that western media has been providing untrue/biased views about China, and I backed that argument with the experience of a real friend of mine. You proved that you know some of the facts about China, while you know little about the reason why those facts happened. Criticizing those policies morally is exactly the information western media has been trying to spread and do they ever talk why practically those policies were in place?",5년 전,6,
@Devdraco," @quanfengzhou5252  So it sounds as though people are living in a state of ""less than poor,"" which is the impression I have of much of China.   It doesn't matter in consideration of the ""one child policy"" because birth control was never a choice, it is forced upon the people, and when people have children anyway, they are penalized such so that it is impossible to take care of children. If that isn't a moral issue, I don't know what is.   Censorship is based on morality, such so that either you believe that taking away certain opinions or facts will be better for society, or you don't. You cannot criticize the way I approach this topic based on morality alone. HK rioters are no different than US rioters, and probably better in most occurrences because when there are riots in the USA they are occasionally abused by weak, greedy individuals that take advantage of it, like any other community action. Either you condemn the individuals that generate harm, or you condemn the population for the individuals? That is not a worthy dichotomy.    Viewpoints are constantly challenging the USA, so I find it difficult that you oppose the sharing of them. Personally, I loathe religion. I express that viewpoint whenever I'm asked about it. That doesn't mean that I need to be censored or that people will agree with me just because I have expressed that view. In this manner, your perception that the USA provides a bias account of China is simply wrong.",5년 전,3,

@Dobiegal,"Why do you think the American government moved as many people to the city as they could? First of all the government owns most of the farmland by being in the pockets of the large conglomerates farm industry such as Monsanto And Archer Daniel Midland companies. Those companies that are now growing most of American foods are in the pockets of the government who controls what those companies grow and do in other words people unless you own your own farmland the government is in control of the food supply. And he who controls the food controls the people. Do you think it's any coincidence that the family farms until the 1960s more than normal and now all those families have been moved to the cities retrained for factory and industry type jobs in the city? Because the government made it too hard for farmers by controlling what the farmers could grow through their county extension agents, and how much money the government would loan the farmers and most of them could not afford loans every year when the crops would be ruined by natural disasters famines floods etc they got more and more behind the government called in those loans move them to the cities by offering them job retraining. that is why Willie Nelson back in the seventies try to help the family farms the family farmers and that whole life style with his farm aid concert series. and what a coincidence, Willie Nelson found himself in some hot water with the IRS not long after he attempted to bring light to what was happening in America. Americans, wake up. If something happened to the food delivery system most people only have a few days supply of food. If the trucks stop, Walmart is out of food in two days. Most grocery stores only keep a 2 to 4 day supply of food in the stores. If you do not learn how to grow and preserve food, in a shtf situation you're in big trouble. That's also why there is so much government regulation on things like raising chickens in the suburbs you are not allowed to have a rooster, because of the noise but also because you need a boy rooster to mate with the girl chicken to make little chickens. Little chickens grow up to reproduce themselves. The average hen only lays for 2 to 3 years and if there are no chicks to raise to continue the supply, even raising chickens for eggs will dry up in a few years if you do not have a rooster.

@hannable70," milkmandan77  Oh great, another psychopath that would gladly allow people to starve in the midst of so much food half of America is obese.  In point of fact, every government in a free society realizes that part of its responsibility IS to provide relief for the poor.  Otherwise, you will have riots and civil unrest that would make the Watts riots look like a Sunday school outing.  Are you honestly stupid enough to think that parents will happily allow their children to starve to death - or that anyone would obediently starve to death when the only thing separating them from almost limitless food is a thin plate glass window?  No, someone will eventually throw the first brick - and then that store will be swarmed with the starving and destitute - and they'll take every crumb.  In places like NK - funny how no one is allowed in or out of Pyongyang - so the poor don't see the elites and the elites don't see the poor.  But in America, you have rich and poor living side by side - sometimes poor and rich neighborhoods are separated by only a single street.  If the government does NOT provide any relief to those who cannot provide food for themselves - not just the poor, but the elderly and disabled who cannot work - you're essentially leaving them to die.  It has been said that society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable.  You right-wingers continuously fail that test and demonstrate your stoic lack of compassion for anyone but yourselves.  Fortunately, the REST of the free world has moved on from your archaeic and myopic worldview - unfortunately you've been holding the United States back from joining that free world so that now WE are one of the worst human rights violators on the planet - and by far the worst violator of any Western nation.",5년 전,1,

@theMosen," Krónika  You certainly can't blame it all on sanctions. China is right next door, they are the largest economy in the world by GDP (PPP) and they don't care about the sanctions, they have no qualms trading with North Korea. NK's problem is they have nothing of value to trade with, the ""Workers' Party"" has been mismanaging the economy for decades. They have basically zero manufacturing and very low production of crops and minerals due to lack of technology and even electricity.   But even if the economic hardship was entirely due to sanctions, that would not excuse the murder and brutality and terror this regime commits. Even as a socialist, myself, I find your instinct to run to these murders' defence alarming.",5년 전,1,

True. -The NK's believe that the world will take them more 'seriously' if they have nuclear weapons. True. Side note, does anyone take India or Pakistan 'more seriously' now that they have nukes? Quick answer: No. They are more dangerous, but only to each other. -NK society is dystopian as Hell. For example, in Pyongyang [a city where almost no one can get permission to own, much less afford to buy, a private car] there are traffic direction police on duty 24 hours a day.

As a result, most of them can either be bribed into letting you go or looking the other way, or are simply too hungry to care.",6년 전,1,

The demise of N. Korea's economy is a direct result of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries collapsed under communism.  If they can start a friendly relationship with their S.

The South Korean President Moon Jae In has been criticizing for kowtowing and giving in too much to KJU in the current peace process.

@jacobs-corner," @kepsenmz   France is not designated a socialist country if that is what you mean. It is true that they have socialist policies like welfare programs, public education, a progressive income tax etc etc... However, France has a balanced economy that to some extent allows the market forces to flourish, just like most countries.  When it comes to North Korea, the situation is completely different. There, the inhabitants relies on the government to provide for them and there are no competitors that can challenge the state monopoly of the economy. This is extremely dangerous, not only because it allows for power to be centred around one single institution (instead of divided which is one of base pillars of the French constitution), but also because it denies the human need to compete - an instinct that is hundreds of millions of years old. In other words: Capitalism is not only an ideology, it is the economic equivalent to natural evolution and therefore also a reflection of ourselves. Capitalism and its market forces are not bad and evil elements, they just needs some regulations and steering in order to benefit us and our civilization.",6년 전,0,

Maybe it's because and well-off countries there's plenty of people that live very good lives without having to wonder about their next meal or starving that that's not what people are out to look for anymore.

Bartering systems function all over the world and are distinct from capitalism, which is a system that focuses on imbuing something with little material value (i.e. gold or paper) with fictitious value so that it can be traded for items that are of actual use/value (i.e. food, tools, etc). It saves the step of needing to decide how much rice you're willing to part with for this bunch of apples, but it also eventually leads to advanced capitalism where money is treated as having value in itself not just the value it brings in being able to purchase things you actually use.",6년 전,1,

@AmbyJeans,"After he was done calling him ""Rocketman"" Trump went on to say nothing but glowing things about Kim Jong Un:  •""I was really being tough and so was he,"" Trump said. ""And we would go back and forth. And then we fell in love. No really. He wrote me beautiful letters.""  ""They were great letters. And then we fell in love,"" he continued.   • “Stepping across that line was a great honor,” Mr. Trump replied. “A lot of progress has been made, a lot of friendships have been made, and this has been in particular a great friendship.”  • “There was great conflict here prior to our meeting in Singapore,” he said. “Tremendous conflict and death all around them. And it’s now been extremely peaceful. It’s been a whole different world.”  “That wouldn’t necessarily have been reported, but they understand it very well,” he added, referring to the news media. “I keep saying that for the people who say nothing has been accomplished. So much has been accomplished.”  • “I see that, and I just received a beautiful letter from Kim Jong Un,” Trump said. “I think the relationship is very well, but I appreciated the letter. I saw the information about the CIA with regard to his brother or half brother, and I would tell him that would not happen under my auspices. I wouldn’t let that happen under my auspices. I just received a beautiful letter from Kim Jong Un.”  • on denuclearization: But the president on Monday, at the end of his short trip to Japan to meet the new emperor, insisted that he was not “personally” bothered by the tests and was “very happy with the way it’s going” in his efforts to engage North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Notably, Trump said he did not think the tests violated the U.N. resolution.   “My people think it could have been a violation,” Trump said. “I view it differently.”  Kim, Trump said, “is looking to create a nation that has great strength economically. … He knows that, with nuclear, that’s never going to happen. Only bad can happen. He understands that. He is a very smart man. He gets it well.”  The divergent remarks came after Trump on Sunday appeared to brush back his own national security adviser on Twitter.  “North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me,” the tweet read.  Trump also drew attention during his news conference with Abe for trumpeting a derisive comment Kim made about Joe Biden, Trump’s potential Democratic rival in 2020.   “Well, Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual,” he said, breaking with a tradition by U.S. presidents to not engage in politics on foreign soil. “He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that.”  Trump had doubled down on the remark earlier in the weekend with a tweet, writing he had “smiled” at Kim’s comment, speculating, “Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?”",6년 전,0,

Other examples are government of Iran, Venezuela, China, and DPRK of course, they are so corrupt, so oppressive, yet they survive, because, like James Madison once said, ""If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land (Iran, Venezuela, China, and DPRK), it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy (the US, Israel, and the west in general)."" For anyone who sympathize with the plight of people in DPRK (Iran, Venezuela, China, etc.), please call your senators, ask them to vote against any foreign intervention no matter how humane it sounds, be it special force deployment, funding the rebels (by the CIA and the State Department, with your tax dollar), economic sanctions (hurting the people, empower the dictator), or no fly zones (that ruined Libya and restared African slave trade for example), and trade wars.",6년 전,1,

People in democratic countries these days are so divided between left-wing and right-wing that we forget that the real issue for many people around the world is still between democracy and tyranny.,6년 전(수정됨),103,

@bonniemoon6790,"It's great and equally important to let their voices be heard, but I would've censored their faces and left out the specific escape route. Why? In North Korea if a member of a family defects they will kill, torture, or hold for ransom the family still in North Korea. The demons who run North Korea have access to the internet, etc, and if they trace a defectors face or name even those affiliated with them could suffer, even if they have done no wrong of their own. That's the face censoring. Second, I would've bleeped out the escape route. While it's heartbreaking hearing about the bottles and conditions, specifying the route only serves to have the dictator more thoroughly guard, patrol, or restrict areas specified, making it harder, riskier, if not more impossible for others to defect on that route. It only serves to make what is already dangerous even more so. Sadly we don't live in an ideal world. So while their escape is to be appreciated, you can't be naive about the horrendous people and what they will do following that. I pray for you all.",6년 전,0,

Receivers and satellites were banned and anyone caught owning one would get taken by the army and no one will see him again.  We never knew cellphones existed until after the war ended. And after raiding his palace, so many tapes were found of him and his sons and officials executing people (even month old children!!!!). Some of the videos can even be found on youtube. So many hidden graveyards were found full of unidentified bodies and even underground jails were discovered.   However, the irony of all this is that most Arabs love Saddam but at the same time they hate kim jung un! I will never understand how anyone can love or respect a monster like that. They call it opinion! I personay find it offensive when someone tells me he loves him, because if he loves him then he thinks Iraqi lives dont matter and its ok if we were tortured or executed... Whats even more sad is that some of the people who glorify him are actually Iraqis.... Just because they were on his good side and they were living a better life then under his ruling....",7년 전,0,

Be it the ongoing economic siege on NK, the war game with Japan and South Korean since 1953, or non-stop threatening of militaristic punishment, you make extremely easy for Kim Jong Un to dismiss public grievance as “overreaction of individuals misled by foreign propaganda"", or to justify crackdown on civil disobedience as ""preserving national sovereignty against foreign instigators"", and to shift the blame on economic disaster (i.e., the famine) caused by communism to imperialism from abroad, such as hundreds of US military bases, dishonest mainstream media, and economic siege (i.e., sanctions on NK). Other examples are governments of Iran, Venezuela, and China, who are so corrupt, so oppressive, yet they survive, because, like James Madison once said, ""If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land (Iran, Venezuela, China, and NK), it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy (the US, Israel, and the west in general)."" For anyone who sympathize with the plight of people in NK (and Iran, Venezuela, China, etc.), please call your senators, ask them to vote against any intervention no matter how humane it sounds, be it special force deployment, funding the rebels by the CIA and the State Department with your tax dollars, economic sanctions that starves the people more while empowering Kim Jong Un more; ask them to vote to stop the annual war games which not only cost your tax dollars, but also glorifies Kim Jong Un's dictatorship as heroic as protecting national sovereignty against enormous aggression from the most powerful nations on earth.",6년 전,0,

Mere support does nothing. You and I support the North Korean citizens, but it will mean nothing without being on the ground and fighting with them, like the French who aided the Colonies against the British Empire.   There is the S Korean army, but they're not allowed by the UN charter to aid the revolution directly by sending troops -- they can probably only arm them if they can even be sneaked in the border. These types of things never really work out either.   Aside from that, N Korea has Russia and China next door that can help. S Korea is almost stranded. So it doesn't even have geography on its side.  Your best bet is an all-out war and the allies coming to shut down N Korea, but that is almost impossible now without some kind of WMD being a probable use.   Should've been dealt with by force before they developed nuclear weapons. Now we're at the mercy of politics.",6년 전,3,

When I hear claims like this I just suggest the person dig out some archived newspaper from 50 years ago and read a few pages.

It is hard for us as individuals who did NOT grow up in this level of poverty to TRULY comprehend the truth in her words, but I know that even for myself who grew up in a family of 7 with absolutely NOTHING extra, I very much resonate with what she said.  it was our lack of extra that imprinted in me the importance of the little things in life like family, unity, togetherness, self control and optimism.  My ENTIRE life people have asked me where my joy, my personality, my grateful disposition comes from and I have always told people that when you are raised with little, you find the beauty in the nothingness. . . In the simply being here.  In the everything that you DO have.  In my family you did not eat until you were full because there was not enough food to get you full.  There was enough for us.  ALL of us.... and everyone got some.  I didn't eat breakfast and dinner's were small but we had each other and that was LITERALLY the only thing that mattered.  I KNEW how hard it was on my mom because I would see her cry sometimes BUT still, we were happy.  Keep in mind this upbringing was in the U.S. where we could easily compare our lives to the lives of friends at school who DID have wealth.  Now extrapolate this to a community in North Korea that has never even SEEN prosperity.  I would imagine that many of them do not even KNOW what the outside world looks like.  All they know is survival through each other so as long as you have each other you are happy.  It is not so common to yearn for things you do not know even exist when your reality is grounded in survival through each other.  Later in life I had the privilege to go to a very expensive private university and some of my absolutely wealthiest friends were the most unhappy individuals.  They could do whatever they wanted, and as a result were constantly looking for validation and purpose in all the things they COULD do, which led to massively empty, unhappy and unfulfilled lives.  This of course was not all of them, but, because of the life I have been so fortunate to live in all it's varying scopes, it resonates as clear as day to me that people with little are often happier than those who have much.  This is why we ALL know the age old adage: ""Money cannot buy you happiness"".",6년 전,4,

@TheCrazyNekoGirl2123,I do get what they are saying. I worry for the people of North Korea even though I am American. Some people might ask me why? I will say that I worry for them because they don't have the freedoms we do. As children dreams are what makes us want to be better they give us something to strive for. In America and many other places we are allowed to have those dreams but saying that someone can't have that dream or if they do they are to afriad to say anything about it for fear of punishment not only for them but their families because it may not be what the leaders says is OK is something that makes me personally want to cry. I don't say that any of the people are bad  but when I say people I don't mean the officials and I will say why. You may think of me what you want after but I want to say my piece. I doubt that officials don't have enough to eat. Judging by how the look I am sure they have plenty to eat.  They all looked pretty well fed to me not only in body shape but in skin color too as their skin looked healthy not pale white as people who do not have enough to eat have even though they work in fields a lot of the time. It just seems like they don't have to follow the rules and that is not right. I know about a caste system that can affect childs education and that isn't right either what  you can learn shouldn't to be affected by  your families status. I know that the people can think for themselves and I am  happy they can I just wish they could express it when and where they want to with out the fear of punishment. That is why I worry and what makes me sad but thank you for both of those people telling their stories and helping us understand more,7년 전,0,

@Jklaun,"I am from South Korea and I've been into North Korean people(Refugees), so I've watched so many TV shows and documentaries about them broadcasted in Korea. Sometimes, some refugees on TV weekly show programs disappeared without any notice. This is true story that one female popular refugee on several Korean TV shows was suddenly vanished. Even Korean police officers who had a duty to care about her, were not aware of her disappearance. So, they tried to catch her and many South Korean people were curious about it. Then a few days later, she was suddenly shown on a North Korea's propaganda broadcast out of nowhere.... that was pretty much shocking cuz she appeared on South Korean TV not that long ago before her disappearance. The police finally announced that North Korean police agency was often threatening her about her family members living in North Korea as hostages. The North Korean government let her family call her and then tell like this ""we are very suffering from poverty under their extreme surveillance because of your escape alone but they said if you come back to here again, they will definitely forgive everything and offer the best   life quality for us. So, that's why she went back. She had no choice for her family at that time. When she appeared on NK's TV, it seemed that she had a haircut by force, dying her hair black and had a swollen face (probably assaulted). Except her case, I saw many refugees stopped being shown on TV in the same reason. I don't hope Sunny has the same problem.. just wish her happiness somewhere.",7년 전,577,

@bboucharde,"Folks,  If we had much better relations with both Russia and China, there might have been a way to cooperate to decapitate the Pyongyang regime---but there are Stalinists (Jiang Zemin faction) in the Chinese government who support DPRK and who would oppose Chinese cooperation.   Moreover, the Clinton-DNC-MSM gang have ruined our relationship with Russia, which actually has a lot of leverage on the DPRK (employs 40,000 NK workers in Siberia and provides supplies & fuel)---and could have helped us, because they worry about Kim, too.  But since our (US) mainstream media has been slandering Russia for five years, the Russians will not help---and neither will the Chinese.     So, removing the NK regime without Russian & Chinese cooperation would be extremely difficult and costly.   I am afraid that the only way to cauterize the evil dictatorship in Pyongyang would be via massive air assault and ground invasion.......which could easily kill one million Koreans---and many thousands of US personnel.  The USA would have to put at least 200,000 troops into DPRK to occupy the country and remove the nukes and destroy the missiles.  Estimated cost to US taxpayers:  at least $1 trillion.   So, this is an impossible situation---probably leading to war.....with very nasty unintended consequences.",7년 전,0,

And whether there is desperation out of poverty or hollowness out of abundance, the former still maintain their senses of pain.

Cannibalism is not the rule as it was for millions under order by the Bolshevik Holodomor in Ukraine and Russia! I live in the West and I see how money rules people's lives, they get together ONCE a year for a brief Christmas dinner thinking their doing Jesus a favor, which most leave right after because they can't sit still and listen to their thoughts, needing constant distractions, lol! When these two on this show being interviewed, FEEL the difference between human connection and the hunt for material fulfillment, void of connection and consideration to their fellow humans, then it is a reality, it is their feeling that NO ONE can deny them!    I've watched the ""separate lives""  of the West,  experiments have been conducted in the streets of big cities in the states, where for example a young boy was left in the cold in just a T-shirt and passerbys just kept on walking without loosing any glance over the child, and many more such things had been carried out with despicable results!!! So you wanna talk about about ""lack of compassion"", start with hypocrisy in the West, because compassion is, when it suits the ego to make IT feel good nothing more! ""Separate lives in developed places"", uhm.... separate lives, separate hearts and if we are so developed how is it that developed places have so much shit going on in every imagined possible shitty way!!!?? Because nobody gives a shit, because the shallowness has eradicated ANY kind of sense, a Zombie state of being, nothing more!   ""See something, say something"", remember that slogan propagated by the NSA? People in their misconstrued perception calling on people for banalities who in the end get shot or suffer some type of loss etc!

But when people who don't believe in God have failures or troubles, they tend to blame themselves because they know that everything happens because of actions they choose, and people like this tends to see things cynically, and that's why I think more people that didn't have God as their guide tend to do suicide.

@gletschertaugaudi1358,"concentration camp, I thought it was an international term tbh.I'm certain the number of killings is in the same magnitude, but I've been to Dachau and the more frightening thing about the killings is how clinical and efficently they did it. They were undressed and put in huge public showers. The door would be locked and gas would be inserted into the chamber. The women hold their babies up in the air so that they might die first and not need to experience much of the cruelty. Those were the camps for killings, but most of the camps were labour camps. The victims would be underfed and had to built V2 parts(Dachau) or other Weapons, while dieing of diseases or hunger. The war in the east was a war of extermination and basically build up to free up space for german people, thus making soldiers extra cruel and mass executing civilians for partisanian warfare of other people. There are stories of soldiers using children as target practise and even throwing living babies up in the air and tring to shoot them mid air.",7년 전,25,

@Alexander-zt9kz,"xXx_MLGPRO_xXx the thing is Mussolini was never elected to office by Italians and most people opposed his rule. The reason why Mussolini got into office was because he staged an attack against Victor Emmanuel the 3rd, which just had witness the Russian Tsar get executed from a rebellion so when Mussolini's men charged Rome with knives ( there was a few guns, but nothing the Italian military couldn't handle ) they surrendered immediately and agreed to join a joint government with the fascist party.       When world war 2, a war he helped start and was fine with fighting. was closing and Italian citizens realized they had the support of the Allies and the Axis was losing ground, most if not all Italians turnt against Mussolini including Emanuel the 3rd.    What am I trying to say? That a rebellion / coup will never happen in North Korea like it happened in Italy. North Korean rebels will NOT have western support with NATO / South Korea troops on their soil fighting alongside.

@CrabTastingMan,"""There will never be a revolution. Not because people are scared to do it but because of propaganda. They've been taught from they were born that North Korea is the best and all the other countries are the worst."" You think Asians are stupid? Everyone in NK by adulthood learns the truth, and hates Kim, why do you think ppl try to escape in the first place? Cuz they know there are better places to live. Naive kids like you think revolutions work when ppl try hard enough. No. Revolutions in history only ever work when the military lets them by not killing the revolutionaries. In NK, the wealthiest people are the generals, they live better than generals in the free world, they are loyal to Kim: there is no way they will let revolutions form. That, and not even Soviet Russia executed the entire family and children for insubordination. Anyone in NK who thinks they will fight for their children's rights will see their children gutted before them. And not just children, the cousins, and their children, and grandparents, and their cousin twice removed whom they never even recognize, will be executed or sent to death camps. This is the same for people who escaped the country. Their sisters, brothers, parents, etc. were confirmed to have been dead in death camps. It is a little different now, they take the families left behind as hostages to extort the escapees for money. Every time the escapees send money to their families back in NK the Party takes like 90% of it. But with the shittiest economy in the world, 10% left is still a lot for the dirt-poor North Koreans.  And in a poor bleak country with no food, no money, no property whatsoever, family is the last thing you have. And your first and foremost priority is looking for food or stuff to steal to sell so your family won't starve. You think people have time to think about revolutions? You're not even allowed to have friends gather in groups of 3s whether it be in public or private. That ofc, does not apply to the nobles, because why would rich nobility hate the regime?

One of the reasons the Nazis invaded Poland was because of people told them that the polish were terrible people to each other and they should invade Poland to add it into Germany and settlement space. This entire video could be staged with fake actors trying to get people to support a war in North Korea.  A war with North Korea will only give the Rothchilds another bank to control, increase the profits of the military industrial complex, and further prepare our country for WW3, Agenda 21, and the New World Order. Wake up North Korea is probably not entirely a suffering nation like the corporate media wants you to think. It could be more like China or Vietnam.

KOREA. at this point, i don't see much of a peaceful option to ending the noko regime. and that puts a staggering amount of civilian lives in direct danger on both sides of the border.   personally, i think a direct approach is the best. lil kim (as i call him) only has one real threat to hold us at bay. which is his massive artillery battalions aimed right at seoul. without that, he has nothing. and though many would disagree. i'm sure lil kim is not a stupid person. and he knows a full out conflict with the US and soko only leaves him with 2 options.  A. getting taken out in a US soko strike.  B. getting captured and later tried in the world court. knowing he'll hang for his crimes against humanity.   a 3rd option of escaping to a foreign ally is possible. but very very unlikely. no nation is gonna sacrifice their entire nation and its economy for lil kim's ass.   knowing this, i'd move our forces into a readied state. and notify noko we want to talk. then i'd begin evacuating the seoul region (yes i know that is a lot of people). once evaluations begin,  i'd make noko very aware that we will NOT fire a shot until noko fires first. but if noko does fire a shot. we'll rain in hell on them. then while evacuating continues. i'd offer lil kim a 3rd real option. which would be that if he declares a complete surrender and orders all forces to stand down. we'll allow him and his high level officers an escape option. we'll let them take an exuberant amount of money and vanish, period. new name, new place etc etc etc. under one condition... we never see or hear from them ever again. if we do... we'll come get you... and we'll fucking hang you, period. then when all is settled... the US steps back and lets soko take over reunification efforts with US support.",7년 전,0,

@viiperbiite,"왕따 ; memedy   Learn Hangul first and well. I recommend watching Go! Billy and his “Learn Hangul in 90 minutes.” Video on YouTube. Get a notebook and write down everything and listen to what he says. Repeat. (Of course you’re not going to learn in 90 minutes but his video is good and you can pause and refer back to it.).   (Billy also has three (slightly expensive unless you get the ebooks) textbooks with full Korean lessons.    Then find Korean grammar videos and use the website KoreanClass101 (the site takes a bit of time to get use to but it is quite helpful.) also watch their YouTube videos.  I also recommend you change as much in your life as you possibly can to Korean. (Listen to kpop, watch Korean movies/cartoons/dramas, use the Korean keyboard (standard) on your phone.)  Flash cards are useful.   Patience, perseverance and practice is key. Because it will get very confusing and difficult at times. Keep in mind it will take months or years to learn. Practice speaking, sounding out, reading and writing Korean everyday.   You could try apps if you want too. You could also try to find someone who speaks Korean and speak with them.   Speaking is also key. Trial and error. Mistakes and embarrassment will more than likely occur.   Find a reliable method but a method that works for you.   Learn a little bit about Korea’s history and history of their language/s. Also learn about their cultures and ways.  Don’t rely on and don’t use romanisation to write. Yes, it does seem easier but you won’t be understood. Use romanisation only as a guideline to help you pronounce words.  Try to learn the formal and informal language.   Learn like a little kid learning their first language. (Even though it’s a bit annoying and no one needs to know) kids shows, worksheets, kids songs etc.    Visit Korea (South, unless you’re brave).

@witchyvoodoo,"Humans are beautiful, these two North Koreans are inspiring. Our democratic republic is far from perfect and becoming more and more centralized, 40% of democrats voted for a self described ""democratic socialist"" last year. While we wont become a North Korean dictatorship, the woes and pains of socialism will still be crippling and economically destructive. In fact the bits and pieces of socialized bureaucracy such as Medicaid, Medicare & Social Security have already created $200+ trillion in debt we cant afford. As Regressive-progressives, democrats, and the faux-conservitive ilk expand these programs they will start looking to take over large businesses like insurance companies, pharmeceuticals, hospitals & other large business structures (aka: Venezuela like endeavors). This will come through bankrupting the companies through regulation (ie Obamacare) then taking them over through the bailout process. The masses will cheer the takeover since these companies have been vilified through decades of propaganda. Then the government will take the profits from these companies and use them to pay into the vast welfare programs that are bankrupt. However, due to the requirements of the welfare programs for vast sums of cash, no reinvestment back into these massive industries will be possible. Equipment will age, infrastructure will crumble, and these glorious gold mines of once capitalistic empires will turn into negative investments. The welfare programs will collapse after society has become almost all-dependent on them, along with once vibrent and healthy industries and those services they provided will no longer be offered too. Venezuela sits on the worlds largest oil reserves and they are broke, because of Socialism. Moral of the story, Utopian ideology is best for religious books, the afterlife, and population control via unintended (yet predictable) side effects such as starvation.

@damnbabygirl8926,"God, I hate it when people blame Western or prosperous countries for other countries' starvation. Yes, global hunger is an extremely big issue, but there is a much bigger and more significant reason on why it happens, and it's not because of wasted food. Global hunger is because of improper distribution, and this occurs because the world generally runs on capitalism. 95% of food is not owned by the government, but by private corporations and companies. The government cannot simply take surplus foods off of supermarket shelves and give them to North Korea or any other starving country. Sure, the government definitely has the ability to do that, but that would create conflict, since the people of any country don't want their tax money being spent to feed another country.  It's up to private corporations and companies, or aid groups, or even simple individuals to send food to other countries. But in North Korea's case, they're not going to accept any donations from Americans. In fact, the United States of America, the United Nations, and other countries have TRIED to donate food and rice to North Korea. But guess what Kim Jung Un did with them? He literally gave all of the food, which was meant for the civilians, to the North Korean army. He also sold some of it and spent it on military equipment.   You seriously cannot blame Americans because of wasted food. If Americans do not eat what is on the shelves, then companies and private corporations will literally just move to another country. They'll go to China, or Europe, and then people will be blaming these ""Damn Europeans wasting food!"" Right now, there is AN INSANE amount of food-- enough to end world hunger. But guess what? It's the bad distribution of food that is causing it",8년 전,93,

I don’t like capitalism because it’s short term (as in it’s only about earning money now and there id no long term planning.) and is always needing to expand in order to continue, so if it the market it’s dealing in is harmful it will become more harmful. I don’t like it because it often takes advantage of the weak (where our clothing comes from, children in factories in places like cambodia.) and cripples the masses (one percent have control, hard for unions to gain power, etc.) in terms of power. And it’s incredibly wasteful: look at the food market. We throw out and bleach good food so that it can’t be eaten because it doesn’t look nice. I understand we are where we are because of it, but it doesn’t mean that I like it or that I think things should stay the same.",7년 전,1,
@smissions7340,"It seems to me that you're against capitalism as implemented in the US. I many other countries where capitalism is implemented, people are paid a living wage. I live in a capitalist country, there is little social support but very low taxes.   In fact, if you make minimum wage you don't pay income tax at all. Your food bill is barely 10% of your salary, room rent is maybe 20%, transport maybe 15%, so you get to save more than half your salary and this is on minimum wage.   This leaves a lot of people with a lot of money in the bank. Many will reinvest the money, thus funding others who start new businesses to cater for the demand of the people who have money (which is pretty much everyone.)   This makes them a lot of money, which most will reinvest.. you get the idea. This is what happens in many capitalist countries.   This in a nutshell is capitalism - people spend, make others rich, they spend, and make others rich, and so on. It's not capitalism's fault that people choose to hoard money or be really short term.   If one percent of the population have control of everything, it's no longer a capitalist economy :) A capitalist economy is as I have described above. Everyone needs something and/or wants something. Because of that he will need money. He can only get money by providing something people want or need. One person or group cannot control everything because they can't possibly provide everything everyone wants, and have nothing they need or want in return :)  Because of this, it's kind of silly to say one percent can control the economy - they can't make everything everyone wants, and they have needs and wants which will require them to depend on others.  As for the children in Cambodia. If you were in a centrally planned economy, you'd only have one set of clothing - the children in Cambodia would be starving because of no demand. There would be no real economy to speak of, their lives would be controlled by a government.   The children in Cambodia only survive BECAUSE of capitalism - people always want new t-shirts, who doesn't have a whole lot of t-shirts? :) there's no reason for anyone to have a closet full of t-shirts, but they do because capitalism right? that's the best part of capitalism - they want more t-shirts because they are greedy, but at the same time they unconsciously help others survive by gratifying their needs, wants and desires :)  This throwing out, bleaching and cleaning thing only really happens in the US, I have no idea why that is. Over here the eggs aren't cleaned, sometimes you can even see chicken poop on them. Stores do with almost expired stuff what any capitalist would do, sell them at reduced prices.   It's good that you understand that you are where you are because of what the people demand, but that again is not because of capitalism, it's because that's what people want and will pay for. It's partly because the US is almost a monoculture - about 76% (more than three quarters) identify as ""white"" and by and large pretty much share the same culture.   So pretty much everyone lives the same way, likes the same things, thinks the same way, eats the same things, wears the same clothing, and pretty much have the same wants and desires. In a monoculture, if everyone wants all the same things, and you don't, it might be a bit of a struggle. That is not the result of capitalism but more the result of a monoculture.   Unions are not a capitalist thing - in fact unions are anti-capitalist because they constantly attempt to manipulate salaries. In a real capitalist economy, if you paid low wages people would just leave for companies that pay more. The idea that someone would choose to work for a company, and then try to force them to pay more is strange,   It makes one wonder why they don't start their own businesses or go work for someone else.

@HJ-hy2py,"It's not really happiness, it's called being content. When you're in such bad state, you're always aware of how much worse it could be, the things others are going through. For example if you're a man working for 5$ a month, you think about those who don't have fixed jobs or incomes and are starving. And those are thinking of the ones in Labor Camps, working day and night without gaining anything in return. And if you're one of those, you think that it could be better than a public execution or being tortured to death. You always know that there is something that's worse, that there's someone praying to be in your place... you kind of count every little blessing. Also, the people tend to be closer and more protective, specially if they're limited to such or such area, cause everyone becomes your family and you worry about them as if they're your responsibility, to a certain point of course.

@doraaaa0613,"Hmm, I guess maybe... Partly they're happy because they don't know what exists outside of their own bubble and they don't know that there's a better lifestyle with more freedoms out there. I suppose it has to do with a lack of critical thinking skills as most of the older generations have been force fed propaganda day in and day out. The youth may be more disgruntled though, I'm not sure. To us they live monotonous and dull and propaganda riddled lives but to them, it's the only thing they've ever known? So the lack of choice essentially lets them lead mentally happier/less burdened lives? I'm just shooting at the dark here, of course. I mean haven't there been studies where a lack of choice has motivated people to do better and end up happier with their results than when they are given different choices? Of course, this still doesn't at all justify the terrible lives that NK citizens are leading. I would rather they have on average less happiness and live freely and fully than have them be happier on average but live under a cruel regime like NK.",8년 전,43,

@Innomen,"Her tone and facial expression are WAY wrong for the topic. You could swap the subtitles and believe she's describing a trip to the grocery store.  Now I'm not saying she's lying or even wrong, I'm just commenting on the jarring discontinuity. And it doesn't seem to be a cultural thing since the guy's expressions are much more congruent.  TWIMC: My opinion on NK is that we should do whatever we can to reform that government. But to be fair there are like a billion other places that need that as well.   The three most insane countries other than mine are imo: NK, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.  I'm hoping reforming mine will go a long way to fixing Israel and SA, since we fund and protect them basically, but NK is a different story. I think China is gonna have to handle NK.  I prefer economic technological and non-violent means. I almost feel like we can solve this problem simply by equipping/informing NK citizens. But of course I realize it's not that simple and there's a lot more to it.  I mean imagine with we air dropped like 500 million solar/crank charged cell phones full of useful data and stealthy mesh net capabilities all over the country via millions of small drones all at once. At least a third of them would stay in civilian hands. Seems like that would form the basis of a revolt or at least massive political upheaval.  I don't know.

He and his 2 younger brothers moved to South Korea when tensions escalated between the two Korea's before the Korean War.  His two older brothers decided to stay behind and when the war came, all connection was severed. Similarly, my grandmother left behind everything to escape to China. She left behind money, family, friends, and a home at the age of 17. She eventually moved to South Korea, married my grandfather, then moved here in the late 70's.  The people who praise North Korea don't understand what the North Korean people go through everyday and it hurts to know that i have family in North Korea. What scares me even more is that they may be in a concentration/work/death camp.  Kim Jong Un needs to be tortured by his own people until he dies. This man needs to suffer for causing over 3 generations of dictatorship and needs to die slowly. I am proud of my North Korean ancestry and will display it proudly, but the leadership of that country needs to die now. Revolution must occur and true democracy must be restored.

This war wasnt like Vietnam, this was a WWII type war for territory,  pitched battles that were fought with North and South Korean forces as well as Chinese forces.

Would the people even be ready for any kind of intervention or are they too indoctrinated?  I have thought about what could be done at times but most things seem to be prone to making things worse. E.g. we could try to pressure NK with more sanctions but with how the government apparently seems to operate this will just mostly affect the people. We could try and march in and assume the military bravado really is just bravado and that we can mop it up easily with superior technology but we might be seen as invaders if we do.

@Blaster53,"Sure, all is pure truth, last time I have seen on TV that in N Korea are living no more than 50 people as everybody else died from starvation or they were killed by police, army, firelighters, butchers and even nurses. True terrible place to live or shall I say to die. No matter what N Korea will be soon liberated as the rest of living are nearly as dead and all of this dissidents will be able to return and build a new society full of freedom and happiness western stile.   It seams to me that they are really brainwashed by our propaganda, now can any explain me what is the difference being hungry in N Korea or in USA? Do these Koreans know that in the western world we have about 500 multi billionaire and about 1 billion poor people who are laying themselves that all is nice and fine and simply cannot spend 20 dollars or EUR for something better than essential.   Does any of westerners realised that N Korea is under the tremendous sanctions even food is banned to be traded with them, It is absolute miracle that they did not die all so far as that is US only intention. USA wants and will punish anyone who will not bend before their terror.   Can anyone tell me how many wars fought N Korean in last 70 years and how many USA? How many people were killed by N Korean army and how many by USA, How many war crimes committed N Korea and how many USA. How many innocent people killed USA police and how many N Korean?  There are 100 similar questions but most of us westerners are brainwashed and believe only what terrorist leading country on planet is telling us. Our EU leaders are slaves of USA politics and are going to dig in shit and eat it if USA is telling them to do.   N Korea is small country under permanent siege from USA terrorist just because they want to break their independence. N Korea wants to be treated as equal partner as they have dignity and honour which are unknown for USA. It is USA which is rejecting every single N Korean call for negotiations, not N Korea. It is USA which is breaking any international law when it does not suit them. N Korea so far did not break any international law, not evebn by developing nuclear weapons as it was never signatory to Non Proliferation Treaty and therefore is not obliged to obey these rules as neither Israel, Pakistan nor India were and all of them have nuclear weapons and yet no one is threatening them and USA and west permanently threat N Korea.   Live them in peace and they will not touch anyone, now as they have nuclear weapons USA does not want conflict as they know that they will use nuclear weapons in self defence and they would be fully justified.  I do not like this Kim family as they are mentally sick but you do not punish whole nation because a imbecile family. It is up to N Korean people to decide their future not idiots in Washington in White House and Capitol Hill. Every US administration in last 70 years committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.

It's scary to think of going to war with North Korea knowing that it's likely that South Korea could get nuked.  My first thought is that the best way is through revolution. That we could supply weapons and inspiration to the people and they could liberate themselves. But the fact that the guy said North Korean towns are separate and isolated would mean that any revolution would likely be severely undermanned.  I wonder how likely it would be to entice a general in the North Korean military to lead a coup?  The US and South Korea would probably need to go to open war against the North. I'm sure we'd get refugees and defectors flooding into our lines. Though that gives opening to the possibility of North Korean spies and saboteurs coming in among the refugees.

If you have a good understanding of how the average person lives in most countries, then look on a map--especially during the Cold War. Notice that all the ""free"" capitalist countries that ""did really well"" were situated right next to a communist country such as West Germany was situated right next to East Germany, Western Europe to Eastern Europe, or South Korea next to North Korea. These are places where broken-up families and friends could be depended on to spread information about the governments they lived under respectively, thus creating discontent and envy in the communist countries. The most corrupt, vile and embarrassing capitalist countries such as Haiti, Mexico, the Philippines, Venezuela, Brazil, etc. with their tremendous lack of employment, education, housing, roads, infrastructure, sewage  systems, clean water, medicine, paid vacation time, etc. were a long, long way away.

They wouldn't give a damn about such hardships unless it happens to them. For a country that says it's the greatest country in the world, they sure are pretty goddamn selfish and non caring. Like what about the vaccine for HIV from both India and America. The Indians gave it to the African for free but America said they will only give their to Africa if Africa pays them. this really disgusted the Indians and they made a report on the Americans that really humiliated the Americans, that the U.S. tried desperately to try to think of a god comeback. For a country who thinks it's the best, I would expect that they would be generous and give the HIV vaccine for free. Suffering should not have a payment! If an orphan is getting adopted and really wants a home, would you bastards ask for payment. When adopting a child, that child needs two things: A home and Love.

It's very different in other countries, for example, Libya, Syria and Yugoslavia all had or have civil wars, however those civil wars are more of a religious incentive than anything else. However, in North Korea you don't have any religion and only one ideology that only the most wealthy people like because they live of off it. The biggest problem with toppling North Korean regime would be how to repair it. One Germany still has till this day a big problem with its Eastern part even though Germany's GDP is 2-3 times larger than that of South Koreas.

I may not be Korean but I am very against the way North Korea treats its citizens and wish nothing more for a Unified Korea under the governance of South Korea.   A revolution needs to happen in North Korea and people need to stand up like the founding fathers of the US to be free from a monarchy that was persecuting people for their religious beliefs. I know it sounds hard but a small movement could be all that it takes if the higher up officers have that much hate for Kim Jong Un. It has worked many times in history, you just have to wait for the right moment to strike. The start of a revolution can also lead to defectors working in secret to overthrow a dictatorship such as in North Korea. And you need to encrypt your communication so your family cannot be monitored. I'm an electrical engineer tech, I know how to do these espionage things against other countries and grew up in a military from The Revolutionary War to The Current Wars going on.

A lot of North Koreans are getting their education in foreign countries then come back to build that bomb. The loyal ones came back of course probably because their family ""might be"" in danger.  If his army wanted to, it could easily topple Kim Jong Un. And obviously there were a lot of political struggles which we witness in Kim Jong Un ""taking out"" his dissidents. No it is not in American's place to criticize or judge especially Americans have bombed many nations created ISIS interfered in many presidential election campaigns and executed leaders of other nations for no reasons.

And the way she described everything, all giggly and smiling, makes it seem like she either wasn't affected by it or she was lying, which is terrible either way. There's other things with this video, but it also seems inconsistent with this other video I saw of an interview with a defector, where what she talked about was like the opposite of what the boy in this video was saying.

Worst case scenario, if military action were the only way forward...I think China should be allowed to stage a rapid take-over, backed by the US military if needed.  Then just sit back and see if the Korean population, with their strong Korean identity, wouldn't eventually push for independence once again, with a democratic govt....OR EVEN a communist govt like China has, which is AT LEAST not just a family run oligarchy.  As China has evolved...vast amounts of freedoms have been gained over the recent decades by the people.  So eventually, it would probably all work out...and i can't help but assume that one day the two Koreas would naturally want to re-unify.",8년 전,0,

@Toppricegr,I will try to explain why North Korea people is mostly kind people ... and some of you will laugh and will not understand because you did not had same life experiences but sill i will say my mind. Their goodness come from the Political stance of the country ... Communism is a hard way in this world because it is constantly suppressed by Capitalistic West .. The only country that was near to reach Communism was USSR at the period 1970 - 1985 ... I remember those days and you where not afraid to go outside and walk at any time because the vast majority of population was kind ... You did not had 100.000 different clothes cars and items but you had all needed for a happy life ... and children had values ... And then the west start to attack hidden in the shadows ... and start to create envy ...  This was the correct path for this planet .. there was not overuse of resources .. If we all followed this path human civilisation would flourish and prosper ... The Union of the people and the equality in the resources distribution is the key to survive .. yet the west is try to go the other way ... the way that will lead us all in a total annihilation ... I wouldn't be alive when this day has come ... but i feel very sad because we have so many interesting questions that need to be answered we know nothing about our universe about our planet about us and all the life as we seen it .. and yet we choose to spend the precious time we live for empty targets ... We only start to feel all this when life is near the end ... I am a logical person and i see many thing that are good in our current way of life ... but the most important is very wrong ... and this way will lead us to destruction ... North Korea is in the wrong path because they have western type of government in a country that try to follow Communism ... they take advantage of many to gain for their personal pleasure and thirst of power. Is this remind to you something? Is this not the Western way? Same but less freedom or illusion of freedom.   But please they are far from reaching Communism.. First Read what is Communism ... so far no country ever reach Communism all try but fail .. I know that it is hard to reach this because all humans need to be good to accomplish this goal .. and this is nearly impossible ... but we have try .. not for us ... not for our children relatives but for the greater good of mankind ... Some people lost their way and we need to find the correct method to show them the path .. North Korea will never listen USA because they political views are totally different.. why try to escalate by force? Nothing good will come out of this only another failure ... A country that share same or near same principals will only maybe achieve something through diplomacy and those country is Russia or China .. but USa don't wanna leave this to them because of geopolitical ambition ... Usa only goal is to get the entire world into their perspective and create vassals so every nation will do as they please .. and create a planet of slaves through the monetary dependent system ...  We have limited time ... the gift of life is so small ... You don't have the right to do this ... I remember the 80s when i use to live in USSR and i remember what a great country it was then ... and yes there was some flaws but we where near to achieve something great ... and  now i leave in the western world and read and hear what they use to know about USSR then and i understand all now ... those lies that the media and your governments feed all .. they worked .. everybody hates Communism yet they don't even know what its really is .. They show you as communism some failed attempts and failed governments and western logic leaders that exploit the people and name this Communism ... I feel sorry for the People of North Korea because they are doomed to suffer because of the mistakes made by both west and they own government ..,8년 전,1,

The UN took over and sent food aid in and the found out that the North Korean army was getting it.    People started joining the army there just to get something to eat essentially.  Sort of what guys used to do here back in the Great Depression.  They were starving, had no money, so they'd work on a farm just so they'd have a roof over their heads and a promise of a decent meal.

With the Berlin air drop, the U.S. was dropping humanitarian relief to an ally, namely, the West German citizens living in (as well as Western Allies' occupying forces stationed in) the besieged West Berlin sector. When the U.S. air drop occurred, it was no surprise to the Soviet occupying forces nor to the East German government. On the other hand, the paranoid, belligerent North Korean dictatorship (eager to act on its own outrageous propaganda, no less) might view an air drop as an act of war and would not hesitate to shoot down the planes. It should be remembered that North Korea is still officially in a state of war with the U.S. and South Korea. Despite tensions between the U.S. and the Eastern Bloc nations under the Soviet Union, there was no state of war that existed between the former allies. It would have been incredibly bad public relations for the Soviet-supplied East German military to shoot down the aircraft of an ""ally.""",8년 전,4,

@theUglyManowar,"@Jeremy Kather That's an important point. One might feel justified dismissing the validity of someone's suffering in the US to the point of suicidal escape. Where they have no perspective. But my experiential evidence doesn't prove as much. I suppose because one's environment defines ""much"" if not all of one's perspective.  Where most of my entire Korean family were tortured and slaughtered during the JeJU massacre... And though many of my family survivors would not exist if my Grandmother did not predict the turmoil : fleeing and hiding as many as she could... Escaping and becoming US citizens was of course a blessed privilege! But as continued success and prosperity was realized that hardly dismisses hardships and tragedy.  Not just obvious events like death in the family or health tragedies. But even events one might assume are trivial in comparison... Such as losing a job promotion/college picks etc... that would had enabled one's dreams/passion.  A failed relationship/Divorce/Parents divorce. Infertility.  No one escapes horrific oppression who struggling for their life and their ""dreams""...  only to ""settle"" if they finally make it to the land of opportunity.  Everyone's tragedies r exactly that. A tragedy.  Also... Health concerns add an extra layer of consideration.  Depression is now designated as Major Depressive mood disorder because to many people confuse as much with a simple ""choice"". Which is hell for someone who has a coping disease living in a society  that expects them to simply cope.  With that said....

@vdamianov,"The tales are 100% lies. Why I think so? Firstly, very big contradictions. One moment the girl said that the whole family to the last baby is to be non-mersifully executed soon after a flee of a refugee-relative. Shortly after that she expresses a joy, that regulary talks with her family thru illegal sent mobile. The logical question here is- why her family is still alive? After years obviously known from the authorities fact of escaping??? The boy is a slightly more convincing (his version is smarter). He talks about youth protests in todays North Korea as a symbol of emancipation and will for freedom (strange words of so young, north korean teenager, I suspect him being potential genius...or a product of long term ""cultivation'' under the leading role and hard repetitions of an american teacher...). And if the communication with the North is so hard, and inner travel inside the state- very limited, how he UNDERSTOOD this years after his flee to the South? The accent above the korean youth make me suspective, because I know all the technology of the so called ''democratical institutions and propaganda centers"" for brainwashing the youth thru selected examples of west kind of living. Artificial and fake ones, of cause. The communist propaganda is a kiddish joke, compared with the colorised tons of west propaganda technologies. A story, smelling of cheap antikorean and proamerican propaganda. No wonder, that the oficial interview officer is korean, speaking...brilliant english. I can swear, that no one permanently living in South Korea, korean citizen, can speak such a kind fluent english, without no accent, otherwise typical for the  main features of the korean phonetic or spell.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

Worse than starving is to realize that it would be impossible to ever realize your potential no matter how much effort you put forth, and no way out of their situation, unless they risk their lives to leave.

@Texas3Step,"North Korea is probably the worst of the nations that are still Communist, but horrors like these escapees describe take place, to varying degrees in all Communist nations.  There has been starvation due to lack of food caused by poor management, or due to government attempts to subjugate certain regions.  There is government control over what the people may read, whether or not there is any religious practice permitted, where people may work and how much they must produce, what the children learn in schools, etc.  Neighbor spies upon neighbor, children spy on their parents, reporting infractions to the government.  There is poor medical care, or none at all.  People line up for days for the chance to buy a pair of ill-fitting shoes.    In spite of the terrible history of Communism, foolish people in the free and prosperous nations of the West still read Communist and Socialist writings and embrace the ideas, and try to convert their own nations to Communism.  History and reality mean nothing to such fools, so any of us who see the truths of Communist tyranny must be alert, and do all we can to teach and dissuade those who believe the lies, even fighting them if they use violence.

Old age and infertility are just two reasons why people may not be able reproduce--it is ridiculous that such simple concepts have to be explained, but here we have you.  Gay means a species ""chooses to die""?  So you're one of those idiots who thinks people can only be gay OR reproduce, and that being gay is a choice?  Dude, you're a complete fucking idiot.  Finally, you reduce sexual orientation to simply being ""feelings""?  But I'm a joke.  No, I am not making excuses for anybody, I did however, feel the need to reply to what I thought was the stupidest comment I'd hear for a while, and then you come along.

@mythril4,"Wish America could help in this case. however, since we are the epicenter of their hate and the world already gets crazy about the USA freeing any citizen from any other country. Well you could see it would only cause a world war, something the North Korean government already knows. However, China actually can do something about it, would be cool if they did. The last option would be all the people of North Korea working together, since their military is the people, it would not take too many lives to destroy the regime. However, once again, the North Korean government knows this so they work tirelessly day and night making sure the people feel like this option is impossible. They also know that China can become two sided, by toppling their own regime, China has the option to replace it. If the South worked with the people of the north, it would cause a potential world war. The south being backed by the USA and the north by China, you can see the problem. That's why the best two options is China removing the regime or the people of North Korea working as a unit. If the North does become free, I would highly suggest never allowing someone who's first name is ""Kim"" become the leader.   This is why in the USA I fight against those who desire communism or socialism. North Korea is the spotlight of why it's the worst type of government possible.",8년 전,0,

What is happening in north korea is so, so wrong, but I also think what the girl said about happiness is right -- the more well off a country, with more tiny choices that aren't as obvious as life and death for individuals to choose, the more we as a society find hard to find peace within ourselves.  Sometimes, hardships bring people together, and as a society without one hardship that brings us all together, with no hard choices except about a gazillion significant or insignificant we are not entirely sure paths and choices ahead of us, we falter, and that is not good.  Sometimes, money money money and more money and sometimes you forget who you are.  Other times, no money, in a world that needs it, without people by your side -- or money, but no people. Without hardships, sometimes you forget about the other people suffering out there.  That's why we have to all  acheive and live UP to our dreams -- so we can change ourselves and the world, and see the bigger picture, and find true happiness, for ourselves, and everyone around us -- whether that is becoming the next president, journying 360 around the world, raising a family in a small house in a small town, or whatever, anything.

@captmcneil,"It's really hard for the western society to understand that even in countries like North Korea, there are just normal people, thinking their minds, living their lives. It annoys me, when especially American documentaries portray NK as some kind of nuclear threat full of crazy mindless zombies, that just has to be neutralized. Propaganda works both ways, it seems.  There are only few very good documentary films, such as the one done by ARTE, but they are German or French. Also, there is an excellent Google Talk by Siegfried Hecker in English about their nuclear program here on YouTube (""What I Saw in North Korea and Why it Matters""), where you soon realize that NK relations are not just black and white, good and evil. There is a lot of stuff going on, and history has not been kind to the divided Korea. Especially what the Bush administration did with their ""axis of evil"" rubbish was unforgivable, and did not help the people there in any way.  It feels to me, North Korea is the scapegoat, and the US has no real interest in stabilizing the whole situation there. That does not mean, I want to excuse the horrible things the NK leadership does to its people, as an act of self-preservation, of course. But you have to know things like President Carter once had very good relations to the NK government, in order to understand how frustrating diplomatic relations have become.  The country and its culture and history is very interesting, yet sort of sad and frustrating, but lots of people don't really care or even know about it. I really really wish for more empathy there from the west, and that the country opens up soon and makes a reunion at least again a possibility.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

Two preeminent realist scholars John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt in international relations theory, maintain that both Israeli leaders and the Israel lobby in the US urged the Bush administration to invade Iraq—a course of action, they contend, that was not in the geostrategic interests of the US but that Israel saw its interests.

Kim Jong Un nor any one of his predecessors look like they ever go hungry but their people starve to death by the millions. Electricity only a couple of times a YEAR?

Acknowledging that fact that the measures in North Korea for doing something what is considered ""illegal, liberal or against the law""  is more draconian and could lead to brutal punishment by the state. Entire point facilitates around what both of them are being thought throughout childhood and as they are being raised because this period is vital for the human being and what we have so far is that the people from both countries (irrelevant how pitiful and catastrophic the conditions in N.D are) both of them believe world revolves around them while they are institutionalising their own agenda in the countries which is terrifyingly far from the mere reality since they re-write history and replace their countries/nations as the heroes of the story. In case of America it goes further to the point to how the mass isn't as educated as it should be instead the mass would rather go on protest for feminism(which most of them don't understand the basic concept of)  let's say for an example when that has little to no impact on anything across the world and little to none impact in their own country either. They take the material, they put it out of context instead of reading a book or two and getting a degree in something and this also could be partly blamed on the American education system, while in North Korea they script their identity and create a whole new one where they are basically living in their own bubble and regard themselves as virtually superior to most other countries and have installed hate for the West based on reasons literally centuries ago.",8년 전,3,

@xyzsame4081,"You are aware that the US - literally - bombed North Korea into oblivion, in the 1950, are you ?  20 - 25 % of the population died due to the bombings. All cities (all of them !) were destroyed. And I think also a lot of SK cities (it might have been slightly less awfull. - I recommend Col.  Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff under Colin Powell - there is an interview (around April 2017) on North Korea on the Real News Network.   NK has well hidden nukes pointing at South Korea (they could maybe also  reach Japan). And I am pretty sure they have them because China wanted them to have them.   In SK the US has 25,000 soldiers and also nukes -  pointing at China of course. China wants NK and SK to remain separated - they want the buffer and I can understand why. Maybe you have not paying attention to the action of the US empire and NATO - but China and also NK have.   If there was ever to be a betterment of the situation it will have be through diplomacy.  Neither the US nor the other Western countries (I mean the governments) care for the fate of the North Korean people. The Clinton admin reached some agreements with NK (which the US did not really fulfill) so NK started again being busy with nukes and missiles. GWB called them axis of evil. Now, while the regime is evil - so are others. And NK was at time no threat to the US. - But the empire always needs an enemy and from time to time NK gets more attention. - US citizens grew tired of hearing of the Middle East wars.",8년 전,9,

@darrisx8146,"When WWII ended, a socialist-leaning provisional government was established called the People's Republic of Korea. When they were forcibly torn in half by the US-Soviet deal, the US started immediately exerting its military might so the provisional government moved North and eventually became the DPRK. The DPRK is the legitimate indigenous government of the Korean people and South Korea is a US puppet. The US military can take over the South Korean military in the event of war even today. South Korea is not Korea.",8년 전,1,
@jonahscher-zagier8196," @darrisx8146  So naive. Kim is a terrible socialist. He recently even removed the language guaranteeing Marxism from the Constitution, so that he could add language saying that his dynasty would rule forever. At best, he is a fascist. At worst, he is a king like that of Saudi Arabia. The country's  previous motions toward Communism were a thin veneer that has fooled very few intelligent Communists of my acquaintance.  Your belief that NK represents a more independent government than South Korea also makes me shake my head. Right now, it is as much a client state of China as South Korea is of the US. More, perhaps, due to its proximity. Previously, much the same was true with the Soviet Union. You want to know why? Because no weak country, least of all one subject to international opprobrium, can remain unaligned for long. As for any notions of legitimacy, let's be clear. Legitimacy comes from the consent of the governed. The problem is, South Korea is no longer a dictatorship. It actually lets the people vote. Moon Jae-In, for instance, had an 80% popularity rating when he entered office (it's about half that now due to his poor management). North Korea, on the other hand, continues to be a monarchy run by a single family. Overall, it always surprises me how many Westerners will say something like this, and then proceed to ignore what actual people from North Korea are telling them.

,"Cool.  Good work.  ee I am from ""boomer gen"". We lived most of our early years with the terror of nuke war always in the back of our minds. Now, Li'l Kimmie 'n NK got nukes and delivery systems, this brings back the nuke terror, gives ""K-pop"", a new meaning.  It is becoming increasingly imperative to take out Kim, and / or his capacity to cause disaster, as every month passes. How can we stop nuclear madness. For that matter, we know just using conventional arms, Seoul can be reduced to a pile of unrecognizable rubble in a few hours.  Any war would be horrible. I've watched videos on various aspects of N. K.  for maybe five or ten years.  But I have been sensiive to Korean matters all my life.  My dad was called up for the Korean conflict.    This video gave me the insight that one or maybe both guests  interviewed really believes that westerners  don't understand N. Korean people, especially younger ones.  Could be.  It also intensified my belief that N. Koreans remain  deeply ignorant,  either mis or un- informed regarding basically total reality outside N. Korea, and left me thinking that the more they learn, the more  “defection prone” the become.  If ""defection prone"" is too specific,maybe I mean N Koreans  would be  far less inclined to automatically default to   the N Korean govt version of reality as most likely the truest version.   I'm wondering to what extent an increased, but still manageably slow, constant , steady stream of component sized, reliably available information coming in to NK might enhance  resistance against the regime by the people.  To what extent might it decrease the likelihood NK govt initiated catastrophic violence.  To what extent could it serve US foreign policy objectives by really truly being designed to further every day life for N. Koreans.  Can design of info delivery and  consumption  be tweaked by reference to new, previously unavailable technologies,with content that is true, balanced, uncensored (contains critiques of non NK nations, expecially critical of US  policies and actions, where deserved, and are both reliably  delivered and  low risk of lethality/ punishment to the  consumers and their families  Might be  such a continuous paced reality delivery effort add to the chances  of a secure non violent future, without necessarily specifying the form such security would take, e.g., not specifying it requires “regime change”, although also not being naive on that.

The high ranking bureaucrats enjoyed the benefits of political inequality from their ends and kept it that way ( this is what hayek referred to as fascism).  Communism is as marx would put it the ""Dictatorship of the proletariat"", where the 'working class' rule, 'collective ownership triumph over private property and finally a 'utopia' where everyone can act hand in hand  ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need"".  Sounds nice, fluffy and cuddly yet seldom those who advocate for such a framework will define the ""abilities and needs"" let alone address the elimination of competition and profit incentive (which necessitates innovation and protection for all parties in voluntary transactions), Hayek's knowledge problem ( i.e no matter how intelligent or abundant the bureaucrats are, it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to match the knowledge of millions who constantly engage in voluntary transactions within different fields of disciplines as formulated by the free market),  'collective ownership' and of course scarcity (as it will ALWAYS be both cheaper and more efficiently  represented by the price mechanism determined by supply and demand which immediately conveys information to both buyers and sellers aiding in prohibitive decision making and allocating scarce resources more efficiently .)   Self interested bureaucrats cannot match the consistency and accuracy in conveying information and has almost always lead to either artificial shortages or  surpluses. ( the imposition of price floors in agriculture 1932 in the great depression, aimed to restore 'parity' between the farmers implanted through supply regulation and buying the excess supply. And ofc the rate of poverty increased until WW2 and the proceeding economic boom.)

Holland: 1.8 (16.5 million, of which 4.4% are foreigners). Belgium: 1.8 (10.8 million, of which 9.8% are foreigners). Spain: 1.4 (46.1 million, of which 12.4% are foreigners). Italy: 1.4 (60.2 million, of which 7.1% are foreigners), Sweden, which provides deep support for parents, has a high TFR of 1.9 (9.4 million, of which 6.4% are foreigners), but that’s still below the replacement rate. Ireland and the U.K. also have high TFRs, at 2.1 and 1.9, respectively, but these rates are derived from non-European immigrant parents.  In just  2-3 generations, Muslims will outnumber native Europeans.  You're women aren't interested in having babies.  They want careers, BMW's, vacations, and sexual freedom.  I'm not blaming just the women, the men are on board with the easy sex, low commitment, and limited fatherhood also. It's not rocket science.  If one family has 6 children and the other family has 1 child, in two generations the first family will have 36 grandchildren and the other family will have  1 grandchild.

You also ignore the fact that those countries that failed/are failing are all dictatorships. You blindly saying countries like Sweden are ""capitalists first, and socialists second"" is highly arbitrary and well, wrong. Their economies are almost textbook socialism, with high median wages, extremely strong unions, solid government programs, the works.

@ignisilluminati,"Umm.. Well, you're absolutely right about why Kim's regime lasts till today, but what I want to say is simply that it isn't right. Yes, US will not protect its Asian allies if it is not beneficial for itself and it applies to any other major power in the world. It is also true that NK is exploiting delicacy among major powers to avoid the pressure from the international society. But is it RIGHT? I mean, NK people are still starving and oppressed while both Koreans are suffering from what they are not responsible for. It is how politics work, but saying so doesn't make any excuse over it. If you're saying that strong countries can do anything to weak countries just to guarantee their own interests, why do we blame imperialism, slavery, militarism or fascism? Why does China blame the west for the colonization of some cities in the late 19th~early 20th century or blame Japan for the war or the Nanjing massacre? They were the politics of that time, weren't they? It's like ""I mustn't be a victim but I can hurt others if it is beneficial for us"" and as we know in our real life these kinds of people sucks.  And even in terms of 'real' politics, I don't believe that China's support over Kim's regime is agreed by the US. US simply doesn't want to touch it because 1) it doesn't want to risk their relationship with China, 2) its regional allies also don't want any military action because of its regional instability and 3) it doesn't have enough reasons to justify the invasion like what was in 9.11. Yet, if NK do some stupid thing or finally got a plausible nuclear weapon, I bet that US will make an action - especially as US is currently led by Trump :-(  BTW what do you mean by 'not thinking like an Asian'?

I think it was WW1 (may have been WW2 though), the british soldiers recovered from the trauma of the war faster than most of the others because of their ability to make use of gallows humor.

I had a sociopath (Diagnosed officially) for a father and lived through a bunch of abusive crap as a kid (my older brother had it worse) but for some reason after that ended and even now I still find myself laughing at stuff I don't find funny. Like I'll feel sad about something and start laughing or whatever. It might just be a result of abuse, I'm not totally sure honestly.  I don't entirely remember but I have read about certain neurological conditions that can result in the wiring around things like... the more emotional parts of the brain essentially being messed up or mis-wired so to speak. I don't know if that's the reason why but regardless it's weird.  Regardless, I feel reminded of why I should be grateful my childhood was as good as it was. I used to think that having had such a close up look at evil was incredibly useful in knowing how people like my father behave, and I was definitely grateful for that. Now I just feel grateful that I was never in danger of starving to death, that I had luxuries that kids in some places would kill for (like air conditioning and 24 hour electricity). This video, weirdly enough, caused me to feel both horrified and tremendously grateful for the fact that my life is as good as it has been. I mean I already felt grateful for my life (been pretty damn great after I got away from my father) but I used to think I'd probably rather die than have to do everything all over a second or third time, but I think I just might rather live through it all 4 or 5 times than living through North Korea even once.

@sabin97,"+werr kowalski ""I think US army is actually not that bad"" that's sad. i encourage you to study all the atrocities usa has committed. even before spain, france, netherlands and india handed them their independence. the trail of tears. reservations. stealing huge amounts of land from mexico. installing brutal dictators all over america and other parts of the world. look at the atrocities in vietnam, including agent orange, napalm, mine fields(some children are still losing limbs because they step on hidden mines). look at the carpet bombing(intentionally bombing cities to try to kill as many civilians as possible) in japan, and of course the two biggest terrorist attacks in history, hiroshima and nagasaki. and look at how they rape pillage and murder now in the middle east. even using drones to butcher civilians and then call it ""collateral damage"", because apparently brown people arent human and they dont want to call them victims.  ""The Japan example is just retarded"" no, it isnt. it's on point. intentionally butchering as many civilians as possible is an atrocity.  ""anyone who knows anything about the atrocities Japanese soldiers committed wouldn't use it"" i find it odd that you can see the atrocities of one side(yes, the japanese commited many horrible atrocities as well, and i condemn their atrocities as well) but not on the other. two wrongs dont make a right. two wrongs are just two wrongs and BOTH need to be condemned.  ""Seems like sabin97 doesn't."" i do. i just use a consistent standard for denouncing atrocities, which applies to EVERYONE, not just the people i dont like. having double standards is a bad thing.  ""uking Japan was the best solution possible"" no. it wasnt. it was just ""revenge"" for pearl harbor(which isnt even fair revenge, as pearl harbor was a military base, the civilians who died were extremely few, the overwhelming majority of victims were expendable soldiers)  if japan didnt surrender after the carpet bombing(bombing entire cities with the explicit intention of butchering as many civilians as possible), they certainly wouldnt surrender after the nukes. and they didnt. they surrendered after russia defeated their last standing army.  there was zero need for carpet bombing or dropping nukes. those were two decisions made entirely out of spite. after the battle of midway japan was already defeated, not a threat to anyone. all they had was their last standing army, which the russians demolished easily. the invasion of japan was completely unnecessary.  ""I don't think you can blame any soldiers for the atrocities they committed"" i can. and i do.  ""its the commanders who are to blame"" they are also to blame. the whole chain of command. from the usa president to the soldiers who committed the atrocities. not a single one of them with a shred of humanity.  it's sad to see people defend atrocities.",8년 전,5,
@sabin97,"+werr kowalski  ""80% of your comment is responding in a ""no it isn't way""."" yeah, if you reduce the conversation to denying history that's the sort of responses you get.   ""You don't use a consistent standard"" i do. i denounce atrocities, no matter who commits them.  ""if you would mention the Japanese atrocities"" if you had said ""i dont think the japanese solders are so bad"", you would have gotten that, but you didnt.   ""you simply ignored the atrocities Japanese committed"" how can i ignore the atrocities of a party that NOBODY is defending? you want me to denounce the atrocities of japanese soldiers? try to defend them, and see what happens.  ""You talk about intentionally butchering civilians"" yes, that's what carpet bombing is. look it up. educate yourself in history.  ""most of the american strikes on Japan"" america didnt strike japan. it was only usa. the rest of america had nothing to do with it.  ""were targeted at destroying military infrastructure and  production, crippling the Japan economy"" i strongly encourage you to look up the amount of japanese cities that were carpet bombed(carpet bombing is intentionally butchering as many civilians as possible)  ""collateral damage"" that's a cute pc term to say butchered civilians. and they didnt die because of some mistake, they were killed INTENTIONALLY. so please dont use pc bullshit. we all hate it.  ""USA wanted to end the war as fast as possible."" are you sure? russia ended the war as soon as they defeated japans last standing army. it seems like usa wanted to invade japan and butcher as many civilians as possible. it seems the intention of usa wasnt to end the war but to destroy japan. defeating all of the armies of a country is the fastest way to neutralize them militarily, and thus encourage them to surrender. butchering civilians isnt. specially when you have already been butchering civilians(instead of defeating their last standing army) and they havent surrendered. the leaders of usa were evil, not retarded.  ""I will not judge that here."" of course you wont. it goes against your ""usa good, everyone else evil"" narrative.   ""And you say that nuking was just a revenge, firstly it is what you think"" of course it is what i think. i have no psychic powers or time-traveling powers. i cannot go back in time and get in the minds of the people involved to know exactly what they were thinking. however i can deduce that the intent was revenge. the people of usa are a very warlike and vengeful people. and they seem to approve of atrocities, if they are committed by their own soldiers. there was ZERO strategic value in nuking civilians.   ""and end war as fast as possible"" if they wanted to end the war as fast as possible they would have defeated japans last standign army. you know, what russia did that ended the war.  ""invading Japan"" was completely unnecessary. after the battle of midway their navy and airforce were completely crippled. all japan had left was one standing army. that was their one hope in the war. but instead of defeating that one standing army and ending the war, usa chose to intentionally butcher civilians.  ""The few thousand killed in it was nothing."" the ""few thousand"" that died at the moment were orders of magnitude more than those who died in 911. so yes. hiroshima and nagasaki were the biggest terrorist acts in modern history. also after 911 very few people died, there was no radiation. in japan the horrors of those attacks were felt for decades. are you from usa? the way you are defending them suggests some sort of emotional investment that could cloud reason.   ""About the soldiers, I can't understand how anybody can blame the  soldiers while they have no freedom of choice."" you always have freedom of choice.

""You mentioned the supposed atrocities committed by the US army during  WWII yet you omitted the atrocities committed by Japanese Soldiers whom  they were fighting why you keep denying that?"" did you even read my previous post? i already addressed this, let me copy-paste it for your benefit, please read it this time: how can i ignore the atrocities of a party that NOBODY is defending? you want me to denounce the atrocities of japanese soldiers? try to defend them, and see what happens.  ""the atrocities Japanese committed on US soldiers are a justification for some of the US atrocities"" bullshit! atrocities have no justification. two wrongs dont make a right.  your burglar example is ridiculous. defending your home is the exact opposite of invading a country. if you want a more direct analogy. imagine your neighbor slaps your dog through the fence. so you sneak into his house at night and stab his child. was the child stabbing justified? no.  ""Your definition is wrong, educate yourself in english."" by your very own definition, the purpose of carpet bombing cities is to butcher as many civilians as possible. it's a terrorist tactic used by the side with the technological advantage. germany did it. and usa did it.  ""Prove me wrong, prove that US attacks were not aimed at destroying the  infrastructure but rather aking to terror bombing employed by luftwaffe."" it was EXACTLY the same shit germany did. butchering civilians left and right to try to get the other to surrender. it's sad that some people are so partialize as to have two different standards for atrocities. in ww2 there were no ""good"" guys.  ""It is impossible to avoid collateral damage by bombing, however the only  way for Japan to avoid the civilian casualties was to surrender and end  the way. Did they do it?"" wow. that's exactly what a schoolyard bully would say ""hey, if he just gave me his lunch money i wouldnt have broken his nose. so it was really his fault."" and why keep using the pc bullshit term ""collateral damage"" instead of what it really is, butchered civilians(yes, civilians have no chance against a professional modern army, so it's not even a fight, it's butchering).  ""Japanese last standing army? What do you mean?"" i'm a bit confused by the question. what else could ""last standing army"" mean other than the literal meaning?  ""And why would that make Japan surrender?"" because when a side has no more standing armies to fight. it literally cannot fight. and this was conclusively demonstrated when russia defeated japans last standing army and ended the war.  ""How about forcing a surrender and avoiding casualties?"" it didnt avoid casualties, and it didnt force a surrender. what avoided casualties and forced a surrender was russia defeating the last standing army. how the fuck is butchering huge amounts of civilians ""avoiding casualties""???!!!  ""How about scaring Soviet union and most likely preventing Stalin from attacking the allies and taking over the whole Europe?"" the germans already did that. russia was fucked up in the aftermath of ww2. they got lucky the germans were still attacking them in winter. nobody successfully invades russia in winter.  ""However the atomic bombs scared them."" russia has enough nukes to wipe usa out of the map. the difference is that russia has never butchered civilians by using nukes. there was no need. they intimidated usa into not attacking them by merely posessing them. so yeah, it was completely unnecessary to butcher those civilians and leave that radioactive terror for decades.  ""What you said about the battle of Midway is complete bs"" i strongly encourage you to read more, and watch less tv.  ""the Pear Harbor attack was a temporary measure"" actually the peral harbor preemptive strike was the worst kind of failure, one that looks and feels like a success. japan failed to take into account that the two largest aircraft carriers of the usa armada were in california for maintenance, and they also didnt target the huge fuel depots that were nearby. so the damage they inflicted looked like a lot but it really wasnt. and usa then got all the technology that uk gave them after the usa president made churchill bend over and let his nation economically raped. the japanese fleet was reduced to basically nothing. there was nothing the japanese navy could do after the battle of midway.

@werrkowalski2985,"I think US army is actually not that bad, like mentioned before in Vietnam US soldiers vere forced to follow some very questionable orders.

It was a war they could never win, the whole idea of search and destroy couldn't work, it violates the centuries old rules of vaging a war.  Given all that its only natural US soldiers committed some atrocities on Vietnamese, and still, it wasn't as bad as the atrocities some other armies committed.  The Japan example is just retarded, anyone who knows anything about the atrocities Japanese soldiers committed wouldn't use it. Seems like sabin97 doesn't. Also nuking Japan was the best solution possible, it was way better to use the scare factor of nukes to force Japan to surrender (and incidentally to show off before the Soviet Union) than to engage into a long, one sided attrition warfare where most of the Japan cities would be bombed and millions killed.

And you say that nuking was just a revenge, firstly it is what you think it was, not a fact, its your conjecture, the fact is that USA wanted to show off before Soviet union and end war as fast as possible, secondly invading Japan would involve much more bloodshed than using the weapon of mass destruction.

@werrkowalski2985,"sabin97 You are the one denying history here.  You mentioned the supposed atrocities committed by the US army during WWII yet you omitted the atrocities committed by Japanese Soldiers whom they were fighting why you keep denying that? Don't you remember what you wrote? The USA atrocities were minor compared to the Japanese atrocities, what don't you get here? Also the atrocities Japanese committed on US soldiers are a justification for some of the US atrocities (eg the killings of ""surrendering"" japanese on sight in some cases), of course you can't justify all atrocities, however if eg the Japanese mine their own soldiers and then send them to pretend to surrender so that they can blow themselves up as soon as US soldiers try to capture them - it is a justification.  I will give you a simple example, a burglar breaks into your house, he attacks you with a knife and deals many wounds, eventually you end up crippled and lying on the bed for the rest of your life. However during the fight you hit the burglar in the face, now do you think you should be punished for that? After all it is an assault, right? During normal circumstances hitting people in the face is bad, right? Now, do you think you should be denounced for that act? And moreover, should you be denounced AND the fact that you were severely wounded omitted? I don't think so. It is a decent comparison to Japanese vs US atrocities, facts prove that.  How can you ignore these atrocities? lol you don't need somebody defending them to ignore them, however you mentioned the US atrocities on Japanese and ignored the Japanese atrocities on US, you just see one side of the coin.  arpet-bomb [kahr-pit-bom]  verb (used with object) 1. to systematically bomb (a large target area) so as to completely destroy it.  Your definition is wrong, educate yourself in english.   I have counted and I got 14, what does it prove? nothing. hwat does the count of bombed cities has to the validity of my statement? Prove me wrong, prove that US attacks were not aimed at destroying the infrastructure but rather aking to terror bombing employed by luftwaffe.  It is impossible to avoid collateral damage by bombing, however the only way for Japan to avoid the civilian casualties was to surrender and end the way. Did they do it? No, first they let some 300 thousands of their civilians die. The collateral damage was not intentional, btw it is an actual term, sad you don't like that word.  Soviets pushed Japan from Manchuria, if US gave them enough time they would probably even try to invade Japan. The Japanese-Soviet war ended with Japan's unconditional surrender to USA, what you said is not true. You seem very biased against USA, and you just keep repeating the same bs over and over. Just ignoting the historical facts.  Japanese last standing army? What do you mean? And why would that make Japan surrender? Japan was pushed out of China and it still did not surrender.  From Wikipedia: ""The Japanese, facing the same fate, refused to accept the Allies' demands for unconditional surrender and the Pacific War continued. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945—the alternative being ""prompt and utter destruction"". The Japanese response to this ultimatum was to ignore it""  No strategic value you say? How about forcing a surrender and avoiding casualties? How about scaring Soviet union and most likely preventing Stalin from attacking the allies and taking over the whole Europe? It was a very realistic scenario, the soviet forces vastly outnumbered allied forces. However the atomic bombs scared them. The possibility of Soviet invasion was very real, McArthur even proposed nuking Soviet Union ASAP before it gets atomic bombs to prevent that.  What you said about the battle of Midway is complete bs, Japan still had a large navy, probably about the size of US operational navy at the time, I don't know the exact numbers though. The US ability to produce new ships was too great however and Japan stood no chance, also the Pear Harbor attack was a temporary measure, most of the damaged or sank ships there later got lifted and I am pretty sure they saw some action later in the war.  What do you mean's Japan's one standing army? Japan had a few armies in China and a few Armies defending the Japan islands, what are you talking about?  I have watched Nuremberg trials, and there actually it was an excuse and some of the convicted got lesser sentences because of that. And only the high ranking officers were being judged there, if what you said was the case then why the low ranking officers weren't being sentenced?  Also you are retarded if you truly think soldiers have freedom of choice, man you are so deluded, I bet you will respond to me repeating the same shit you just said just changing the form a little.",8년 전,0,

If given the will, North Koreans could even fight for their own freedom, assuming they have the sense to take the weaponry from the existing military.  The issue with ISIS is that they exist in such desolate regions, where they are able to adequately exploit oil reserves to strengthen their resources and defenses.

@ignisilluminati,"Margaret Miao It's true for not only China, but also Korea and Japan in ancient times (For example, search for 大明律, a law book of the Ming empire). The king (or emperor or whatever the ruler's name is) usually did not want to let someone who can revenge for his family's execution. It's also related to the Confucian ideas, which basically sees each individual as a representative feature of his/her family. In extreme case, if you're executed, your father's paternal & maternal, your mother's paternal & maternal, your wife's paternal & maternal family members (so-called 9族) are all executed. So you can easily see in the history that ~300 people per each participant's guilt were executed whenever a rebellion was cracked down, But of course it is not applied to every crimes - it's usually applied to anti-regime or anti-monarch crimes.",8년 전,1,

None of her laughter sounded like she was laughing because she was happy about it or fond of the time. There's such a thing as laughing to reduce the impact of unpleasant things.  They are happy with each other. That they have family and that they still love, not happy that they were still starving. And, as they said--people were dying of starvation, and there wasn't enough food in North Korea. Staying meant likely death.  She still has some living family--she's been in contact with her sisters. Remember, they said that the killing of the whole family rather than just the escapee began with Kim Jong-un; they both left during the rule of Kim Jong-il.  As they pointed out, it was effectively capitalism under the veil of communism. They still had money, just a shitty small amount of it; if you're leaving, you can afford to blow everything you have left for a bribe, or you could sell all the possessions you can't carry with you.  As for the military--that's where paranoia comes into play. North Korea's a fascist police state where you can be reported on by anybody. There are rewards for turning in defectors, and for a member of the military to abandon post to run away would be a significantly worse crime than just any old civilian trying to escape. If they tried to escape themselves, another soldier there might shoot them. If they tried to talk about it first or convince others to escape with them, they might be snitched on (arguably worse than just getting killed running away). If they try to have mercy on someone escaping and not shoot, they could be reported on for sympathizing with traitors.  How North Koreans escape and the travesties they have to go through (which can last a while after escape--there are a few human trafficking groups that trick North Koreans into ""escaping"" with them)  has been pretty well documented--a few ex-North Koreans have even written books about it, like Park Yeon-mi.

Succes: What would this mean for the north korean people. This people have no experience with democracy at all. It is most likely to fail in the aftermath through oppressive forces from the modern western world, or a simply by a vacuum of power. Similar as it did in other countries before. For example Afganistan, Syria or others....  2. Failure: The oppressive government of North Korea could use the interference of other countries for their own propaganda wich eventually would just lead into several years or decades of continuing in the already existing system with even more hate for the western world.    Eventhough the people scream for freedom the north korean government mastered the art of manipulating people even in the worst situations. For example the great starvation wave in the 90s should've already been enough for the system to collapse, but somehow it did not.    Hopefully the urge for freedom gets big enough for the people to finaly stand up and do it on their own.

@DarkbloomTV,"Depends on how you define ""significant"". North Korean accent is a little bit different than your usual Seoul accent and they have different words for a lot of stuff, like Hangul (the Korean alphabet) is called ""Chosongul"" in North Korea, friend is ""chingu"" in South while it's tongmu in North. Also South Korea has borrowed a lot of English words, but North Korea has borrowed a number of Russian and Eastern European words. So there are a lot of differences when it comes to technology related words and even country names (like Poland in North is ""Polsuka"" and it's actually borrowed from Polish while it's just ""Polandu"" in South, obviously borrowed from English).

@guhalaa,"the mechanism of korean (hangeul) is way different from that of alphabet.  To make a readable letter, it requires 1 consonant in front, 1 vowel following it and sometimes 1 another consonant following former 2.  so in this case, 'pol' alone formed a letter already and 's' can not form a letter since it is followed by another consonant. So they just add 'u' after 's' to make it sound as similar as the original pronunciation.",8년 전(수정됨),61,
@leoniesa4020,"It has indeed. Since North Korea and South Korea separated, the north has hardly experienced any development. While the south was also allied with the United States, this influenced their vocabulary and brought a lot of english words/terminology into their language. North Korea however, still uses words and phrases that are straight out of the 1960's. The influence of english on the (south) korean language has proved to be a difficult adjustment for many north korean defectors that come to the south. What's more, the education/studies north koreans did in their own country are not seen as eligible in south korea, for example in the medicinal field. While South Korea is the world's 11th largest economy the north is decades behind. This also means that their medicinal and scientific research has very much fallen back. If a defector that was say a doctor/nurse in the north wishes to continue practicing medicine professionally in the south, they must redo all of their studies in order to update them to south korean standards... this includes learning all the new english terminology that is used in south korean medicine nowadays.

@teddie1018,"I grew up in South Korea roughly for the first half of my life. There had already been regional dialects across different parts of Korea before the split, and people could mostly understand each other despite differences in the intonation and usage of words (perhaps with an exception of the Jeju island dialect which is extraordinarily different from the rest of the dialects).    After the division of the country, both the North and the South declared Pyongyang and Seoul dialects as their own ""standard"" languages, respectively.  As others have noted, each has diverged somewhat with North Korean heavily influenced by Russian and Chinese and South Korean by American English.  However, I noticed  North Korea seemed to put emphasis on preserving their own culture and language more than the South (perhaps because of the Internet, South Korean changes more rapidly).    Note that the defectors in the above video have lived in South Korea for a long time and as far as I can tell their Korean is very close to the standard South Korean.  When I watch videos of people in North Korea, I can understand about 98% of it.  So I believe while there are differences in the languages, they are not that great.",8년 전,14,

Hence why I ask you to go to the North and experience, what you'd consider to be a wonderful world, for yourself. Your pretty thick huh?   And it would be Obama's fault/Congress's fault for failing to provide adequate food, like in the 1930's dustbowl and depression (mind you, they did fix that). Yet, they didn't murder people for listening to music or stealing some 'state owned' pick-axe at the Hoover Dam! If you like anarchy, you'll hate the North, frankly, I fail to see how you could ever consider total authoritarian state control 'anarchy' - their problem is an abundance of govt, not a limitation.   Anarchy is more Somalia. Think Mad Max. There is no true state of anarchy anyway, total absence of govt is impossible and undesirable, who else will protect you from thieves, murderers, gangs, sex trafficking for your wife/daughter, even fires and help you when your sick. Who's going to make sure your employer pays you, doesn't make your workplace dangerous, who makes your cars and pharmaceuticals safe for consumption, makes your water clean and food free of contaminates, allows your kids to get an education and you to get a degree, permits you to retire with an inbuilt safety net (like the pension) to guarantee you don't become old and poor. The govt provides all of this, through our tax dollars. That's the beauty of it - we have some degree of control, our vote. In an anarchistic society, you'd have gangs in control of certain areas, bloody feuds between leaders and we'd all have to pay for 'protection'. We're no more than cannon fodder.",8년 전,1,
@skullsaintdead,"Juri Vlk Of course the ex-American's were treated well in the North, it aids their propaganda. And yes, America and it's allies kill many people indiscriminately in war, including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Vietnam, drone strikes in Yemen, Somalia, to name but a few. But they do not sanction mass state murder of their population simply as a means to quell dissent. The difference is great between the North and America, it's disturbing you cannot see it.   Also Jewish depiction? Oh dear, so you're an anti-Semite as well? I do wonder what has happened to you to make you so bitter and indoctrinated with these beliefs, it's sad tbh.    During evolution there was nothing but anarchy? Do you not realise how foolish you sound? There was natural law, which has evolved into common law and statute, including application of the Golden Rule 'treat others as you'd like to be treated'. So, if some tribe member beds your wife, he'd be punished, if someone is killed, they'd face a rudimentary court, to determine if their actions were self-defense or murder. And think, who'd gather to hear his trial, who'd hear the evidence - the townspeople and their leader, often a 'council' would determine a criminals fate, that is the beginning of the judiciary and rudimentary government.   'The Aboriginals lived in anarchy'. What a disgusting thing to say. They lived in peace, rarely did they even realise other tribes existed, and hardly ever did they fight. They are a peaceful, caring and oppressed group of people, and for you to make such a sweeping, incorrect generalisation about them, well, frankly, it doesn't surprise me.   Also, 'I' did not kill the Aboriginals, my ancestors did in some numbers but treated them appallingly in other ways (sure, not people in my family, still).

@skullsaintdead,"Juri Vlk No, no you're right about mass imprisonment in the US, it's a fucking disgrace. In 2012, almost 1% of the pop was in jail. The US constitutes just 5% of the world's pop, yet they make up 25% of the prison pop.   They imprison more people per head of population (at 707 per 100,000 people), than China and Iran combined (124-172 and 284 respectively), and are equal to or greater than it's nearest competitor, North Korea, at approx 600-800 (the figures vary though).    But Feanor is right, everyone is the North is imprisoned (denied: freedom of movement, freedom of press, freedom of information, free internet, freedom of association, free thought, free and fair elections, impartial judiciary, the freedom to simply live) and they could be murdered by the state at any second, without recourse, either through starvation, poor or non-existent healthcare, contaminated food and water, pollution, hazardous working and living conditions, freezing to death from insufficient electricity, firewood and shelter, worked to death in a slave labor camp or executed by the state... The list of atrocities is too long to mention.   The American mass-incarceration problem stems from the 1960's, when elected law-makers reacted to an increase in drug-use with harsh sentencing laws, choosing to ignore the evidence that showed tougher sentences lead to worsening recidivism, poverty, drug and alcohol use and metal health problems.   Now, because of the corrupting influence of money in politics, too many US politicians have been legally bribed by corporations (including the security contractors who make money off for-profit jails and the pharmaceutical companies that loose money from illicit, home-grown or out-of-patent drugs, like weed) and they continue to toughen laws around prohibition, crime and sentencing to 'pay-back' their corporate donors.   You've gotta get all this corporate money out of the political system in the US, every issue is held back because of it.

@user-xw1yh2py4j,"Juri Vlk Because Capitalism describes the free market, where people are given the right to keep their individual earnings.  Something which is by nature free is not burdened by an oppressive governance.  The closest example which has ever proven evident was fascism.  However, even within these systems, the economies were able to grow.   Yes, the North Korean regime has murdered many.  During the war, and thereafter.  They have killed America soldiers, dissidents, and even citizens from within.    You are relying upon the correlation/causational fallacy.  The fundamental reason that communism is wrong is for a simple reason:  It utilizes the initiation of violent force against peaceful people to prevent voluntary contracts (wage-labor) and it additionally utilizes violent force against economic ""inequalities"".  The system in itself implies entails violence.  The very same goes for socialism, where violent force (or coercion) is utilized against contractors.  Famine is a mere correlation which people attempt to use in favor of ideologies such as communism and socialism.  Did it never occur to you that this correlation may be the result of poorer nations attempting to model themselves off of the economies of successful nations, but they have merely yet to utilize their own resources effectively?",8년 전,0,

It is normal that Korea killed some US soldiers if those killed 3 millions of Koreans! By the way, you should watch the documentory of the 4 US soldiers that fled to NK in 1962 and 1964. They weren't shot but even well treated by NK! Your problem is that you don't know the history of NK at all and so you don't understand anything. NK was occupied from 1910 to 1945 by the japanese which were worse and more fanatic than the nazis. In fact whole Korea was occupied. Then, in august 1945 , the glorious Red Army freed great parts of China, Mongolia and Korea with its enormous forces of 80 divisions, 1.8 million men and thousands and thousands of tanks within 6 weeks. The Sowjetunion was asked at the conference in Potsdam in may 1945 by Truman and Britain to declare war to Japan and agreed. In six weeks only, the Sowjetunion had won the war for the allies in far east. Then, they decided to divise Korea along the 38th grade, although the Sowjetunion had already reached down to Seoul. Later, the useless US started attacking the north, using Napalm among others, and violated the agreements.

@jurivlk5433,"Skulls Ain't Dead You are following the same path your government teaches. While it is a brutality to imprison  innocent people in NK, the same thing is normal to you in the US and you search even for reasons to justify it. When a number of persons have died of starvation twenty years ago in NK it is the fault of the government. When tens of thousands of people are murdered every year in the US it is an individual problem. But don't forget, NK has at least a social health system which the US has not. In the US tens of thousands of persons have no home at all, are homeless, live in cars or shacks like animals. This problem does not exist in NK. Much more people die of malnutrition in the US than in NK. In the US. people eat shit and that is also malnutrition. Weighting 400 KGS is worse than weighting 60 KGS. 40% of the US population is overweighted and that is also a problem of the government. The millions of deaths from drugs in the US are also an issue of the government. The absence of a public health care also.  NK is not a paradise but is far better off than many other countries. Look at how people live in Bangladesh! Or in Ethiopia. Or in Haiti, in Somalia, Mauritania, West Sahara, Uganda, Nigeria, Botswana, Yemen, Palestine....! And what kind of freedom an US citizen has if he can choose between two idiots for president? What is his freedom worth if even his basic needs and rights are not covered. The standard US citizen has no protection from being fired in his job or dying from middle age diseases. People must work up to 90 because they have no retirement insurances.

Every language on the planet can be represented with that alphabet.  (Not the writing system for Arabic. The ""ABC's"" is the arabic alphabet for anyone who reads this and gets confused. It is not the latin alphabet as many people have decided to tell me. Latin uses completely different characters and is incapable of representing every word on the planet...which is why Christians have completely different names for key members in their bible than what their real names would have been in Ancient Israel. The modern alphabet that Western Europe, America and Turkey uses is called the arabic alphabet and was invented in Moorish occupied Spain by an inventor who was on house arrest on multiple occasions for not converting to Islam).",8년 전,0,
@Disgruntled_Old_Man,"jh Choe The Arabic Alphabet is not for Arabic. The ""ABC's"" that Western Europe uses today was invented in a part of Spain that was conquered by the African Moors. Therefore we call it the Arabic Alphabet. It is the Alphabet used in several Western European countries, Turkey, North America and South America. It has drastically reduced the amount of illiteracy throughout the Western World and is still the most practical alphabet I have ever seen.      While in Korea I never had the chance to learn Hangul but the little bit I did find out about it reminded me of Japanese Katakana. I have studied Japanese Hiragana, Katagana and a little Kanji and I find all three to be impractical once you start trying to spell words from a foreign language (which is why hiragana and katakana exist and they still don't accurately reflect the sounds of foreign words). The greek alphabet has the same problem and it has caused Christianity problems because the names of their religious figures could not be represented in Latin or Greek and now the true names of these biblical figures have been forgotten and replaced with Latin names. Atheist use this fact against Christians becuase the Atheists view it as ignorant that a bunch of people give thanks to other people who's name they don't even know. With the Arabic Alphabet we could have spelled these biblical figures' names and represented the correct pronunciation of those ancient semitic names).",8년 전,0,
@Disgruntled_Old_Man,jh Choe When I retire from work I will study Hangul. I have to leave Japan and move to Germany soon so I have to learn a new language so I can survive out there.

When I was there last time I was in the Marine Corps so I didn't get to see much of Korea. I especially love History and I didn't have time to go to any museums while I was there.

The damn Nazis were even known as the Nationalist Socialist party before Hitler had the socialists in the party murdered when they realized he only cared about the nationalist aspect.  The difference between Nationalist and nationalism is as different as the one between a Democracy and democracy. One is a governmental system and the other is a trait of a society.  I shouldn't be surprised though, you seem like the kind of person that comes from the same camp that thinks there isn't a difference between liberal, socialist, communist, and pretty much anything left of theocratic fascism.",8년 전,0,
@kwazooplayingguardsman5615,"first of all, I don't appreciate your assumptions about my character, that's a sign that you're grasping at straws as a way to discredit your opponent,  secondly, I don't even know who this kruger person is. thirdly, almost all governments are nationalistic, Nationalism isn't a structure of government or economy, its how people act in relation to the public interest of the nation. When you have a government that is keen on the interest of the nation, then you have a nationalist government and that can happen in all forms of governments and your second point could be attributed to any kind of differential dichotomy between the people and its government and it will always result in a form of dictatorship. a difference between government and its people will always paint a picture of dictatorship, nationalists or not.  Yes, north korea, nazi germany, and the ussr, are nationalist governments, but so is the U.S.A, south korea, U.K, Chile, Singapore, Indonesia, Norway, heck any nation that strives to do what they deemed would be best for their nation is applicable for the label of nationalism.   OH MY GOD, you are an idiot, there's is no governmental system called nationalism, tell me, what's different about it compared to other government system? do they abscond their legislative wing? do they have a slight merger between the executive and the legislative power like in parliamentary democracies? or do they have complete separation of powers like in republics? there is no nationalists form of government, its just a trait in society which can take the form of almost all kinds of movements, to the american revolution, which birthed the great nation of the United States Of America, to the cultural revolution, which killed almost 87 million Chinese and completely ruined thousands of years of traditions and culture.   And lols, aren't you doubly guilty of doing the same thing? you just pretty much reduced the whole scope of right-wing ideology to theocratic fascism and even worse made a glaring strawman about me arguing for it.  First of all fascism is left-wing in origin, their whole ideology rests upon collectivism, something all left-wing ideologies share.  second of all, your liberalism is different from classical liberalism which centers around individualism. and lastly, the only working difference between socialists and communists governments is that in a socialists one, one seeks for the state to own the means of production, while in a communists one, one seeks the community to own the means of production, but since its entirely impossible to voluntarily distribute all private property to the whole population, then often it also rest upon the state to commit these transfers.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

Always with the wars, the imbalance of power, the blind pride for the country you happen to be born in. Always we think that where WE live is the best place and the rest is whatever.. ""Make America great again."" And what about the rest of the world? Why do we feel like we have to elevate ourselves above the rest of the world. To be the greatest? Because that is the mentality of a bully. To be the best, you must make sure the rest is worse off than you. Or to ignore it completely. We cannot stand together as a group of nations to overthrow this horrendous place because we are constantly at odds with one another. We can never truly unite or get what we want when we say world peace, or freedom, when we ignore the rest of ourselves when we are ALL human beings and ALL worth just as much as one another. THIS is the result of having separate nations, and more, including racism and other endless forms of ignorance and suffering at the hands of EACHOTHER.  Of course I speak of this as if its just nations against one another but within nations, we more subcatergories of separation between race, wealth, gender, sexual preference.. and within those groups even more. Always. Always at war with eachother and ourselves. We are not taking thew right measures in order to step even close into the right direction to end all the shit that makes this world a terrible place.",8년 전,0,

These two things can cause a divide among society.

There will always be humans taking advantage of others and since those who don't usually are the 'weaker' ones when it comes to arguments thus to get into power communism will not work unless we humans change for the better as a whole race. But in that case it doesn't matter what system you run as if we really change so much that communism works there won't be people suffering no matter which system or ideology we run. And since even the slightest imperfection in a communist system will turn it into not functioning correct it will always come with the risk to break down to a point where the majority will suffer. In capitalism, as imperfect as it is, these situations are dampened by the ones in power as they'd actually lose a lot themself and so while capitalism isn't actually working the ones in power always find ways to postpone the complete breakdown.",8년 전,2,

@BarHonigfeld,"Man, I really wonder if there is a way to intervene. The way the North Korean government deals with protests and petty crimes suggests change from the inside is impossible. I had high hopes Kim-Jong Un would be a cautious reformer, being raised in Switzerland and all... but I believe that hope is unsustainable at this point. Thing is, you cannot just attack a sovereign nation. And if you somehow do anyway like the U.S. recently did with Iraq and Russia even more recently did with Ukraine you are not only setting another precedent for the disrespect of nations (although quite justified in that case) but you are also risking a lot of lives, depending on how advanced North Koreas nuclear program is. On the other side, North Korea could eventually extort resources from it's neighboring countries under thread of nuclear first strike.  Essentially I believe something has to be done, but that is easier said than put into reality.  I wonder what North Koreas plans are, if they get attacked by a national force. Do they believe they can withstand the assault? Do they believe they can coerce the assault to stop? Do they believe their own forces would defect when faced with foreign intervention? Do they believe personal assigned to nuclear missile would go through with the launch order? Aren't there high ranking officers who defected, who are in the know regarding those things?",8년 전,0,

Therefore, South Korea remains vigilant but non-directly aggressive and China maintains the status quo as a collapse would harm them.   The North Korean regime is kept in power due to these external factors, but there will eventually be a breaking point.

If you tour European countries, you will see a lot of the cities have dungeon tours and even torture museums.  The British had the ""hanged, drawn and quartered"" execution method which is cruel beyond comprehension.  The French also had very bad execution methods and before the French Revolution, peasants were starving to death while they had to pay heavy taxation to the French kings, aristocrats and clergymen.  Frenchmen could get executed or imprisoned for just stealing some bread for survival so they wouldn't starve to death.

Hitler put the collective (the state) rights ahead of the individuals. Don't take my word for it, that's paraphrased from Mein Kamph.   His buddy, the father of fascism Mussolini (former socialist) wrote a short book defining fascism called ""The Doctrine of Fascism"". It only takes about 50 minutes to read or listen to, and it's on Youtube. I'd suggest you do before tying fascism to the free marketed, liberty minded right.  Mussolini was not a racist, so your ""Extreme right-wing is basically extreme nationalism and racism e.g. Fascism"" argument holds no merit.

@brindlebriar,"To affect change, you have to change the minds of the people in power.  That's not Kim Jung'Un.  Not really.  True power is violence, and he, like all leaders, is granted that power by the ones who actually hold the guns, the military.  If they wanted him deposed, he'd be deposed.  But they don't; they believe in him.  Their 'hearts/minds' have to be changed.  Men with guns are the real power, but they cede that power to 'leaders.'  That's why the U.S. government wants to take the guns away from the public, as most countries' governments have done.    And this is is also why there is a movement in America to sort of infiltrate our own military with the ideology of loyalty to the constitution and the public, above loyalty to the state and the hierarchy, such that solders make a vow to refuse to follow any order to wage war against the American people.   It is precisely to prevent a North Korean type of situation.    Freedom requires vigilance and right-thinking from the governed, particularly from the men who have or could obtain and use weapons.    Think about the soldiers, probably young men, who shoot the people trying to escape across the ice.  Those soldiers probably come from the people themselves; they probably yearned to escape, have family members who have starved.  Yet in a supreme display of Orwellian 'double-think' they still hold the contradictory belief that trying to escape is bad and merits execution.  These are poisoned minds, rotten hearts.  A virus of consciousness.    But now think of the 'pop-culture' or 'youth-culture' he mentioned as having arisen, of people who have contraband media from South Korea, sent by escaped relatives, and whose minds have been changed by that information.  That information is medicine.  It needs to get to the soldiers.  It needs to get into the minds/hearts of the young men with guns.  They are human; they want better for their own families.  They need to know there is better, and getting it entails no longer granting power to the 'not-so-dear leader.    Unfortunately, even young men are not brave enough to take that stand unless they are following some other charismatic new leader, who, if they succeed in overthrowing the regime, will set himself up as the new dictator.  Still, maybe he wouldn't be as bad as the current one.  Over time, information begets freedom, though it may require a series of revolutions.",8년 전,0,

Your statements remind of me of the racists statements that people make about black people not being able to rise out of poverty in America by pointing to immigrants who came to this country with nothing but able to succeed in an incredible way by the 2nd generation or even sooner.   So why can't black people overcome their problems in a country with so much freedom and opportunity???  The funny thing is that the same opportunities are NOT afforded to urban/rural poor.

@Longmachao,"Don't want to be a party pooper here but .. isn't this story a bit lopsided. These are defectors.. aka people who are at the bottom of the society looking to improve their position in life by leaving. That's like having illegal Mexican immigrants telling you how bad Mexico is. But a good number of the Mexican population doesn't need to risk their lives crossing the border because they can live comfortably in Mexico. So having only the people who are in a dire state or poverty stricken paint you a picture of their country is not the most accurate one.  There are still places in the world that have public execution and shitty economy too, but nobody pay them no mind. Mass starvation happens outside of NK too, but international aids usually help with that. I'm not saying NK its a great place to live but rather just another 3rd world impoverish country among many. The whole isolation and mystery behind NK is the only reason you're watching this video in the first place.   Edit: I just noticed Asian boss did put a disclaimer up regarding this point but judging by the comment I don't think many people took it to heart.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@alieninthecaribbean,Not all laughter is because of mirth. Not all tears are because of sadness. There is nervous laughter and tears of joy. Human emotions are complex. Just because she is laughing doesn't mean she is feeling happiness about recounting it. It is uncomfortable and distressing and she is trying to make it less so by laughing. She is more worried about not distressing the interviewer with the horrible things she has to say. You find that kind of brushing off or smiling or laughing to lessen worrying or distressing others among highly empathetic people who care more about others than their own pain. They don't like being a burden to others or being pitied and tend to carry all the troubles of the world with little complaint.,8년 전(수정됨),2,

We just assume that he passed away because my grandfather is around 80. Every time when our family gather up for family holidays, my grandfather would start talking about how his brother was and what they did when they were young. But the sad thing is the story repeats. Do you guys know what I mean? He has no other memories to reminisce, because the time they spent together was not long enough to bring up new stories for annual holidays. I don't know exactly when they were separated, but it's been a long time since they last met.  It would be around 60 years I believe.

@genisay,"When he said we make up stereo types about North Korea...I actually drew a complete blank. I literally don't even know enough about NK to even have stereo types. I know they are people living in a part of Asia, I know there have been things going on in their country that have been terrible for them, but I don't know the details of what those things are. But honestly, as he says, I rarely ever see things about N.Korea (I don't really have TV at home, so most of what I know is what I find...like this and through self research), and in terms of studying countries, N.Korea isn't one I have gotten to yet. I've studied more about Japan and China so far, as far as history from that region of the world. So....I really can't even formulate stereo types about them, even if that sounds strange, because they are currently amorphous in my knowledge base. Might be time I take a break from Japan and Ireland, and go learn more about Korea in general.  I know these kinds of things have happened in lots of countries in the past, and still do happen even elsewhere, but it was hard thinking of the lives these people must have lived, and the kind of fear those still there must live with every day.  I know only a little of this first hand. When I was little, at times we could not afford electricity, and no heat during the winter (in a state where below 0 Fahrenheit is common), and our mom would go stretches with out eating so she could feed my sister and I what ever she could get. When I moved for college, couldn't find a job, and my money ran out, I spent almost a year knowing what it's like to be so hungry you stop feeling the signs of hunger, other then you are tired all of the time, and even moving becomes a tiring task, but you still do it. I started sleeping pretty much any time I didn't need to be some where for classes, because it conserved energy and I didn't get hungry until later in the day, and I would snitch food where I  could.  I don't even know anymore how I managed to get through classes most days now. But for the things I've been through, I know none of it was even a scratch compared to what people must be dealing with over there, and that my life has been many many times easier then theirs, even during my bleak times where at least I can still afford eggs and a bag of rice, even if that's what I end up eating for every mean for several months.

North korea simply is useless strategically no one would risk anything for that place, there are no tangible interests and the cons and risks are way too high to do anything.",8년 전,1,

@morfanaion,"@Desolo SubHumus I never said Japan wasn't asian, I said it was the US dropping the nuke, not Europeans.  As for yout point about the korea's never having been unified, I didn't know that, not a thing we learned in school, so, thanks for bringing me up to speed, you seem to be correct. What yoou say about the government that would be good for the Koreans, that would beg the question, what kind of government would that be? Any type of government has its pros and cons, even democracy is not infallible. All types of government are susceptible to some form of corruption.  Personally, I think it's important to learn from the ""liberation"" of Afghanistan and Iraq. People that are not used to freedom, should not be given sudden freedom and then left to deal with the new situation. Freedom is a very important thing, but it also brings responsibility. Right now, the people of North Korea are used to a few simple truths and one of them is that they have no freedom at all, not even freedom of will. Giving people who have never known any freedom full freedom all of a sudden is a recipe for disaster, they have never learned of the consequences that freedom of will may bring, despite the fact that no government body is dealing the blow. Even in the free west, the freedom comes with certain obligations, but we learned that, by fighting for our own freedom. That has to be the first step, the people will never learn to appreciate freedom, until they start fighting for it themselves.  As for your point about Bernie, I'm with you. Hillary was a bad pick. If I had been a US citizen, I would have voted for her, because of all the evils that you could pick on election day, she was the lesser one, but Bernie could have made a positive change.",8년 전,0,

@Erootuser,"Janine Anderson Well there's actually a fairly complicated answer to that. To start off I'm going to state a quick fact, most South Koreans are ok with North Korea as it currently stands, remember this as I'm going to bring it up later. One thing that you have to remember about NK is that while it's citizens are extremely poor, its government is not. Most, if not all of their federal budget is spent on one thing, military technology and we can see this in their recent tests of both atomic and, possibly, hydrogen bombs. This is one of the bigger reasons why countries tend to stray away from getting involved as if NK gets to its breaking point and decides to drop a couple bombs, we could see this possible loss of 10s of millions of lives. But something I want to stress is that nuclear, atomic bomb aren't the biggest threat that North Korea proposes. In reality, the worst weapon North Korea probably has is chemical and pathological weapons. Seeing as we already know that North Korea doesn't really play by the rules I can see no reason they wouldn't  delve into this, not only are chemical and pathological weapons cheap to create, the cheapest having the possibility to create for less than 1000 dollars, but they can cause immense amounts of long lasting damage at levels much larger than any nuclear bomb. Also as seen in this video the North Korean government is extremely unpredictable and very violent, I shudder to think what their response could be if they found out a foreign country is, or was, working against them. But let's say we did go in to North Korea and completely liberate it, the first thing that only happen would undoubtedly be an influx of refugees flowing into South Korea. Let me make this perfectly clear that would absolutely destroy SK's economy which would hurt everyone involved whether it would be the country who made the first move or the now liberated North Korea itself. Also as the guy above me mentioned, we have to remember that both China and Russia are technically allies of North Korea and angering those two would cause trouble for everyone.",8년 전,0,

The problem there is, their capital is within the range of North Korean artillery, they share a border that would mostly likely be crossed by millions of North Koreans, they would also have to deal with China, and North Korea would most likely use one of those nukes they keep threatening people with. That's not even mentioning the issues with dealing with the millions of North Koreans refugees after winning a costly war.   Not going to war with North has nothing to do with cowardice. South Korea for example is more than capable of taking down North Korea, as is the US and many other countries. Frankly, it's an idiotic move even if it would be a noble one. The cost of life (both civilian and military) would be horrific, and the country(s) involved would gain very little if nothing for going to war.

@hzuiel,"White rice is processed, and therefore probably more expensive than whole grain rice, potatos, or other staple foods.  It probably also varies from different parts of the country. Areas of the country where smuggling is more prevalent, i would guess closer to borders and coastline, I think they have more money and more access to things, but it's weird, i've read how the men are dirt poor because they're forced to serve in the military and meanwhile the women work, and sometimes smuggle and sell contraband and have all the money. So depending on your  situation perspective you may be more poor or less poor in north korea.   We know north korea has a shortage of power, you can see on satellite imagery that it's practically a dark zone at night compared to south korea, china, and japan. I'm not really sure how much power they have exactly, but even countries with some exports and some semblance of a functional economy often struggle to keep a stable electrical grid. Kathmandu in Nepal is infamous for scheduled blackouts because they can't run the entire grid simultaneously. People in remote areas don't have power at all, they use car batteries and solar panels to charge phones and run a few basic items. In the great depression in the USA it wasn't that uncommon for electricians to re-connect people's electricity when it would get cut off, and even the people at the utility itself might be bribed into turning a blind eye to stuff like this. It's possible in some areas they've hacked the electrical grid and strung up lines to try and get electricity when it is disconnected, or have a similar solar panel battery system that maybe gives them power a few hours per day for a few small devices like a portable dvd player(which doesn't use much power). They might save up to buy alkaline batteries and play until the batteries run out and not play again until they can find more, which is common in many developing parts of the world.  These are just thoughts that popped into my head, there may be many explanations for the discrepancies.   I'm not sure what their incentives would be to lie, is north korea really a utopia and all the ""refugees"" are just south korean operatives trained to convey horror stories, because south korea and the usa are so jealous of north korea's success?

@yoligong7636,"I am a Chinese citizen and I know people who defected from North Korea in my childhood community, I don't understand what you are saying about that agreement and the defectors ""often get arrested.""? From my 20+ years of personal experience, I've never seen or hear anything about Chinese sending back North Korean refugees. This North Korean family opened a small business in my neighborhood, and they were very welcomed, now they are living a life just like any regular Chinese citizen. One of the brothers married my neighbor, we hang out and our families play soccer together on the weekends. We all know they came to the country as defectors from North Korea, so what? They felt safe enough to share their stories with us when we just started being friends. No one holds that against them. I treat them just like other people in my life; sometimes I forgot they were born in a different country. So I am not sure where that “agreement”, or the “arrests” you said came from, please be specific. China takes in a lot of refugees and treats everyone fairly. Compare to other countries, China is a very welcoming place to foreign people. Also one thing to think about is why won't the North Korean people just go straight to South Korea? They speak the same language, so won't it be easier? Or is it because other countries are not as easy to enter.",8년 전,1,

But in fact yes: A video in which people talk about terrifying situations in their life should not be used to express that you want to bang or even just have a relationship with them.  To give you another example: It is like watching old footage of a concentration camp and instead talking seriously about it saying that some guy there looked handsome. It is inappropriate.

Korea means of production are some form of Capitalism i.e. privately owned, not Socialism (the proposed road to communism) i.e. socially owned. Clearly these people dying in the streets don't own the businesses they work for, or they probably would not be starving to death.  Try reading some of the source material--the Communist Manifesto at least, then come back and tell us how North Korea pairs with the concept of a classless society where people share the means of production, take care of one another, and are free to pursue their innermost dreams and desires because they have the leisure time, security and freedom to do so.",8년 전(수정됨),12,
@goldjoinery,"Beartoe Con Carne Capitalism:  1. Destroys the environment. It must expand into as many avenues of production as possible as the forces of social reaction (eg conservatism, populism, etc) will allow. The wanton destruction of the environment as we see and experience everyday is proof of this.  2. Exploits workers. Mainstream bourgeois economists cannot explain the failure of Keynesian economics in the stagflation of the 70's as well as recently in 2008 monetarist policies and neoliberalism. They blame external forces interfering with their theory like immigration or outlier agents in the market. However, it is because they have abandoned the labour theory of value (LTV), ie that the source of all exchange-value is socially necessary, homogeneous labour.  The LTV explains an inconvenient truth for economists: that exchange in capitalism is zero-sum. That in turn has the consequence that, in order for companies to turn a profit — to even stay afloat! — they must exploit workers; in order words, they must take from the worker, who is alienated from their labour inputs by wages, surplus value.  3. Amplifies and sustains racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, etc. So long as the workers as distracted by identity politics, they will at best see class as yet another part of identity and nothing more, and perhaps even call for class collaboration like fasces. So long as there is division within the working class, consumption and selling one's labour for less will be widespread. Competition relies on worker disunity.  Capitalism does not create these problems. However, so long as it is allowed to fester, solidarity for the vast majority of people on earth will be impossible. And if the left fails, capitalism will turn to fascism to foster worker division directly.  4. Creates artificial scarcity. We produce at least 1.5 times the food all humans need to eat but this is wasted by corporations because it is profitable. Empty houses in the US outnumber homeless people 6:1.  5. Creates planned obsolescence. iPhones and Samsung mobiles go out of date in a flash because it is more profitable to design newer, subtly different models.  6. Diminishes the middle class. The state apparatus taxes the middle class heavily to subsidise companies through government policies like welfare, forcing the great mass of them eventually either into the proletariat and the remaining few into the capitalist class, or turning them into a body for far right militancy.  7. Spreads war and imperialism. Capitalism is forced to look abroad to a. drive competition and force workers to sell labour for less in the name of ""the war effort"" and nationalism; b. accumulate capital and expand its industry; and c. create demand for weapon and ammunition manufacture and the military.  8. Alienates us from society and our work. This is a complex topic, but we see that capitalism alienates us by estranging us from our products by wages, making work feel drudgerous by limiting organic labour in favour of wage labour, by turning education away from fulfillment and into repetition and regurgitation, by dehumanising us as in turning us from fellow human to cogwheel in the machine, and so on.  9. Creates inevitable economic crises. Marx concludes in his crisis theory, from the LTV and the work of classical economists, that boom and bust cycles cannot be escaped. Bankers fall; companies fall; the bulk of society is chained down and breaks down with the market economy of exchange-value and its abstractions and internal contradictions. You cannot reform this away.  In addition it creates super-bacteria due to over-prescription of antibiotics, prevents a collective move towards veganism, and a whole deluge of other problems.  So how do we change this? The problems are too severe. Continual reform with no end in sight is but a bandaid to what is clearly a massive slice to the jugular. We cannot look to the state. We know through the extensive work of countless historians and political scientists that there is real class struggle everywhere since time immemorial, or in Marxist terms, the lens of historical materialism has been and continues to be affirmed. To take reform (or ""infiltration"") of the state apparatus which serves the bourgeois as primary is not only futile, it is also a betrayal of the interests of the working class. We must look outside of the state and within capitalism for answers.  Where do the multiple ""evils"" of capitalism stem from? They result from the various internal contradictions of capital, which all come from the conditions necessary for society to be capitalistic: a. exchange in the market; b. the commodification of labour, sold for a wage by the proletariat; and c. the ownership of private property by the bourgeoisie. The relations of production are the basis of the class divide; in this way, class is defined concretely.  The solution, then, is to negate all three of these. If not a market, then what? An intimate network of central pools of resources. If not relations of production, then what? Classless societies. If not private property, then what? The bifurcation of private property into either public or personal property.  Historically, shifts and changes in the structure of society have been accompanied by developments in the technological forces of production. The bourgeois-democratic revolutions throughout Europe in which the state became increasingly dominated by the then-mercantile now-bourgeois class could only have been possible with the advent of the Industrial Revolution. So we must not tire.  Quantitative change inevitably leads to some foreign interruption or natural qualitative change. We must either head towards revolution or collective ruin.",8년 전,11,

@nubemuffin,"Communisation China was very much communist during the great leap forward. Land was nationalized, private enterprise was forbidden, and people were sent to work on communal farms. It was textbook Marxism, and if failed as it always has and always will.   Also, you rambled quite a bit and I don't have the time to cover all of your topics.  However, the idea that a market is a zero sum game is a really simplistic and archaic view of markets. Production is determined by the input factors that go into producing it. These factors can be accumulated and improved upon making production more efficient and therefore requiring less resources to produce the same amount. For example, there are far less resources needed to produce a computer capable of calculating simple math (a calculator) today than was needed 50 years ago.  It's undeniable that our productive capacities have increased over time. We are capable today of producing more than we ever have. In economics, this is called real GDP. This increase in real GDP completely disproves your zero sum theory. Those new products have to go to someone which means that the market can't be zero sum since new products are being added to it.  You may wrongly conclude that this increase in real production is just a result of the exploitation of the environment. However, the invisible hand does an amazing job of fixing exploitation problems. When a resource becomes more scared (due to the overuse of it in the market), the supply of that resource shifts left and the market clears at a higher price. This higher price will result in a lower amount being demanded and consumers will switch to other more available and cheaper alternatives. In the past, many simple minded folks concluded that the world consumption would exceed production capacity by now. They assumed we would use up all of our resources and starve. However, it's clear to everyone that they were wrong.  One other thing I'd like to touch on: The idea that capitalism harms minority populations.  You'll find that if you really examine the situation, capitalism can only help minority populations. In state controlled markets, the goods a person has available to consume is determined entirely by the government. Governments will be controlled by the majority populations. It's very easy (and often happens) for the government to use a minority population as a scapegoat or treat them as some sort of ""other"" and deprive them of the necessary goods required for survival.  Capitalism on the other hand, results in an entirely different situation prevailing. In capitalism, people only care about profit. This gives minority populations opportunity to compete and make a living by selling their products at cheaper prices (if there is some discrimination present in the market and there goods come at a discount), allowing them to make a living. The market doesn't care a pair of shoes were put together by a black, white, asian, green, or purple person. It's impersonal.",8년 전,7,

@goldjoinery,"UnderGat45 Let me be clear: I argue for and defend neither UBI nor the USSR. The flimsy human nature ""argument"" has been trotted out since time immemorial (or, at least, whenever the status quo feels the need to assert itself and the validity of its oppression). Therefore, I will give you my standard response.  'The social form of people's regular activities under capitalism is a response to a certain material and historical situation. The material and historical conditions explain the origin of the capitalist form, but do not explain why this form continues after the initial situation disappears. A concept of ""cultural lag"" is not an explanation of the continuity of a social form after the disappearance of the initial conditions to which it responded. This concept is merely a name for the continuity of the social form. When the concept of ""cultural lag"" parades as a name for a ""social force"" which determines human activity, it is an obfuscation which presents the outcome of people's activities as an external force beyond their control. This is not only true of a concept like ""cultural lag."" Many of the terms used by Marx to describe people's activities have been raised to the status of external and even ""natural"" forces which determine people's activity; thus concepts like ""class struggle,"" ""production relations"" and particularly ""The Dialectic,"" play the same role in the theories of some ""Marxists"" that ""Original Sin,"" ""Fate"" and ""The Hand of Destiny"" played in the theories of medieval mystifiers.  'In the performance of their daily activities, the members of capitalist society simultaneously carry out two processes: they reproduce the form of their activities, and they eliminate the material conditions to which this form of activity initially responded. But they do not know they carry out these processes; their own activities are not transparent to them. They are under the illusion that their activities are responses to natural conditions beyond their control and do not see that they are themselves authors of those conditions. The task of capitalist ideology is to maintain the veil which keeps people from seeing that their own activities reproduce the form of their daily life; the task of critical theory is to unveil the activities of daily life, to render them transparent, to make the reproduction of the social form of capitalist activity visible within people's daily activities.  'Under capitalism, daily life consists of related activities which reproduce and expand the capitalist form of social activity. The sale of labor-time for a price (a wage), the embodiment of labortime in commodities (saleable goods, both tangible and intangible), the consumption of tangible and intangible commodities (such as consumer goods and spectacles)-these activities which characterize daily life under capitalism are not manifestations of ""human nature,"" nor are they imposed on men by forces beyond their control.  'If it is held that man is ""by nature"" an uninventive tribesman and an inventive businessman, a submissive slave and a proud craftsman an independent hunter and a dependent wage-worker, then either man's ""nature"" is an empty concept, or man's ""nature'' depends on material and historical conditions, and is in fact a response to those conditions.'  — Fredy Perlman, The Reproduction of Everyday Life",8년 전,4,

You'll find that people who are not successful in a capitalist society are unsuccessful at just about everything else, basic hygiene included. I hate to be that person, but some people are truly hopeless, and it's very sad, but we can't blame capitalism for their (or their family's) inability to do anything but unconsciously breath for their failures.  3.

"" And if the left fails, capitalism will turn to fascism to foster worker division directly.""  The left is the side that buys into that stupidity, and they lost this election hard. The right doesn't trust the media, and hasn't for a long time. The proof of that is the rise of alternative media sources, which your virtue signaling leftist media is labeling, and libeling, as ""fake news"". That's why Trump won, most people realize that those are all lies and that no one in America is really oppressed, other than all people by the political elite and the media. The US has never been more divided than before and that was under leftist governments. But hey, I guess we'll see if America becomes a fascist country in the next 4 years, won't we?  It's obvious that you're in an echo chamber in the way that you admit that capitalism creates division yet you haven't yet realized where this division is coming from.  6. Diminishes the middle class.  ""Far right militancy""  I want to disagree with you on that but I'm not knowledgeable enough to do so. I'm good at spotting bullshit though, and this is bullshit. What is a far right militant anyway and why is it such a bar thing? What aspects of the far right scares you, and why do you believe that America is going to turn into that. America has been a capitalist country since it's creation (?) or at least a long time now, and is it a far right country? I don't think so. You see how you're dividing the country by claiming that the right is this evil entity and that the left are the good guys? You're so convinced that you're on the right side of history that you think it gives you carte blanche to say and do anything you want, you're actually the problem.   7. Spreads war and imperialism.  War and imperialism existed way before America was created, and in fact America was created to get away from that. The only reason what you're saying is true is because there is profit in everything, including war. Or is there? Didn't America lose tons of money going to war and in fact, a lot of right wingers were against the war on Iraq?  You seem to have this notion that this is due to capitalism or that the right are a bunch of war mongering greedy capitalists who don't value human life, but let me remind you that all the richest people in America are leftists, and so are the rich Hollywood actors, so is the mainstream media & the political class that labeled 52 million voters as a basket of deplorables simply for not being leftist. Meanwhile, all the grunts who are the ""boots on the ground"", as the left so endearingly calls them, are mostly right wingers.  8. Alienates us from society and our work.  As opposed to making shoes my whole life? Plowing fields my whole life? Doing plumbing my whole life? The only work that is not dreadful in the life you're describing would be emergency response, which would be extremely dangerous and incompetent due to farmer's boys having no money to get a proper education or afford police academy. You know, those small town cop cliches exist for a reason. Because cops used to be like that, and cops are like that in less developed countries where the law bends like rubber and is dished out on the street, i.e. Brazil.  ""super-bacteria due to over-prescription of antibiotics""  Created by college educated, leftist doctors and researchers, prescribed by college educated leftist psychologists who needed cry-ins when a republican candidate was elected over a woman. And you're telling me they're not the cause of sexism, where if anyone supports a white male candidate, they're clearly sexist, racist, etc. ?  You know what, at first I thought you were smart because you used big words and nomenclature I don't understand as well as structured paragraph. I thought only an idiot would dare to argue with you. But the more I break down your arguments, the more I realize this is all a show and you're just bullshitting to push your agenda. It started when you started claiming that the left were the holy warriors here to save people from the evil demonic right. And you're talking that capitalism creates identity politics? No, you do, not capitalism, because you want to virtue signal how much better you are. The left is done. You guys need to change, and for the record, I""m not right wing and I was leftist before this US election.",8년 전(수정됨),2,

@mmKALLL,"While they are extremely picky about who can enter the country, from my point of view it is not the same as being completely closed off.   There was a Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea; I can recommend checking it out to get more context from a somewhat reliable source of information. There also exist various organizations trying to improve the famine situation a bit through various means, but admittedly the effectiveness of such efforts might not be very good at the moment. In my opinion, change of policy might be one of the best ways to induce North Korea to open up more, but the international community should also be careful not to cause a war that nobody benefits from. I believe UN for instance has tried to push things towards that direction, but it doesn't seem to be one of their top priorities due to the high difficulty.  I tried to make the point that there are many people in somewhat similar situations regarding their options, but who are much more within our reach to help. As an individual, if it is not be possible to help everybody, don't you think that we should focus on making our efforts go as far as possible? Organizations like GiveWell have made lots of excellent research towards that direction; http://effective-altruism.com/ is another place where one could get good ideas regarding that.  Lastly, I'm not trying to say that we should neglect the North Korean situation by any means. If you feel like doing something for them, trying to contact people who have worked from that angle before might yield some better insight on the issue.

@cestarianinhabitant5898,"1:38 the international community is fully aware of what's going on in North Korea. But no one does a damned thing about it.  This whole issue is something that has made it particularly easy to see through the massive hypocrisy and lies the American government make up. You know like how they're always invading countries that have dictators over them or civil war going on claiming they're doing it to make the world a better place. If that really were the case they'd have started with North Korea.  Instead all the countries they're invading are ones they've been targeting since way before for some resource or another, or with some massive ulterior motive. Often even putting these dictators they're later gonna fight against into power in the first place. If they really gave a damn about anyone else than their 1% richest crowd the world would be a very different place. But they are basically the only country that's still invading other countries year in and year out (they then rope others into their conflicts) like some medieval empire, and they're doing it all to make their rich richer, and their poor poorer and deader too.  The only hope really is to convince Japan and South Korea to do something about this (China has made it pretty clear that they're perfectly happy with North Korea as it is). The only reason they haven't joined hands to liberate NK is because South Korea can't set aside their differences after Japan's actions in WW2. I still don't get why SK and China act like they're the only country in the world who suffered in WW2 because of another country. Do you see all of europe blaming Germany for what happened in WW2? No. They need to get their heads out of their asses, everyone suffered in WW2, not moving on will only cause everyone harm in the end, because while everyones still butthurt there's still chance for another war.",8년 전,0,

@tyraelarchangel183,"At least the rich college kids know that Communism hasn't really been established in history, communist countries are normally dictatorial/socialist regimes (like North Korea). Communism strives for what's basically a Utopian society, in true Communism the government is actually only there to establish this system, the problem is a lot of countries never relinquish that governmental control and truly accomplish communism.  Not defending communism, since most people associate it with government like China and North Korea, despite the fact that it's not the proper term. Yes, those types of government are horrible, and if you wish to call it communism, go for it, I won't argue there horrible. But you're using the incorrect term, don't go yelling they're communist supporters expecting some horrible reaction, since you're not even talking about the same thing they are >.<  Communism is actual what most people would prefer, especially a lot of Americans. It's a state without classes and government, where the working party essentially decides what to do democratically. It would eliminate politicians and social status based on wealth. Where people provide for others as they can, and accept help when they need it. But again, if you can imagine such a thing, it would be a Utopia, and sadly will require a great deal of cooperation, sacrifice, and humility among a LARGE amount of people.  Actually if you think about it most families would be similar to a Utopia, where you try to provide and help your own family as you can, and you don't define your family as harshly based on their social of governmental status, and any decisions make are made via a vote, rather than having a sole figurehead (yes, some families have a head of household).  But whatever.  Equality can exist in nature if we make it. We're humans, last I checked I was made by nature.

Most people hate the idea, or hate feminists, because they don't truly know what feminism is, and only know extreme example, what they call ""femi-nazis"" which are often arrogant, extreme ""feminists"" who abuse the term.  Do I hate feminism? I hate what most people THINK is feminism (i.e. what they call femi-nazies"" but REAL feminism is great, i.e. the fact that woman should be equal to men, that's really what the heart of feminism is. It's not about making women MORE than men, and suppressing men, it's just about equality, and I think we can all agree that's a just cause.  In this case communism is like feminism in the way that most people are thinking about the WRONG examples, the examples of feminism/communism that aren't actually what the idea is about, but a twisted/construed version that people often associate because they're misinformed.

@handsomejustin,"North Korea was one of the richest nations in Asian after the Korean war all the way until the early 90s.  They were 90% urbanized (way higher than the Chinese in 2016) and everything was industrialized. Their industry and economy was light years AHEAD of the South Korean counterpart and looking to compete with Japan. The reason they were so prospers all the way till early 1990s is because they got super cheap oil on top of huge discounts from the Soviet Union. Ever since the Soviet Union collapsed they were no longer able to get oil from them for cheap and the Americans refused to let ANY COUNTRY to supply North Korea with oil with a reasonable price.  So all their industries collapsed without oil and Americans use this opportunity to starve North Korea further with sanctions so there will be no buffer zone between China and South Korea (which the US controls). So in the end North Koreans are poor because they are a buffer zone for China, and China needs NK to survive in order to maintain its security from imperialist America's likelyhood of invasions (like they actually did in Korean War). So in another word, the USA is really the one who's fucking up other countries and then come back and blame the victims. (cough Iraq, cough cough middle east, cough Libya)",8년 전,19,

If we use GDP per capita again, North Korea's real GDP per capita was roughly 3k dollars in 1980 - Japan's was at least thrice (3x) that amount.

So, there. China had good enough reason to intervene in Korea, but the US did NOT use Korea as an opportunity to invade China (this would be true if MacArthur had his way - but it's not), and the US does NOT have 100% of the blame for North Korea's current condition, on the weak basis of oil embargoes - you have the dictator and his command economy (why doesn't North Korea open itself more to business with China, then?

Tey have been invaded, bullies and stripped of their land by the British, Americans, French and even the Portuguese! (Macau). Then they got hooked on opium by the British that they couldn't even survive while having a drug addiction enforced by the British. Their Qing dynasty couldn't even control their own VILLAGES let alone get out and invade other countries for profit.  Tibet has been a part of China for almost A THOUSAND YEARS, how many years has California been a part of the US?

You're bringing up all these new attacks against the US while disregarding the literal falsehoods you spewed. North Korea's stronk economy light years ahead of South Korea in the 90's? US invasion of China? Blaming US for North Korea's economic woes while China also participates in economic sanctions now?  And I brought democracy into this argument because you keep riding China's dick. Then I brought up Tibet, since you DIDN'T ADDRESS any of my criticism, I thought we might well try a different route.

On top of that, look at the many countries that have similar systems. China might not be half as bad as North Korea, but there are a lot of similar systems in place there. What of Saudi Arabia, where the islamic police stopped rescue workers from entering a burning school to save 15 girls that were still inside, just because the girls in question were not properly dressed (which is to say they weren't wearing headscarves and abayas).

South Korea can't act because, while they have arguably more advanced weaponry and more money/supplies, North Korea has Nuclear weapons.

Not to mention, while its equipment is outdated and they could barely feed it, North Korea still has a large army.   Long story short, the only quick way for things to happen is if an uprising succeeded within North Korea itself and they then asked the UN and/or South Korea for help.

More primitive ones, but nukes nonetheless, capable of destroying nearby cities like Seoul or Tokyo. Imagine that. Imagine a nuke exploding over a 10-15 mil population metropolis. Third of all, you have China which guarantees North Korea's independence. The Kim dynasty needs a strong friend and China needs a buffer between itself and South Korea. This alliance is based on mutual need rather than ideology. So going to war with North Korea would also mean effectively making China your enemy.",8년 전(수정됨),11,

@Goldyhawk,sydandtaytum I'm just going to say this as a history buff and political enthusiast. we officially are at war with North Korea.  ever since the start of the Korean War we have been. there was never a treaty only a cease fire. that is why we have military stationed on the border of North Korea and the whole 7th fleet off the coast. the last time we went to war the cost was too great for what was achieved. so technically we are at war with them. secondly we receive the majority of foreign oil from Mexico and Canada. we did not wage war in the middle east for oil. a lot of it had to do with NATO and the UN. I'm not saying we had 100% good intentions but it sure was not for oil. Thirdly China would not back up North Korea now. it is to westernized and we are China's biggest trade partner. war would not be beneficial. and China has helped north Koreans escape because they now realize what kind of country North Korea is.,8년 전,0,

This was basically a loophole that prevented them from declaring official war against the US and south Korea.  If you understand how the UN is made up, of course they came to the aid of members of the UN.  The reason why China had to hide their involvement in North Korea was because they are one of the main founders of the UN and the UN was against North Korea's actions against the South.  Even now, China is starting to distance itself from North Korea because of their actions.  They are condemning the testing of nuclear weapons by them. If you also understood that war you would see that North Korea started that war.  The fact that North Korea gained absolutely no territory so it was a complete failure.  North Korea is only a geographical concern for China. If that war starts again they will be obliterated.  Even though China is not an enemy of North Korea they still supported sanctions.  China is just too affraid to have Western Allies surrounding them and they also want a buffer country so they can have a proxy war without actually claiming to be at war.",8년 전,0,

Japan was the one that Attacked the Korean peninsula and when Japan fell the Koreans divided themselves into 2 nations.  Kim Jung, like all communists, didn't like that the South wanted a democracy and was threatened by that so they tried to take over the South.  You should really brush up on your history.  The fact that you aren't even in North Korea helps prove my point.  With a country so powerful, as you claim, should clearly have a control over the internet.   US and UN troops being in South Korea just reinforces the strength that all of us have against North Korea.  North Korea is so weak that they don't have any influence or troops even a half of the world away from the US mainland.  We park or naval ships and military troops right outside of their borders and North Korea is too affraid to do anything about it.  North Korea is just a spec on the globe that has absolutely no influence or power.  I feel bad for the people of North Korea.  It's no wonder that all the countries around them are constantly housing the people fleeing from there including China.    I again point to the fact that the Korean war was initiated by the North and ended up with a truce on both ends where neither side gained anything.

I don't know why they feel that way since we were basically in both of those wars to protect the take over of our allies but ultimately it appears we were successful in stopping the aggression.  Usually when there is a winner they tend to gain something.  Neither side in both wars gained anything except for death and destruction.

If the north korean army shoots people for trying to leave the country according to their own free will, you can't possibly expect us to believe that the people can actually visit places outside the country. That choice has been made for them. Do you know what would  happen if the people were free to leave? North Korea would be a country with only one person in it - that Kim Jong dude. As nobody would opt in to slave under him willingly. Also the UN isn't oppressing NKr, Kim Jong is. UN opposed every oppression there is to oppose and nKr is a cluster fuck of these. The sheer fact that tourists that go to north Korea are only allowed to see what the government wants to show them, is evidence enough that there's something seriously fucked with the country. Even the arab people are more hospitable to foreigners.  Also as long as you can leave north Korea alive, you can go to the US and opt in for refuge. They'll take you in.  And nuclear submarine really? They don't have nuclear reactors to power up their nation, but they have nuclear submarines? A nuclear submarine reactor can power up half of Moscow without breaking a rad. If north Korea had such reactors at hand, they wouldn't keep their population energy starved.",8년 전,2,

Not even that shitless dictator in there, has the balls to do such a thing.",8년 전,1,
@kywilliams2717,"Daddy Fupa you are a sweet man. I personally don't care about these people at all though,  nor anyone else suffering in the world, unless it has a direct risk/effect to my own resources and safety. And I worry that people take the stance of the ""moral high ground"" so often because it's easier to be an elitist and imperialist - similar to the king of Siam's fears in the classic ""The King and I"" when a well established queen told the world he was a barbarian. He knew people felt justified to do anything to someone classified as an inferior savage. Just as Sadam Hussein also found out when the U.S. destroyed his country and left a vacuum for insurgency and warlordism that has brought about close to 20 years of instability and chaos to the Sunni, Shia, and Kurds.   If I were to go to war with North Korea, morality and ethics would have nothing to do with it, because it is a fallacy, and leads to war without achieving any measurable goals. By the time it's done you would have caused so much harm that you couldn't even begin to call yourself a good person.   For me, It would only be to antagonize China, who is one of the only countries helping keep N. Korea afloat with exports. I'd also do it for a strategic chance to get closer to Asia without having to rely completely on Palau, which is a small island we regularly pay $15,000,000 to $50,000,000 just in case shit ever hits the fan in Australia, Japan, or the Asian coast and we need a strategic location to station troops and ships.   If your goal is to cure North Korea and place heavier emphasis on food instead of weapons research,  then what you would really do is just help them finish their weapons program - then they can focus on all the things they have ignored and we won't have to criticize them anymore. Or, since we insist they abandon security independence altogether, you would get rid of your own weapons, showing your adversary that your goal is to be an EQUAL. Finally, you would send ambassadors and foreign service officers to help strengthen weak civil infrastructure without asking for anything in return, and would defend that scared nation when challenged and criticized by the rest of the world. You would invite Kim to your nations and feed him a buffet and let people get to know him. write him clever speeches guaranteed to help your people warm up to him. work hard to get North Koreans in your homeland and your people in his for a CONSENSUAL exchange.   If you or your country isn't doing that, then you don't really care about North Korea. Going to war just sounds fun and meaningful to people, as though it's more effective than winning the hearts and minds of your adversaries.   Our global response has been cutting their aid more and more in hopes that they give up or go crazy and have a civil war.    We are only mad that they called our bluff and are continuing to learn defense measures so that all the big countries won't come rape them when the opportunity presents itself. If I as a nation had to choose between starving or having to forge a big blade to stop from getting raped someday, I'd be one emaciated Michone! LOL.  I don't agree with North Korea entirely, but know what reality is outside of our comfortable bubble. North Korea simply doesn't want to be a 6-nippled bitch on all fours, so the answer  is to build up their defensive capabilities. Since we can't change this yet, it's easier to point at the nation's cultural flaws, like people do with any minority.    My question to you people is this: See how your country treats your minorities and unstable citizens? Korea is a minority as a country. Imagine what the other countries have, is, and will continue to do when no one is watching.   Whereas I can't speak for the cultural differences that send people fleeing North Korea, I'd be building bombs too. If N. Korea can't defend themselves, a bully will challenge them by 2080 and no one will challenge it because we think the worse of their isolated people.",8년 전(수정됨),1,

@emmastrange5557,"***** No I'm not complaining about statistics... Out of curiosity what do you think I'm talking about?

@emmastrange5557,"***** This is very simple, if one country says more things count as violent crime than another country, then obviously in that country there will be more violent crime. It's like how gun crime increased after stricter gun laws were put in place. It's not because more people were shooting at each other (that actually decreased) it's because simply having a handgun now counted as a gun crime.

We've already burned through out treasury and tax dollars to nation build sandbox land. Every American thinks their super bad ass, they wouldn't last 10 seconds in an all out war with North Korea. The lesson is, if you're going to be a psychotic dictator or emperor, always put the majority of your resources into a loyal huge army who worships you because you created a cult status. We are not physically, mentally, or nationally prepares to take on a real army in conventional warfare all to save yet another country from itself.  Again, I repeat, I'm not responsible for an Asian country thousands of miles away. If you want to go fight and die for all these foreign countries while bankrupting your own country, you'd be in a constant fight everywhere. We do not have the will to fight a conventional army so we can give them Walmar. North Korea is a shithole that no American is responsible for. Let all the Nordic socialist countries that enjoy USA provided world security while spending their own money on health and welfare for their own citizens fight North Korea. It upsets me that our Army and resources are still being squandered by being in a country for over 60 years. That's ridiculous.  Ever since world war 2 where we were the only big Dick swinging left after the war, we became a nation that took on the mantle of militarization. Now our police are tactical military service member, and we live in a country dominated by militarized police and it connects to North Korea because we decided to be the world police provider. We have treaties with countless countries to protect them from aggressors. We absolutely cannot take on North Korea in a conventional war and nukes would only make all matters worse because countless civilians woul die.

@Typhoon792,"leastcommondinominat It's not greed.  It's built into the so-called ""free market"".  If one person cheats or does something exploitative, it puts them at an advantage which effectively puts others who don't join out of business and therefore their livelihood.  This causes an evergrowing chain reaction on multiple fronts which inevitably leads to an inevitable end, with growing mass inequality.  That's of course bring relevance to where you'd predominantly be getting this idea from, ironically, from the stratifying and ""individualistic"" culture that's born out of this.  In other cases, it's always been things which were structurally incentivized.  The problem with human nature is that its reactionary, so when scarcity and inequality are an issue, it's always going to lead to conflict.  The only way for this to not be an issue isn't in particular any kind of arrangement of government, but rather, the building of an economy that's based around post-scarcity.  With the technology we have today, and no, not just in some Utopian fantasy, it's possible today to accomplish this if enough people actually came to this understanding who are in charge of serious production.  We have more than enough resources for this to be a reality - certainly to meet basic/base-level human needs.  I find it funny when people think they've actually been met in the current system we live in, just because most of the population have a roof over their head.  The biggest problem with Communism was that it wasn't technically accountable and it was still a money-based economy (as all economies in the world today) rather than a resource-based one.  Money is the thing, in the value it's assigned relative to resources (and therefore influence and power), which differentiates people by status and inevitably leads to clashing converging interests.  It's impossible to account for in the way you suggested simply because of the inevitable runaway effect that this eventually has.  I wouldn't really place the root of this at human nature.",8년 전,3,

GDP it grows, it CERTAINLY does that, but past a certain point the charts of standard of living and GDP are essentially inversely related.  As one of the reasons I imagine you therefore mentioned, it's all a mix and a very necessary one.  In terms of it being the strongest system to date, my point was this: that it was*.  There isn't physically existing a better one but it's certainly no longer workable in any balance or mixture and there are ideas to better take its place.

After decades of no change and even the lowest common denominators of the ""American Dream"" gone, people who proudly believed in this are waking up to the reality that it is no longer the case.  And yes, even when before that it was, it was always at the expense of some other large group of people, regardless of what form they happened to take at whatever time(s).  It wasn't so much at the expense of others as much as Capitalism's default/natural state is to exploit.  I'll bring up the current growing wage gap as an elementary example of how in no way previous pros of this system continue to be valid, especially if you understand the reason for why it's happening and why it's not getting fixed within the current paradigm.  On a very base level, if you've never seen or looked into this before, I'd suggest starting with the film ""Zeitgeist: Moving Forward"" actually.  It's free on YouTube.

Kim Jong-un's grandfather Kim Il-sung started ruling not long before Stalin's death. The period in 20th century from the 20's to the 80's was just full of megalomaniacs with a crush to dictate (and before that, of course, and until now too ><). Anyway, these are just maniacs with a all lot o passion just looking for some doutrine, some high ideology to create it's own distorted theory on the top of it and starting it's path of conquering ultil the top, simply for the urge of ruling. Ok, we had Stalin and other communist dictators but, remember, we also had Hitler and Franco in Europe and Salazar from Portugal, the military dictatorship in Brazil, and before Fidel, which is also considered a communist dictator, there was Fulgencio Batista, another dictator but not a communist. All these men weren't communist but then were they capitalists? No. The fact is that dictators use social and economical and political theories/doutrines simply to come to power. From that moment you can expect anything. You can't call Stalin a creditable socialist (yet some people do) and neither can call Pinochet a creditable capitalist or individualist or liberalist or whatever (now that's something no one does :P). You can't use the worse example, man! North Korea is just a fucked up example haha :P It's just so stupid how most of the people so easily relate communist inclined dictatorships with Marx.

@dragoneye6229,"There are MANY reasons for the growing wage gap. The one you've listed is Marxist nonsense in a nutshell. ""We can't trust people so people should have no power under a state ruled by a certain type of people, namely ones that ideologically agree with myself."". No.  Inequality has widened because globalization and technological change have made most people less competitive, while making the best educated more competitive. What people used to do can now be done more cheaply by lower-paid workers abroad or by computer-driven machines. Now take into account intellectual property rights being extended and enlarged creating windfalls for pharmaceutical  companies which in turn caused prices to skyrocket in comparison to other advanced nations, antitrust laws having been relaxed for corporations with significant market power, such as big food companies, cable companies facing little or no broadband competition, big airlines and the largest Wall Street banks, again causing Americans to pay more for these services than any other advanced nation, bankruptcy laws being extended for large corporations but not homeowners, and many more. None of these are fixed by socialism, they are in fact the cause of socialist dipping in our current system. These are all laws and policies passed in an attempt to enforce democratic centralism, which is a socialist political tenet of Marxism. Long story short, money lost power and the rich already traded that money for influence and power in the government, as such the rich were relaxed upon by the left so much that even Obama handed a bailout to companies putting the risk of economic failure on the average taxpayer. Even now one third of Americans is working a part time job, despite the current upward trend of companies having full time positions open, because Affirmative Action (another borked democratic centralist and thus Marxist policy) has been given the authority to punish employers for not meeting quotas as if they have a choice as to who applies for the job. Instead we see the local Home Depot is still hiring, it's been over a decade now, they cannot hire anyone because they need a black person. If Affirmative Action were designed by a capitalist it would be written the same way save for one thing, it would not be racist. It would target people by wealth level. Because in a capitalist society you gain wealth when others do and when you don't do funny math or other socialist bullshit in an attempt to control the government. For instance as a business owner when the value of the dollar increases this is good for me as it's good for my workers. This gives them and me more spending power, easing the burdens of their life, making them more likely to spend money, in particular at my businesses. It's when nonsense funny math comes into play and people claim that this causes inflation (it does not but that's a discussion for another time as many people want you to think economics is complex when it's simple, because it's just math). The idea that you cannot prosper by the sweat of your brow doesn't sit well with people who have talent, and since those people have talent they will refuse to work for everyone else at their own expense, that's a raw deal no matter how you look at it. This is why everything in Zeitgeist in particular has not yet come to pass despite claims it would eventually would decades ago. If it could work, it already would have, however no one wants to invent a teleporter to be brushed under the rug because of some shitty ideology's view on what ""equality"" means literally states that you get no personal glory for your own outstanding achievements. Even more so when it does not pay off. No one likes to do shit for others for free, not even you. Don't believe me though, just look at the current most outspoken socialists, they all make money for simply speaking. Anita Sarkeesian spread nonsense about gaming and was paid handsomely for it. She made money doing the same thing that got Jack Thompson laughed off stage. Bernie Sanders who took donations from supporters but made everyone forget that by giving back money from ONE supporter which happened to be a big pharma company. Boogie2988 for saying ""I think they handled it correctly"" when authoritarian measures are used, yet it gets overlooked because he's polite, he even went so far as to say that anyone who plays a card game is in a single community. What? Finally let's not forget to look at how socialists spread misinformation as you have with a popular myth, so popular it's myth #5. Capitalist Myth #5 : Capitalism Is Inherently Exploitative. Economic theory stipulates that all transactions in a free market economy are voluntary, and therefore by definition must be beneficial to both parties. There's more to go into here as well.

Let all the Nordic socialist countries that enjoy USA provided world security while spending their own money on health and welfare for their own citizens fight North Korea. It upsets me that our Army and resources are still being squandered by being in a country for over 60 years. That's ridiculous.  Ever since world war 2 where we were the only big Dick swinging left after the war, we became a nation that took on the mantle of militarization. Now our police are tactical military service member, and we live in a country dominated by militarized police and it connects to North Korea because we decided to be the world police provider. We have treaties with countless countries to protect them from aggressors. We absolutely cannot take on North Korea in a conventional war and nukes would only make all matters worse because countless civilians woul die.

@laxjoh,"+B A S E D SBG SOLDIER that can be true but I doubt that will actually happen. If let's say North Korea got freedom tonight. The regime just goes ""FK THIS I'M LEAVING"" and they all leave for the people to fend for themselves and govern themselves.  No doubt both China/US will want to come in and try to instate their idea of what the government SHOULD be. IF China succeeds, China will have a very VERY strong nationalistic people who identify themselves with and as Chinese. So you would tell people history of Korea and how Koreans were part of Chine before they declared independence. Gain traction for that movement. Even if there's no tension going on between China and US, this is how you essentially secure your borders.  If US gets it, they will have it be just like SK but use much of the new land for military purposes in which case will make China weary and worried. US wants access and power over the Asian region. Now I don't know if that means they want to take over it (I doubt it; no one here has any interest in China except to do business WITH). But it still might trigger very tense situation.  What probably will end up happening is both US and China will argue for what they want, and in the end just have South Korea deal with it alone. In which case you have the potential possibility for a nuclear missile-ready country with high tech military that's VERY nationalistic (South Korea is already very nationalistic. We went the right way of thinking foreign things are exotic rather than disgusting like nazis but that can easily flip flop). South Korea has the technology, science, research and North korea has the resources and nukes. Now, all of a sudden, you have another superpower nation (though as influential as US or China or Russia? Probably not but that's way too many powerful players in the region).   Generally Korean and Japanese relations have been improving but there are still others who are VERY against Japanese people albeit much rarer these days. Judging from how a lunatic president who listens to shamans got the presidency, you could say having a nuclearized Korea could make Japan restless as well.  In this planet that's already suffering too much, having one more player join the nuclear arms table isn't that helpful. That's one more tense situation to defuse every time something serious happens. Also there is a good amount of anti-American sentiment in South Korea too. Not a lot; for the most part we love America but when some things happen it's always causing problems. Neither sides want an independent and nuclear Korea. They prefer to keep it a proxy nation where it's safe. It's also a nation where all men are drafted to the military so they certainly don't want another Israel running around (look how badly Israel turned out; not blaming Israel just the situation).",8년 전,0,

@alext2887,"Ryudenki  catsintexas  Actually the term privileged has a few definitions and refers to quite a few different things.  priv·i·leged ˈpriv(ə)lijd adjective having special rights, advantages, or immunities. ""in the nineteenth century, only a privileged few had the right to vote""  Because, in case you have forgotten, white men in the US were privileged when it came to the right to vote. And then it became both white men and women. And now, in the world, the citizens of the US are privileged when compared to other countries who do not have the right to vote in their extremely oppressive governments.  Food, water, freedom of speech including the right to vote, compensation in exchange for our work. These are basic rights in our countries, but in other countries these are not basic rights, so when you look at us from their point of view, we are privileged when compared to them.  Simply pointing that out does not make one a ""guilt-tripper"".  Pointing out out facts doesn't make you a ""guilt-tripper"" UNLESS that is your intention and especially if you are telling ppl they should feel bad of themselves and/or they should give something up because they're privileged..cough..poposisa..

A powerful establishment can do whatever they want with their nation until an outside party steps in. No outside parties are stepping in on North Korea at this point in time. Kim Jong Un and his establishment could wipe out that entire country in a heartbeat if they wanted to. And to be quite frank, most of the world wouldn't even know it was occurring until it was way to late.",8년 전,0,
@-SUM1-,"Mishro22 Think about what you're saying. What ""establishment""? Where are these people coming from that make up the establishment? They inevitably have to come from or at least be supported by the people they're ruling over, as if they weren't they couldn't exist. ""Kim Jong Un and his establishment"" are inevitably members of the North Korean population, and therefore couldn't ""wipe out"" themselves unless a larger faction of the population was opposed to them. Point is, there is no such thing as a ""dictator"", it is impossible for a state to exist without the support of its people or a foreign power.  Yes, in this respect, it is well known that most Germans under Nazi Germany supported the NSDAP and they are what led to its rise (due to a combination of huge economic crises and a humiliation after the defeat of WWI), and there are clearly enough active members of the Sunni ISIS force to hold territory and population for many years, meaning they do not go unsupported. They are the Sunni faction which opposes US domination and Assad domination. The Islamist ""rebels"" oppose Assad domination but ally with US aid and armed forces. The Kurds are the ethnic Western Iranian component who are also Sunni but are fighting for their ethnic rights, and the Assad family are a Shia power from the Western Shia Alawite Latakia region. They only held power for so long because they did it under the banner of Ba'athism and Arab nationalism, at a time when Ba'athist governments were more widespread and could support each other.  I think you'll find I am very informed about the origins of the Syrian war.",8년 전(수정됨),0,
@Mishro22,"SUM1 The ""establishment"" I am referring to are the plethora of military and governmental support he has surrounded himself with that all benefit directly from his tyranny. You are correct, overall his nation requires the survival of the lowest tier to some extent, but that doesn't stop a sociopath from going crazy. If his low tier attempted a revolt, he would wipe them without a second thought. His grip is secured much more deeply than that of ISIS or Hitler because it has been burying its claws into the country for so many more years than the aforementioned. You could make the argument that Kim Jong Un is significantly more powerful than Hitler ever came close to, and much more than ISIS will ever be. He hasn't created global scale terror like the other two, but his regional grip and control is beyond description.",8년 전,0,
@-SUM1-,"Mishro22 Again, what ""grip"" are you talking about? He didn't decide to be the next head of state of the DPRK nor could he control the millions of people needed nationwide to facilitate him being in his position. That would make no sense. So again, think about what you're saying. It must necessarily be that most people are supporting him and therefore keeping him in his position, worshipping him as a direct bloodline from Kim Il-sung, importantly the founder of the first independent Korea (in the north) after decades of Japanese rule. The Korean peninsula has a history of kingdoms and dynasties. It is a single dominant Korean ethnicity territory. North Korea is no different in that respect from those kingdoms. The main thing makes this different is that there was no head of state for 35 years under Japanese rule, and the Kim family bloodline happens to descend from the guerrilla leader who found his way into the first position of head of state in the north by way of Stalin and the Soviet Union.  So you could say in one respect that people do steadfastly support him and his words and actions as this figurehead and that gives him a so-called ""grip"", but you can't say that he is the one with the ""grip"" in reality, as that wouldn't be further from the truth. It's the larger part of the North Korean people who prop him up.",8년 전,0,

@saranchan9556,"The problem is: you can't do much. The sanctions they did are great to weaken the government, but bad for all people who are living there.   The problem with politicians/organizations like UN is their greed: UN has removed Saudi Arabia (The biggest exporter of jihadists) from the black list, although they're known for breaking shitloads of human rights every year. However, they've got a lot of oil and you see... oil in greedy eyes make you blind.   The West needs reforms. People think it's about being left wing or right wing... and that's wrong. There are many greedy people in the left AND the right. You only can trust some politicians, everybody else is just looking for his/her own benefits. The West has become a place where the rich and pseudo intellectuals can pile up their money, whereas the normal folk (hence almost everybody else) and real intellectuals suffer more and more.",8년 전,0,
