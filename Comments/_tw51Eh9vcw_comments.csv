I could not draw realism no matter how hard I tried and it discouraged me to the point of quitting drawing. In college I discovered the art section of the college library and found the Impressionism books. I saw in them what I saw when I attempted to draw. And from them I learned the most important art lesson no one can teach you- it is okay to draw the way you draw. It doesn't have to be photographic realism. I am indebted to this movement because it gave me permission to keep trying. Now I have a Masters in Studio Art and I teach, and I encourage my art students to create the way they know how to.",3년 전,0,

@leroidethunes3913,"i think there's a lot of similarities between impressionism and chinese shui-mo painting, both are characterised by more or less improvised virtuoso brushstrokes, mostly done alla prima in a moment of sudden inspiration and focusing in capturing the essence of someone/something or a moment, putting less enphasis on depicting things accurately or in a too naturalistic way, sort of like doing more with less, it's more about what scapes the eye and that's what makes them so great in my opinion, one can see and feel more of what the painter was portraying, take Boldini's portraits or Liang Kai's scenes for instance, they perfectly show this, while other, more naturalistic painters just recreate a picture of what they see or set up on their studio leaving nothing to the imagination of the viewer, without any motion or hint as to what's the essence of what's being represented or how unique and impactful observing a moment, a landscape, an animal or a person was to the artist, no signs of improvisation either, at wich point i think a painting becomes more a craft than an artistic endeavor, carefully constructing layers to archieve the desired result, i don't think they're bad paintings at all, they just convey a different experience that i don't think is as pure and unfiltered",4년 전,1,

@jacobl6714,"""Is the absence of rules a good thing?"" The revue asked. I don't think so, because then you just end up with yellow squares, bananas nailed to a wall, tik tok, and the circles over peoples' heads that andreas guy does. I think it's the balance of any one moment in time between chaos and order. That's obviously not a profound thought, nor am I trying to be profound lol I just have noticed that the theme of that comes up rather a lot. The bible, star wars, the morality of a given culture. I think the point that there isn't a correct way to do art is what makes it beautiful. Because there's no correct way to love or hurt or strive. But there sure as shit are a few wrong ways : p  Edited just to mention that someone in comments said they collect photos of art they've seen throughout their lives and that the ones they've kept on their walls the longest are impressionistic. That's absolutely brilliant, sir or madam! If things like that are a collection of memories, we don't remember in photographs and video. We don't have nightmares that stick with us in stunning 8K.

Just like how cubism is sometimes needs an acquired taste, Impressionism can be clunky, hard to depict, and scattered in terms of form and placement. A sunset that has been broken up by the short brush strokes tends, at least to me, ruin the image behind something that just looks like a bunch of colors mushed together. The effect of realism and renaissance is better able to display something for what it is and was, without drowning it in a bunch of strokes and blanted colors.  Artists such as renoir (who still clings to the renaissance way in my opinion and is able to combine the best of two words) and Claude Monet are more skilled to delivering the best of Impressionism in the way it should be, there are other artists that do this as well.

@oksanatulpa7984,I was fond with impessionism in my youth . Studied all the history . It was an ideological battle more than the battle of styles . Most of them were the sons  of rich parents that saw their sons as an lawyer  or a banker  but not as an artist . Most of them found their loves  with  women from the lower social society  that cause the anger  of their parents /what was the reason of the row between the academic and though who call themselves impessionists . The history began with the Mane  not Mone / Who painted as an academian but showed the people the real life and of most of the academian artists . All those woman that were represented as goddess were common  women in real life often just whores or laundresses. But the impression .The row was between those who lead the rules and who ruined them . Most of them were starving all their life / But now as for me the classical school tecnicaly is more prefered,5년 전,0,

Also presents many others less central strands to the impressionist artistic approach, and the addition of the importance of the development of photography at the same time was a valued perspective (also note the recent special exhibition of Photography-Impressionists at the Thyssen-Bournemisza in Madrid in 2019).

It's an important shift towards the world we live in today and a sig of the huge changes happening. It's ironic how the people at the time criticized impressionism for not being historic, they were too ignorant to see that this in fact was a core part of impressionism, they were recording history in the making and they recorded both the feelings and events of the time.

@AtheistPalkuKirataTurkMongol,"Impressionists are real artists. My definition of artist is completely different. To me artists are them who contribute to the art i.e. the innovative techniques, newness for better. The word is clearly different from artisan. The latter is a skilled person in a particular skill, in this case art. By definition an artisan is not innovative; he or she is trained in a particular way to think, act in a particular way. He or she may be innovative, but for the innovation we will call him or her an artist, not an artisan; and definitely he or she is no more the artisan of the previous skill, because he or she feels for innovation due to there's either subtle or violent opposition to the conventional approach inside him or her, but conventional school will not allow him to do so. Classicists are artisans in this case. You see my profile pic, that is my self sketch from mind; 1inch by 1.5 inch. I have been a drawer since my childhood, but it is reading about the Impressionists that has made me to take up paints at this age of 25. An artist I can be or not, apart from the contributions you have mentioned, isn't it one of the greatest of them- inspiring thousands like me to take up paints.",5년 전,1,

THE CASE FOR RENOIR- Which Impressionists thought women, children and family life were worthy subjects for art? Cassatt, Morisot and Renoir. In fact (and please correct me if I'm wrong) I am hard-pressed to think of any male artists, in any age, who celebrated domestic life, or who seemed to actually like women and children like Renoir did. I'm a wife and mother - There are many other facets to me, but my family and domestic life are very important to me and take up a large proportion of my time, yet I rarely see them explored in art. Some of the Victorians did so, but in a very maudlin, overly sentimental way. Other children in art are royalty. Some of the other Impressionists painted real women, but they were either part of the landscape (Monet), modern goddesses (Manet) or exercises in the most magnificent draftsmanship (Degas). Only the three artists above feel relatable to my family and, of those, only Renoir is a man - and for that reason I make a case for Renoir.",5년 전,1,

The Hausemenization of Paris made the city ""safer"" sure for the rising bourgeois class, however many where forced from their homes when the city was torn down. Shopping districts and large boulevards where put in place at the cost of those who used to live in the city. One could argue that the impressionist captured the alienation of quick moving modernity. Many of the women depicted were working women, meaning prostitutes, though as a modern viewer we don't pick up on the signals. Manet's magnum opus, Bar at the Folies-Bergière is a prime example. They were depicting the rapid modernization of Paris as well as the French country side, but not just it's joys, also it's tragedies.",5년 전,1,

@sheepinaspaceship,"i was so happy to see this video in my sub box! I don't know much about art, but I've always loved impressionist paintings because they really capture the vibe, or the atmosphere or the moment, and that's something really hard to capture, even with the best cameras we have today. Great video :)",5년 전,6,

@peterjgeraghty, @monkiram  One of the reasons that some artists choose to remind you of unpleasant things in the world is because they hope you may be motivated to do something about them.,4년 전,5,
@Lunch_Meat," @monkiram  I think you may be misunderstanding the issue that people have with ""aesthetic"" work. Beauty is important to all art and a great artist can even make the uncomfortable beautiful in its own way. A way that represents something and has meaning. The argument against work that is just aesthetically please and doesn't reach into anything deeper is that those kinds of works aren't ""art"" necessarily, but simply a design to be bought and sold because pretty colors. Now, it's important to remember that a return to beauty is itself a form of meaning, kinda like beauty for beauties sake. The reason this is different from just another pretty picture is because it calls us to remember that beauty exists, rather than just giving us something shiny to look at",4년 전,9,
