For disconnections(Coop vs AI has only 5 players which is your whole team, and this doesn't give a good amount of IP), the technique is for everyone to quit, making the match to be disabled.

Each shout caster knows the names, skills, general strategies and other information about the game they are working with. Each has the people skills to be able to effectively communicate what is going on during the game to thousands of viewers. And each obviously had enough skill and social skills to be hired to be some of the faces of the gaming community. In my opinion they are highly qualified for the positions they hold.
