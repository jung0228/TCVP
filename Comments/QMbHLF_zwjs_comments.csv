@turalmirzaliev1232,"Zoos have research programs that help expand our knowledge about animals, especially the endangered species. The information gained by these programs can help protect, and treat the species in the wild, as well as determine what affects if any climate change may have on the regions needed for the species to flourish. Many zoos also have breeding programs for all kinds of species, endangered or not, and learn even more about the species during the breeding, and rearing process. All this knowledge and information is shared with visitors, organizations, and other programs alike. There are certainly zoos that do nothing but display animals, but so many have broadened their exhibit goals, and expanded their species scope of responsibility, that each zoo really needs to be judged on it's own merits.  Zoos should not be banned because they help endangered species, give people experiences of a life time and they is a hole lot more reasons and I could goon for ages but I won't.

@c.d.dailey8013,"Oh no! I am shocked and appalled. This is horrifying in terms of animal welfare. I just watched Meg 2 in movie theaters. The beggining of the movie depics a megladon shatk in a tank. It escapes shortly afterward. I think that is a bad idea. Sharks seem too active to do well in captivity. The closest real life parrellel is having a great white shark in captivity. I was curious on how that would work. This video confirmed my suspicians. It even shows that things are even worse than I thought.  One good parellel to the great white shark is the orca. They have a lot of superficial similarities. They do look very similar. They have the same basic lifestyle. Both are apex predators. Both are crusers in the open ocean. I Googled both animals. I found that both have phenominal endurance. They swim tens of miles every day. This video even shows specific animals in the diet in a great white shark. The adult diet has stuff that an orca would totally eat. There is a big diffence in terms classification though. Sharks belong in a primitive offshoot of vertibrites. This group is called chrondoicthys. This group also has rays and ratfish. Orcas are mammals instead. They are also very intellegent and social. These features make orcas similar to humans. So some anthropomorphizing of orcas is appropriate. It is cool that such distantly related animals can seem so similar. This is called convergent evolution. It blows my mind. My favorite example is actually sharks, dolphins and icthosaurs. Orcas fit in there too. They are essentially giant dolphins that have become apex predaters. Ray finned fish have thier own versions, which are tuna and swordfish.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@jygergruz9562," @nazru8  great whites are ram ventilators, meaning they need a constant stream of water to be alive as well as being constantly swimming. Most attempts for the great white put them in reef tanks and tanks with lower flow and less space. The Monterey bay managed to keep one for almost 200 days because of their open ocean tank, having a circular design allowing for constant swimming, high flow, and their were bubble generators below to keep the water highly oxygenated",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Those who have devoted their life to study marine biology should be at the forefront of protecting this ethical boundary instead of being the ones putting them in aquariums and theme parks with the excuse to study them. And on that note, same goes  for dolphins and whales. Stop eating octopus and squid, there is tuna and many other alternatives.

My response to that is, first of all, If you feel like white sharks face a significant threats out in the wild, they why do you torture them and put them in little cages, that's basically prison.  Second of all, there are way to do that that will first of all put more of an effect on people AND it will not torture the sharks, it is putting humans in cages underwater so they can face the sharks up close and personal, it is already somewhat common.",3년 전,0,

@dragongirl89115,"Actually, zoos were originally from the collections of the rich, who had a myriad of exotic animals either purchased or given to them as gifts. Some of them decided to start charging for folks to come see their collections of animals. Only later on would zoos start to focus more on research, rehab, and education. This doesn't mean zoos are without their problems. The majority of zoos are private, roadside entertainment venues owned by people who have no experience caring for animals. Not only that, but studies have shown that even the best of zoos don't contribute to the global protection of animals as much as they would like to brag. Much of the research has to do with how to keep the animals alive in captivity, the majority of the animals cannot be released into the wild, and many zoos still source their animals from the wild through cruel and inhumane methods.   Just seeing an animal doesn't mean you someone become educated by it, or even inspired to do something for those animals. Most people go to a zoo or aquarium for a fun day out. It's entertainment.",3년 전,0,

@hoppytoad79,"Reputable zoos work toward the conservation and protection of species and education of the public. For the animals, the focus is on providing nutritionally-balanced diets that meet their needs; enrichment to keep them mentally and physically stimulated and occupied; meeting their social needs; enclosures that resemble their natural habitats while also allowing visitors an opportunity to view them (and places to hide from visitors if/when they want to). The days of concrete and steel bars and the mindset of the zoo as entertainment are in the past.  Zoos are modern Noah's Arks, serving as ports in a storm for so many species. The habitats of thousands of species have been encroached on to the point that there's very limited space for the animals that are in the wild, never mind the ones in zoos, and wild numbers are declining alarmingly, and the threat of poaching is a threat to species around the world. There are more tigers in captivity (zoos and others) than there are in the wild. U.S. zoos that belong to the American Zoo and Aquarium Ass'n (AZA) have many programs in place for population and species management to increase populations of threatened and endangered species--I've assisted with the Wyoming Toad breeding program. The AZA also tightly controls (with the animals it's possible to control reproduction with, like the big cats) what animals are giving birth and when, so every baby born will have a home to go to.",3년 전,8,

Awesome they were able to add them to the aquarium, a lot of commenters seem to be missing the point of the project in the first place which is to help change the public perception of sharks. The aquarium made sure to pick babies that wouldn’t be heavily effected, took in babies from fisherman that likely needed aftercare from being caught anyways, and stopped the program after one died. People are either terrified or fascinated by sharks, so having them in an aquarium where they can be safely viewed by the public, and if they took in injured sharks and gave them a safe haven to recover, I think that would be a win for all. I wonder how the shark would do in an outside tank, similar to but a lot bigger than the transport tank.",4년 전,1,

Stopping that is like stopping a human from moving out of his\her hometown and into the world as an adult 🌎 life is to be lived without boundaries and restraints in doing daily routines. Can’t be a apex predator if you’re in a cage. Millions of years to be designed a certain way for this planet. Only to be detained as a test subject and experiment for the millennia. I always wanted to see a great white in a shark aquarium tank. But even humans can’t control everything. And I will always understand if I never do. Catching a sight of one in the ocean tho.

I don’t think it is a bad idea to try to find a way that is healthy and safe to keep a great white shark in captivity for many reasons. But the facts may be that there just isn’t a way to make it healthy or safe.

But by seeing a great white shark in captivity,and showcasing the things that make it such a unique creature, it could have been an effort to introduce sharks as peaceful creatures to a general audience. If more people could see these magnificent creatures as more than bloodthirsty killers, then more people would care about poachers driving the species to extinction.

But for species that are able to thrive in captivity, why is it such a bad thing to have a place where the public can easily see and learn about them? Idk about all aquariums (and zoos for that matter) but the ones I’ve been to have all been huge advocates of environmentalism.  Vancouver aquarium, for example, had two (maybe three?) rescue dolphins who had sustained injuries living in the open ocean that would eventually have killed them if they had remained (e.g. a missing flipper). They only kept the ones that wouldn’t survive and released the ones that could after treating them. Vancouver aquarium also has their Ocean Wise program, which basically works towards sustainable seafood practices (I’m not the best at describing stuff so it’s probably better you look that up yourself for a good description).

In the late 18 to early 1900’s, there were a number of humans kept in “museums.” I’m not talking sideshows, or freak shows. No, not that. There were people like Ota Benga kept alive in mainstream places like the Bronx Zoo, held there as if they were animals to be observed. His story is terrifying, but there are others as well.   To come out and say that all aquariums and zoos treat animals unfairly or poorly is not only overlooking the stories of people like Ota Benga, but it’s also ignoring the fact that a majority of these institutions have vast conservation programs, veterinary programs, and research labs to protect these species. A lot of animals kept in these institutions may not be able to survive in the wild, and to research them on a daily basis on a close scale can actually improve our knowledge of the species and aid in conservation efforts beyond the tank.   Yes, of course there are issues with captivity.

@dragongirl89115,"Of course there is no true good or true evil when it comes to zoo's and aquariums, but that doesn't mean they can't improve. There is a lot of questionability about how much people actually learn from these facilities, especially since the higher quality zoos and aquariums are the minority. Most facilities are small, private, roadside zoos with at best questionable ethics and the treatment of their animals. Even in the high quality zoos information might be old, outdated, or simply not read. Studies have shown that the average zoo visitor spends less than a minute observing a display, even with the most popular animals like elephants. Some facilities even missinform the public, skewing data in order to make captivity seem more appealing. For example, SeaWorld has missinformed the public for decades about the lifespan of Orca, insisting that it was 25-30 years. Similarly, many facilities will try to downplay the average lifespan of Belugas and bottlenose dolphins, making it appear that they live as long in captivity as they do in the wild.   And yes, while many zoos and aquariums have breeding and conservation programs, studies have found that when compared to the profit these facilities make, their efforts fall quite short. An observation of the Vancouver Aquarius conservation budge saw a continual decrease in the late 2000's.Then there is the breeding of animals that, by the own word of zoos and aquariums, cannot be released into the wild. Polar Bears, Elephants, Orca, Tigers and Lions are just a few of the many animal species that are bred that have no conservation value.  The problem with zoos and aquariums comes from the fact that they are holding living, breathing, thinking, feeling creatures in spaces often far too small for them and without enough mental stimulation. t would be nice to see these facilities stop breeding the animals that cannot be released and start focusing more on their actual conservation efforts and local problems. A person doesn't need to have a tiger pacing in front of them in order to appreciate them either. The technology we have today can bring people close to animals without taking them out of their natural environment, and can give people a better idea of what these animals are actually like, vs the unnatural behaviors they'll see in a zoo or aquarium.",4년 전,1,

Again “dangerous” in this context is towards individual humans. I totally agree that there isn’t any species more dangerous than humans on this planet, but that doesn’t make me any less worried if I find myself in the middle of African jungles.  OP was making a smart comment, it makes people think, which is good, but the logic doesn’t work if taken seriously.",3년 전,4,

@goten339," @Amy_the_Lizard  There's obviously a world of difference between dogs and white sharks though. Domesticated animals have gone through literally thousands of years of human-controlled selective breeding to make them better suited to being domesticated, making them friendlier and often smaller, more docile and easier to tame. Even less intensely breed creatures that we have as pets like various lizards and birds are smaller and easier to take care of, yet a lot can go wrong with them too. In fact essentially all domesticated creatures can still massively suffer mental and physical issues from improper care. The only exception probably being like, insects. So imagine trying to adapt a great white shark, even a relatively small or young one, to living in captivity in a small environment, after being corralled and transported which is often a hugely stressful thing for them. The whole process is an absolute nightmare for those sharks, they're massive, incredibly powerful creatures, it would take centuries of breeding to get them anywhere near naturally ready to live in such small, controlled environment, by then they'd have to be much dumber and docile, it really isn't worth it.",4년 전,96,

Great white Sharks are creatures that need the open ocean, and after several attempts the aquarium stopped the program that was leading to the deaths of these animals. The whole point of doing it in the first place was so that the public could see what amazing animals they are, since their is still a deep general fear of sharks in the public, especially great whites, which has directly contributed to their declining numbers.

Sadly, that just isn’t plausible for some animals. Many, many animals do amazingly in captivity because there are many less hazards, and because their habitats and diets are easier to recreate. Great White Sharks just don’t have a habitat that we can recreate in captivity. People are now, instead of keeping them in captivity and killing them, tracking them in the wild instead.

@browdser,"While the sentiment of these comments is really admirable there is a scary amount of misinformation being spread. Everyone needs to remain wary of zoos and aquariums that take poor care of their animals and exhibit animal cruelty. These places are becoming less common in developed countries and they are normally smaller family run businesses, hobby farms, tourist trap amusement parks. However! There are still many zoos and aquariums that adhere to strict standards and employ only professionals who care about each animal's comfort and happiness deeply. And you cannot turn your back on them because these places are some of the few organisations that make real difference in conservation. These places bring animals back from the brink of extinction with rehabilitation, breeding programs, and releasing and monitoring new populations back into the wild. They also put big money and resources behind environmentalist legislation and habitat protection.  A lot of these comments also really discount the value of learning about these animals first hand. ""I don't need to see a great white. let it be free!"" While yes I agree that I hope aquariums stop trying with great whites, since it's clearly not going to work, you're really not seeing the big picture when you villainize these researchers. 100 million sharks are killed each year and the only way to stop that is to spread awareness, change public perception so that laws and fishing practices can change. Monteray Bay Aquarium kept 6 great whites since 2004 and while this video focused on the one that died the others were released back into the wild alive, and each monitored for a month. MB Aquarium also allows approximately 75,000 students a year to explore the aquarium for free. The movie Jaws did irreparable damage to the public perception of sharks resulting in decades of culling across the world and it really is vitally important that people see 'scary animals' in real life and appreciate for themselves how beautiful and special they are, so that they will put their support behind the fight for their futures.",5년 전,1,

It seems like people won't stop capturing these sharks, so even if you don't think we should put them on display, it is probably a good idea to research how we can extend their lives in captivity.  I agree that at the time being it is cruel and wasteful to keep these sharks in aquariums to entertain the public, but we can't make any progress without research and it doesn't seem like people will stop demanding that these sharks eventually be put into aquariums for long time periods.  We should do more research and see if it is possible, at least so we can prove that they absolutely can't live in tanks for long periods when people complain about it, (even though there is lots of evidence as to why they can't live in tanks already, some people will not be satisfied until more comes out).",5년 전,0,

It was a success because every other shark died within the week, this made it to 6 months which was amazing for any researcher that wanted to get up close and personal.

These animals act mostly based of instincts, which they formed over long periods of evolution and which are specific tight to their habitat.  it's not unusual that an animal forms depression when it cannot fulfill its instincts and their sense.   Huge changes in their environment, like when their are captured and brought to inappropriate cages they have huge problems if their actions based on instincts doesn't work the way they used to do.  And their are other examples of animals suffering under these circumstances.

We will have to deploy an extremely efficient and fast RC decoy which the shark would chase and eventually come close to the viewing bay so the spectators would catch the action. This could happen at feeding time twice or thrice in a day randomly and at the time when spectators know the time. At these times when the shark is at its tail, the decoy would release a live fish right before zooming into its garage beside the viewing bay. The decoy could also be good entertainment and exercise tool for the shark.   also, the glass window will have effective signalling flashes to discourage the shark to bump into the glass and get injured. missed anything?",5년 전,0,

Even when it was a part of ancient history and its civilizations, save for the Romans and their seldom purchases and sales of slaves, it wasn't always documented and, even then, slaves and their relations were sometimes able to be kings or emperors of Rome.

I guess it explains why they’re basically always on the move, and probably why people are scared of them, because it constantly looks like they’re searching for something when in reality it could just be them trying to live and use their gills.

Note that I do condemn zoos with inadequate enclosures (worked in one before and it was heartbreaking) and private people having exotic pets (especially tigers and bears etc)  So all in all I do prefer animals living in the wild, but as long as they have the space I think zoos are not too bad.",5년 전,56,

@embri.o,"to people saying ""stop imprisoning living creatures for human entertainment"":   aquariums actually benefit most animals since the monitored environments aren't polluted like the natural environments of these creatures. the pollution that the human race has stressed upon the earth's sea won't be reversed any time soon, so putting the creatures in aquariums protects them from the hazards of pollution in their natural habitat. not only that but there is a less risk of them going extinct because (1) they don't have to experience the threat on invasive species killing them off in their natural habitat and (2) humans can't over-hunt or over-fish. yes the aquariums do entertain humans but they also in turn benefit the animals. i completely agree that animals and living creatures deserve freedom and shouldn't be treated as slaves to entertain humans, but in this case, aquariums and conservation programs protect these creatures rather enslave while in turn giving humans the joy of observing the various life forms around us.  AND YEA OF COURSE, if aquariums are harmful to creatures such as the great white then um I HIGHLY recommend KEEPING them in their natural habitat.  **edit: take this with a grain of salt, lol im 15, what do i know about this kinda stuff? this is just my opinion from an outside perspective but correct me if im wrong about anything or drop some knowledge in the replies, i have nothing against learning  more :)",6년 전(수정됨),55,

I know that there are people who own large plots of fenced off land with wildlife that they hunt and also feed and monitor the population levels.  people who hunt deer in their literal backyard, and carefully maintain the population.  why can't we do that for sharks?  not to hunt but if anything to build up the population, and maybe even release them into the wild as needed, with admission fees supporting the whole operation?

If you want to see a wild animal you can watch documentaries or see them out in nature. Using animal cruelty under the guise of education and/or entertainment is wrong. I went to an aquarium once, and couldn't help but feel sorry for all the poor creatures. They don't deserve that.

@bigblue207,I mean I agree sharks like this shouldn't be kept in tiny tanks but I think people are missing the intention of them even trying was to have a safe way for the public to observe them and see how amazing they are. The best way would obviously probably be some conservation where they remain in their open habitat and people are controlled and welcome to view them but then it gets hard to know when the shark will be there and the purpose is defeated. The only real way right now I would guess is to get scuba certified and go to the sharks themselves but how many people will be willing to spend that kind of money or feel that kind of risk. For now we just have to be happy with the really well done gopro videos and the like of people recording these sharks even though there's no way such recordings do justice to it.,6년 전,0,

@adriannaa545," @Lillukkainen  it's explicitly said in the video. Sharks like the nursing shark, tiger, and even lemon sharks etc, can be put into captivity becuase they tend to have typical migration patterns along coastal areas, meaning it's easier to simulate their living environments (even the whale shark, but those also tend to stay in very shallow, heated waters). However, mako, Great White, and Hammer head sharks, all swim openly out at sea with the ability to travel as they please. You can't replicate those conditions in any tank, and even if the tank is suitable enough, the shark will not be able to stay confined with becoming literally depressed, and dieing.",5년 전,6,

@hi-pk9wr,"comment section: HERP DE DERP, PETA WAS RIGHT, SHARKS DON'T DESERVE THIS LET'S KEEP THEM IN THE WILD UWU, YEET  Sharks are already in danger. To keep them alive, we need to breed them in captivity. How do we breed them in captivity, you ask. We need to find out how to keep them in captivity without them killing themselves within a few days. How do we do that, you ask. HMM, MAYBE WE SHOULD >TEST< IT OUT. Scientists test it out, unfortunately a few sharks die because THAT IS THE PROCESS OF LEARNING HOW TO KEEP AN ANIMAL IN CAPTIVITY, WE AREN'T PERFECT, INTELLECTUAL PEOPLE. EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE A CONFIRMED METHOD. You scream, ""OH MY GOD, I'M SMARTER THAN THEM, LET'S JUST KEEP THEM IN THE OCEAN SO THEY >DIE< IN THE WILD! I tell you this. You scream, ""OH MY GOD, JUST TEACH HUMANS TO BE BETTER THEN!"" Humans have free will. They won't change from being evil. Evil is something that has been in our world forever. We can't control people. You just need to accept that.  TL;DR: Sharks are in danger, we need to learn how to breed them in captivity. We need to learn how to keep them in captivity, and make mistakes. We can't teach humans to be better people, and we need to focus on having the good people learn to save the sharks in captivity instead of leave them to die in the wild.",6년 전,0,

@HighLordBlazeReborn,"A lot of people in this comments section are trying their best to virtue signal without even understanding the issue here. No, it's not enough to just 'leave them where they are'.  How do you think conservation science works? That we rock up to an endangered animal one day and put it into a reserve and that's that? It takes years, sometimes decades of research to understand how to keep a wild animal in captivity, alive, healthy and breeding. Predatory fish are killed on sight by fishermen and others to protect their hauls or themselves- great whites themselves are on the threatened list now. If they dwindle to near-extinction, how exactly do you idiots propose we breed them in captivity if no one knows how to keep them alive?  Second, it IS important people see animals and organisms that they otherwise couldn't. Not everyone has the money to pay for a trip of the ocean to see ocean fauna in their natural habitat. The more people lose the ability to relate to an animal, the less the public and policymakers will care about keeping these species from going extinct. Not to mention we'd be raising an entire generation of kids with no awareness of these creatures besides stuff they see in books or on TV/the internet. There are zoos and aquariums with horrible records, piss poor conditions and a complete lack of scientists among the staff, but to assume every zoo and aquarium is like that tells me maybe you should visit a proper one before you go rushing into conclusions.  So while you lot try and out-PETA each other here, spare a thought that what's going on may be beyond your elementary school-level understanding of the world.",6년 전,3,

@nameprivate4287,the outsider no dear that's why the we sanctuaries  ! Zoo are for profit . I have seen for myself . At the OMAHA ZOO in Nebraska I saw beautiful wild cats pacing back and forth in small cages with nothing natural but cement around them. They were zoned out like  any human would be trapped for a long time. They were deeply suffering  psychologically and broken. It was the saddest thing I have ever seen and from that day I have been against zoos !! A sanctuary allows animals to run free in a natural environment with others of its kind. A zoo confines them and does it for show and profit. Big difference !,6년 전,1,
@BoneViolyn," @nameprivate4287   well true, but not all zoos are like that, and this thing with sharks is a rescue  because  these kinds of sharks are really going extinct. but a lot low budget zoos are low  quality bad but zoos in New York and do mean zoos because  its says it titled o. A sign look very humane I seen the. Happy and also in the video it's clear that that this place is TRYING  to do its best  for the shark. The reason  why it's a ""show"" because  if you gonna save it why not let people view it as well and make some money. It makes sense  in order to supply  there needs. And bad zoos are just  poor and usually  get shut down. I understand  where you are coming  from but people seem to have a bias against  zoos that aren't all true.",6년 전,2,

But people get judgmental  to fast when it comes to these things, I use to think the same but with  a little research it's clear there is always more to the story.",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@BoneViolyn," @nameprivate4287  and  I also, heard of zoos being nasty and sad because  people  stopped coming, but once more people   did come, more food, and bigger  enclosures are the first things. I seen  upgraded. But there seems to be a lot misconceptions about  zoos. They always have to beg people  to come back trying to tell those, overly emotional, but understandable peope that in order for for  them to take care of the animals  they need them to visit and they aren't  lying  because  they actually  do maintenance  when money is given. But when one person's only visits  ONE ZOO  they say  "" ugh all zoos are bad ugh I hate zoos""  not know the entire point of the show is to provide  for the zoo why a show? It's easier to make money and it makes the most sense. I understand  if you don't  wanna see it I really  understand  that. But please understand  why its like that in the first  place and there hard to take care. of and isn't  your. Normal  house pet. and its heart breaking  to see them like that and sad to those conditions. But they do try, and it shows not all the time but some of the time.

Sharks, being apex predators, are extremely sensitive and when they're in captivity their environment is so abnormal that it causes extreme stress which takes a heavy and severe physiological toll on their bodies, which would eventually lead to organ complications ultimately resulting in their deaths.  Surely when they capture them they would implant body monitoring devices that would give them this information.  The answer to this issue is leave them alone.

@TheTonyMcD,"I wonder, what if they were to use very high powered pumps around the edges of a tank. I don't think they would be able to get the water to move inwards toward the center of the tank, as you could only place the pumps on the top or bottom. Placing them directly on the side of a tank would essentially prevent it from being viewable.   But if they placed strong pumps all around the top of the tank, I wonder if the shark could learn. If the entire tank was glass, and looked essentially like endless ocean, I wonder if it could work. That would give the shark a pseudo feeling of freedom, and sense of comfort. And he might be able to learn the ques from being forced downward when he reaches the side.   I have no idea if this would work or not, it is just a thought. Also, I wonder if they have ever tried to raise a White Shark in a tank environment from birth. That definitely has its own completely new challenges. But if they can keep a small yearling for 6 months, perhaps they could improve and bring in a pregnant shark about to give birth. As soon as she does, remove the mother and any other offspring from the tank.  Sharks don't rear their young, so the babies are largely living off instinct. That seems to not be a great indicator of success, but it also means that they don't have to keep both a baby and a mother alive together.",7년 전,0,

@spellwing777,"Granted, I can see y'all point saying it's kinda cruel and detrimental to keep killing these increasingly rare animals trying to keep them, but there's a reason behind the madness.  First, research. It's a lot easier to study an animal in captivity, as you have 24 hr access that's not hampered by weather, hazards, or...not being able to find a freaking shark (big ocean you know).  Two, conservation. Yes, it sounds ass backwards killing an animal to save it, but they were trying to see if they could keep a shark in a secure location, safe from illegal fishing where-maybe-they could breed it.    It's a pity they weren't able to keep it though. Perhaps in the future we'll figure out a better solution that'll help further these goals. For now, hope we can save the enviroment it's living in and crack down on the fin trade.",7년 전,0,

I believe they have an ability to find ocean currents that they can have run through their gills while their bodies movement is drastically reduced.During this time they sleep. All animals sleep. Maybe not like mammals but certainly on some level. They need to build a tank that mimics natural swift running ocean currents. Maybe with special contours on the floor so the animal can rest.,7년 전,0,

It's fascinating. But human fascination isn't a good reason to keep capturing and killing animals. That's like a little kid who hurts the pet cat because it's curious about cats. I know that more sharks are killed by fishing trawlers, for food, or in shark culls than in any of these aquariums, but it's still unnecessary (and so are those other things). Scientific curiosity and research is one thing, and I'm glad that these attempts at least lead to more knowledge and understanding about these sharks, but they just don't belong up here, on land, in a tank inside a building, bumping into walls getting distressed while people gawk.

@TheThanatos34,"I was there at the MBA as a student guide during 2004 when they were displaying the White. Vox is missing a key component of why Great Whites in particular are so damn hard to keep alive in captivity, as opposed to say, hammerheads, another deep sea shark that while difficult, is kept alive quite frequently. Great Whites hunt with a finely tuned system that sends out some sort of pulse into the environment. Great whites kept detecting the generator that was being used in exhibits such as the Outer Bay, (where they kept the one they finally got to work), and it was literally sending the sharks into seizures. It's why the MBA gave up on keeping whites, it was simply too hard to adjust everything in the environment for them. Plus, ofc, the one they had in 2004 tore into a tuna also in the exhibit right in front of a guide explaining how these creatures are so misunderstood, lol.",7년 전,0,

But not all zoos do that, and some may be even tryna save a few sharks, except.. they're not succeeding. Also, how would we know what we know about the sharks if there was no zoo? Sure, wildlife studies can be conducted, but they can often be a little misleading in regards to the situations. Also, we don't know what the shark was thinking (and we never will), and we don't know if the shark wanted it or not. And if the sharks die... then they die.

@MrLagzy,"​ @Ghettojaku  On average, about 6,500 people die on an hourly basis - for any reason. We aren't extinct yet.. And if we were to go extinct based solely on deaths per hour and no new children were born, it would take about 132 years before we went extinct.  But the hourly birth rate is ~15.000. Almost 3 times the number of deaths we have an hour - meaning that in ~58 years we should be about 15 billion people. This isn't incorporating all factors that we know of, of course but given this, it's easy to extrapolate from this line of thinking to sharks.   Sharks don't breed as much as we do - but they do breed - and there is no certain estimate of how many sharks are in the ocean, but I would estimate myself that there is at least several billion sharks across all shark species. If we estimate that in 1950 there were 10 billion sharks across all species and they bred at a quarter of the speed of humans, meaning they would make an additional 5k every hour.  If we take the IFLS estimate of 11,5k shark killings an hour the number would decline by 6,5k every hour. How long would it take for it to go extinct? More than 175 years. Someone could easily do better math than I could and probably some time in the future scientists can more easily make estimates of how many sharks are alive in the world.  Basically what I am saying is that Sharks exists today and a lot are being killed in the name of Shark Fin Soup and you sir(or madam?) should be ashamed of yourself.",6년 전,0,

@willcampbell3129,"Great white sharks have senses and abilities that humans and a lot of sharks don't have. These abilties help the shark hunt and well... Navigate the ocean because that's what great whites do. They travel. They travel for miles upon miles. They go to mating areas and  hunting areas generally staying near the coast but not in a shallow reef area altho they can travel as shallow as they are tall from stomach to back. The reason they don't generaly hang in these shallow areas is because there hunting tactics is to attack something from above from a great length below using the vertical distance to gain speed. So there hunting abilities really on a large area of vertical room. Us humans have are basic 5 senses that everybody talks about. Sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell. But imagine if we spent all our life in a world completely differant. Where our form of seeing was murky and to eat we had to find our food in a one colored sea with a lot of that food being colored like the ocean or rocks. Well the sight thing won't get you too far. So ovecorce we would need to fall back on those other senses. While sharks do have sight they have a multitude of other abilitys that are very useful. Have you ever heard the saying ""a shark can smell a drop of blood from a mile away""? Well that may be an exaduration to some extent but it is true that sharks are very good at finding blood and injured fish that are easy pray. Great white sharks also have the ability to sence magnetic fields. Thats why magnetic shark repelants works. They can feel very very slight activities in the water that can tell them where activity is. And these are only the  surface of all shark abilities. But when you put all this together you have a shark that has a map of the ocean and what is happening around the ocean in the white sharks head. This is how they are able to travel all over and still find breeding and feeding areas. That's what makes this shark so amazing. Some sharks hang out in the reafs. Some sharks near shores feeding on fish and birds that fly near the water. Some behemoth sharks swim in the depths of the ocean feeding on large amounts of plankton and other small sea life. Some even live in the deepest places amagionable under great amounts of pressure and heat. Some live on the bottom of the sea, on top of rocks, blending in with sea bed until a fish swims over it. Some, like the great white, travel long distances as do some forms of the hammerhead but they travel in schools that are formed a lot like the geese we see on land. But the great white has no bounderies or limits the thing about the great white. Its a lone adventurer that goes anywhere it wants when it wants to. One shark could travel all over the world by themselves. That's why they have all these abilities because that's just how they work and live. So when you take one and put it in a tank its like doing the following to a human. Imagine if you were just walking down the street and all of a sudden your blind, deaf, and have almost no senses at all the ones you do still have tell you you've been put in a completely new environment. Even the air your breathing has been changed and feels differant. So you try to move. Nomater what way you go you always bump into a wall within a few feet. You don't know how to eat anymore. And Ofcorce there's no one there to teach you! There's food present but you can't eat it because the old way you ate food doesn't work anymore. You had no warning you just were there. Had all your world suddenly disappear. How long do you think you would survive?",7년 전,1,

Also you must understand that some species will die out, it's the natural order of things.

@bamarshmallow1,"by making an aquarium seperated from outside water sources you are able to elimenate natural disasters such as red tide or el nino. as red tide is extremely poisinous to over 75% of all aquatic life, and rapid heating or cooling of the waters near that region can also kill thousands of fish. even if you seperated the waters with glass it would still take 5-10 times for power to keep the water at the proper temperature than to just seperate it completely.",7년 전,4,

@bamarshmallow1,"@Hank Hodges, we dont just put the animals up for display for people to gawk at. The aquariums usually have influences from colleges and think tanks that help fund the expeditions so that they can study the creatures and figure out how they live their lives.  By being able to observe 1 or 2 of them for a couple of years we may be able to figure out how sharks and whales are able to combat issues like cancer and slow and eventually get rid of it. If we can figure out how they do it then we stand a chance of finding a cure ourselves, while also being able to cure the creatures as well in the mean time. These places invest 3-4 million dollars just to get one shark into the tank not to mention the construction price for the exhibit and the tank, crew, specialists. But they may only see 100k return from admission fees to the park. We dont bring them in just to make money, and even an idiot can tell you thats a horrible investment.

That Great White was dying and they knew it, the video said they stop eating and constantly need meds.Thankfully, I really believe that every generation is born more physically mentally and spiritually evolved and I am convinced our children and grandchildren will be the very last ones to even recall their elders literally stealing these creatures from their rightful home aware they are to be entombed in a glass literally watching them go from scared and seriously confused to insane and yep,dangerous. These treasures were never not dangerous,but it is man and man only that bears the heavy responsibility that literally created the ""shows"",the caging and ""entertaining"" all of the masses using intelligent and innocent marine life agaisnt their will in an absolutely inhospitable land shaped like,whatever we think they will like!Right? sorry for length didnt realize that even upset me so deeply ,but did we not already know this?

His girlfriend on the other hand, if she wasn't comfortable being there she shouldn't have gone. I know animals are wild and dangerous.

@ixlivesofficial8019,"@Strawberry Flavored Clorox Bleach | Listen, I'm gonna give you why you, sir, can't kill them. It's called a food chain. You kill the animal at the top (which in 2 thirds of the ocean is a shark), say A, the creature below it, say B, has a population boom. Because of which, the prey of B, say C, is eaten into oblivion. Because of which B will no longer have food, i.e. it will too die. Basically, you remove a shark, lion, wolf, or any other apex predator, and the ecology goes to hell.   Why do the other animals matter??? Say the fish at the bottom of the food chain goes extinct. The algae or plankton or zooplankton it fed on, would boom. Green plant infested slimy beaches.  We have no idea how, or whether if, the ocean can deal with the extinction of sharks. Considering sharks take a long time to grow and reproduce. Making them go extinct is much easier (though not easy) than you think. And that, sir, is why you can't kill a species off. Any species! Be it mosquitoes, sharks, or rodents.   Check this video.

@z_.5557,"Just to add to my previous comment, those people who says that humans shouldn't have existed are clearly hypocrites right when they mentioned their own race. Humans.  First of all, what is the size of your brain? A pingpong ball? Probably. Because you never noticed the more wonderful people who actually cares about nature especially in marine life. If you think about it, saying that there are more inhumane people than caring people is childish, stupid even. If almost everyone is as it is described, you wouldn't see flowers, trees, animals alive, or anything else. That you wouldn't see someone having a pet dog or fish. That you wouldn't see someone planting flowers or trees. That you wouldn't see someone disposing garbage properly.

@z_.5557,"What the hell are you people in the comments section arguing about? Leaving sharks alone? Accusing companies of capturing sharks just for show? Just for study? How pathetic that most of the people who watched this on the year it was released are utter idiots.  Even if you say 'Leave sharks alone', the people who manages the ocean parks and owns the aquariums won't see your complaint from a simple form of text. Also, we aren't in control either if they die or so, it happens. We aren't gods to choose when they die so stop blaming those who tried their best just to display those sharks for a variety of reasons. The very least reason actually is for money. Most are about studying them up close. Observations and being able to see it clearly than on a poorly printed Science book.   Also, we can't help if they can't easily adapt to the aquariums and tanks like as if you are pointing out that we are puppeteers pulling on toys' strings. Actually, I pity the guys who worked hard just to present the creatures to you.   If you think it is abuse then go up at the f*cking company's doors that you think are doing wrong and say your complaint right in their faces instead of whining in the comment section!

@PrimalNerdz,"Great video and very informative - although very sad!  So sad to see this happen to such majestic creatures. We are based in Hermanus, South Africa (about an hour and a half's drive from Cape Town), known as the whale watching capital of the world. One hour's drive from Hermanus is a small fishers' village, Gansbaai (directly translation: Goose Bay) that is a known for Great White shark cage diving.   Gansbaai is situated at the one end of Walker Bay, the bay having shallow water with Hermanus basically in the middle of the bay's shore. This is one of the reasons that the Southern Right whales are so prominent in this bay: mating, giving and raising their calves, sometimes getting as close as 5 meters (16.4 ft) from certain shores.   You never get sharks in the bay, as they HATE the shallower water, even though there is an overflow of food for them from seals, and penguins. Go to Gansbaai at the end of the bay and there is a great number of Great White sharks with the water being much deeper there than in the Walker bay area. There is the odd shark that wonders off, but that doesn't happen often, mostly off track being lured by cage diving boats.",7년 전,0,

Dogs also have a different vision from humans but aren't as smart as us. Vision has nothing to do with sharks getting captured and put in a fish tank. The comparison from a fly not being able to see something to a shark being forced into a tank is like me comparing the amount of people who go to food stores to the amount of people who get killed in bank robberies.   And, on the topic of sharks killing humans.. You may say I'm a sick human for saying this, but the shark bit the human before the human killed it. The humans kill a few sharks and you all freak out? Come on. If a shark kills a human or the other way around it doesn't matter. In fact, humans are becoming overpopulated so the shark killing a human is just some population control.  Applying a thought process linear to many of the replies I've seen here; a shark killing a human is the same as a fox killing a bunny, right? It's just one animal killing another for food. Now, personally, I believe humans are the higher beings. If we weren't, we wouldn't be the animal to capture and take any other animals for our entertainment. So maybe the shark killing a human is a bit more like the bird killing the snake. I don't doubt it has happened before. It is uncommon, just like the shark killing the human. People always miss the fact that humans are just any average animal with a higher intelligence. Perhaps those who tend to forget that should stick to working in a circus, so they can at least be above or work equal to another animal in their lifetime, and not always be on the bottom.",7년 전,2,

Unlike humans, animals aren't built to stay put in one place; they need to roam every day. You want to have a taste of what it is to live in a cage/fish tank? Have fun living in your bathroom for a week (bathroom as in the American style where the bath tub, toilet, and sink are in the same room).

@Jefstito,"Hmmm, I think you are looking at it wrong. Although a lot of your points make sense, don't forget that its not the same thing to watch an animal on a funny video online than actually seeing it. The first time I went to the zoo I was amazed by the animals and a feeling of protecting them and know more about them grew inside me. Its not the same as a Shelter, were you dont really good to experience the animals and seeing them ""as if"" they were out in the wild. Aquariums and zoos are great at creating awareness of the animal kingdom and talk about our responsibility to protect them. In fact, most aquariums and Zoos tell you about endangered species and how humans have destroyed their habitats, making you feel like we should stop that.   And talking about zoos as if they were enslavers is kinda dumb. Sure, I guess not everyone that works in one is a selfless person but the experts that take care of the animals usually love them a lot and really look after their well being. After all, they are experts cuz they studied about those animals because they really want the best for them since they were kids.   I know its cool to go all Green and stuff, and its awesome that you care, but acting like you know better than the experts is just kinda dumb. Comparing this to ""killing homosexuals"" or whatever, doesn't really apply. You could be keywarrioring all you want on the Internet, but usually the people working on this places are the ones actually taking care of the animals.  There's an awesome video of Adam Ruins Everything about the Safari Zones that explains further all the things to consider when talking about this topics and how even something as conterintuitive as letting people hunt animals to protect them is actually a great idea.  If I sounded mean in anyway, just want you to know I did not meant it.

With that vast open space, an adult great white could survive. Only problem is, that tank is bigger than most aquariums themselves. you would also have to constantly have other fish in there with it as great whites are hunters and they need to catch their prey and not be fed out of a big bucket. you could even enduce a small current in the tank to simulate open ocean currents.

The past tense and past participle most commonly used for this verb is sneaked, as in:  The thief sneaked in through the backdoor.    However, the form snuck has found its way into use despite having no precedent amongst other verbs ending in –eak (creak, squeak, leak, etc.).",7년 전,2,

@DaniMartArts,"This is surprisingly easy to fix, and I'm disturbed that Aquariums never figured it out, or they decided it wasn't financially worth it? Like how the glass of your car has sheets of plastic in-between the layers to prevent it from shattering, Sharks like Great Whites navigate with extreme electrical sensitivity at the snout, so if a layer of thin net-like metallic film was layered inside the glass, the Shark would never bump into it because it would be able to detect the weak electrical current pumped through it, and so avoid it altogether, and if the Aquarium was Donut-Shaped, it would swim in a circle endlessly, clear of the glass walls. On top of this, Great White Sharks are long-ranging pack hunters, opposite like Killer Whales which are close-ranging pack hunters, and require Social Interaction from their species, and so an Isolated Individual will experience Psychological Trauma in an Aquarium Setting, thus a collective of Donut-Tanks connected to one another for multiple sharks is required. You can't own just one Great White, you need a Breeding Colony of at least 3 Males and 5 Females I would imagine, and the overall size of the exhibit would fit a small zoo all its own?

Its not as simple humans ""just leaving animals alone.""  Of course those who mistreat and abuse animals (i.e., Sea World) should be condemned and shut down.

You can actually see the great dark bodies of the orcas (killer whales) - and be horrified to observe that even the biggest tanks don't give them room for a good swim, let alone 100 miles per day. In 1961, the first captive orca, Wanda, lasted 3 days. It was over two decades before a captive killer whale was able to give birth to an infant that survived 30 days (1985).     One of the saddest phrases for any animal on display is ""doesn't breed well in captivity."" Organizations are finally coming to grips with the problem. SeaWorld has finally agreed to stop breeding orcas. Many american zoos are getting out of the elephant business. Ringling Brothers retired their elephants!! That made me so happy!    Granted, animals are losing habitat in the wild. But people are trying to do more for animals, to prevent poaching ivory and unnecessary deaths.

@pedromeneses5661,"If sharks were to go extinct, since they are at the top of the food chain, then it would lead to more food(the food that sharks used to eat, that now is uneaten and propering even more), the ecoystem would not be disrupted at all, only if a vital conmponent such as plancton was removed, then the entire marine life could go extinct, for reference, plancton is the food that many of the tiny fishes eat (at the bottom of the food chain).   My point is that if you remove a bottom of the food chain species, it would lead to a lot more trouble than if you remove a top of the food chain predator, the same could be said for the extinction of humans, the world would be better off without them, (except for domesticated animals), and not putting to account that if humans were to go extinct all of a sudden, thousands of factories, nuclear plants and other facilities would be in imminent danger towards the environment, but that's another story.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

One of the most famous examples was reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone, which totally altered the local and regional environments arguably for the better.  Another example being when predators were removed from areas with deer populations at which point the deer population exploded and did immense damage to surrounding forest land.  I don't know specifically the role sharks play in there environment, but it's almost certainly not how you think, Doggo Fitness.

Since they live in the ocean, and we don't see them often (and most of us are scared of them), not everyone cares about sharks, or their well being. People see them as monsters, not creatures that are being mistreated and hooked and killed constantly because of their reputation. If we had more in aquariums, that we could see and learn about up close without being in danger, I think more people would care about how sharks' lives are affected by us.",8년 전,0,

Probably the real reason there are no great white sharks in captivity, especially the adults, is because of how they hunt prey, always from below and ramming them really fast upwards.  Some scientists belief that great white sharks dwelve more in deep waters than we know, but there is not much info on it due to the difficulties it requires to study them beyond 200 ft. deep.  In my opinion, depth might have something to do with the cause of these sharks dying, perhaps it's the amount of light or some feeding they do at those depths that don't know anything about.",7년 전,1,

The majority of human beings do, actually, given that we're prone to empathy. However, just because something FEELS like it's the right thing, doesn't actually make it the right thing. Zoos and aquariums are vastly doing more good than harm for the animals. There are some species that have been hunted to extinction or near to extinction, which is a shame. However, your point of ""Let's just not touch these animals anymore"" lacks good reasoning. The fact of the matter is that we interact with our world as species. In massive ways, some good, some horrible. The climate changes may very well lead to many more species becoming threatened/endangered, and zoos/aquariums are the saving grace for such species.

It's because fishermen exploit them for their valuable fins - that is the root cause of this problem.  Aquariums taking in great white sharks is really not exploitative - the idea of aquariums taking in species at risk is that we can keep the species alive, while using the profits from the aquarium to support that. The issue with this, when it comes to great white sharks, is that they fundamentally cannot be kept captive - they just cannot live in such an enclosed space. This is a problem, because fundamentally, if we can't keep an animal in captivity, we can do nothing to help it. Our attempts to solve the root cause - exploitative fishermen - are completely unsuccessful.

If we 'leave them alone', we risk having a population that feels disconnected and apathetic to endangered animals, and the longer that continues, the less likely that population will support or do anything for conservation efforts when they're really needed.  So as sad as it is that some sharks died in these attempts, the time that they were in those tanks, and little kids excited about them got to see them, in the flesh, swimming around, means that we'll have people passionate about helping them down the line.

It's nobody's property to exploit. And yet Japanese behave like it's their own little aquarium to fetch w/e they need from whenever they like.  Americans at least set up regulations and quotas in Alaska for crabs and cod and things like that. But Japanese just mercilessly hunt down anything that can be eaten or made into a cream or oil or w/e. And they not only do it for themselves to life off of, they do it for export and making profit.

@arcticjackalope,"When my daughter was little, her favourite movie was Finding Nemo. And like most kids that age, we watched it every day, day after day, and she never got tired of it. It sparked an interest in marine life for her, so we went to our city zoo which includes a few small tropical aquariums, and she saw and learned about the clownfish, the moorish idol, the cleaner shrimps, and others. (also the pelicans elsewhere in the park. lol) The rest of the fish we looked up at the library, where I helped her find the books with the best pictures and read interesting facts about sharks, rays, and anglerfish. She enjoyed this just as much if not more than seeing the live fish in an aquarium.  Having knowlegeable researchers go out into the sea and capture great whites on film in their natural habitat is all we need. Most kids don't need to see them in person, and if they really want to badly enough, encourage them to grow up to be marine biologists",8년 전,12,

And domesticated animals that are raised with humans should be treated as humanely as possible, just as how we'd treat our pet dog or cat, like family.

@Yippeee16,I saw one of those great whites at the Monterey Aquarium. Probably that last one they had in 2011. The interesting thing was all the tuna and baracaddos they had in there with them were swimming clockwise. A good 100+ fish were all doing that. The great white was swimming counter clock wise and swam at a different depth level above all the other fish swimming clock wise. It was pretty amazing to see. The great white had such a presence in the way it moved. I had no idea that it was such a rare thing for them to be in aquariums and that it was hard for them to survive in that atmosphere.

@SianaGearz,"Animals are never endangered because people try to catch them to place on display, as there's only a few thousand zoos worldwide - only hundreds that will even attempt to keep a difficult exotic animal with little documented positive experience. They're endangered because their habitat is destroyed by commercial activity, because they accidentally get injured by manmade objects and machinery that wasn't intended to catch them at all, or because they're poached illegally for food or 'valuable' body parts.  So it appears that trying to regulate what is on display isn't going to contribute to solving the problem, it's more like closing the eyes and pretending the problem didn't exist. Instead you need to raise awareness, investigate, and combat each specific root cause on a case by case basis.  A better argument is that since we can't figure out how to store and display these specific animals without injuring them and causing them painful death, it's inhumane to do so. But then it's debatable whether we should care about that short term, or whether accepting an occasional sacrifice on the path of figuring out how to breed and restore populations is a reasonable compromise.",8년 전,1,

The zoos today empathize detailed conservation, hazards to the various species, and education about them. Alot of the animals are rescues from many various reasons. It's not all perfect but alot of the people that work to take care of them do love and care the best them they can. And for the animals well being, for one they are not complicated creatures like us. Not even close at all. The don't feel, express, or desire the way we do. They eat, sleep, socialize/not, mate, repeat. Different animals do need allotted space but generally speaking zoos can and have offered it well. As long as their needs to survive and thrive are fulfilled they'll be good.

Zoos are incredibly valuable to maintaining endangered animals. Without zoos many of your favourite animals would likely now be extinct. Breeding in captivity is what keeps tigers going, and pandas. Letting people see the animals is how they get funding.   Aquariums are different. Seaworld needs to die. Some aquariums only care about displaying the animals with no regard for their happiness and safety (like Shamu.) Zoos are more international and therefore the majority of them are properly monitored.  Many many zoos are properly accredited and are incredibly valuable. https://www.zoo.org.au/fighting-extinction  You might not like animals being put on display, but it's the best way to get the public involved and invested in wildlife conservation. The orangutans in particular get a lot of attention - there are sponsorship programs and signs and billboards encouraging people to get involved. I was there a few months ago and they were talking about switching to recycled toilet paper to save rainforests. Without our zoos many animals would be left in the cold.

In most animal species, thats about 3 generations. Do some research before trying to be smart and self righteous. You don't even know the Monterey Bay Aquarium(the one that held the Great Whites) I've been there many times, and they usually release their animals that survive in the wild, and keep those that are unable to live in the wild. They just try to research and help the animals. Its a world renounced aquarium, that even I have been to multiple times. Stop trying to be a retarded PETA ripoff.

They don't breed and sell animals for profit, they don't buy animals, and are active within professional breeding programs. They only take animals that they know they can provide a natural, quality life and enclosure for. 99% of zoos are horrible, living 3X your lifespan isn't a positive thing if you live an unnatural life and in a small enclosure for entertainment.

@higurashikai09,My parents went to a scuba diving site to watch a shark feeding frenzy (lead by dive masters and guides of course. Don't do this by yourself). There's no other way to see these kinds of sharks besides visiting them in the open water. Sharks are pretty uninterested in humans which is why a lot of shark bites were a case of mistaken identity (looking like a seal for instance) or due to panic (they're more likely to attack something that is thrashing about and looking like easy prey).  There's very little shark bites per year and they're not likely to bother you as a scuba diver.,8년 전,0,

This is part of the natural process of learning, and being a anthropocentric species we tend to kill more of other types of animals than we do our own.  Those who say we should bring people to nature instead of bringing nature to us, it's a good idea, but incredibly expensive and liable. The whole purpose of these establishments is to educate the public in a controlled environment, there's a whole world of research that goes on behind the walls of aquariums and museums that people don't know about. Having a controlled environment makes it easier to educate with very little limitations and makes it safer and more accessible.

@stanvanderbend8298,"Your argument has various flaws. First of all, you say there is nothing inherently superior about doing things the natural way. Which is a meaningless statement without some given framework of meaning. If one is to assume you meant there is nothing inherently superior about a life freely liven against a life liven in captivity then you obviously lacked that kind of experience in your life.   This opens a whole network of language we could dive into, is it immoral if a life liven in captivity never experienced a life freely liven?  Till what extend did one way of living benefits the shark? Do we look at just the individual shark or the shark as a species, it's gene pool?   Let's refer back to the superiority part of your argument. What do you mean by inherently superior? The only objective truth I could grasp from that box is a definition grounded by evolution. Which leads us to the shark's gene pool. This video left nothing to the imagination of whether this way of living holds an evolutionary advantage over the 'natural' way to live. So I think we could state that there definitely is something inherently superior about going the natural way. Btw inherently and natural point to the exact same things in this argument.  With this kind of reasoning you get nowhere. You will be left with the conclusion that there is no point in doing anything, so why not just die already. Which is fine, if it works for you.  However, as you state, we have a choice. So why choose one that annihilates consensus in morality?

@Wertsir,"Stan van der Bend, you used a lot of words to say a lot of nothing.  What I meant was that arguing we should leave them in their natural habitat because it is their natural habitat is not a valid argument in and of itself, because something being natural is not the same as something being good. (the naturalistic argument).  Obviously the current tanks are inferior, due to, you know, killing them. but that doesn't make all tanks inferior, it just means our current tank design needs to be improved. unless you have an argument as for why all tanks are inferior (rather than specific tanks) to living in the wild that will remain true.  As to evolutionary advantage versus non: humans have killed millions of species, and we will likely go on to kill even more. our effect on the environment is undeniable, and the species that currently have the best chances of surviving in the future are those that we have a vested interest in keeping alive. for instance Dogs and Cows are almost certainly not going to go extinct before humans, because humans have a strong desire to keep them alive (as pets and food respectively).  So long as sharks exist only in the wild people are going to be less interested in keeping them alive, (after all it is easy to forget about something dying when you never see it in the first place) and they could easily go extinct, if we built tanks to keep them in not only would we be able to guarantee their survival easier but we would also be more likely to want to do that. (Both on the aquarium's end, since it helps make them money. and on the customer's end, since they now have more personal experience with Sharks and thus more reason to want to keep them alive).  I have no doubt that over the next millennia humanities impact on the planet will only grow, and I expect that within a couple thousand years life will cease to exist on the planet without direct human intervention. keeping them in tanks is one such form of intervention.  And even ignoring the future, currently people are keeping sharks in tanks regardless of the fact that they die in them. And the fewer people do so the greater the incentive to do it becomes (because people are still going to want to see sharks, so the people who do keep sharks in cages will get more clients who are willing to pay more money, per the laws of supply and demand), all my original comment suggested was a potential method of tank construction that would seem to resolve the issue of them dying will still allowing people to see them.",8년 전,3,

@stanvanderbend8298,"Well I was responding to the things u said in your second argument. The first part concerned something I consider as one of the most fundamental philosophical problems, when does something truly matter? Then, in the second part u make a rather big claim about inherited superiority. I was simply trying to say that it certainly does matter how we deal with other life around us.    Anyways on to your new comment. I agree with you that it is not a valid argument on itself, that is what I was pointing out in the first part of my comment. It's only valid within some framework of truth, one you did not setup.   Then u point out that natural and good are not the same kind of truths. Here we run into a moral issue, what is good and what is bad? This is also impossible to even approach without first making a set of presuppositions that fit within some framework of meaning.   I agree that the current tank designs are a fail. No one ever claimed this automatically flags all future designs as inferior to their natural habitat, neither does it automatically entail the design 'needs' to be improved. It seems likely they will be improved as long as there is economic gain in it. Obviously the reason why these tanks are so ill-designed is because the incentives are set for profit, not the well-being of the shark. These obviously have a relation to each other. When one increases, it is likely that so does the other. 99,9% of the species that ever lived are extinct. The species that are most likely to survive are the ones that best adapt to the environmental changes, there is no evidence that artificially keeping a species around is the best way for a species to remain.  Dogs, cows and sharks are both very different examples. Cows we keep because we need them for nutrition, dogs we keep because we need them for comfort and sharks we keep because we need them for entertainment.  All three examples are on a completely different peak on the moral landscape. There is no such evidence that this is the best way for them to live.   Dogs are what they are now because we like them that way, our society is designed to include certain pets. This is the best way for them to live now because this became their 'natural' way of living. The only assumption you'd have to accept is that pet dogs generally have a better life than street dogs.  Cows have been genetically altered by humans to produce more food, this is a more artificial way of living already. We basically grow the meat and keep it alive and well enough as to improve the product.  However, recent breakthroughs in technology, allows us to grow meat ourselves. Expected is that within a century the mass murder of animals will be over and meat production will be replaced by lab grown meat. What happens to the cows then? This points out that this way of living is too artificially constrained already to bear any direct evolutionary advantage.  An aquarium is not the only place where you can see a shark in action, there are a million other ways to reach people and bring awareness. Take this video as a prime example. And humans do not have to keep them alive, we do not have to do anything. It is what we should do what matters. So that is what we should question.  Ok?  I do doubt that actually. That prediction is of such complexity that one could impossibly use it to support an argument that is so zoomed in on this particular kind of possible intervention of extinction.  I never denied this, nor do I find myself lost in disillusion of this being a problem that is easy to tackle.

I can understand the hate for circuses and places like Seaworld that have had a history of treating animals inhumanely. Sure, if you go back in time, animals in zoos were kept in terrible conditions and we're just there to bring in money. But now, we can see so many zoos around the world are trying to create positive changes in the way we view animals. And so many of those zoos are actively trying to keep endangered species from going extinct. The San Diego Zoo in the US has so many programs for different species of endangered animals ranging from mammals, to amphibians, etc. That zoo has one of the largest DNA banks of endangered species DNA, so hypothetically if one species was to go extinct, then they could possibly bring them back. Zoos today are not what they used to be. In the past, the enclosures for animals were called cages. Now, we call them exhibits or something of the like. We shouldn't refer to them being in cages anymore because the zoos of today try their best to recreate the same environment that those animals would have lived in in their natural homes. We need to accept that, at one point in time zoos weren't good, and move on.  EDIT: Also, in the case of the Great White Shark, they should not be kept in captivity. Until scientists can truly understand why they die so soon in tanks, then they should try again. Spending so much money probably, on a cause that's not going to end well is a waste and it's not fair to the animal. When the scientific community can solve this problem, and can keep a white shark in a tank for an extended period of time with no problems, come back to me and I will probably have a different opinion on their capture.

We have vets who take care after animals and help them give birth. Smaller dogs needs humans help to give birth and wouldnt last 4 days because of its size. And Stop whining theese animals are treated well. they are fed and given a place where we can see them in real life witch is better than to see them through a computer screen and that they can live in.

@hi-wo2jr,Irelynn Iniguez their normal home is in the ocean if they are placed into a tank with water it's just the ocean but way smaller but they don't migrate every single day so they stay around the same place and sometimes migrate if you put that into a humans prospective we live in houses but they would be smaller and have nothing but something to sleep on because sharks can sleep so it would be the same also they feed the sharks meaning humans would have a food supply meaning that if that were to happen it wouldn't just be someone around glass they would have anything to need to survive and they would be around more people the only difference is that humans care about their young and sharks don't also they must be fed right like the one who would have lasted longer than 6 months and if they wanted too they could have made it last longer it's just that they require specific things and they were being used for not only entertainment but for research too that's why they caught them not just money,8년 전,1,

@violet9777,LOL at the fact that you truly believe children have are far more intelligent and more emotional than non human animals. You clearly know nothing about animals then and should do some more research on their emotions and what they actually feel. They feel the same emotions we do & a child being held captive like one of these creatures IS JUST THE SAME. obviously just by watching this video you see the detrimental state those sharks are in upon being placed in an environment they aren't accustomed too.

@kyrakia5507,"Lydia Estrange  The brains of different animals are very different (some animals having no 'brain' at all) and subsequently have very different levels of intellect an emotional experiences While I would have thought it obvious that humans were more intelligent than animals (assuming you have not made up your own ethics based definition of 'intellect'), it is also widely accepted by nearly all biologists that simple animals like ants do not have the same emotional capacity as humans, and cannot feel many of the emotions we can, such as boredom. The same is true for practically all non-human animals, with a very few 'possible' exceptions. It is also worth noting that animals do not have the same needs and desires as people, with sharks, as a non-group based animal, not needing other sharks nearly so much as we long for social contact. In the case of very young children or mentally handicapped persons with very limited intellects or emotional capacities, these people would have families who love them and so much more that would complicate matters if they were to be put on display as an animal, hence we haven't had people kept in these conditions for over 100 years (this is ignoring the aforementioned additional needs of humans like social contact that would still leave this much worse for any human than a shark)",8년 전,0,

I don't blame people, just because I know they're asking out of curiosity and not because they're actually ""stupid"". I get things like why don't we have whales, dolphins, great whites, etc. The simple answer is, some of these animals need a very large amount of water to swim in along with lots of attention and others to play with while others just can't survive in captivity period. If you follow the AZA's rules, dolphins need a minimum of 1,000,000 gallons of water alone and some people don't realize just how much water that is. Fun fact: our local aquarium's largest tank is 385,000 gallons and it took 30 days just to fill it with water coming from a hose from a fire engine.

Second reason is wouldn't a biologically enhanced shark be smart enough to realize what they can fight and what they cant fight and will eventually group up to kill us off with us maybe have some sort of a chance vs the chance we have against robot sharks in which we could press one button and shut it down?

@jarynn8156,"Zoos and aquariums are great resources for studying living creatures. It allows researchers to watch how creatures respond to specific conditions and circumstances that cannot reliably be recreated (or without the risk of interference) on the field. It also allows scientists to do things like dissect specimens when they die of one cause or another, something that is far harder on the field because you have to hope a specimen happens to die while you just so happen to be very close by.  And thats just the raw scientific applications. That doesn't take into account conservation efforts and educational ventures undertaken by zoos.

There are many traits that Humans and Humans alone have that are not found in any other species on this plant. For instance, those sharks are not using tools or inventing anything new such as technology or philosophy. Those sharks are not using medicine (such as surgeries, or complicated diagnostic tests to determine ailments). All of those things are specifically human. And there are hundreds of more examples.  If you want to think of yourself as equal to sharks or other ""animals"" you are selling yourself short. Humans are miraculous in their abilities -- however, many of them choose to reduce themselves to the lowest common denominator.

It's the 'trial and error' attitude I have a problem with. Keeping a shark like that is quite obviously extremely difficult (and costs us a lot of money) and I think people need to stop trying until we have better knowledge of the species and way more resources.

Their freedom is taken away. Don't talk about animals getting attention when alot of the animals die because of the unnatural environment they are trapped in.

And you're correct, kids will learn just as much out of a text book as they would seeing the real life thing. Also, I hope you understand sarcasm.",8년 전,5,
@Roozyz2,"I do not care to ""win"" this discussion but I am interested to discuss this subject with a fellow scientist student (Applied Biologie in my case. Dutch is my first language so forgive any mistakes in translation please).   Let me first state clearly that I've got love for all animals, chickens, giraffes and sharks alike. In my opinion they should all be treated with respect and be spared as much harm and suffering as possible. It is however difficult to spare an animal (or a ecologic system for that matter) if you do not understand it. In the early days of zoo's, people had no idea how to take care of wild animals. I was very sad to hear that many animals died by peoples ignorance.   Nowadays animals thrive in zoos, especially now laws (obligatory five freedoms of animal welfare and such) are getting better and better over the centuries. By letting zookeepers forging bonds with animals (in a way safe for both animals and people) gives us an opportunity to study the animals up close and learn exponentionally about them. With this knowledge we can educate people who may be harming animals by ignorance. Don't forget it wasn't too long ago people were convinced animals and babies don't feel pain but just have reflexes. And a lot of people are still convinced fish can't feel real pain because they can't express it. When people see animals up close, in real life, that sticks more to memory and heart than seeing them in a book. You can show a kid a picture of a lot of trees and tell it that it's a forest, but take it to forest and it will really understand. As a science student, of course your fascination lies with science but how did it start out? Did you immediately decided to be a biological scientist after you saw a picture in a book or did you go to a zoo or aquarium with school or your parents? Maybe the combination did the trick? Knowledge and appreciation come from experience and different insight on the same subject.   Knowledge about animals, animal welfare and animal health is not only educated to people in zoos but the knowledge is gained by zookeepers and scientist too in the zoo itself. We've come very far with succesfully keeping a lot of different species in captivity. Unfortunately, we haven't come as far with marine species yet. The ocean is for us a more unfamiliar place then the moon, or so I've heard. Although every death shark is as sad as any other death, as long as we try our hardest best to make it work (keep the shark alive and happy) and as long as we learn as much from failed attempts as we can, the death will never have been in vain. And that's why I personaly think that there áre good reasons ONLY under good circumstances, to take a wild healty shark from it's natural invironment: to study it, to educate people about it and to let them develop an appreciation for it, hopefully leading to a lifestyle where he or she makes an effort to contribute to the protection of the enviroment, just as what happened to me when my parents took me to the zoo for the first time.  I hope I gave you more insight to how I see matters as these. You don't have to agree with me but I do like your opinion on my view as I am writing an opiniated piece about it at the moment.",8년 전,10,

@RichardBrownFUCKOFF,"no offense but you did not address where are great white sharks cannot be kept in captivity other then for a short time. you failed to explain the reason other than saying the shark belong in the open ocean. as a kid I recalled watching a great white shark Special by Nova. where are young great white shark named Sandy was kept in a large circular tank in California in I believe was the early 80's and after 14 days had to let her go when she started bumping into certain spots of her tank what they found was there was a weak electrical fields at those points. now I may not have a doctorate in marine biology but it would be my guess giving the behavior of great white and given the fact they are a migratory shark and go to the same places every year. putting them in a tank impedes their ability to navigate in concordance to their life cycle. it's with that thought that makes me think that's why they had such success with REALLY young sharks. especially when considering the fact that the best of our knowledge when great white sharks are born they are already 5 foot was documented along the coast of California tend to stay there for 4 to 6 months while they grow to 7 to 8 foot long before swimming South towards Mexico. when there are 7 to 8 foot long they can compete with a bit more dominance with other predators. and let's face it after 30 to 40 years of ""studying"" them we still know VERY little about the great white shark.",8년 전,0,

@Cyanopteryx,"Because white sharks inhabit an open ocean environment, they rarely encounter situations in which they are stationary, so they never evolved the ability to pump water (oxygen) through their gills. Instead, they move in long straight paths to continuously circulate oxygen into their bloodstream. In fact, when they sleep they've been shown come up to shallower water to access a steady coastal current to swim against as they sleep.   When placed in a small habitat they not only have less open water to circulate oxygen, but they also have no access to currents and variable depths to provide adequate conditions to facilitate sleep.   Sharks in captivity very likely die from complications of lack of oxygen to the brain/other organs, which could include anything from a stroke to simple suffocation. But note that most of these sharks were not eating (which could be a hallmark of extreme stress, or other factors in environmental feeding cues we do not understand yet), so malnutrition cannot be overlooked.   Regardless of which stressor (or combination of stressors) killed them first, all of them endured a great amount of suffering during their time at these aquariums. We learn much more by visiting them in their homes rather than bringing them back to ours.  Hope that helps a bit :)",8년 전,134,

And they can't be in captivity because they roam freely and if they can't and hit the walls they can get hurt, they can get sores, they just cannot live in captivity",8년 전,10,
@VaeSapiens,"I guess it's because of how sharks navigate in the ocean. They use Ocean currents and earth's electromagnetic field. Young great whites could be kept captive for over 100 days, while the adult ones die very quickly. I suppouse it's because of their developed neural networks.    An adult great whites are over 20 years old. That means that neurogenesis had enough time to produce a viable neural pathway that recognises and responds to ocean currents and EM field. You get that shark into a small (relatively) pool with various electronic devices around him and that shark will have a problem to adapt.   Get a young one and you can even feed them and he will survive much longer.   So I think it is due to development of speciffic sharks.  But it's just a hypothesis.",8년 전(수정됨),31,

Animals weren't just one day born doing what humans wanted for no reason at all. It took generations upon generations of keeping wild animals under the care of humans until they finally started to domesticate (Which continued to take a long time).   2) A lot of pets people have today aren't actually domesticated. Many reptile and amphibious pets, for example, are still very much wild and could survive on their own if moved to the correct climate. Even goldfish are arguably not domesticated.",8년 전,5,

Also everyone interviewed had an extreme bias which destroys the purpose of having a ""educational"" documentary. If they want a real non biased film they would have interviewed sources who both agree and disagree and argue why. But they used ex employees and scientists who already had anti seaworld and anti captivity programs and agendas (some even worked with PETA) If you care to research the subject instead of blindly follow trends set by PETA (Who are far worse than seaworld btw) seaworld #1 has changed many of their programs including no more theatrical shows and now just educational ones. They have also stopped their breeding program. #2 seaworld also does so much to help wildlife. They are the #1 sea rescue program in the country but don't get the recognition they deserve. They are there for every ocean disaster like the BP oil spill where they saved over 100 endangered sea turtles all the way to a single injured animal like the young sea lion that was shot back in 2012. Also, Every new animal there is an injured animal determined by the GOVERNMENT not healthy enough or strong enough to be in the wild so seaworld takes them, and if they're able to, rehabilitate them so they can be put back in the ocean. If they are not able to and if the government agrees they won't survive without assistance then seaworld will take them and take very good care of them. It is important to have places like seaworld because so many species are becoming extinct or endangered and the only way to even have the possibility of taking them off that list is places like seaworld having those animals in case the government wants them to breed the species and release them to grow the population. Fun fact: there are actually a few animals at Animal Kingdom that don't even exist in the wild anymore so the only possibility of bringing them back is through the captive ones breeding. It's one thing to have an opinion but you better have real hard facts to back it up and not a single mockumentary. I also have many sources if you'd like me to link any. If you want to shut down seaworld, do not complain about how little help there is for injured sea life, ocean disasters, and endangered/extinct animals.",8년 전,1,

Sure it's cool the first time around and it's amazing to see all these beautiful animals, but we can't just keep them in cages and let them rot away there. There's too little room, and really, think about it this way.  Imagine yourself being stuck in a cage, while people throw fish at you and laugh. Then, afterwards you're stuck in a cage with nobody. You're alone, forever. Even if another fish comes, or another creature, they too will rot away with you. You are forever stuck in a room, and you are never released from it. :|",8년 전,3,

@KSOTOXP,"While they didn't say it explicitly, they kind of explained why. Firstly sharks need to be in constant motion  in order to breath, so when they are being transported by truck they don't have the oxygen flow they need to survive. Therefore many don't don't make passed transportation. Secondly, since sharks need constant motion in order to live that means sharks need a wide open habitat, something that an aquarium can't really give them. Thirdly sharks move fast, because of this they keep crashing in to walls and hurting themselves. Aquariums just can't keep great white sharks,because they can't recreate the conditions a shark needs to survive.",8년 전,98,

They are declining in populations due to human activity. Like Briana Harter (from the comments) said, aquariums are used to study the different marine life and do promote marine life conservation. And like other comments have said as well, sharks are not the enemy. They might seem scary, but they rarely attack humans. Only about 6-10 deaths by shark attacks occur each year. In fact you're 30 times more likely to die from being struck by lightning than being killed by a shark. It's really important that we try to help protect marine animals and aquatic ecosystems because, you may not know it, but they provide many ecosystem services to earth and it's humans.

I can agree with you on that, but you said everything that moves got emotions. Trees move, most plants move, plants grow and lean towards sunlight. Grass produces a distress smell when something eats it or a human cuts it (the smell of newly cut grass), does that count as feelings? Venus fly traps eat insects and other creatures with meat on them, once something goes inside their mouth they either close their gap or starts to produce a disolving acid-like liquid to disolve the insects, venus fly traps are plants.  Emotions isn't based of if they move or not, it's based of their brain.  Fish and insect does not have the part of the brain to feel and plants doesn't have a brain at all, they simply have not evolved to do so. But plants, fish and insects will do anything to survive even if they do not have a brain or can't feel, because they have evolved to react to damages like this: ""Oh an attack, let's do something with it so that I can survive and reproduce"". While mammals have evolved like this: ""Ouch, that really hurt, let's do something so that the pain will go away and make sure that this will traumatize me so that I make sure to never get in this situation again"".",8년 전(수정됨),1,

Sharks are a predatory fish. They are good at being a bully but once they are bullied they can't handle the circumstances and they cry and die.   This is why you should never hold these big fishes in such small aquarium jails that will make them freak out and die. They're not used to survival on their own. They're dependent on their prey to survive. Once they're put in a position where they're a prey they die.  Evolutionary they don't rely on surviving however their prey always prepare to ways to survive.

@demonzero677,"ya know, I see a lot of people here gone on their soap box about ""leave the sharks alone"" and ""Why kill them to make money"" May I take a moment to play Devil Advocate here? The intention of any of the captivity of these sharks isn't souly profits. Yes, people do want to come and see something like a Great White up close and person, and it's a rare enough occurrence in the wild that surprisingly few ever get to safely outside of the TV.  However, it's precisely because of the natural habits of sharks like Great Whites to constantly roam over huge expanses of Ocean that make the prospect of raising them in captivity so enticing from a scientific standpoint. It's hard, VERY hard to track the same shark when it literally makes the equivalent of cross country trips constantly in the vast ocean, it's also incredibly, STUPIDLY INCREDIBLY expensive to do so as well. As a result of those two factors, even today we still know incredibly little about these creatures beyond certain feeding habits and some migration patterns. We know next to nothing of any social structure between White Sharks, We know nothing of their breading habits or birthing habits, we don't have a firm grasp of how long they live, how long they can live till, how fast they grow, in truth we really don't know nearly as much about White Sharks as we'd like too. Yes, we DO know more then we use too, by a large margin, but there is still so much more we have yet to learn and the fact that finding a single shark repeatedly is like literally finding a needle in an ocean sized hay stack is making that research INCREDIBLY difficult and expensive, as in if you robbed EVERY disgustingly paid celebrate in the world, we'd still probably had money issues in this research.  So with that said, if we could raise them in captivity, that would be the holy grail for researchers. They could reliably study these creatures and learn about them, better our knowledge of them, and the more we learn, the better equipped we are at protecting the wild ones. If we learn how they breed, what factors play into it, we can ensure humans do not interfere in this. If we learn there they give birth, we can protect those places. The possibilities for what we can learn, and the good it does, are endless. So if it were possible to raise them from birth to natural death in captivity, well hell we might be able to make breathroughs with the super expensive research out in the wild.  So do keep that in mind before you go and demonize and crucify these scientists for wanting to be able to learn things that, to date, we do not know. Honestly learning more about Sharks like the Great White could prove not only useful in a scientific standpoint, but could actually save lives if we can learn what exactly prompts an attack, and can design measures to prevent them.",8년 전,0,

Every day animals that have a key position in our eco system die because of humans. We destroy habitats, we pollute, we over fish and over farm. So it's not the zoo's and Aquariums who are killing these animals, it's you. Yes there are a lot of problems with keeping animals in captivity, such as in the case of this shark where it is being held purely for entertainment and it is killing the shark. I think it's pretty obvious that we should leave well enough alone with that, but for other species, they often thrive in captivity and are receiving exceptional lifestyles and care. Many species that these institutions work to save are being forced into extinction by human greed, not natural selection. By supporting Zoo's and Aquariums we do not support animal cruelty - at least as long as you are visiting a reputable and upstanding one - we support the continued existence and diversity of animals.

@KC-bg1th,"They don't ""love"" the thrill of the hunt; that's anthropomorphizing a creature that functions almost purely on instinct. No predator enjoys hunting because every time they hunt, they risk injury. In the wild, if you're an injured predator, it's essentially a death sentence. It's why gouging at eyes of sharks will deter them — you're too much of a risk to hunt.  White Sharks have the physiology of a creature that's meant to aggressively hunt prey. Basically, since they're equipped with the tools to be aggressive, so that's how they'll be. It's similar to how terriers love to chase things, but also shake their heads to break the neck of whatever the catch — they need to end it quickly because the way they hunt is by chasing them down solo instead of being reliant on a pack.  As for them eating live prey: White sharks will scavenge, and will scavenge whenever they possible can. I mean, everybody's seen those videos of them having a feast on a whale carcass. They also get drawn in by chumming and baiting the waters for when people cage dive.  The most common fact of well sharks pick up the scent of blood just shows that sharks are drawn to prey that aren't necessarily 'their' hunt. This goes back to how predators always preferring the least risky way to not starve.  I understand what you're trying to say, and it's true that sharks belong in their natural habitat.

Another example. Dolphins are smart enough to recognize each other in a mirror and know its a reflection, how would we know that if they were never taken captive.   If we didn't take them captive people would KNOW a lot less about them and very likely care a lot less about them.

Let's say there are very few people left and we live far apart from each other and would never meet on our own. Now an alien race comes to earth and decides that lets pair me up with a female and care for us in the hopes that we procreate, but we are imprisoned for life and monitored constantly by a race that has no way of knowing what I really want.

In many ways it would be better for the species to die in the wild by natures laws but as an wildlife lover i understand your desire to presurve and help animals but the sad truth is that more disruption and artificial change would not fix the problem as if it never happened. As long as humans exist to cause the disruption thier is no point wishing to prolong the life of a species that can't survive these disruptions, admirable as it may be. The only course that will solve the problem indefinitely is for human activity on earth to halt entirely.

@lavender_queso,"Dean Cutler If I said captivity was always bad for animals, I take that back. Snakes, for instance, absolutely thrive in captivity (I'd know, I have 3 pet snakes and they're in prime condition). What I'm saying is that in most instances though, an animal would do far better in a wildlife sanctuary instead of a zoo. That doesn't mean they wouldn't be able to be fine in a zoo, however.  With great whites, I think it's impossible for them to flourish in captivity, simply because of the reason they've died in captivity in the first place. By definition, captivity means the thing being captive isn't free to roam around wherever they wish, and again, since that's the reason great whites can't live in captivity in the first place.  But really it comes down to the animal, like I said. Using snakes as an example yet again, all they want is water, warmth, food, and shelter. Since humans can easily provide all of those, snakes typically thrive in captivity. As mentioned earlier with the great white however, we can't provide them with one of their most important requirements in captivity; freedom.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

We humans are a relatively intellectual species and we're always looking to advance our knowledge and what we can do. We're so interested in always trying to find out more that even the universe isn't big enough - people are always questioning what else is out there, where's the edge of the universe and even what's beyond that? If we were confined to one room (like we essentially are with the universe) we'd spend a lot of time wondering what's outside. But many animals aren't like this and so there could be a lot of animals in zoos that don't really care that that is the only space they have. The ones that were born in the wild and captured MIGHT miss it if they know what grief is but a lot of animals born in the zoo wouldn't know that there is more to the world than the space they can see and a lot of them can't care to get upset about it.",8년 전,0,

I have been unable to find a definition of predator that isn't ""An animal that kills other animals for sustainance"" and that DOES describe the whale shark.  My best guess as to why this odd stance is so prevalent is anthrocentrism; we tend to think of predators as being able to kill and eat US. Whale sharks clearly are not. But then neither are lots of other things that we certainly class as predatory; owls, for just one example.  Just because krill are very, very small does not mean they are not animals.

@Belzediel,"Probably because AproLogic didn't give an explanation. Assertions are simply that. Not understanding the difference between plants and animals didn't help either.  Filter-Feeder  Are you asserting that the method of eating other animals is relevant? I've yet to find a definition of predator that states that.   The WhaleShark does not hunt.  Whale sharks smell areas rich in plankton and swim into them to feed. Does that deny it being a predator? I'd rather think that's the definition of hunting. But, even if that were not true, there are plenty of predators that do not hunt - most spiders, for example.  It does not have a specific target/prey to kill, therefore not a predator.  And yet they spit out what they don't want to eat, so, yeah, they pick and choose what they eat. Also, would you provide a link to a definition of predator that states specificity of prey? I have not found one. Would you class wolves or hyenas as predators? Most people would, and yet they don't hunt specific prey.  I'll make it  simpler for you: the only predators alive are carnivores.  Evidently I'll have to make the point AGAIN. Whale-sharks eat SHRIMP. Shrimp are animals, therefore they're made of MEAT. They might be very small, but they ARE animals, and animals that eat other animals are either omnivores or carnivores. I'll merrily agree that whale sharks also eat plant matter, so, omnivores, but I'll be obliged if you can point out a definition of predator that states predators are exclusively carnivorous.",8년 전,1,
@Raybets,"Matthew lawley Admiral Belzediel  I'll be frank; you both sound so deeply lost, clouded in your own idea of correct. If this happens to not be another sad trolling routine of yours, do know that the terms predator and carnivore are used interchangeably. aka. synonymous. Feel free to google it up (:  Sure I can imagine special situations where they don't necessarily come hand in hand like a potential carnivorous giraffe for instance. But without man's interference that is impossible to achieve because nature dictates so.  Guess what else? All of us indirectly consume bacterias and bugs which, by your definition makes every single visible creature on earth a predator.  UhOh!  To address your example,, Spiders deliberately set up traps to catch a calculated prey, it hunts[attacks]. Hunting is essential to predators (please do your research). And as we have agreed, the whaleshark does not hunt. it eats whatever it breathes. end of story.   P.S.

@Belzediel,"Predator and carnivore are synonyms? Stop huffing glue.  No, wait, huff MORE glue.",8년 전,1,
@Raybets,"Admiral Belzediel  Again, they are synonymous according to dictionaries. While I am aware that the definitions do differ, they do come hand in hand. If it wasn't obvious enough, below is why:  This just occured to me that despite all of the discussions had, we were on completely two different planes. Have you realised that people don't normally refer to ants and frogs as predators?  That is because the word ""predator"" is highly subjective. It can be used in two manners: ● ONE; the general way = ""the predator"" = our predator, an animal that imposes danger to us humans ● TWO; when applied to display their position within the foodchain in versus to its prey.  A frog is predator to smaller insects but not to humans.. hence people addressing it as such is unheard of -except when the relation with its prey are brought in.  In this case,, speaking from one human to another human, the whaleshark is NOT a predator, and that is simply because we aren't its targetted prey. It may be to the prawns, but not in general context,...  And I've been talking in general context as I should be because we are both humans and no man alive personally views a bluebird as a predator(threat) regardless of the fact that it preys on OTHER animals, similar to the whaleshark. While it is the largest FISH in the sea, it isn't the largest marine predator (again to us because no prey is specified thus the general context).

If you heal a broken soul, it doesn't actually heal!! It just gets paranoid!! With animals, we should learn how to interact with them. Know what to do and learn to fight when necessary. We've advanced in technology, yet lack strength. We're like rabbits. We have no protection if a predator comes near. Even a horse can beat us up. We're the slowest compared to animals and a lot of people are scared to hunt their own food. Dudes, if you're a vegetarian and you're facing a cow that's trying to kill you, yeah, you Should try to calm it down first, but if that don't work, you have to defend yourself. We use guns to defend ourselves when animals don't need nothin! We think we're superior to animals cuz what? We talk and they don't? We wear clothes and they don't? We have guns and they don't? They got natural strength and claws And Fangs to rip us apart. We can't even take a dog!! We Are literally like rabbits! And a lot of people say neuter and spay animals. Quit it with that!! Neuter humans and see how you like it!  We're so weak and we're clueless!! We need houses, cars, clothes, and Animals are the ones who are dumb?!! A Lion 🦁 wants to visit his friends, he walks. Animals are so smarter than us that they let us live and just pity us. You see it in their eyes. Seriously! We CAN'T abort a child, yet we can neuter an unwilling animal?!!

@Augready,"Sharks have to stay continuously moving in order to breathe right? Well in the ocean they are used to traveling linearly as far as they please and turning only as they please. But in a captive tank they are FORCED to continuously turn and change direction, because the tank is no where near long enough for them to travel. I would imagine that it would be impossible for a shark to ""sleep"" or hibernate as it swims, like in the ocean, if  it constantly has to be alert enough to turn direction or it will slam into a wall which would still wake it up. This is an animal that cant stay in the same spot for too long, the rules to an ""adequate"" aquarium arent the same. Turning directions so often is unnatural to the shark and it may eventually die from exhaustion and lack of ""sleep"".

People may give zoos and aquariums a lot of grief for keeping animals in cages and tanks, but they serve an important educational purpose to the general public, to see exotic animals up close, and gain a greater appreciation for the world's biodiversity. Without zoos, people would not understand these animals, and have less empathy for them in the wild.  This is especially critical for great white sharks, because their public image is still largely informed by movies and Shark Week, where they're depicted as ""mindless eating machines."" Hundreds of millions are killed every year, partly for shark fin soup, casualties of commercial fishing, or just because humans plain don't like them. By comparison, all species of sharks from 1958 to now, have attacked less than 3000 people, and killed less than 600. The amount of sharks we have killed in kind is incalculable.

@TheMidnightwolf15,"This shouldn't even be happening to these sharks. They need to be in the wild, their numbers beforehand were not suffering. Captivity should only be necessary to help increase the numbers of endangered animals with breeding programs to help with that. That's why we have safaris, zoos extra. Their core aims are to help endangered animals and their population. Sharks and Orca's do NOT need this! I hate organizations like SeaWorld who think it's a brilliant idea to put Orca's and Sharks on display. NO IT ISN'T!!!! I'm now super glad I'm studying animal care in college because I might be able to someday help put these poor animals back where they belong, in the ocean. Oh yeah and they are called ORCA - not bloody Killer Whale! Plus I hate films like The Shallows and Jaws who paint sharks to be vicious man-eaters and are generally evil. Hate me all you want fanboys but that's literally all these films do. When the sharks in question do not deserve all the hate they do get.

@Eszra,"I'm no expert but I've always believe that many sea life creatures need to use their movement to both regulate body temperature as well has changes in water pressure. In order to keep a great white it would have to be a very young pup, then placed inside a tank the size of four football fields. There would also need to be a wave and current generator as well as constantly changing levels of salinity every so often. You would also need to regulate the temperature. Deeper level colder higher levels warmer. There is also food source. Young White's eat fish then move up to mammals. The problem there is that your would have to figure out if the pup was one of the Whites that eats a certain mammal. Seals. Keeping a group of seals in the tank for breeding and living would also be difficult. Because they would have their own needs and may need even more room, very likely the tanks would need to be 6 to 8 football fields in size along with sand, rocks, and beach material. The cost would be ridiculously high.",9년 전,0,

@Inv4derxXx,"maybe it has to do with the pressure of the water? It was noted that on some large crossings that they will dive down as deep as 900m in open ocean its easy to simulate coastal conditions  but a shark probably spends more time away from the coast and a 35ft tank is like a puddle. So the bigger shark only lasted about 3 days because remember that they need to move to oxygenate, water under pressure contains more oxygen, a shark under 100ft of pressure will have greater oxygen content than one under constant <35ft, plus a bigger shark would require more oxygen which explains why the big one died so fast.   I remember a story about a guy who survived in a ship underwater for a few days because when his ship sank the barometric pressure increased making the air hyperoxygenated, so he sat in a pitch black room for 3 days until some divers showed up to retrieve the wreckage and surprisingly found him alive.",9년 전(수정됨),0,

And point B, if I'm correct, is because of aforementioned data collected since they were able to analyse sharks without them keeling over in a matter of days.

@SoverineSR,"Concerned about the well being of these animals? Then lets play a game of looking at the bigger picture. Have you all ever heard of a fish known as the coelacanth? Two species of coelacanth are currently recognized to be around still, one believed to have a population of 500 max. Furthermore, coelacanths, as I understand, are currently considered the most critically endangered class of animals currently. Now, for those of you who understand the scale of the ocean, you'll realize 500 makes the whole ""meet, greet, breed."" thing a little difficult to do, even in a small portion of it. If nothing is done, they very likely would go extinct on their own from this alone.  So you might react ""why not breed them in captivity?"". Well, as I understand, we've never been able to keep a coelacanth alive in captivity. If this is starting to sound familiar, then it should. It seems until recently, very little information was available on coelacanths to the public, and it was just recently a lot of our understandings of them have changed. We still have a lot to learn about them, and how they potentially effect the environment, yet they're close to disappearing. Yes, we're partially to blame for this, but its also ""too late to fix it"" because trying to take them into captivity is likely to just kill them, and we don't even know if they'll breed in captivity. And there have, as I'm sure many of you recognize, been examples of captive breeding keeping species within existence.  And you have to remember, at the end of the day, most of our research on marine biology, which has done a lot of good, ends up occurring outside of the oceans.",9년 전,1,

@breadroelling3451,"Im totally against shark and whale captivity, but if the Aquariums really wanted to exhibit these creatures, they should do what they did with the shark cage they used for the acclimation process in Malibu. Monterey Bay Aquarium backs right up to the bay, so if the really wanted to, they could build a cage right there in the bay that is visible from the balconies of the Aquarium. This would be much healthier for the shark, and the visitors could still get to see the animal. In addition, since it is attached to the ocean, where they don't need to worry about the water condition, they could easily make the cage larger as the shark grew.

On top of that the people who work at aquariums have dedicated their lives to taking care of animals. Why they try to bring great white sharks into captivity is simple. People need to know the truth about great white sharks and not have a fear for them. General public believes that they are a huge danger and should be killed when fishermen catch them. People have a fear for the unknown and by educating the population they can understand that fishing and killing sharks is wrong. That being sad not all aquariums are the same especially ones in other countries. Smaller ones with less funding are more likely to have negligence especially when they are hurting for money to stay open.

Hopefully it will learn or maybe through instincts it won't go to the shallow part of the structure and it will stay in the deep part. If it does go to the shallow part it will just brush against the glass and turn around versus taking full impact of bumping into glass.  If the glass is smooth enough it really should cause much damage from rubbing up against. The shark will turn around to the deep part. Much better than hitting the glass straight on,9년 전,0,

Chimpanzees and Ants BOTH engage in warfare to an intensity that if we adjust for both population size and technological level is GREATER than humanity. Heck Edward O.

@npaul4171,"If you can't or won't do something right, then IMO don't do it at all. It is completely possible to house this shark, and most fish, in captivity safely. BUT, the housing conditions needed for large open water predatory fish are too expensive for most organizations, and so large that it would make observation almost impossible. Could you imagine looking for a single fish in a tank that was a thousand feet tall and several miles long & wide? As with most predatory fish, they are highly sensitive to slight water changes, but their diet requires food which will in fact cause water parameter shifts that can be lethal...aquarium enthusiasts with delicate 6-inch fish in a 230+ gallon tank can spend $5,000-10,000+ on filtration, so poor sharky needs filtration on a scale that probably only Bill Gates can afford....just to give him some non-toxic wuddah, never mind all the other factors that need to be accounted for!!! The more logical way to go about this is building aquariums that are underwater observatories to view sharks in the wild or very large man-made & controlled bodies of water. These fish require space that is impractical for an artificial tank, and if you can't provide a fishy with a reasonable quality of life then it's time to reconsider the game plan.",9년 전,0,

@MaxsSeveredHead,"Linton S. Dawson A simple 'no' would have sufficed. We know so little about Carcharodon carcharias, being able to study them in captivity would provide a wealth of invaluable information which can then be harnessed to benefit the species holistically. That's why we're trying so hard to do so. The marine biologists involved in these efforts care more about the creature than you or most others (myself included) ever could, they've devoted their professional lives to the understanding and betterment of these creatures - obviously they don't want them to die. I'm not even going to tackle your false analogy with human experimentation, it's so moronic it would take paragraphs to dissect (no pun intended). I know you're well meaning, but spreading this sort of rhetoric only serves to hinder, not help. Lack of understanding is the only sickness humanity suffers from.",9년 전,10,
@ihazthots,"+MaxsSeveredHead, We know very little about a lot of things. For example - the human brain. Many in our species suffer from degenerative brain diseases. In a similar case with most organs, a transplant is a plausible cure to the illness. But not for the brain. Brain transplants have not been done on humans yet and we are unsure whether it would even be possible. It leaves in limbo so many questions in regards to memory storage, transfer of information, neurologically networks and the brain's overall relationship to the human anatomy. But we haven't tested it on a living human being and most likely won't in the near future.  I'm certain marine biologists care about the well-being of the animals, but I am also certain that researchers are hungry for information and will push as far as possible to gain knowledge. As a researcher, I can definitely relate to that sentiment. However, in our pursuit of knowledge, humans can at times overstep ethical boundaries, and since ethics is mostly a differing moral norm laid down by an individual cluster of people, overstepping for ""the greater good"" can ostensibly be appealing to scientists. Hence, the Institutional Review Board (for humans) and Committee on Animal Research and Ethics (for animals) was set up to make sure research is done ethically. Because animals cannot provide consent for a study or fight off human interference in habitat modification, it is essential that ethical researchers do not impose a study that greatly disrupts the population of a certain non-human life form; especially one that might be endangered.  Do we know enough about the benefits of studying the Carcharodon carcharias because prior studies have led to the deaths and puny information gained from such investments. Bertrand Russell exemplified this point further in the 'Theory of Knowledge' stating that true beliefs do not constitute knowledge until their truth becomes self-evident. The truth of a belief may become self-evident if its truth is evident without the need for any demonstration which is based on the evidence of other beliefs. According to Russell, knowledge is based on acquaintance with self-evident truths. True propositions which are not self-evident may have to be demonstrated to be true by self-evident propositions in order to become objects of knowledge. Knowledge is based on acquaintance with self-evident propositions and with propositions whose truth can be demonstrated by self-evident propositions.  I fail to see how these concerns are ""moronic"" and since you don't care to elaborate on the point, I suggest initiating a dignified discussion or disengaging altogether. I don't care for sardonic statements about what I don't understand if you're not going to make an effort and present alternative viewpoints.",9년 전,6,

People want to see and learn about these creatures and not everyone has direct access to the ocean, or scuba equipment and licenses or boats or what have you. Going to an aquarium gives them the chance to see these animals up close and in person which I think is amazing. Engineers and marine biologists have worked very hard for decades making sure these set ups are good enough for the animals, not just to keep them alive for monetary gain but to keep them comfortable and simulated real ocean life so that they and others can see observe what could possibly be the closest to reality behavior these animals have in the wild. Stop assuming every single thing in this world is focused on money and making more of it.

It's only really a problem if the animal is very active or actually needs a lot of space to survive, or if they are kept in unfavorable conditions.  Sometimes captivity is actually good. It has been used to keep animals from extinction, and to educate the public. For example, pandas are kept in captivity or they would die off due to habitat loss; orcas were extremely feared and hated until they were domesticated by aquariums... they point is, nothing is black and white.

They are successfully bred in captivity.  With the Great White Shark, it is different.  They are endangered and rare and so the primary goal is conservation.  From this video, it seems like we can't really breed them in captivity successfully. I don't know where you're going with the IQ part of your comment.  It's not really a valid argument that some animals should be saved because of their higher IQs while the others should not?

@Darth_Fatass,"Kai'a Bellamy Nervous system =/= the ability to feel pain. A nervous system at the very least is something that makes a living being move. And it evolved because the ones that didn't have that factor died, natural selection.  There's obviously no way of convincing you my side of the argument, and I'm just kind of done. Go read up on biology, maybe learn something.",9년 전,6,
@kaiajasmine,"+bob8065 wow thats condescending. I am actually a student doing my degree in biological and ecological sciences so cheers for the assumption that I'm not educated in the subject. Obviously that is why the fear factor evolved but how it evolved is different, if you do some research on the subject you will find multiple studies showing that fish are a lot smarter than you seem to think and that they, along with cephalopods like octopuses and squids, do have the ability to react to harmful stimuli that we would call 'painful'. They do have very different brains to us and so maybe they feel something different but analogous to our pain.",9년 전,10,
@SysterYster,"I had to read about that a little. It does say it's not known if they feel pain or not. They lack most of the parts of the brain that humans and mammals have that note pain, but it's not known if fish feel (are conscious) of pain. But they do react to pain and injury. And at least in humans it is vital to be able to feel pain. Humans that are born unable to feel pain often die within 5 years (I think it was, I could be wrong with the time). Because feeling and reacting to pain is one very important part to stay alive. If you don't feel pain, you don't remove yourself from it, meaning you might take too much damage and die. Fear is another very important thing to have to live. More important than pain, but still. But also remember that for most animals, especially animals that are not living in packs or herds, showing that you are in pain may equal death as predators will target you first. Many animals hide their pain until it's so bad they simply cannot. I have seen a horse with a deep chest wound, not blinking an eye about it. Not because it didn't hurt, but because it's a prey animal, and they don't show pain for natural fear of predators. I think fish feel pain. But they are very unlike humans, and we might not ever fully understand them. And they probably hide their pain as well.",9년 전,3,

@Kenpachi0Sephiroth0,"Well I wasn't going to reply to your comment but now I read that you seem to actually believe that Great White Sharks dying would actually be good for us. I hope you are just joking but in case you are not then I'll respond. If the Great White Sharks suddenly went extinct it would probably create a massive imbalance in the oceans ecosystem (Specifically the food chain) which would most likely affect us humans in a negative way. They eat several things like sea lion, seals, turtles, rays, many types of fish, etc. If they don't eat them it might lead to overpopulation of many if not all of these animals. Thus more of these animals will be hunting their preys and that would most likely lead to a massive reduction if not extinction of said prey animal species. And as in a chain reaction it can come to affect us all (humans and other animals) negatively in one way or another. Thus Great White Sharks dying most likely isn't a positive thing for us. If someone is afraid of dying or losing a limb from a shark they most likely have the choice of not going into ocean waters, especially those were Great White Sharks are known to frequent. Same with the horse and cows, you can probably avoid them. Now did you know that around 3000 people die each year (Give or take) from choking on food? This isn't a lost limb like with sharks, this is a definitive death. What would you suggest in the case of choking? Do we stop eating? And what about car accidents and deaths? Should we stop using them? These are risks we decide to take because, generally the benefits far outweigh the risks.   Btw, they also eat carrion which would makes them a big part of the ocean waste cleaning crew E.I. Keeps the oceans cleaner. If they are gone, who is going to eat those massive whale carcasses if not them? You and me perhaps lol? I don't have much of an appetite for them though so I think I'll pass.",9년 전,3,

Somedays there would be no significant marine life around. So people would complain about being ripped off. At least with an aquarium you have guaranteed attractions (not that I agree at all with keeping animals captive).  So there would be a strong incentive to try to keep the big attractions (like sharks and whales) around, perhaps by leaving out food for them. But that would disrupt the ecosystem, forcing competing and hunter/prey species together for the amusement of visitors. That could be even more disruptive to the environment.

In the Seattle-Tacoma area of Washington state for example, they have one of the only displays of the nearly extinct red wolf, which that zoo made great efforts to save in a program they headed. Thanks to coyotes and overly territorial humans, they can barely survive in the wild, but thanks to this program there's still a chance of their continued survival in the natural world where they belong.",9년 전,1,
@laitma,"Zoos not only raise awareness, but are really important places for research on animals and also in captive breeding programs that can help save endangered populations (the California Condor, for example, was completely saved through the efforts of the San Diego and LA Zoos).  Sadly these programs need funding, hence they put out some animals on display and have people pay for the zoos, but a great deal of work is done behind the scenes in learning about the diets, behavior, biology, and ecology of the species they hold.  Researching by tracking wild species is incredibly limited in the amount of information you can gather; just think about how hard it is to find a single shark in the ocean (and the cost of the excursions by boat needed for every sampling/research trip), nevermind documenting their diet, movements, sleeping and mating habits, and how they give birth/care for their young; the amount of information we can gather from observation in the wild is totally eclipsed by the amount of information we can gain from a captive specimen in a much shorter period of time.

While a domesticated horse lives longer and is more healthy than a wild one, and they can be perfectly happy that way as long as they get to move around enough and live with other horses. But, put a bird in a cage and not let it fly... that's not nice. So it all depends on the animals and how they work. Some animals wouldn't even exist without us. There is a difference to keeping animals, and to torture them to an early death. I'd never support keeping animals if it means they are suffering or hurt or die early. But if they are happy, if they live a good and long life, it's ok. You can't see the world as a black or white side. It's a lot of grey in between you see.",9년 전,1,
@jaden8208,***** Dearie im not being stupid <3.  Any animal with time can be bred to be kept with humans. People complained im sure once wolves went into dogs and horses were a normal thing of the farm.,9년 전,0,
@SysterYster,"IINightingale21 II The difference between taming and breeding any random animal and keeping horses and wolves(dogs) is that they served a purpose. They were helping humans and they were pack animals. Which is why we humans can have them around and it works so well. There's a reason why we don't have big cats as pets (apart from one or two). They are not as reliable as a dog or horse, and they might eat you. And as I said, some animals we can't breed in captivity because they simply won't do it. Others we can't keep because they're too hard to care for, they are too big or they die, like the great white sharks. So no, we can't. Many animals we can breed and will keep in captivity, but most we can't. And don't patronize me please. It's not endearing your cause. But anyway, if you want to prove me wrong. Start a breeding program on great whites or whales or some other animal that you find. It's easy, read on about it, find some animal that won't breed in zoos and then get started. Get back to me when you have done it.",9년 전,1,
@jaden8208,"***** Any animal, including big cats etc, can serve a purpose. Whether it be companionship, or just for the hell of it.  Artificial insemination is also an option assuming you can keep the female at a state where it wont abort.   I exaggerated when i said any: i assumed you would be able to tell but clearly you assumed i thought blue whales could be bred in captivity.  To be honest the only animals excluded are ocean ones.  So yes, we can.",9년 전,0,
@SysterYster,"IINightingale21 II  Of course, but as I said, some of them can and will eat us. So the purpose may be short lived. And because we ""can"" do something doesn't mean it's a good thing to do. We can clone humans too, but we don't because it's not a good thing so most countries have forbidden it. And ""for the hell of it"" isn't a good reason. There are many animals that won't get babies even with insemination if they are in captivity. They just can't get the things, the life they need in captivity to make them happy enough to breed. Well, of course you can't breed whales. But to be honest, this is a video about trying to keep sea animals in captivity and you then say we can keep any animal. So... yeah. But still, can do, and should do are two different things. And most animals will probably be happier in the wild. Just like you are happy to be free. There's a reason slaves are not allowed you know. They were not happy, even when they were well cared for. Because freedom is a good thing.",9년 전,0,

Secondly, you preempt on the matter without first getting you're assumptions corrected about me, and thirdly, you bollix yourself to quickly! Now, I'll elaborate for you and everyone else reading this comment. I am deaf. I was born with Ménière's disease and in 2013, after years of it's progression on me, my hearing finally went away. It slowly deteriorated for 25 years. Yes I have _music on my profile and in my playlists but if you took the time to read my biography on the About Me, you would of seen that I share this account with my sister, who also helps me when I make videos. I do editing and graphic design where she does the music/sound effects for me. People fall for stuff like this all the time but I actually have proof so if you took the time to look at my videos, you would find that my first video - that I made 2 years ago - talks about my disease and my medical issues/problems. I even set up a GoFundMe to help me with one of my personal medical problems, that I asked the world for help with. You can "" lol "" all you want but I have something you'll never have in you're life time and that's the appreciation I have for life now! What I've been through, I truly now know the vital importance for appreciating things in this world! Think what you may but in all honesty, you're opinion or even thoughts doesn't even matter to no one but yourself. I wrote this comment for Vox and their crew because in ways you'll never understand, they have helped me tremendously with coping with my depression of losing my hearing. On a side note, I can still enjoy music because my sister blasts the music for me and I feel the vibrations. I may not be able to hear ever again in my life, but I can still enjoy music. Losing my hearing, never mean't I'd stop listening to music. Perhaps if something drastic happens in your life - to open up your eyes, if you will - then you'll be a little more slower & appreciative to say/write something rather then reading the ending to a book. :)",8년 전,4,

@BunkerBlog,"I believe that some species of animals can (and should) be put on display in zoos. However, only those animals that can fair well in captivity and lead completely safe, enjoyable lives. Saying ""no animals should be kept in captivity"" is illogical, as A: many animals can fare very well in captivity, and B: it allows people to see/experience and learn about animals that they would normally never see.   Fish and inshore shark species are a great example of animals that can fare well in captivity and still lead happy lives. So can penguins, otters, etc. But animals like pelagic sharks, dolphins, orcas, etc, do not fare well. In the case of the sharks, they usually die very quickly after being put in captivity. And in the case of the dolphins and orcas, they can live in captivity, however, they are extremely intelligent and social animals - almost on a human level. And they have been shown to become extremely bored and even develop depression in some cases (dolphins have even been known to commit suicide).   So here is the TL;DR version: many animals can be kept in aquariums and still lead happy, healthy lives. However, other animals cannot. So we should only keep animals that we know can survive well in captivity.",9년 전,0,

I've pointed out a number of your inconsistencies before in this thread also:  You said that I was simultaneously self-pitying and arrogant (wrong: those two states of mind are polar OPPOSITES).  You said that arrogance is a product of feeling worthless (wrong: arrogance is the exact OPPOSITE of feeling worthless, it's the feeling of OVER-importance).  I mean, you can't even keep basic dictionary definitions of words straight, that's how fried your brain is.  And, now you're insisting that when people are in their 80s, that means that somehow they should reject all medical technology, when that's when they need it the most?  Oh, and side note: medical technology is probably what got them into their 80s in the first place, because before modern medical technology, the average life expectancy of humans was about 25-30 years.  Your hypocrisy and self-contradiction are stunning, absolutely stunning.  And, your brain is so fried that I've asked you at least a dozen questions trying to decipher your incoherent mess that you're spewing, and you won't lift a finger to answer a single question or challenge.  Nope, you ignore the questions, and keep spewing condescending idiotic self-contradicting ramblings, then declare that it's a product of a superior mind.

The white sharks that the Aquarium displayed was the world's first successful attempt to do this with the MOST stigmatized species of shark, and probably any aquatic animal. It doesn't have anything to do with whether or not animals are ""safer"" in captivity, but that the aquarium and zoo industry does not affect wild populations of animals as there are literally a handful of such accredited institutions in comparison to wild populations, no matter the vulnerable status of a species. The Monterey Bay Aquarium displays fish and invertebrates that are all caught in the food industry or aren't and therefore not vulnerable in the wild, and also rehabilitated birds and sea otters, the latter of which participate in surrogate programs for otters that can be re-released.",9년 전,1,

Personally I believe that choosing freedom over quality of life is just human idealism and many animals would prefer the cushy beds, easy meals, parasite and predator free life. But that's the unpopular opinion. Apparently it's more humane to allow an animal to starve to death because it went blind from mange than to wait on it hand and foot 'cause freedom.

@dlakerguy,"Jacob R 3) Thousands of religions over time? Maybe. But what do they all have in common? A belief in a higher power. Do you really think that basically all of humanity in all of history and many civilizations that had no contact whatsoever with other civilizations too all believed in a higher power simply out of coincidence? Pretty sure there is a reason for it and it isn't science. It is a feeing, a belief, a sense that is not measured in physicality.   For evolution to have existed, yes, it would have to jump and create entire new families in genetics and DNA. The theory doesn't say we all came from a variety of species that all originated separately and at the same time. It says we all came from 1 organism that miraculously came to life all on it's own and then somehow procreated all on it's own and then somehow evolved into billions of different species that are not related in any way to each other. Solid theory...  And yes, most of the country is Christian or another religion. But these religions are NOT indoctrinating anyone. No public schools allow religion or creationism to be taught. You have to send kids to private religious schools for that, which of course costs money. Therefore, the vast majority of kids are being taught evolutionism and therefore are in fact being indoctrinated with a very flawed theory of how we came to exist. This, over the course of the last 30-50 years has created a sharp decline in people who believe in creationism and a huge increase in non-religious population in our country.",9년 전,0,

Do yourself some favors and look up real studies and actually read them to better understand the truth in things.

@dlakerguy,Jacob R If you were reasonable like uh ok was on here then that would be fair.

The question though was whether scientists believe humans have evolved over time or stayed in the same form they are currently in since the existence of humanity. Evolving over time as a human is reasonable and expected in 1 form or another.  However, my point is to whether humans (and other species as well) evolved into what we are today from an entirely different species. The theory suggests all species ultimately evolved from 1 extremely simple organism over a very long period of time. The questions was not about whether we evolved from 1 organism entirely unrelated to what we are today. It is asked if humans evolved as humans over time.  http://www.darwins-theory-of-evolution.com/  This basics of his theory as noted in the link above.

@qazwer001,"Dale Couture while I will admit the language is a bit ambiguous, ""“humans and other living things have existed in their present form since the beginning of time.”"" in this case ""present form"" is referring to species, in a somewhat ambiguous manner because the changes are subtle and the line for speciation is when the two groups are no longer able to reproduce, something that is often hard to draw a conclusion on while looking at evidence with now extinct species.

As for fishing, you also choose what to eat or buy or go fish for on your own. You can't tell me that starving people would turn down fish because it isn't tuna or some store stocked common fish. I don't contribute to either of these problems. I am not the one choosing to have 15 kids or choosing to only buy certain fish. I would gladly try other kinds if it was offered to me.

@cs6993,"Individual self-regulations for off-springs will not help, the issue must be addressed on a grander scale to take effect. If the goal is to alleviate the stress we cause on the earth, population control is a solution but also a compromise in that it limits our way of life. Increasing resource yield is a better solution that can alleviate the stress we put on earth given that it is done efficiently. Imagine if there were no farms but 7 billion people still existed (completely hypothetical) We would hunt and fish until there's nothing left. But Agriculture and Farming allowed us to increase the output for food,which allowed us to preserve much of nature, and allowed us the time to be more than just hunters and gatherers so that we could achieve all that we have achieved. THAT is a solution. Because of farming and agriculture billions of humans can exist without hunting and fishing the world to oblivion.  Even now breakthroughs are being made that can help this issue. Cells can be grown into resource we can use. Just as you and I grow by cells multiplying, it is now possible to grow cells into the resource we usually kill an animal for... their meat and leather. The cells do just as it would do but without creating the conscious life that are humans and animals. it's also less wasteful as billions of animals solely grown for slaughter create an enormous amt of waste. Growing just the meat of an animal prevents all waste.  Efficiency and resourcefulness is the way to solve this problem. Imagine a world where the presence of human life actually enriches the earth instead of destroying it. These types of solutions take time and great visionaries to get just right.

To the religious it is their chosen deity, to an atheist it could be society or there own conscious or preferably a system of normative ethics and so on. However in my post I was arguing from the point of what most of society considers ethical(I suppose from a pragmatic view point), and most people would not consider being at the top of the food chain a warrant to abuse all other species as we see fit.

@peterjones242,"Jacob R Ethics and morals are what is created by us humans. Humans create these rules to ensure than the existence of one human would not prejudice the existence of another. Nature does not prescribe these rules. Therefore you are really just enforcing your own illusions. You are enshrining something that doesn't exist. Humans don't really care about animals. The reason they do is because they feel uncomfortable seeing the animals in that state, it is empathy which causes such emotions. People want to get rid of that uncomfortable feeling, hence why they decide to help animals. It is in fact for selfish reasons that people care. Proof of this is that if saving an animal would cause discomfort, people wouldn't save it (e.g. choosing to save a dog over your family member). People don't really give two shits about animals.",9년 전,1,
@peterjones242,"Jacob R Doesn't change that fact that it is a human concept which does not exist in nature. I am not saying you cannot apply such beliefs on animals, but I am saying that minimum standards require it to be implemented to fellow humans as we are social creatures that rely on each other to develop. Whereas I do not rely on other animals, therefore there is no necessity to accommodate them with such rules. We only implement those rule to humans because we rely on them, it is a mutual interest. Apply it to animals would be purely one sided, that is to say I am the only one applying those rules. Whereas for humans it is bilateral. I applies those rules with the expectation that those rules will be conformed to by other humans. Consequently, whether or not I choose to apply it to animals is at my own discretion. I owe them no duty as I would to other humans. On a side note, if humans were to breach those ethical rules, I would similarly not be bound by them in respect of that person, as he has breached his duty to apply those rules, I accordingly do not have to abide by them. For example if a person tortures me, I would reserve the discretion not to act ethically in respect of such person.",9년 전,1,
@qazwer001,"Peter Jones I find your moral stance sickening, basically what you are saying is that if an act cannot be reciprocated then it matters not what you do. With that stance if you knew you would get away with it you could justify anything.  ""Whereas I do not rely on other animals"" so if another human being does not affect your life in any way shape or form it is permissible to kill them?  ""therefore there is no necessity to accommodate them with such rules."" how about to minimize suffering? also you speak of ""necessity,"" ethics is not what you must do but what you should do. Out of respect to another living creature and its experience of reality I see EVERY reason to accommodate them ethically(within bounds, same as humans you wouldn't do an excessive effort for minimal help). Such as by ethical treatment of livestock, ie humanely killing them rather torturing them.  EDIT: also animals DO act with morality in mind, it is not one sided. Many times animals have saved humans, such as my earlier example with dolphins ramming a human out of the way of a shark, or in the article I linked some elephants protecting a blind person from hyenas.  EDIT2: we are part of nature so by us acting with morals in mind we are putting it in nature, humans are just intelligent animals",9년 전,1,
@peterjones242,"Jacob R No, morality is something you MUST do in order to live in a community with humans. It is different to law per se, but it does have anti social consequences.   Does not matter whether one human is in contact with another or whether they may or may not affect your life in anyway, there is a PRESUMPTION, because of being human you can EXPECT such persons to perform the same duty to you. You cannot do that same to animals, because animals do not have the same mind set.   Animals are not on the same rank as humans. they are less important to us than our own kind much like how we rank lower to monkeys than their fellow species. We afford different treatments to different species and depending on how much we rely on them we treat them favourably.   Minimise suffering? I owe no such duty. Much like if I were to get killed by a tiger, I don't expect the tiger to kill me humanely. Only if the animal in question are able to give me the same treatment would I owe a duty to do so myself. Any one way performance on my end is my discretion, it is not something they are entitled to.   Animals only act with morality because of, again, reciprocal treatment from humans. I.e. I live with my dog, I feed it and look after it. I rely on it and it relies on me, we form a bond and consequently it treats me favourably and reciprocally I treat it favourably. It would protect me and I would protect it. As simple as that. As for wild animals, they act instinctively, many times not knowing what they did. They too have this idea of reciprocal interest, they may have mistaken us as another one of their type and saved us thinking it was saving its own kind. It has a moral system within it own species, albeit a different kind to ours. And just to clarify, those two types of moralities are incompatible. Much like how you can't play tennis and football with the same rules.",9년 전,0,
@peterjones242,"""Even if this was the case, it doesn't mean that we cannot or should not extend ethical treatment to animals.""  Like I said that is your discretion, and like you said I owe no duty. So don't push your discretion on others and don't expect others to comply by your rules.   ""just because a creature is not the same species as you does not mean you have the moral right to cause unnecessary suffering.""   You seems to be starting at the wrong end of the rope. Killing is already inherently suffering, you would have to go out of your way to make it not suffering. You don't need the moral right to cause suffering, suffering is not something you actively engage to induce anyway, it is inherent in the act of killing. You do not have the DUTY to ease that intrinsic suffering.   ""an old woman who couldn’t see well, got lost and was found the next day with elephants guarding her. They had encased her in sort of a cage of branches to protect her from hyenas.""  As I said they act purely on instinct, there is no proof that have any due regard for life of another species. Perhaps the elephant is storing her for some purpose. Many times people misinterpret animals.. quite in an optimistic sense as well. When animals find unusual objects or creatures, unsure of how to deal with it it often stores it for later consideration.   So any regard for other species on ground of moral or ethics is not entitlement, it is privilege which is given by discretion.",9년 전,0,

In this case even though the lion gets some enjoyment out of killing for sport(I was not previously aware of this), it likely does not possess the cognitive facilities to consider the pain it is causing. Because we have the intellect to consider the morality of our decisions, we can choose to act in an ethical way.  EDIT: further in the case of the lions hunting(or humans), a full moral decision would be based on how much enjoyment the Lion gets out of it, if the Lion gets more enjoyment out of it then the other animal suffers, it could be an ethical action. Though I don't consider myself a utilitarian(I am by and large pragmatic, but because pragmatic ethics allows the use of other systems of normative ethics until such a time as we can move beyond them I use deontological ethics in most cases), in this case it works and is the simplest method for weighing how ethical the action is.

@SatansFire,"AliceAttentionWhore Alas that would only work in theory. Pandas would go extinct without the conservation of human efforts in captivity. Certain dog breeds such as Pugs wouldnt survive in the wild. Cats released into the wild would murder billions of animals yearly. My best friend is an insect and amphibian breeder who has been given  permission to bring in endangered animals (such as two aligator newts and a few golden frogs) into his home to help bring up the population. Its sad but thanks to our over population and disregard for the planet majority of the worlds animals need our help to survive. And conservation through protection of wildlife while useful still barely helps. Protected Rhinos, Elephants and Lions are still regularly shot and killed, and again as depressing and cruel as it is the only hope we have for them at this point is enclosed zoos in captivity with breeding programs. The Tiger has proved that this system of raising in captivity and reintroducing them to the wildlife and raising populations through breeding programs does in fact work.",9년 전,6,
@SysterYster,"♆ Satan ♆ You are indeed right about that. But if it weren't for human stupidity (much of which could be fixed if all countries gave free education so people knew that eating rhino horns doesn't give erections and drinking tiger blood doesn't cure sickness etc) we wouldn't need to protect the animals in the first place. It's a sad thing. :( Pug and other such dogs shouldn't be allowed though. I mean, we breed dogs that can't give birth to their own young, or who can't breathe without surgical attention and such stupid things. It's animal cruelty!

(And some of these animals are fairly easy to keep in captivity, but ther're not happy about it. Others we know are really unhappy about it.) Many animals kept in captivity are not happy. Some yes, but far from all. Just think of all the different animals in the world. There are LOTS of them. Many are incredibly hard to keep in captivity because they need too much space, they need to move around too much, they need very special food or living habitats. Many animals can live well in captivity, but for some reasons will not breed. That's not very good. Even big zoos with large areas are often too small. There's a reason there are protected wild life areas. So they can live in their natural habitats. As for humans, we have at least chosen and constructed out own living habitats and we can leave them at will. But why should we force other animals to live with us? And they cannot leave at will. I think if we took a look at literally every single living animal on this planet and tested in captivity. Most of them wouldn't be better off there. They need too much.",9년 전,0,
@brookiki,"+applesauceiloveyou Not necessarily.  For example, I don't think anyone would have to try to keep a blue whale in captivity to realize that keeping a blue whale in captivity is a very bad idea.  Also, the video listed several reasons (difficulty in transport, inability to swim properly in a limited space, difficulty in feeding their natural diet, tendency to kill their tank mates) that show why great whites can't survive in captivity.  And thirty years of sharks dying days after being captured should have stopped the practice.

But what ""we"" perceive as comfort is not always what animals want. And at least we chose it ourselves. And yes, animals can and do show that they like to live in freedom. Or at least they do show when they are unhappy about their captivity. ""Stop pretending animals want free will, or you are doing exactly what the captors are doing, you are forcing a choice for them..."" You said that. But by saying they'd like to be in captivity YOU are doing the same. And most of us living creatures I think wanna chose for ourselves what and how we wanna live. Besides we are stupider now. We have more accumulated knowledge, but that's not the same thing. Humans brains have become smaller since the middle ages. Read about it. It's true. Using your brain to survive is what keeps any animal fit and smart. But humans don't need to be smart to survive anymore, so we get less smart. Animals in the wild are smarter than their captivated counterparts. Tests have been made on horses and camels and other animals that proved this.",9년 전,0,
@SysterYster,"***** Our knowledge is getting bigger as we keep making new discoveries about things, yes. You still don't seem to see the difference between intelligence and knowledge though. Intelligence is what we need to make use of knowledge. We have more accumulated knowledge now than in the old days and it's also more available to people. And there are many more sick and stupid people now than there used to be. The reason, they don't die. We take care of them, the society. We save them. They live, they breed. It's simple. It's how evolution works. And evolution doesn't work in the way that everything gets better all the time. It only makes the most fit to survive in the environment it's in survive. And if everyone survives we're getting more bad genes in the gene pool. We are also getting smarter people of course, since they also survive. So basically we're getting a more divided human race with really dumb and really smart people I guess since most really smart people wouldn't get children with really dumb people. But there are reasons people get more and more health problems that's not only related to obesity. We treat it and most people survives. They give their diseases to their children and so on. In the future, maybe we can with science remove those bad genes. That's a possibility, but we're not doing it right now. And we can clone humans right now, but it's forbidden in most countries.",9년 전,0,
@SysterYster,"*****  Well... evolution doesn't always mean smarter for instance. It can be smaller, or stronger or better at holding your breath. Doesn't mean ""better"" as most humans see it. It only means that the ones with the most offspring will, in the future get even more offspring and spread their genes. A wild rabbit that's not fast enough or bad at digging or fighting for females will not get many offspring before it dies. It'll get out of the gene pool. And the fact is, that people with high education and good jobs get fewer children than poor, uneducated people (in general). Because they don't have the time to spend on many kids. If you breed animals and only keep the ones that are sickly... you'll get sickly animals. Yes? Same happens to everything else. Now, there are so many humans it'll take a looong time before it'll get too obvious or affect the population as a whole very much. But it doesn't mean it's not there. If all animals were to survive, they wouldn't get ""better"", because the best genes would be blended with the poorest. You only get ""betterment"" if the poor genes get taken out. Like it does in the wild. I assume we'll do that in the future with science, but not right now.",9년 전,0,
@SysterYster,"*****  That's not what I said. You just don't understand what I'm trying to say to you, ok. Of course evolution didn't say: ""Let's give those humans two legs! It'll be fun!"" But it did over time give humans weak teeth and big brains, because those who had that survived better. Cheetahs became fast because the fast ones survived better. Of course, in our society education and money does matter. Not as much in some countries (with free education) as in others (where the rich get all the good education and the poor nothing) of course, but yes. But if you're a very smart person, you won't like the company of a very stupid person. Simple. Smart people will be drawn to other smart (and educated) people. Dumb people will have other dumb ones I assume. This would if we didn't have our protective society, the dumb ones would die sooner than the smart ones. Thus getting r5id of bad genes for poor brains in this case. Genetic diseases will today be treated (but not cured) and so people will live and pass their genetic defects on. I'm not saying these people deserve to die or anything, but they do pass on bad genes. More and more and more people in the world rely on medication to get through their daily lives. It's good that we have the medication. But it's bad that the bad genes get passed on, making the populace on a whole more sick. It is how it works. Evolution isn't magic that makes things better. It is simply what's left to pass on when the bad is taken out. Pandas are bears. Bears eat meat mostly. Pandas had to, far back in history to survive on only greens. And they have, but the result is a bear that has intestines and teeth made for eating meat but a brain that tells it to eat green. They lost their hunting abilities. That's why they have to sleep and rest so much. Their deit gives them too little energy. But they still eat meat if they find it, they just don't hunt it anymore. Because at some point in history that wasn't needed and the bears that were more inclined to eat green food survived better than the ones trying to find meat and hunt. In the far future, if humans don't make them die out before then, they'll have gotten better teeth and intestines to live on bambu than they do now. That's how it works. That, or they'll maybe revert back to eating meat. Whatever makes them survive the best in the future.",9년 전,0,
@SysterYster,"***** I'm actually amazed at your lack of knowledge about how genes and evolution works. ""There are no bad genes?"" LOL. Then you talk about races. There are no races. There is one human race. And yes, bad genes do exists. That's why we have genetic defects that runs in some families. Because the diseases they have are in their very genes and they give it to their children. There are many other diseases that are not in the genes of course. But the one does not rule out the other. ADHD is not a disease. It's just hyperactivity. And it's not dangerous or horrible or anything. Even if it does pass down to the next generation in many cases But some cancers are. Diabetes is, Alzheimer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, Parkinson's etc etc. Some types of obesity is too, but rare. Many things are genetically transferable. Here's a list of gene mutations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genetic_disorders Here's alist of genetic disorders: https://www.genome.gov/10001204/specific-genetic-disorders/ Now say again... there are no bad genes? I'm not saying people with bad genes should die. That's immoral. Morality is what makes people save the weak and the sick. That and love. But it has nothing to do with what's smart to do. I'd save them if I could too. But it's not good tor the human race and our genes. But at least I'm not denying it. That's ignorance. Like you. Ignorant and in denial. Humans haven't needed bigger brains? Of course we did. If we didn't we wouldn't have become what we are today. 5000 years is no time in the history of evolution btw. But then you'd need to understand evolution to know that. Evolution can go very fast, but also exceptionally slow. It all depends on the situation and the size of the population. And our situation is that we are MANY! If you have a small population with a high death rate they will evolve faster. A large population with a low death rate will evolve slower. That's how it is. Having gills as you say would obviously not be better for humans, unless the world gets flooded like in the movie Waterworld. But that's you who said stupid thing like that, not me. Again, because YOU clearly don't know who this works. YOU are the one who keeps saying evolution does things like it's some kind of magic. Not me. Many smart people may be dicks. True. But just as many are nice people. Being a douche and being smart is not the same thing. That's about how you are being raised. But just look at you and how you ""hate"" what you see as dumb. lol. You hypocrite. It's just fact. Nobody likes to be around people we perceive as dumb. Some people like to take advantage of them, which is despicable. And some people love them because it's their family. But no, people don't like to be around others that are dumber than themselves, because they can't bloody talk to each other if the one goes: ""Huh? I don't know? I don't understand?"" To everything you say. Humans are omnivores. We can eat almost anything. Another evolutionary fact that made us so successful. We can live on only raw meat if we want to. (But raw meat gives us diseases because of the germs in them) We can live on only greens (but we get deficiencies and malnutrition). IQ as you talk about is about logical thinking and problem solving. There's also EQ (Emotional Quotient) with is just as important. But when I talk about bad genes that make you stupid as you put it, I'm talking about people who can't effing live by themselves or take care of their own lives or their children because they have too big genetic deficiencies that they become stupid or their bodies don't work. They can still breed. But they probably shouldn't. Why should I hate diversity? If you have any clue about how genetics work you know that diversity is much needed. But not BAD genes. They are not needed. They will always exist, but that doesn't mean it's a good thing. Some mutations are good, but let's face it. 99% of them are actually bad or do nothing at all. Now go back to school. Bye bye!",9년 전,0,

And letting people see the animals up close, to see and interact with them, makes them more real and encourages interest in the conservation of these animals. Once they become real things and not pictures in a text book, their value in peoples' minds shoots up.",9년 전,55,

@jarynn8156,"ranerk inasa Ideally, yes.. But lets take the sharks, for an example. No, we don't have the technology to watch a shark endlessly in the wild. Our ability to watch sharks generally involves stalking it in scuba diving gear, thus disrupting its environment and potentially tainting observations.  Zoos have also been used to save species that otherwise would have vanished. Zoos are able to keep endangered species in a protected environment where they can work to rebuild the population in a controlled manner and eventually reintroduce them into the wild.  Yes, orca life expectancy drops in captivity. Our ability to handle large marine wildlife, as spoken in this video, is still a work in progress. But most animals live far longer in captivity and live far healthier lives. A well maintained zoo will provide all the environmental and social requirements an animal requires while allowing education, conservation, and research to go on.  You also cannot overstate the importance of outreach. Zoos help connect people to nature. They are emissaries for the conservationists on the field, bringing the discoveries back home and raising money and interest to keep these projects going.",9년 전,18,

@YodaDJmaster,"+Abby Lowe   It's far too late to cling to such an impossible and outdated ideal. As it stands now, the very existence of Humans on the Earth presents far more danger to animals than the processes of zookeeping. Poaching and overhunting should be priority to complain against. Not zookeeping.   Also, (even though I'm sure people tell you this all the time, telling you again wouldn't hurt so long as you understand) a zoo is far more likely to aid a species than harm one. Many species live longer in captivity than in the wild. Captivity can potentially save an entire species!  On the contrast, how often does one hear of a species going extinct due to legal captivity?

But if you think about it, keeping an animal in an enclosure where they have access to food and water, proper social interaction with other animals and a spacious enclosure with surroundings fit for the species is much easier for an animal to live in than in the wild, where they have to compete for survival with other animals and risk their life (sometimes) hunting. It&#39;s the same reason that people live in houses. We put all of our needs (food, water, warmth, shelter) in one spot and we live there as to take the &quot;surviving&quot; part out of the equation of being alive.

I wouldn't want that but there's probably a couple of people who do and they should be able to do what they want. Just imagine some random people taking you from your family, putting you in a room with glass walls so people can stare at you while you're scared out of your mind. Remember these animals don't have a choice to be in there. They can't speak out languages just to tell us to put them back in their home.

@RoyalAviator,"Except things like zoos are actually really good for animal populations. An animal might not be able to live in the wild due to any number of factors in their environment and instead of just letting them die like you're suggesting they create a sustainable environment in an enclosure at a zoo for that animal to survive, breed and continue the life of that animal specify.   Sure this is a different situation but with advancements in putting Great White Sharks into aquariums we could potentially see something similar with Great White Sharks to help combat the dwindling population. A few may die now but isn't that worth it when you can potentially save the entire specifies? It also opens up more ways of researching the animal, because currently we know an incredibly small amount about sharks in general. We can't study animals that have tiny populations and live in an area larger than the land on earth, so by putting them into an aquarium where we can research them we have the potential to learn more about them and even work out a way of how to save that species.",9년 전,4,

And it's not like the aquariums were trying to make the sharks uncomfortable.  In fact, they were doing what they could to try to make the lives of the animals as comfortable as they could in captivity.",9년 전,0,

Through the fossil record scientists can tell a lot about history such as that some high mountain ranges were once oceans home to a plethora of sea creature species that haven't existed for millions of years.   They have a particularly hard time studying the fossil record of sharks since most of their structural makeup is cartilage and not bones, they do however have teeth they leave behind.

It could swim laps in a glass doughnut all day instead of hurling itself at flat, invisible walls at high speed. Essentially, remove it's left/right options, and make it continue forward in a per-determined circle or figure-8 course. Food could be dropped in it's path from overhead openings. (Since you're holding a living thing against its will anyways, please, really spoil the shark. Make it a star. Really give that animal a great life for what you're doing to it.)  Then build your theme park/water park/attraction around it. The shark would be on display throughout the entire park. Everyone gets to see it every X amount of minutes. No bullshit scheduled appearances/obligatory shows like with Shamu. Eventually, add a second, larger pipeline throughout the park and add another shark, a whale, and/or a pod of dolphins.

Its overall cheaper to just have an aquarium for everything else, and leave the sharks in the ocean. Less resources wasted, as the video clearly stated.

@pimp963,"In an age when the internet didn't exist, the only ways to educate people were through word of mouth, books, or illustrations. So when it came to public interest in learning about animals and the creatures around us, these were the only real ways to learn. However, these methods were limited in scope and potential by a variety of factors. Transmission speed was slow - books take a while to print and distribute. Update-ability was low - revising books and illustrations take long times. Reliability was also often in question - out of date books are not that useful, and word of mouth can be easily corrupted by human memory fading. Thus, enter the concept of zoos, aquariums, and circuses, where real people can see real animals in real time. The idea and novelty of being able to see an animal you've never seen before and probably will rarely see in your lifetime drove the profitability of these businesses. Why see an animal through the lens of an illustrator, author, or storyteller if you can just see it for yourself in first-person? Then, the internet came, and today, we have massive, easily accessible, and fast database of information that is constantly cross-checked and cross-reviewed by others on the internet. It takes the best parts of speech, books, and images, combines them, and makes the result into something greater than the sum of its parts. The advent of video also plays a large role too, and you can see the animals not just captured poses, but in real action. By adding the dimension of time to our graphical records of animals, we are able to see so much more about animals - not just how they look, but also how they act. The internet in turn makes all of this material on animals easily distributable and accessible. The end result is that today, we can learn lots about animals without ever seeing them in person, and also being sure that what we learn second-hand is reliable information in most cases. Because of this, we now see less need for zoos, aquariums, and circuses, and instead see the negative qualities that made these businesses possible and feasible in the first place. What it boils down to is this: at first, people were willing to ignore the bad things about zoos and aquariums in exchange for the opportunity to learn a few things about animals in first-person (not least of which is, what do they actually look like?), but now, we don't need zoos anymore, so their negative features become more evident. With lower demand for something comes a higher scrutiny of why such a thing exists in the first place.",9년 전,0,
@LsBells,"gabriel j Yes, I know. Still doesn't change that it's wrong and always has been wrong. You can not learn about a wild animal when you view it behind bars or glass walls.

Statement remains that aquariums and zoo's (also circuses,as you brought up) have always been for entertainment to the public- they're not seaside sanctuary's or wildlife rehabilitation centres- there's nothing good about them, they are not very educational and are simply cruel (especially circuses). 👋 ",9년 전,0,

Sharks often locate prey through sensing the natural electric currents in living bodies.   Also, I think the Great White has a different feeding pattern.

It merits a more in depth investigation and this latest report is a good contribution towards issue familiarity and situational awareness for the viewers, readership and public mindshare. All too often news stories are run like infomercials without contrasting advocates or discussion, let alone debate.

@DahjerCanaan,"May or may not have anything to do with it. Sharks are primitive, they've lived for centuries & thrived in a natural habitat of the wide open seas. Compare it to dolphins, or other mammals like primates, they can adapt to their environment -- some find it more difficult to adjust of course but that's why many of them grow up & live in captivity because most who grew up in the wild generally can't cope with walls or barriers -- and as an extension animals & mammals that grow up in captivity on the opposite end of the spectrum, don't know how to survive in the wild due to dependency, the only reason a Great White was able to last & live long enough before they were released were only able to survive for a short while even after having been reintroduced back into the ocean.

@CloisteredExplorer,Alexis Toxqui just curious how you made the assumption that i dont care just from one little comment? just because i believe in the potential of the human race doesn't mean i dont care about other animals. i just dont see anything in my abilities that would be able to help out. plus its not like they purposefully went out to kill all sharks. they tried their best to keep them alive for more than a few months and failed quite a bit. did you expect them to know that a shark would have died so quickly at first? people make mistakes and learn from them therefore developing new methods to get around the same mistake. its a learning process. besides that i dont think that just because a few sharks died that the entire human race has to go.  as i said they tried to keep them alive as long as possible. how would they know if they released the shark that it would have died? if you do carry out your plan of human extermination have fun trying to kill the 7.4 billion people around the world and getting arrested for murder.,9년 전,0,

@xxayizanxx4014,"I'll just reply to all of you. Having animals in zoos is actually quite important- they raise awareness for their species. If you never saw an animals such as a lion, or tiger growing up why would you ever care about them? You have to be exposed to these animals first before deciding what to do about it, yes?  Before you scream 'murder, 'torture' or 'kidnapping', which is all ridiculous, think about it. A tiger doesn't think the same way you do, you can't apply human terms to something non-human, they're two unequal things. They don't have rational thoughts like a person does, and don't feel the same way about things you find 'terrible'.  However, that's not an excuse for zoos that don't properly take care of their animals and those few should be dealt with accordingly. All care standards must always be met, and when they are, the animals are quite content as ambassadors of their species.   And btw, tons of orcas are dying off the coast right now, but I guess since they're in the wild they don't matter as much as the few being taken care of at seaworld?",9년 전,1,

Sharks have sat atop the oceans’ food chain, keeping our seas healthy for 450 million years. They are a critical component in an ecosystem that provides 1/3 of our world with food, produces more oxygen than all the rainforests combined, removes half of the atmosphere’s manmade carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas), and controls our planet’s temperature and weather.  As the apex predators of the oceans, the role of sharks is to keep other marine life in healthy balance and to regulate the oceans. Remove sharks and that balance is seriously upset. Studies are already indicating that regional elimination of sharks can cause disastrous effects including the collapse of fisheries and the death of coral reefs.  that took me 2 seconds to google. i can not understand how anyone with so much readily available information can afford to act so ignorant.",9년 전,4,

@AnaheimZoo,"I'm not going to sit here and defend zoos and aquariums ruthlessly, because obviously they are by no means perfect places, and it is clearly wrong to keep particular animal species captive. However, for those denouncing zoos and aquariums and condemning them, I'd simply like you to (1). prove that they have not aided at all in conservation efforts, and (2). propose an alternate solution to how we can help save wild animal populations?  One thing is obvious - a lot of wild animal species have gone extinct in the past because of our actions, and a great lot of them are going to go extinct in the future, regardless of what we do. However, just leaving all wild animals alone and letting them be clearly wouldn't help them. It isn't helping them now.  I am not saying by any means that I support the capturing of wild animals to display in captive settings, or even the displaying of captive-bred animals that inherently live in the wild. (I'm also not saying that we should continue to try and make accommodations for species that simply don't fare well in captivity - if sharks keep dying in captivity, yes, leave them be, they're clearly not meant for that life.) But I am tired of people vilifying zoos when they have helped with conservation. No zoo is without its faults, and there are clearly zoos out there that really are prisons, but to say that every single one is and should be shut down is just overly-cynical and false.  I hate to say this, but the state of the environment and wild animal populations as a whole has become so poor that keeping certain animals captive is almost necessary today. I really wish that wasn't true, but I implore those of you to offer feasible solutions as to how we can fight this mass extinction without zoos and aquariums.",9년 전,0,

@TehLemonsRUs,"What about if an alien took you out of your natural habitat (Earth) from your family to study you in something the size of your room? It would be a prison sentence to you when you did nothing wrong. So stop talking about ""how are we going to study them"" when this obviously ISN'T about studying.  This is for money, monetization. Studies of aquatic animals last a few weeks and they care much for the shark's well-being, caring for it, and if in any case it comes to any physical harm too much for its own well-being they WILL release it back to the ocean.  Aquatic researchers (people with degrees and experience unlike me and you) will study these animals either in their natural habitat or for a few weeks and then release them back.  Aquariums however, are like a circus.

Now, why I disagree with holding animals in captivity is very simpel: they can very rarly, especally with big animals, be held in spaces which are apropiate for them.  However why I think its good nontheless is that if peopel can see them, they care more about them.

Take an example from the Lion King, While it's not completely real world Style, The animals are living in a region, no Humans at all, just natural life, that's similar to what I envision for the creatures of this world,  I still hate that  people think that animals are just things for fun, to make money off of, or just survival material, People don't have to make them suffer while they harvest there meat, some cultures I hate for that, even the way they treat kids, or think that Woman are slaves, or think Boys are no better then girls or Vice versa,  but that's I diffent story,  Humans should live in peace, not make you pay to get life saving medicine, or Pay a hospital for saving you life JUST cause you went in there, people should share what they make, We still gotta have rules and stuff, but I envision a world where greed and Money isn't a thing, where we can live in harmoney, but the only time I see that is in fiction Movies, Tv shows and Video games, such as Pokemon and Moana, this world is corupted in some sense, while others it's not, Why need a government, just so they can research and experment in aliens if there real and discovered, instead of giving (Friendly) aliens peace most governments would torture and destroy them, Inkmiw I went off track there.. but you get the deal.",8년 전,0,
@fusel5883,"+Lucas dunk Dunk  That’s basically what I said. You said cavemen were no more than what we call animals I said no since their language must have been so good that they could communicate Ideas.   If you don’t mean to say something like that, watch your language. “Destroy” doesn’t mean “we have to reduce our population or shrink the growing rate hence to the overpopulation of the Earth” that could be a point I could agree on. Of course, there would be the question of “How” but that’s not what we debate.   I stated clearly that I do not support unnecessary pain for the animal when they get slaughter. And of course, all humans should be treated fairly. I would never disagree with something like that.   Of course, to live in peace would be great, no one could argue with that! On the medicine part: where do you live? Because that’s why there’s Healthcare.  Do you state that a world of fiction has less real problems than the real world such as greed? Of course, that’s why they are fictional. Because the real world is way more complicated.   A government is one of the most important parts in our society. They make the laws, they maintain public property, they found more than science! You said that we need rules but who would take care that they are been followed?   In general, you seem to like the idea of communism. While I agree it’s a good Idea that’s where it ends. It doesn’t work in the real world. Money is needed. While there are some videos here on YT that suggest a way of a world without money, most of them either introduce a different form of money or have the everyone would work. The problem without money is: who would work as a sewage worker if they wouldn’t get paid? I highly doubt it that anyone enjoys it to work in sewage.   Yes, Greed is something bad but it is something that makes us human. Not only love, friendship and kindness make us human but also the shadow side. The truth is that life is neither only good nor fair but it’s the only shoot you get, so make it count! Especially greed can be explained genetically. To read into this I would recommend: “the selfish Gene” by Richard Dawins.   No Government I could ever think of would torture Aliens! What for? They couldn’t tell them anything since no one speaks their language and vise versa. If we would experience first contact, every nation would try to make peace with them because they are bloody Aliens! Any species that can travel through space within an affordable time would be way to powerful to fight. That would be the equivalent of fighting a Tank with a stick.

No animal apart from chimpanzees and some whales have the brain adaptions to have the necessary rights, as other animals either are unaffected in their reality as they dont feel negative emotion, dont recognise themselves as an entity or have this long term intelligence in which they can consider the future and are therefore indifferent apart from pain reception that we often sympathise with as we place our human perception of reality onto them.",9년 전,0,

I believe we have the right to use animals to our advantage, however I think they should be truly to our advantage. What I mean is if we hunted and killed every animal that would be to our advantage in that we would have food for everyone for generations, but we would be obviously far worse off in the long run and the world would essentially collapse.

@AngryKittens,"TheFlowMind Again, you are making the assumption that the Monterey Bay Aquarium is doing this for money. MBA is a non-profit organization. They do what they do for conservation and research, as well as outreach. It is run by scientists, not by corporations or entertainment executives. 2/3rds of their workforce are volunteers, and they don't keep whales or dolphins or any large mammals.  MBA is also the sister organization of MBARI. Another non-profit dedicated to conservation, research, and oceanographic exploration, famous for their deep sea ROV submarines. The latter is one of the most respected scientific organizations in the world, and can be characterized as the NASA of the deep sea.  Moreover don't anthropomorphize animals by assuming they want freedom like humans do. The vast majority of animals live in very tiny environments, and they acclimate very well to captivity. As long as it resembles their natural habitat closely enough, they will usually thrive far better than in the wild.  It is usually only with larger animals that captivity becomes more problematic. But sometimes it is unavoidable in the interests of preventing them from going extinct in the first place.  That is the case here with great white sharks. Despite having multiple movies made about them, we actually know very little about them in real life. To conserve them, we must understand them first.  Sure, places like SeaWorld are horrible. But not all zoos and aquaria are there to exploit animals. Some are there to help.",9년 전,1,

If a big brand aquariums were to do that, they'll hit bankruptcy first due to the funds it'll need to create this tank that could ""suit"" the great whites. Another issue would be due to the captivity, in the end they'll be just swimming around in a box ( or circle) and like in the video, they'll be bumping into the glass no matter what, and to even breed the sharks would be a hard question. I get your idea, but the amount of efforts, funds, and chances of reproduction, and survival..idk about the odds.",9년 전,1,

I personally will not go to zoos or aquariums because I feel they do more bad than good.   so many obese children and adults roam the world now because everything is at your finger tips. no one knows what it's like to go out there and experience nature with out a gopro or a film crew or the best selfie. take your shoes off, feel the dirt between your toes. even if all you see is a pigeon, you saw it, not someone else. it's your moment, not your friends live feed.",9년 전,0,
@yoshih9,"In an age when the internet didn't exist, the only ways to educate people were through word of mouth, books, or illustrations. So when it came to public interest in learning about animals and the creatures around us, these were the only real ways to learn. However, these methods were limited in scope and potential by a variety of factors. Transmission speed was slow - books take a while to print and distribute. Update-ability was low - revising books and illustrations take long times. Reliability was also often in question - out of date books are not that useful, and word of mouth can be easily corrupted by human memory fading. Thus, enter the concept of zoos, aquariums, and circuses, where real people can see real animals in real time. The idea and novelty of being able to see an animal you've never seen before and probably will rarely see in your lifetime drove the profitability of these businesses. Why see an animal through the lens of an illustrator, author, or storyteller if you can just see it for yourself in first-person? Then, the internet came, and today, we have massive, easily accessible, and fast database of information that is constantly cross-checked and cross-reviewed by others on the internet. It takes the best parts of speech, books, and images, combines them, and makes the result into something greater than the sum of its parts. The advent of video also plays a large role too, and you can see the animals not just captured poses, but in real action. By adding the dimension of time to our graphical records of animals, we are able to see so much more about animals - not just how they look, but also how they act. The internet in turn makes all of this material on animals easily distributable and accessible. The end result is that today, we can learn lots about animals without ever seeing them in person, and also being sure that what we learn second-hand is reliable information in most cases. Because of this, we now see less need for zoos, aquariums, and circuses, and instead see the negative qualities that made these businesses possible and feasible in the first place. What it boils down to is this: at first, people were willing to ignore the bad things about zoos and aquariums in exchange for the opportunity to learn a few things about animals in first-person (not least of which is, what do they actually look like?), but now, we don't need zoos anymore, so their negative features become more evident. With lower demand for something comes a higher scrutiny of why such a thing exists in the first place.",9년 전,1,

And to add on to that, there is no law saying that men can't hit women but women can hit men. that's old fashioned chivalry, which, from what I gather from comments on videos with political agendas, is what modern western feminism is supposedly against (i.e. opening doors for ladies, pulling out their chairs, men paying for meals, etc.) and what people against modern western feminism are supposedly defending (how dare someone be kind to you, it's just chivalry get over yourself, etc). in other terms, you being upset that you can't hit a woman is you being upset with the morals of classic chivalry, which is what modern western feminists are against.

@enjogior5489,"Some Zoos (called Zoos but are actually more like reserves and sanctuaries) do help some species of animals, especially herbivores who are close to extinction and other smaller species. The sad thing is, people don't go to zoos to see bugs and smaller creatures, they want to see exiting species, but unfortunately those species aren't meant for Zoos. Some animals who've lived in captivity all their lives and are rescued though are often put in safer zoos/sanctuaries because they simply cannot survive in the wild. I'm ok with seeing that, because with the money you give those non-profit sanctuaries they can improve the lives of the animals who live there.

You get into the cage, dive in a wet suit, but without scuba tanks so as to not disturb the sharks with the additional noise. So it all boils down to you being able to hold your breath and wait. During the seal season a large number of great whies congregate there for food and mating.  The sharks are attracted via chumming, but are NOT fed from the boats, so that they do not associate boats with food. Instead, they are drawn towards the seal rocks which make up shark alley.  I had the privilege of seeing a 3.5 meter great white give a test bite into the lower right corner of our cage.

@lujoja8226,"Simply, its because great whites are used to moving huge distances in the open ocean; they can't cope with small spaces - they just stop eating properly and get stressed, or damage themselves because they keep swimming into the glass walls. Also, adult great whites feed on aquatic mammals like seals and sea lions etc. - thus their dietary needs cannot be met in captivity anyway, which is why they can only really keep young ones in the first place.   Nurse sharks, lemon sharks, and other types of sharks that live in coral reefs seem to be able to live in captivity, the larger ocean-going sharks, like the great white, cannot cope. The reason for this is because these smaller reef sharks spend their lives in the same reef and don't move great distances in the wild, so they can cope with staying in one area. Also a coral reef is easy to replicate; and since their diet is fish, their dietary needs can be sustained in captivity. Whereas, the bigger ocean-going sharks like the great whites are itinerant, and wander the oceans all over the world, swimming thousands of miles. Their natural habitat therefore is not replicable because they need huge areas to roam, and in the wild they transition between different habitats as they wander around.  Their impulse is to wander huge distances freely; they can't cope in confined spaces. In comparison, smaller sharks naturally stay in the same reef so can cope with being confined to one area, unlike the larger ocean-going sharks like the great white.",9년 전,0,

@kylew728,+robert karas so you are saying that keeping them in captivity will allow us to learn where they breed? Pretty stupid thing to say.

This will allows us to help protect that area and add protection to areas that they commonly go to. If they can't even get one great white to live more than A year in captivity then how do you think they will be able to get two of them (one male and one female) to breed and give birth. Even if they did this and it worked it would provide absolutely nothing to helping the species out. It wouldn't tell us where they breed in the wild or where they give birth. Taking the white out of its natural habitat would provide nothing to the further the study of them. Wouldn't further the knowledge on their migration patterns or anything.,9년 전,0,

@Rowow,"Kyle W Research a bit into breeding marine organisms, its not as simple as it sounds. For many organisms you need the right lighting, and the right temperature, and the right salinity, and the right phosphates and calcium and this and that.  Lighting can easily tell us what time of the day, or if its only during the blue spectrum then we know they breed at deep water.   Salinity can easily tell us where in the ocean they breed, near the coastal inlets or in the middle of the ocean with the highest salinity.  Phosphates can allow us yet agian to know where in the world they breed. In the gulfs where nutrients stack up or in the open ocean.  Calcium same thing, and so on and so forth.  By knowing these things for other organisms such as oysters, shrimp, fish, etc, we have learned so much in their life in a such quicker amount of time. We can also track them, however that's far more expensive and far longer then learning from them in captivity. The following 3 things I listed help us know exactly where they breed.

Many zoos also have breeding programs for all kinds of species, endangered or not, and learn even more about the species during the breeding, and rearing process. All this knowledge and information is shared with visitors, organizations, and other programs alike. There are certainly zoos that do nothing but display animals, but so many have broadened their exhibit goals, and expanded their species scope of responsibility, that each zoo really needs to be judged on it's own merits.
