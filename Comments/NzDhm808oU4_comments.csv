@nickwilliams9887," @theMelvinShow   After been given information provided by Britains Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher…..Queen Elizabeth 2nd declared U.K. at war in the Falklands in 1982.  This was after the Iranian Embassy siege in London where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced the world to the SAS and Britains response to the terrorist attack. Queen Victoria declared war against Russia in 1854 during the Crimean War.  Anglo Zulu wars were declared in 1879. The famous battle of Rorkes Drift was one of the most memorable of this war.  In 1585 Queen Elizabeth officially declared England at war with Spain.  Not to forget Catherine The Great and  the Pharaoh Cleopatra and wars which began on their watch! There are others of course…..but these are just some of the obvious ones!",1년 전(수정됨),1,
@nickwilliams9887," @rosethorne9155   In 1982, Britain was officially declared at war with Argentina in the Falkland Islands by Queen Elizabeth after a meeting with Englands prime minister Margaret Thatcher.  Queen Victoria declared England at war with Russia in 1854.  Queen Victoria declared England at war with the Zulu tribes in Africa in 1879. Queen Elizabeth declared England at war with Spain in 1585. In 1768 the Russian Empire went to war against the famous Ottoman Empire under the rule of Catherine The Great.  These are just 5 examples.",1년 전,1,
@rosethorne9155," @nickwilliams9887   I will accept this answer. Now please list all the wars started by male rulers.  All of them, please.   (None of this proves that woman leaders are more bloodthirsty or more dangerous than men, btw--all the female rulers had things in common with the male rulers was that they were heads of empires that went to war to expand their empires. The point that a woman would annihilate the world if given the nuclear launch codes is what the Trump supporter was not making. I do not believe that to be an accurate assessment.)",1년 전,0,
@rosethorne9155," @nickwilliams9887   And of those 5 examples, 2 were the direct result of situations those women leaders were left in because of actions done by their male precedessors... Queen Elizabeth I went to war with Spain because of what her father did splitting from the church, and with Spain backing her sister as the rightful queen as seen by the catholic church. That was her father's fault. The same could be said of Queen Victoria, whose rule over England and wars in Africa were precipitated by her *grandfather and uncle Leopold's invasions into Africa in search of slaves and gold.  I am not absolving them of what they did,  or saying that all women leaders would be saints. Merely pointing out that being the head of an empire will make one behave in such a way. Their behavior as rulers would be unremarkable if they were men.   It is interesting to me that several of those examples are people from the same royal family, however...almost as if they were simply following the family empire's trajectory. As hereditary heads of state are known to do.  *small edit",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@nickwilliams9887," @rosethorne9155   I’m not sure I understand the point you are trying to make here….. There has always been war in history, and when a person is in power they make the decision whether or not to go to war during their reign. Leaders can decide to make peace with a country, or go to war with them. Just because a leaders parent had feuds with a leader previously is not a reason to send your country to war again. You have the option available to shake hands and let bygones be bygones, create new fabrics of society and build new industries, or you can go to war with them. Queen Victoria could have decided not to go to war, but she chose to go to war instead. It wasn’t because of her father, she had the option not to take Britain into another war, but SHE alone made the decision. Woman are capable in having the same brutal mindset as men when it comes to warfare. No war itself is justified. It is always wrong, whoever the leader is, make or female. Two facts we have been taught by history is  1. Both men and women are capable of starting and ending a war.  2. We have not learnt that war is pointless.

And by him doing so is by exposing the corruption that sits in both the democratic and republican party.

After listening to to so many that voiced their reality that there was nothing Trump could do that would change their devotion to him I realized trying to use facts or decency was a waste of time.  When a guy bashes Obama for not being in the White House when 9/11 had just taken place made him a horrible person.  Of course the man had no idea why Obama could not be there and that was because Obama was NOT President at the time, George W was.

You have to understand that Afghan's own military won't protect them from the Taliban so how exactly are we supposed to protect them? Yes, I know that this decision has caused lots of suffering to Afghanistan people and every day when I see the news I wish and pray that people like the Taliban just disappear of the face of planet Earth. But sometimes u have to deal with reality and the reality is that we can't protect Afghans forever and if we could then I would say go for it but Biden's job is to protect America and not Afganistan. There was never a time where it was the right time to pull out U.S troops but there will never be a right time. And it's hard decisions like this that make it impossible to be president but that's why we have to choose the right people to protect us and everyone else in this country. So maybe u get where I'm coming from maybe you don't but try to look at the situation from both sides and make sure your opinion isn't based on someone else's.",4년 전,10,

@pmpowalisz," @sad_ia5883  our government could have done a much better job at looking at the reality of Afghanistan and creating a government that actually fits that reality instead of copying and pasting our own government model. While the Afghan government was way too corrupt to be functional, the Afghan military was decently protecting most of the country since 2014, right up in till trump pulled our military’s vital air/logistics/advisory support (minimal effort and cost for us btw) in early 2020. After that it took a year for the Afghan military to implode. President Biden still had time to reverse this, but chose to mostly stay the dumb trump course (instead of organizing the Afghan military to where it could function without our direct military support), and is probably the worst decision of his presidency. When we invaded Afghanistan in 2001, we made a promise to the Afghan people, and we broke that promise, even though we could have fulfilled it with minimal effort for the next few decades. Oh and we lost another war, we gave up on it for being to long ugh.",3년 전,0,

You guys are going to try to run this country into the ground with your socialist ideas and then when you figure out that you just destroyed a free country you're going to blame everybody but yourself,4년 전,0,

Of course hitler is wayy worse in terms of violence but the comparison is still there. And it’s not proof that America is uneducated. It’s proof that just like hitler, trump can plant a seed in peoples minds and basically brainwash them to do the unthinkable. Just take the capitol riot for example. Trump had his supporters on his side and he knew damn well that if he told them to storm the capitol, they would. And the supporters listened because they will do anything trump tells them to.

Other countries do this well with a waiting period until you get the gun to prevent impulsive buying. And also making ammunition expensive.  Many gun deaths are accidental.

Uneducated people whose parents BUY them degrees will always feel it! The farcical behaviour when they visited Europe showed the world that here’s a classic example MONEY DOES NOT EQUAL OR REPLACE CLASS!

@animalpeeps,"With the hyphen connecting the years (like 2024-2028), that implies that the years served are the 4 years between those two numbers. So it's only those 4 years.  By your logic, that means between 2024-2028, the person would win an election each of those 4 years... Which we don't do. If the guy's numbers wanted to work for the ""elections won,"" it would need to be listed something like ""2024, 2028"" rather than having the hyphen between the two numbers. But since there's the hyphen on the guys shirt, it completely means ""in office between 2024 through 2028,"" not ""won the election for 2024 and 2028.""",3년 전,0,

@jenniferp1917," @liam137153  I was thinking of that during that segment, as well. Like you, I understood what the man wearing the shirt meant, that each year shown represented the year the person was elected or re-elected, thus each had two terms. HOWEVER, the normal (correct) way to write the years a president served is to write the year sworn in through the year of leaving office (whether by death, resignation, or leaving due to term limits or having been defeated and the successor sworn in.) Thus, Obama 2009-2017 is the correct way to denote that he served two terms/eight years. You don't write ""Obama 2008-2012"" to represent the two election years that he won.  If you REALLY want to denote the specific years they won elections (instead of the span of time they served), you would use a comma or the word ""and"" to separate the two years, rather than a dash, because a dash means ""through,"" as in ""Obama was president from 2009 through 2017."" If you want to talk about years they won elections instead of years that they served, you would write something like, ""Obama won presidential elections in 2008 and 2012.""  Also, when writing the years a president served, you start with the year of INAUGURATION, which is NOT the same as the year of winning the election.    Leaving a gap between years doesn't denote that there was ""no"" president; it would mean someone else (not listed) was president during that time. Like if you're only listing, for instance, Republican presidents, there will be years in between them where you haven't listed a name, but someone was president.  TL;DR - that guy in the shirt was TRYING to say that each of those Trump family members would win two terms in the future, but he completely and epically screwed up how you write down a president's term in office, and was completely oblivious to that fact.",4년 전,10,
@jenniferp1917," @user-bg6cp5fw6n  Yes but anybody could have been president during those 4 years. And, you don't list presidential terms by the election years. His shirt was just an incorrect, amateur mess that did not say what he thought it did.",4년 전,0,

Plus, it´s not my fault the Republicans got flooded with Democrats through Blexit 3% increase in colored people vote for Trump. From 8% in 2016 to 12% in 2020. There were hundreds of thousands of your kind who left the party and picked up the red hats. So of course there will be few ignorant Republicans. The pieces that were not cut and edited. Were probably former Democrats.  And great to know you took interest in where I live. It´s literally the greatest country in the world. Admit it, you had to use ""Google Maps"" to find it. Or you would never have taken the lord's name in vain and told me to stay out in the ocean...  A person who does not know geographics would not have mixed the Icelandic island with the ocean. Shows what you know... and even more embarrassing, I am still there. So telling me to stay there gets you what?  I should probably also mention. The average IQ for your country is 98 and under. The average IQ for the Icelandic people is 104 and above. As in, Republican. Democrat. Trump or Biden is not the reason why the world is laughing at you... We have been doing it for almost 3 decades. That I personally know of. So don´t come here high and mighty telling me to stay, where I am. When I am obviously where I am. ​ Your brain cells did not figure that out.  Just accept you are not smart because you did not notice all the ""clips"" before. And found what 1? Where there was not a cut... Very well done. I applaud you. You did notice it yet you defend it...

@assjam3104," @SC_2QUICK  Yikes. Apparently you can’t even look it up yourself, but here’s the evidence of Trump being a flat out racist babe; 2010: In 2010, there was a huge national controversy over the “Ground Zero Mosque” — a proposal to build a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Trump opposed the project, calling it “insensitive,” and offered to buy out one of the investors in the project. On The Late Show With David Letterman, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, “Well, somebody’s blowing us up. Somebody’s blowing up buildings, and somebody’s doing lots of bad stuff.” 2011: Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first Black president — was not born in the US. He claimed to send investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama’s birth certificate. Obama later released his birth certificate, calling Trump a “carnival barker.” The research has found a strong correlation between birtherism, as the conspiracy theory is called, and racism. But Trump has reportedly continued pushing this conspiracy theory in private. 2011: While Trump suggested that Obama wasn’t born in the US, he also argued that maybe Obama wasn’t a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed, “I heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?” Trump launched his campaign in 2015 by calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” who are “bringing crime” and “bringing drugs” to the US. His campaign was largely built on building a wall to keep these immigrants out of the US. As a candidate in 2015, Trump called for a ban on all Muslims coming into the US. His administration eventually implemented a significantly watered-down version of the policy.",4년 전,17,
@assjam3104," @SC_2QUICK  Anywaysss, let’s continue w Trump’s racist past and present shall we? When asked at a 2016 Republican debate whether all 1.6 billion Muslims hate the US, Trump said, “I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them.” He argued in 2016 that Judge Gonzalo Curiel — who was overseeing the Trump University lawsuit — should recuse himself from the case because of his Mexican heritage and membership in a Latino lawyers association. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who endorsed Trump, later called such comments “the textbook definition of a racist comment.” Trump has been repeatedly slow to condemn white supremacists who endorse him, and he regularly retweeted messages from white supremacists and neo-Nazis during his presidential campaign. He tweeted and later deleted an image that showed Hillary Clinton in front of a pile of money and by a Jewish Star of David that said, “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!” The tweet had some very obvious anti-Semitic imagery, but Trump insisted that the star was a sheriff’s badge, and said his campaign shouldn’t have deleted it. Trump has repeatedly referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) as “Pocahontas,” using her controversial — and later walked-back — claims to Native American heritage as a punchline. As a Native American woman, I find this extremely disgusting. At the 2016 Republican convention, Trump officially seized the mantle of the “law and order” candidate — an obvious dog whistle playing to white fears of Black crime, even though crime in the US is historically low. His speeches, comments, and executive actions after he took office have continued this line of messaging. In a pitch to Black voters in 2016, Trump said, “You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?”  Trump stereotyped a Black reporter at a press conference in February 2017. When April Ryan asked him if he plans to meet and work with the Congressional Black Caucus, he repeatedly asked her to set up the meeting — even as she insisted that she’s “just a reporter.”",4년 전,18,
@assjam3104," @SC_2QUICK  Yooo!! We can still continue!! In the week after white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, Trump repeatedly said that “many sides” and “both sides” were to blame for the violence and chaos that ensued — suggesting that the white supremacist protesters were morally equivalent to counterprotesters who stood against racism. He also said that there were “some very fine people” among the white supremacists. All of this seemed like a dog whistle to white supremacists — and many of them took it as one, with white nationalist Richard Spencer praising Trump for “defending the truth.” Throughout 2017, Trump repeatedly attacked NFL players who, by kneeling or otherwise silently protesting during the national anthem, demonstrated against systemic racism in America. Trump reportedly said in 2017 that people who came to the US from Haiti “all have AIDS,” and he lamented that people who came to the US from Nigeria would never “go back to their huts” once they saw America. The White House denied that Trump ever made these comments. Speaking about immigration in a bipartisan meeting in January 2018, Trump reportedly asked, in reference to Haiti and African countries, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” He then reportedly suggested that the US should take more people from countries like Norway. The implication: Immigrants from predominantly white countries are good, while immigrants from predominantly Black countries are bad. Trump denied making the “shithole” comments, although some senators present at the meeting said they happened. The White House, meanwhile, suggested that the comments, like Trump’s remarks about the NFL protests, will play well to his base. The only connection between Trump’s remarks about the NFL protests and his “shithole” comments is race.",4년 전,18,
@assjam3104," @SC_2QUICK  Oh, he also mocked the Trail of Tears, hun. Trump mocked Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, again calling her “Pocahontas” in a 2019 tweet before adding, “See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!” The capitalized “TRAIL” is seemingly a reference to the Trail of Tears — a horrific act of ethnic cleansing in the 19th century in which Native Americans were forcibly relocated, causing thousands of deaths. Trump tweeted later that year that several Black and brown members of Congress — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) — are “from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe” and that they should “go back” to those countries. It’s a common racist trope to say that Black and brown people, particularly immigrants, should go back to their countries of origin. Three of the four members of Congress whom Trump targeted were born in the US. Trump has called the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu.” The World Health Organization advises against linking a virus to any particular region, since it can lead to stigma. Trump’s adviser, Kellyanne Conway, previously described the term “kung flu” as “highly offensive.” Meanwhile, Asian Americans have reported hateful incidents targeting them due to the spread of the coronavirus.

@cameronhouse23, @TheHeavenlyUrchin  what are you trying to say here,4년 전,0,
@cameronhouse23," @TheHeavenlyUrchin  there are different types of abortion. The main ones are with a pill, vacuum, and the plucking. With the pill, it literally rots the baby away in the mother's womb. As the process goes on the mother starts dropping blood out her vagina and the limbs of the baby fall out one by one. The mother suffers. So tell me watching your child fall apart limb by limb is not suffering? It causes sever e pain to the mother to feel and to watch. The vacuum affect is when they go in through the vagina and open the womb. There, a vacuum sucks the baby out. This may seem ok, but the full baby does not just fall out. It sucks out the organs, limbs, bones, etc until it is small enough to be pulled out. The plucking procedure is when the doctor goes in with tweezers and other tools to pull the arms, legs, and head off the baby until the only thing left is the torso. Then they pull it out.

@antislit_4938,@?????? k ima tell u why but first I should let u know that 88% of tax payers reported lower taxes (https://www.policygenius.com/taxes/who-benefited-most-from-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/)  so ur already wrong. Trump lowered taxes on big business to encourage them to ACTUALLY pay their taxes in the first place because when taxes are to high companies like apple will hide their money  in different countries with little to no business tax entill the u.s business taxes are lowered so they can move their money back to the US so if trump didn't lower taxes apples money won't leave its shelter. Another reason for lower business tax is growth trump wants more jobs so to get them he allows business more capital letting them grow and create a ton of jobs this worked as unemployment rates were at a extreme low (3.7 percent in 2019 before the lock down  https://www.statista.com/statistics/193290/unemployment-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/#:~:text=Unemployment%20rate%20stood%20at%203.7%20percent%20in%202019 ).

Trump told the police forces to not engage until Mike Pence started dealing with things. You can say something, but when all of his actions up to that point promote violence, it doesn’t matter what he said at the last minute. Also, there are videos of Republicans destroying stuff too.

And if you want to talk about black people, he said if they dont vote for him then they aint black. he also proceeded to call them roaches. Not to mention he's a pedophile and you cant argue that with me because both sides know he is.

@notablesquid968," @Imadino-123  Being a woman does not define how good you are at your job. It's like how Barack Obama was the first black president but did that make him a good president? NO! If you pull back the curtain and undermine what the media want you to believe you would see that Kamala is actually a pretty awful person. Now I am not against black people or women being in power but we need the right person for the job and Kamala is definitely not the right person for the job. So before you go praising someone just because of their gender/race etc maybe dig deeper and consider if they are right for the job. We need a woman president yes but we also need someone who can run the country and Kamala definitely can NOTT do the job. So repeat after me ""your gender and race does not define whether you are good at what you do.""",4년 전,0,
@Imadino-123," @notablesquid968  Did I say it did? No. I said it was exiting that we have out first black and female VP. I think we can both agree that it’s disappointing that it took this long to happen. Also, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are PERFECTLY (well, nobody’s perfect at their job) CAPABLE of doing their jobs. Just ask the American people! Oh wait- they did.",4년 전,0,
@notablesquid968," @Imadino-123  But you were congratulating her for being the first female VP and woman of colors. Race and gender means literally nothing like why do you care so much about the skin colors and gender of someone in power? Also you said ask the American people whether they are capable. Don't trust them. I saw a news report recently and it said that more than half of all Biden voters are voting for Joe not because they like him and think he's a good president but because they just want to have Trump out of the office. So you Democrats could be electing a sheep for all you know but don't care as long as it's not Trump. You're whole battle cry is literally ""vote blue no matter who s."" Says a lot doesn't it? Just to show how blind you are Joe Biden said he is going to ban fracking without realising how much that will damage Texas and Psnnsylvania economy wise. Then during the debate he claimed that he never said he would ban fracking even though the evidence is there. He changes his mind because he knew that he couldn't win without Pennsylvania and he has supposedly managed to manipulate enough people to get Pennsylvania to vote for him. I added the word supposedly because I'm not convinced that this election was fair but let's not go down that road. You can call me a triggered trumptard and other overused insults all you want but the jokes on you because I don't really support any party. If I had to choose though I would go republican.

@JacobScheps," @cameronhouse23 , the reason ""we're"" impeaching him after his term is because no one wants him running again. 12 repuplican Senators voted to Impeach. You realize that Donald J. Trump, nearly started WW3, encouraged his own supporters to become terrorists and to try and hang the Vice president, crashed the U.S economy, and has put countless people in the Eletric Chair over race. The people who want Trump dont care about this country, they dont care about the people who lead this country, and most importantly, they would love to see it come down in flames like our Democracy almost did on the 6th of January, 2021. One last thing, do you really agree with him about ""trying out"" communism, is that really how you want the strongest Union in the entire History of the world to fall. September 17, 1787. The Constitution was held before the American people. The 22nd ammendmant was also brought in. The 22nd amendment was the act of the President, having limits. A certain limit isnt to be talking about moving forward Communism in a Democracy. Its sad that all Trumpers are like you and dont care about the aftermath of this Country.

Why does he not put all the guys that he films and pick whoever he wants , showing few if any argumentative trump supportes? I Bet anyone can do the same with biden supporters or anybodys supporters. Actually many people have done that. But if you choose to do this on Trumps supporters why don't you do the same to the other party as well ? Why so one-sided ? Don't you think that is unethical/immoral. Why only show half the truth ? As they say half the truth is worse than a lie. Maybe beacuse you want to deliberately change/influence peoples minds rather than be objective. Now if you look it up that is the defenition of propaganda. Also Mr.Trevor keep in mind that by constantly telling half the story to such a large audience you pollarize and divide the people.

I'm saying that conservatives have this idea that women are more emotional than men, and that men are the logical ones. There is no logical way to make this argument, so it is an argument from emotion, regardless of the gender of the person who's making it. You would have to be an individual who is more emotional than logical to make this argument.

Why does he not put all the guys that he films but instead picks whoever he wants , showing few if any argumentative trump supportes? I Bet anyone can do the same with biden supporters or anybodys supporters. It is very easy to go to a rally interview a bunch of people and pick the stupidest of them and put them in a video.  Actually many people have done that.I assure you Mr.Biden have no less stupid supporters than Mr.Trump.   But if you choose to do this on Trumps supporters why don't you do the same to the other party as well ? Why so one-sided ? Don't you think that is unethical/immoral. Why only show half the truth ? As they say half the truth is worse than a lie. Maybe beacuse you want to deliberately change/influence peoples minds rather than be objective. Now if you look it up that is the defenition of propaganda. Also Mr.Trevor should keep in mind that by constantly telling half the story to such a large audience you pollarize and divide the people.

@jdamah," @nonononononono2022   Donald Trump graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and anthropology. Mensa doesn't accept SAT scores from after 1994. However, Mr. Trump was a student at Wharton when it was possible to derive an accurate IQ core from known SAT scores. Given the usual requirements for admission to a top school like Wharton, I estimate that Mr. Trump has a 156 IQ at the minimum.  ""The standard description of this level of intelligence is 'Genius - Exceptional intellectual ability and capable of looking beyond known facts.' However, the percentile rating is more revealing than the raw score. A 156 IQ is at the 99.9905490555 percentile. That means that Donald Trump is smarter than 99.99 percent of the people on planet Earth. Not only does Trump qualify for membership in Mensa, but he could join the Triple Nine Society [people scoring at or above the 99.9th percentile on selected intelligence tests].""",4년 전,0,

@carlosbaba4216," @zoisantonopoulos7999  If you know basic economics, you’d understand that Trump cannot just cut taxes and increase government spending dramatically.

Imagine you quit your job yet decide to take on major debt without any source of income, that’s precisely what he’s doing. Even though we won’t feel the effects until decades later, One day a president is gonna be forced to tax us all 10-20% more to pay off the massive debt Trump accumulated. Anyone with a basic understanding of macroeconomics knows for the Baby Boomers this won’t matter but for millennials and Gen Z, our generations are gonna have to deal with the consequences.  And if you don’t believe that’s possible, remember Germany after WW1 had to tax its citizens insane rates because of the massive debt they carried. We all know what that led to...",5년 전(수정됨),1,
@zoisantonopoulos7999," @carlosbaba4216  What happened to Germany after ww1 is a whole another matter we can't possibly explain right now. I agree with your comment just a few thoughts. Less taxes doesn't necessarily mean the gov will receive less taxes. Less taxes can lead to more businesses -> more people working to tax -> more products to tax. Can't say if we don't have the whole tax data from the ministry of economy. Also , true , my generation is paying for mistakes of our past generations ( not living in us ) . This has always been the case. Just like any mistakes i make will affect my kids.",5년 전,1,
@carlosbaba4216," @zoisantonopoulos7999  Lower taxes incentivizing more small businesses would work in a perfectly competitive market however, due to the rise of internet, stricter regulations put in place to start a business and simply consumer tastes shifting, most small businesses aren’t able to take advantage of lower taxes and you’re able to see that as small town shopping districts have gone out of business as well as the dying of America’s Malls.   This happened before covid as well. As much as Trump has attempted to aid the economy through lower taxes, the economy has only been booming because of three reasons,   1: Previous presidents decades ago who implemented policies to boost the economy are only now taking effect, 2: Tech Boom, and 3: Trump’s been injecting federal funding into the economy which isn’t backed up by taxes.   Short term aid, long term damage.   I agree with backing up republicans more in Congress to hopefully remove a lot of the limitations placed against small business. But for the executive branch in these precarious times, a democratic president is needed to fund restoration without hurting government debt. Remember Hoover’s conservative policies during the Great Depression did little in aid while FDR pulled the US out of it and through WW2.",5년 전,1,
@zoisantonopoulos7999," @carlosbaba4216  Biden's plan to increase taxation will not boost the economy right now nor in the future. About FDR , i am not sure what to believe. Many say what he did was genius many say it was the economy reaching a new equilibrium. I can't comment on that. However the economy in the US is not weak by any measure. You have had lower taxes than us in Europe for at least 150 years. Also , ww1 made you the superpower you are today. The US got RICH from selling guns and supplies to the allies , so FDR managing it doesn't sound that hard of a job. The thing is , economic growth doesn't happen when you have high taxes if you consider only these parameters. High taxes -> smaller economy. That doesn't mean that when you have high taxes the economy will necessarily suffer because there are infinite other parameters to this equation. Look at my country , Greece. Decades of government spending , way too high wages etc. Of course it is not sustainable forever. But our current government has done a much better job at improving the economy than their left counterparts. They made the process of starting a business easier , you don't need a fairly large amount of money to even be eligible to start your business. Lower taxes , specifically something like what trump does with his opportunity zones. Before covid , the people did notice those improvements. On the other hand , the government before this one increased taxes , increased social services etc. It's all about what you want to accomplish. There is no golden solution , but if we are talking about economic growth i would 100% prefer a republican .",5년 전,0,

@WA_S_S_AW,"Totally clueless and they are walking and talking.  I wonder if they are aware of the latest development.  Health insurance company leaves Oklahoma’s Trump supporters high and dry.  Ronald and Leslie Fulton attended President Trump’s Oklahoma City rally and were diagnosed with Covid less than two weeks later.  Ronald required hospitalization where he spent a week being intubated and placed in a medically induced coma.  Leslie fared better but still has lingering conditions stemming from the disease.  90 days later the collection calls and demand for payment letters started.  Ronald and Leslie’s health insurance company denied payment to the providers saying that Ronald and Leslie purposely participated in activities that are classified as reckless and are a well known and commonly understood risk factor for disease or death.    Ronald and Leslie Fulton are not alone as both life and health insurance companies are lowering coverages and denying claims across the country based on the insureds provable risky behavior.  The Fulton’s both signed and agreed to a release of liability for the venue, organizers and presenters of the rally held in Oklahoma City and when they signed that release they were stating that they understood that attendance was inherently dangerous and that they would be solely responsible for any consequences or damages  that arose from said attendance.   Ronald and Leslie are appealing their insurance companies decision but are unlikely to win their appeal since the policies that allow this have been a standard practice of insurance carriers for 60 years or longer.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@jpungello,"Cancer has killed over 1,012,000 Americans in the past two years, 30,300,000 in the past 5 years! With no cure in sight! Covid death rate projected to hit 300,000 by January. Covid will never approach cancer numbers. Covid death rates continuously drop even while cases rise, lowering the mortality rate. You should be far more worried about dying of cancer than covid. Covid average death age is 82.4! Cancer kills little children, healthy 20 yr olds and seniors. You should be pushing the government for a cancer cure rather than a covid cure! Forgive me if I'm not afraid of a virus that kills less people than cigarettes (480,000 Americans die from cigarettes every single year 41,000 die from second hand smoke) . For the record, Sweden did not lock down and very little mask wearing and now the US has a higher per capita death rate from Covid. Not to mention the negative effects of lockdowns like, increased over doses, people in higher stages of disease that could not be diagnosed until now, social unrest, loss of business, jobs, homes, and total destruction of economy and quality of life for a virus that so far has killed less people than obesity,which will continue killing people long after covid is gone, good thing the gyms are closed and Dunkin donuts is essential!

BUT why the video only shows these kind of people, are there really no Mr.Trump supporter that is logical ? Did Mr.Klepper  intentionally not show those who respond logically ? Why does he not put all the guys that he films but instead picks whoever he wants , showing few if any argumentative trump supportes? I Bet anyone can do the same with biden supporters or anybodys supporters. It is very easy to go to a rally interview a bunch of people and pick the stupidest of them and put them in a video.  Actually many people have done that.I assure you Mr.Biden have no less stupid supporters than Mr.Trump.   But if you choose to do this on Trumps supporters why don't you do the same to the other party as well ? Why so one-sided ? Don't you think that is unethical/immoral. Why only show half the truth ? As they say half the truth is worse than a lie. Maybe beacuse you want to deliberately change/influence peoples minds rather than be objective. Now if you look it up that is the defenition of propaganda. Also Mr.Trevor should keep in mind that by constantly telling half the story to such a large audience you pollarize and divide the people.

Both teams have the same owners, both pretend it's the ""american people"" that they are playing for, while the truth is that they do it for the same reasons as pro athletes. It's an endless game where the ball changes hands, but the score stays the same. Fans(short for fanatics)bicker and fight over who's team is better, while sharing the same delusion that their support of one team over another will effect the outcome of the game, and produce a win in their favor.

@wrecker3318,"1. I doubt you know how taxes on business owners work. You can deduct your taxes if your business is losing money, so running one of your many businesses at a loss can eradicate some of your taxes and he is also under no obligation to release his tax returns. He is a smart entrepreneur that is well versed in economics, that's why he has so much money and wants to remove the tax loopholes mega corporations have abused, instated by not him, but those who came before him.   2. I agree trump should stop bragging about his schooling if he doesn't have the balls to show his grades. Although Trump is indeed extraordinarily smart. He is a self-made billionaire whose grandfather started with almost nothing. You can not deny his intellectual abilities to understand economics, the most valuable measure of a country's power.  3. You act like business bankruptcy is evidence of stupor. 9 out of 10 businesses fail and it just so happened that out of approx. 500 business, 3 failed. With every failure comes a loss, and it happens that that loss was great.  4. You are grasping at straws to put down Trump. I have never heard of Trump paying for women, that's a lie and you have no evidence to back that up,  5. Covid is as deadly as the flu if not less. Over half of all covid deaths are from those whose ages surpass the national life expectancy (72). So yes, downplaying the virus was beneficial as it allowed him to revive the economy to where it was pre covid and played little to no impact on covid deaths. Obama Care is a horrendous plan that taxes the working class who can afford their own healthcare and gives to those who do not work or strive for a better life for themselves. It is detrimental to poor communities and it makes about as much sense as communist universal income.  6. You can be religious and not attend religious meetings or follow religious scripture, religiously. That is a difference of opinion. He doesn't brag about sexual assault that is provably false.  7. I have not looked too deep into this so I will agree with you that he has done shady things with his Trump Foundation. Trump has donated to charities on many occasions, that is undeniable.  8. There has been no confirmed evidence that he dodged the draft other than a testimony done by Micheal Cohn. So that just isn't provable, unfortunately.  9. Testify for what? Russia collusion? He has been under investigation his entire presidency and nothing has turned up. His involvement in a smear attempt on Biden? There is overwhelming evidence that Biden and his son Hunter both worked together with Ukraine to secure millions of dollars into Hunter's accounts. That isn't smearing that's called bringing controversy to light, that's why he couldn't be impeached. Voter fraud? There have been more documented voter frauds by and for Hillary Clinton herself than the zero evidence of Trump committing voter fraud or his supporters.  Almost everything you say is regurgitated garbage from the media that you and your liberal goons love to get your dirty hands all over. It's misleading, untruthful and in reality, the reason why everyone that isn't a far-left radical hates the left. Voters from all sides are uninformed and ignorant, but the ratio of dumb liberals to dumb Trump supporters is extremely polar.",5년 전,4,

@kristinheiman4913," @wrecker3318  Many of the things you've stated here are incorrect or ""regurgitated garbage"" but I'll focus on the one that bothers me the most.  You really think he doesn't brag about sexual assault?  Have you not heard his infamous voice recording talking about grabbing women by the pussy?  I'd say that is sexual assault.  I can't believe you can watch a video like this and not see how stupid you and his supporters sound trying to come up with defenses for things that are indefensible.  Do you not see the irony of the ""lock her up"" chants at Trump's rallies when so many in his administration have been jailed and he has been impeached?  There's so much hypocrisy, nepotism, narcissism, misogyny, and prejudice surrounding him and his presidency, it's sickening.  He's created a distrust of the media and a divisiveness in out country that is probably beyond repair.  God I could go on and on.",5년 전,34,

@kevindam1946," @wrecker3318  LOL so many lies and inaccuracies, with zero sources too. Exactly what I'd expect from an ignorant Trump supporter.  1. He is not a smart entrepreneur, he's a trust fund kid with a mega-rich dad who has lied and cheated his way to growing the wealth he was given from birth. And he has done nothing to remove any tax loopholes while President.  2. LOL I like how you say ""grandfather started with almost nothing"" because you know the only reason DJT is rich is because of his dad and you want to divert that attention. Typical. And I CAN deny his intellectual abilities, he is by FAR the stupidest President we have ever had. His own sister has said that he paid someone to do his SATs.  3. Businesses started by middle class Americans without a lot of capital fail often. Businesses started by people who are given hundreds of millions of dollars from their parents do not fail often.  4. https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/07/hope-hicks-stormy-daniels-michael-cohen/  5. COVID has about a 30x greater mortality rate than the flu, according to the CDC. Educate yourself. Obamacare is only a 2% tax increase, with zero tax increase for low income earners. Your conclusion has no evidence to back it up and you're just regurgitating FOX propaganda.  6. Wow the mental gymnastics of you people is appalling. During an interview Trump was asked to recite his favorite bible verse and he said ""they're all great, I like them all equally"". You must be seriously brainwashed if you don't think Trump only says he's Christian for sheep like you to vote for him.  7. He has stolen far more money from charities than he's donated.  8. https://www.politifact.com/article/2015/jul/21/was-trump-draft-dodger/  9. There has been PLENTY that's turned up from the investigation that the GOP ignores and continues to enable Trump.   Almost everything you say is regurgitated garbage from FOX propaganda that you and your uneducated ignorant hick goons love to get your dirty hands all over.

They might also be one of those people who just refuses to vote anything other than republican. The other reason people tend to vote trump is because they’ve become unfortunate prey to fake news and misinformation. Also, when you say “have you seen the amount of red (meaning trump votes in the election I assume) on the map of USA?” You know Biden is winning right? In both popular vote and the electoral college?

@PC-cu9qz,"Unfortunately, Like yourself. Ideas and ideologies from the Left and Democrats are literally unsustainable for our society it will never ever work to keep our country the way it has been and what we have stood for throughout history. Our Declaration of Independence the Constitution what we have fought for in the past to be able to have the rights and freedoms that we have today in the society for everyone no matter left or right to express their own ideas and ideologies no matter right or wrong and who determines/declares those ideologies right or wrong. They are still open for discussion. But to keep the freedoms of our nation and our ability to continue to be the best Nation that we have been up to this point and enjoy the freedoms we all cherish. We need to keep those types of ideologies that will negatively affect our nation from moving forward and continuing to be the greatest country that there has ever been. Bottom line yes. We have our freedoms. We have our constitution. We have our Declaration of independence. Those are the things that our country was founded upon. And in short. If this is a country that you no longer want to be a part of with those instruments in place in order for the United States of America to continue to be the greatest country in this world. Then yes, you do have the ability to say no, this is not something I want to be a part of. You have the right to say these are not the beliefs I have. And if this is not something that you can live with. Then that is also your right as an American to freely leave this country. You have the right to go to another country which will welcome you and that are founded on your types of beliefs and ideologies that will welcome your beliefs and ideologies and they will welcome you with open arms. You will feel at home if these are truly the beliefs and ideologies that you personally feel would better represent the way you would like the society that you live in to function. So please, enact you're right to be free and to go where you want to go where to a country that will welcome you and your ideologies. Just please. Do not continue to live in a society that was founded on our constitution, Bill of Rights and Declaration Of Independence which gives all of us the right to fight against tyranny against those that opposed our beliefs in which the United States were founded upon. (KEY WORDS BEING, IN WHICH WE WERE FOUNDED UPON) Obviously, if you DO NOT have the beliefs then it also gives you the right as stated to leave this country.     Being an American citizen means exactly that. There is a reason why you are an American citizen. Citizenship means in believing in what your country stands for and you will uphold those beliefs that you had sworn to uphold as a citizen. When people are citizens of this great country you take on an oath. Which means exactly that. Just as all politicians. You as citizens take on an oath to defend our country's Constitution and Bill of Rights and to adhere to them. And yes, you are allowed by all rights to disagree. But you cannot be so far to the left in which your beliefs and ideologies change or go against our constitution to become something America does not stand for which is Socialism, Communism or Marxism just to fulfill your own ideologies, beliefs or agenda. Again, there are countries that will welcome you with open arms. We encourage you to be as happy and free as you like in whatever type of society you choose. Obviously, you are here now enjoying the freedoms that our country has afforded to you. Remember. You came to the United States of America for a reason. Looks like you have done pretty well for yourself since coming here. Why? Because we allowed you to enjoy the freedoms you have had up to this point to get you to where you are now. You have it better than the majority of Americans and your viewers currently do. So, stop bashing our current leaders and administration as they too have allowed you to flourish in the greatest economy in the history of America for over the past 3 years. Never once have you ever pointed that out to your viewers or anyone to that matter. But then. Why would you? You are simply part of the problem and its time for you to leave because America is such a horrible place to live according to your ideologies and belief system.",5년 전,0,

@stevendow2606," @itsmebeff_  Most people coming from ex-dictatorial regimes, former communist countries, are Trump's worshippers. It is a psychological fact, studied and researched. A high percentage of people abused at some point in their lives become abusers themselves or slid back in abusive relationships as victims. I'm not saying that your mom is an abuser now and hope she's not still suffering at hand of an abusive relationship, but if you look around at communities of Russian, N.Korean, Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Czech, Slovenian etc, etc ex-communist countries first generation immigrants, you'll discover that a very high percentage of them are Trump's supporters. Even Melania Trump married her husband because she was looking for somebody like him apparently. Read an article about her stating that she married Trump because she found him as being 'a true man', reminding her of her father. In her eyes, Trump having money and being so selfish and abusive meant he was a guarantee that she would have money and power through him, which for her was all that mattered. The interesting thing about these people is that most of them are educated, intelligent people. The only mutual thing among Trump's supporters that are 1st generation of immigrants from those geographic areas is that they either had suffered at the hand of oppressive government, people or both. On the otehr hand, Americans that support him are either people like the above video, with no education and living in poverty, or people that had been abused. The proof is that these people are aggressive themselves. Look at their reactions, at their comments, jumping at all that contradict their beliefs, calling names and trying to trash the others like cornered animals do. Now, I still think that Trump did the mistake of his life to run for US presidency. US will never accept for long time a dictature, because Americans coming from regular families were raised in a different mentality and view of life than these people. And they are in large number also, enough to counteract the others' actions. Trump will lose everything in a few years because he thought he was untouchable and didn't care to draw attention to all dirt in his pot. Now, he stirred authorities to check minutely on him. He was spared temporarily because he had immunity as president. Nobody cared about it before presidency, but now things are different. And once he loses immunity, he will also lose all powerful 'friends' and will find himself alone to take the consequences.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@stevendow2606," @duduychony9747  Because it is a special situation. Trump out has been priority, and Biden was the only one at this moment able to open the door for Trump to be kicked out. Biden is well liked by both parties in spite of the fact that is Democrat. A lot of Republicans on his side, which is very important right now. That's why everybody voted Biden, including independents, some Republicans and even some of former Trump's adepts who woke up and saw they put their money on wrong horse. Otherwise, Trump would have won again. That's the reason Trump won in the 1st place. There have been a ton of Americans that didn't go to polls and/or voted for Trump in 2016, simply because they didn't like Clinton. They didn't realize how dangerous Trump can be, how easy it would have been to get rid of Clinton, but how difficult to get rid of Trump. Also they didn't realize how much damage Trump would make in 4 years. Now they know and cast their ballots. Anybody is better than Trump. I'm myself not happy 100% with Biden, but I'm certain that he is smart enough to choose a very good team in executive, with the help of which, and advice from former presidents and actual vice-president to manage to fix something of the mess done by Trump. Hope you understand now. There might be a lot who voted Biden, not because they liked Biden, but because they knew that was the only way out of the shit. Biden is necessary at this moment for USA and for the world.",4년 전,0,

@stevendow2606," @duduychony9747  Ok Dudu. thecoffeeholic explained well enough why we don't want Trump in the WH. I might add some concrete things. How do you feel about the concentration camps he opened at the border with Mexico, jailing your own people, forcingly separating children from parents? How did you feel when he went to Puerto Rico and spoke to people there so low while throwing rolls of toilet paper at them, that watching it, I felt shame that US president could treat people like dirt. How did you feel then? Do you consider his behaviour as a fatherly, normal treatment and you have nothing against it? What would you do  finding out that he intentionally persuades his followers to walk around without any masks. I've just read the comment of one of his followers saying that people with issues must stay confined at home (as if they don't need grocery shopping, no need for them to go to pharmacies, to doctors' appointments, in other words, they have their blessing to die). The comment said that healthy people have no problems if contaminated, because.. well.. they are healthy. On the other hand, all mankind must do and move around at their orders. The list is too long to explain the ways Trump hurt Americans and the rest of the world, including you. If you like him, please take him! We offer him to you as a gift. Besides, it seems to me that you, as a typical Trump supporter, cannot be convinced anyway. You just asked around reasons, only to have somebody to argue with.

He called black people super predators and fought against black kids going to school with white Kids and said he didn’t want his kids in a racial jungle? He also spoke at KKK members Robert Byrd’s funeral (not that long ago,/don’t worry Hillary Clinton was there too) and called him a mentor, friend and guide.....All I’m saying is what about all that Joe said too?

@adriblack511,"*Warning* Ranting ahead  I'm a republican, and I'm watching these types of videos to see the other side's perspective. I suggest all of you do the same.   Go watch some conservatives and see their point of view on certain subjects. Go watch THEM interview liberals and see their perspective on things.  This (rant) comment isn't necessarily responding to this specific video, just a lot of liberal and conservative videos I've seen and a lot of things I've heard.  Something I've noticed about both sides is they tend to paint the other side in the WORST possible light. These trump supporters sound stupid. And that's what the liberals show, so that's what they must think of us. That crazy you're seeing from these conservatives is what conservatives are shown (but worse) all the time of you liberals.   Before I watched this, I couldn't imagine conservatives being this dumb. The liberals always struck me as dumb. But, that's because of the way they've always been shown to me. Ignorant, brainwashed, and SO full of blinding hate. Perhaps, just perhaps, both conservatives and liberals are being painted in a biased light?   I still think a lot of liberal ideas are very wrong, and a lot of them lack common sense when you really debate it from BOTH sides, but I think they're not ALL as hateful and ignorant as some Republicans make them out to be. I think a lot of them are just misinformed and completely brainwashed by their side. But that isn't the point of this comment. The point is to try to make people look from both side's perspectives.  I think both sides tend to show a VERY biased view of the other side. And then watching that, you began to think that's how ALL liberals or republicans are.  I've also noticed that liberals tend to not give the full story, twisting it to fit their agenda. And that they're a lot less likely to be willing to look at it from another point of view and try to understand or debate topics. They seem more likely to try to shut down any opinions that don't fit their views, instead of having a civil discussion about it. Not ALL liberals, but a lot. That's what I've noticed watching both sides.  Whatever side you're on, how do you know it's the RIGHT side when you've been blinded to the other's side's perspective? How do you know the things you've been taught aren't lies? If the only side you listen to is your side, everything you learn is going to be extremely biased. Important details will be left out and you will form your beliefs based on lies. If you don't hear BOTH sides of the story, you're going to be blinded and misinformed. And you'll have no idea.  This is why I think it is very important to look at things from BOTH views, even if you disagree. You need to educate yourself from both points of view to make sure you're not just hearing what your side wants you to hear, and like a sheep, just following along.   If you're a liberal, don't just view republicans and their views based on what ANOTHER LIBERAL is showing you! Instead, go directly to a conservative's point of view and see how the story differs. And then make up your mind on what you want to believe. Same if you're a conservative. It can't hurt to see the other's side from THEIR point of view, not other conservatives.  I think if more liberals did this, they may turn conservative. Because you might be shocked at the lies you've been told, and how they twist things to play off your emotions. How they show you only what they want you to see, and leave out vital information. How they lie to you.   I used to be liberal. Because that was the only side I really watched or learned from. Things they said made perfect sense and I couldn't understand how anyone could even disagree on a lot of the subjects unless they were bad people. But, then I heard the other side, and I heard the TRUTH. And I was shocked at how wrong the liberals got it.  On a final note, DON'T believe everything you hear and look at both sides before deciding whether it's true or not. Be open to other views. See if there's a counter-argument that makes sense as to why what you have been taught may be wrong. Until you get the full story, you will never know the TRUTH.  If you're a liberal and want to see the other side's view and how WE view liberals and can debate their views, here are some suggestions. Some conservatives I like to watch are Blair White, The Conservative Twins,  Steven Crowder, & sometimes I watch Ben Shapiro debates because the way he destroys liberals in arguments amuses me. Just don't watch Kaitlin Bennett, as most republicans will agree, she does NOT represent us very well.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

But you must understand, Trump's supporters are not Republicans, nor are they Democrats. They are simply the incipient group of extremists, that might turn any moment into fascist group. And unfortunately this is on the brink of blossoming all over the world, not only in USA. As the president of USA, Trump opened the worm hole. Just watch this guy, Trump. Similarities with Hitler are astounding. Both coming from rigid German families, Hitler preaching Jewish people's death, but coupled with Eva, who was of Jewish origin. Trump preaching immigrants' death, but married with a Slovenian woman that came in US as a 'model' with an 'Einstein' visa. Both preaching the pure race, but here Trump is even more racist than Hitler ever was. Both charismatic and knowledgeable in their spider-like tactics of catching their preys, but Trump is far mentally simplistic. At least Hitler was an artist, had some idea of what kind of object a book was and what it served for.",4년 전,2,

Because they didn't listen to debates, they didn't realize that anybody, but anybody would be better than Trump. We could've gotten rid of Hillary so much easier when somebody better showed up..

Before covid black unemployment was at its lowest in history, criminal justice reform has mostly helped black people, has given school choice, and he wants to end lateterm abortion because planned parenthood has targeted mostly black people. But you won't mention that because it hurts your agenda. And while yes I do believe that Obama was born in America and he is not a tarriost. But if being racist is victimizing people of color treating them like there stupid, giving them hand outs from a system that is quote on quote racist, and calling them not black if they don't 100 percent of a movement that was well intended but is overtaken into a bullying, anti black, ani history, riotng, fascist, marxist movement racist, than I'm the most racist person in America. 85 percent arint like these stupid people who were interviewed and you probably cut out the smart people. #Trump2020",5년 전,1,

@WelcomeToTheFamily7,"Both sides of the spectrum have a vast amount of stupid people supporting them. The only issue is that everyone who's a Democrat takes the cake by a landslide. This guy is just asking really dumb questions. ""Where are all the black people if Trump has black voters?"" Nice one bud. ""What do you think of x y and z?"" You're setting people up to say dumb shit. However, when you ask a Biden/Bernie supporter  a legitimate question like ""What do you think of your candidate of choice's policy on x y and z?"". Asking opinionated questions like ""What do you think of gay marriage/rights?"" or something to try to make Trump supporters fit the narrative is so very SJW of you. You're only digging yourselves into a deeper grave with all your posturing and virtue signaling. You steer away from the policies and focus on people's feelings, which again, goes to show you care more about feelings rather than policy or keeping a country running well. ""HURRDURR DO YOU PARTAKE IN LOCKER ROOM TALK?"" ""WOULD YOU STILL VOTE FOR TRUMP IF HE ACTUALLY WAS RACIST?"" ""WHAT IF HE SAID THIS?""

@virez_tegh2314,Jimmie You could say the exact thing about republican news. When do they compliment democratic achievements?

@andrewwang8021," @jimmie7787  I consider news sources with their own ideological interpretation of the events as a mixed blessing within a functioning democracy. It ensures that our media environment has a prosperous diversity of political opinions, but it also has the potential to create numerous echo chambers in which people simply soak in news coverage that comply with their own beliefs. It's why the concept of a balanced political diet is so important in my opinion, both for your own understanding of events as well as to continually test your capabilities of noticing bias.  In regards to the coverage of President Trump by left-leaning news sources, I feel that they are doing precisely what they should do within a functioning democracy: call out negative behavior with critical coverage. Right-leaning news sources have the opposite role, and it is just as important as the former. The most significant issue I can see with this system is that it encourages the creation of those aforementioned echo chambers, fueling political polarization. It's why I always want to chat with people of differing political opinions from my own.  I am very sorry for the late response. I hope we can continue this conversation we're having!",5년 전,0,

@andrewwang8021," @jimmie7787  I feel that all news sources are guilty for playing to their bases a bit too much, regardless of their ideological leaning. Why do conservatives have this problem exclusively with left-leaning sources?",5년 전,0,
@jimmie7787," @andrewwang8021  Because they are lying to the people. For example, there were 21 BLACK people shot in DC the other day, one dead, and the left leaning media was only concerned with the amount of people there(50+) and they didn't ware masks. There are riots in Seattle every night, the left leaning media say, they are peaceful protesters. But, they plaster all over their ""news"" about a cop shooting a black guy or BLM rallies and play it for days. You have to stop calling them ""news sources"" because, they are not. Your, so called, ""news sources"" shouldn't have a base. They should tell the truth. And CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NBC never do.And The Daily Show and shows like them, disguises their bias with ""comedy"" and get away with it.",5년 전,0,
@andrewwang8021," @jimmie7787  The selection bias within media sources is a significant factor, but that doesn't mean what they say is false. They focus on different events that you may consider less important and unrepresentative of the full picture. That is certainly a significant flaw, but what they report is still very much real. For instance, there are plenty of peaceful protestors in Seattle, and the media chooses to focus on them, rather than on the violence that also occurs there. They have their reasons for doing so, just like how those on Fox News have their reasons for focusing more on the violent protestors. Neither one are incorrect, they're simply choosing what they would like to focus on. That is a significant benefit of a balanced political diet: it enables an individual to receive a diverse array of ideological perspectives on massive, multi-faceted events such as these. It allows you to get a fuller picture that left-leaning sources like CNN and MSNBC don't cover. Once again, at least in my view, that's not to say that those news sources aren't valid, they are merely reporting according to their own opinions on the issue and focusing on what they believe to be most important for their audience to know. That's technically what any news source does, whether it be liberal or conservative. That's why I am still rather confused as to why it seems mostly to be conservatives that are angry with mainstream media.",5년 전,0,

@andrewwang8021," @jimmie7787  Thank you very much for your honest answer! In regards to what you've stated about how left-leaning sources cover President Trump's actions, I don't believe they've ever reported his comments on illegal immigrants and travel restrictions like that. More often than not, they would play a clip that is the subject of the story, like the part in the speech when President Trump asserted that a significant portion of illegal immigrants were rapists, and then have commentators discuss their opinions on the matter. I apologize if this seems confrontational, but I feel that you're conflating the subjective commentary they provide with the news that they report. You and I may disagree on the opinions being expressed during these discussions, but regardless, they aren't presenting what they say as fact, merely their own perspectives on the issue. While using inflammatory titles for their news coverage has certainly become more of a problem in recent years, I once again must bring up the fact that this isn't an exclusively liberal issue.

Tax returns aren’t disclosed so we know how much money someone makes, it’s to show transparency, to show they’re honest, maybe that they donate to charities. A study of the top 300 charities doesn’t reveal Trump’s name, even though he claims to have billions. Perhaps you bought into his BS about “draining the swamp,” yet he brings on the likes of Manafort, who is the very definition of the swamp. Perhaps you bought into his “promise” to balance the budget, yet in 2019, a year with a robust economy, he manages a TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. There’s no excuse for that, but he couldn’t resist tax breaks for his buddies who run already mega profitable corporations like Wells Fargo. And what’s his fascination with Putin, a ruthless dictator who has murdered his own people? He defends him regularly, while creating rifts between our greatest allies, like Germany. There’s a reason our two former GOP Presidents didn’t vote for him, a first by the way for former presidents to not support the nominee from their own party. Most of the tell-all books written about Trump are authored by Republicans. Most of our retired military officers have spoken out against him as well, and I don’t think dodging the draft helped him any. He’s the 3rd POTUS in history to be impeached. He is sort-of promoting the wearing of masks to help with the virus 4 months late. Last week he was quoting some quack doctor from Africa who has claimed we’re using DNA from aliens in modern medicine, while criticizing the number one infectious disease expert since the Reagan administration, who by the way, graduated first in his medical school class from Cornell. I’m just warming up, but I’d like to hear why you support him. I won’t even mention his racist past, like when the Trump organization was sued twice by the Justice Dept for race discrimination.",5년 전,5,
@ffhd1clt,"Bruce Mitchell Typical response. “I don’t care about foreign relations or his past?” America does. It doesn’t matter if you care about it or not. That’s your “logic?” If you can’t debate the issues you just say you don’t care? I’m not interested in what you think about Biden, Carson, or anyone else. Thanks for proving my point.",5년 전,2,
@ffhd1clt,"Bruce Mitchell And by the way, you’re correct that 2019 was a “great year financially.” That means it was absolutely beyond irresponsible for Trump to manage a TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. We should have been paying down the debt, but a trillion dollar deficit? He’s completely inept with other people’s money, like ours or his daddy’s. I don’t get why you people just give him a pass on everything. In the mid 90’s, Bill Clinton took the great financial opportunity and operated with a budget SURPLUS.",5년 전,3,
@ffhd1clt,"Bruce Mitchell The déficit thing is “simple?” You call a trillion dollar deficit during a robust economy “a mistake?” Do you hear yourself? This is exactly what I was talking about. You have yet to engage me with anything specific. This is why Trump said he could shoot someone on 5th Ave and his supporters would still back him. I absolutely believe it. You would write it off as a “mistake,” and blame it on the “left-wing” media. This is my last post, because like I said in my first, no Trump person will even try to defend him. Saying it’s a mistake, or that you “don’t care about foreign policy or his past is not a defense. What do you base voting decisions on if not one’s past, his future? His past is everything, in fact it’s the only thing. He has done nothing but divide a nation. Here’s the result of that: he is going to lose big in November. His “base” is simply not enough. I can excuse people for voting for him in 2016, but not after this performance. Why do you think George W Bush and George HW Bush didn’t support him? We won’t be able to find any of you people after the election. You’ll claim it was fixed, but as usual, with zero evidence. This has nothing to do with political parties either. There are any number of Republicans I would support, but Trump is no Republican. I would love to debate him, except for the fact that he would just spew out whatever enters his tiny brain and his followers would take it as fact. I have a better grasp of our democracy, and our Constitution, than this former builder from NY. He was an outspoken critic of the electoral college, until it got him elected. Does that not strike you as disingenuous, or was his support of the popular vote a “mistake?” Did the logic behind the popular vote suddenly disappear because he was elected? What is best for him is by definition, what’s best for the country. The right thing to do would be to say something like “the popular vote is still the best for the reasons I laid out before the election.” But he can’t do that because it makes him look like the results were illegitimate. It’s a sad time for our country.",5년 전,4,

@DeathBYDesign666," @elonmust7470  Yeah that's gonna happen, I was asking you. And you want me to ask the opinion of a violent convicted rapist, I mean wtf? I just want a straight answer, because I don't quite see what some of you see. I have never liked the guy in the 30 or so years I've known about him. If what they are saying about his view on military veterans is true, I can find no logical way of defending that position. It may be hearsay, but I have heard him say similar things in the past. Some of the things he says and does are representative of the way despots act and no amount of money is worth that kind of a drastic change. Some things are more important than money believe it or not. I'm not even a true liberal, both me and my family have always been more center left, but it does help with the bias factor. I get along with pretty much everybody and don't have a prejudiced bone in my body, but something about this man just is every kind of wrong. I'm willing to give anyone a chance, but after this long it seems kinda doubtful. It's in all our best interests to wish for the best from our president, but this whole corona thing has pretty much proven that he has no idea what he's doing. He just likes the attention he gets from being a figurehead and he lies constantly changing his stories from one day to another. I understand that all politicians do so, but not quite on the level he does it. Though I actually do believe that he buys into his own bs, but that only makes it even worse. Help me understand what is so great about him, his actual observed behavior is more than enough to make a case why he shouldn't be president. Normal people do not act the way he does and I am pretty far from normal myself. Of course I'm not running for president either and we should expect better behavior than he has shown us.",5년 전,1,
@DeathBYDesign666," @elonmust7470  The part I'm having trouble understanding is why everyone else that has worked for him says similar things. She didn't know she was being recorded and those are not just casual banter type of things that you say against someone you don't like, normally it's way more simple and less specific. I'm past passing formal judgment on people for lying for political reasons, which she has none of anyway. Lying is part of the political landscape, but what stake she has in a private conversation I have no clue. That's why I can believe it.   The man is belligerent in most situations and never hesitates to pass the buck off on someone else when things aren't going his way. That's the main problem I have with him, it's that while being the president he chooses to take absolutely no responsibility for any of his actions. When it works out well he's the first to take the credit and when it doesn't someone gets fired and someone less qualified and willing to be his yes man will take over that position. His new medical top man is a radiologist and not really qualified to make judgments about how to handle a potentially deadly virus. The real scary fact is that most Trump supporters don't even believe that the virus exists. Even hypothetically if it didn't I would rather not take the risk of getting it because a bunch of wilfully ignorant people say so. There are easy ways of prevention and I myself can't afford to be sick for a month and risk lifelong health issues because of it. I'm trying to look at the facts here as much as possible and trying to forget personal biases, but every time he speaks he brings up a new reason not to trust him. Like I said it's about more than just money, a thing like this is where his true incompetence shines the most.   And yes he's is by far the most responsible for the state of the political division in America. He is both the man with the highest office in the land and has the most screen time on television and various other media outlets. Like him or hate him, he is one of the most watched political figures in recent history, so how could anyone possibly be more influential than him? These are facts I'm speaking, not just innuendo from a bunch of biased liberals.",5년 전,2,

@arsenalcrazy8,"One thing I’ll say - regardless of Dems vs Reps, Donald Trump divides the country. He creates the drama and thrives off it. I’ve never seen a president refuse to bring a country together as much as he does. He refused to wear a mask for the first 6 odd months of this pandemic, thus inadvertently rendering the use of masks a partisan issue. He’s president, and should have known that his actions directly influence how people view things. He openly admitted to hiding how serious Covid is; the leaked interview tapes reveal it, and if it was to “save the country” why did he declare the pandemic a democrat hoax? He touted the use of hydroxychloriquin for weeks, even though he has no license to give such advice, and again, his actions influence people. He constantly does what he wants “because he can” and while that’s desirable in a leader on a surface level, it certainly is not desirable as the president of the unites states, who should be held to a higher standard. I’m nonpartisan myself, and would have no problem voting republican, but I certainly cannot vote for trump; his image alone causes the entire world to laugh at us.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

He even got through an impeachment trial by having the same senate block witnesses. also i don’t watch CNN as your comment seems to insist, i do research online from several reputable sources. look, BLM has said that’s it’s against rioting, and it’s rallies are meant to be nonviolent. Sometimes things get out of hand however, and it’s not the fault of BLM that some of its members are more radical than the organization. Also, you didn’t address the main issue...

Don’t make yourself the most tempting women to a man that clearly has no moral compass or he wouldn’t capable of rape. You can ignore the facts as much as you want and say what a woman wears does not attract attention to herself and that she’s not wearing it for men, when clearly she is just for the men that she wants to attract.

I know that men would get angry if I said that because they think they have rights to be half naked or something BUT HONESTLY, I think it's annoying that they flaunt their privilege like that. But alas. That's just me.   And have you noticed that society likes women to wear more revealing clothing than men? How is it that formal clothing is skin tight and reveals your boobs? Why don't men dress like that in formal events? Why do men look gay when they dress like that? Why is the standard for women to expose themselves to men? Okay I'm getting excited.

If you read the comments,  few, if any, are seeing it as anything but factual on-site interviews. I'm sorry for you if you are scared.   If you truly understood what was going on you would be terrified! Not because of Trump,  but what the other side has planned. They call folks feeding into the anti-American push as ""useful idiots"".   My suggestion: Stock up on food, water and necessary supplies. Without food and water you will not need toilet paper.  If you live in the city, you need to get out (that would mean heading into Trump country). Sanders and Biden have assured the country that the cities will burn come this  November (worse than what has already happened).   I was in East Germany as the Soviet Union was falling. That's why I have food,  water, supplies, and live far outside the city. I sleep well and just try to get the truth out there; for those willing to listen.

@sarakhayami999,I will never forgive trump supporters for their uneducated opinion and capitalist thirst. Do they actually know what it means what they’re causing when this white supremacists demand to put Americans first? When I revisited Iran again for example it was completely devastating and shocking to the core. The sanctions your great president put on Iran makes the situation so thight over there. People throw themselves off of buildings because they don’t know how they to support they’re families anymore. He wants to crush the economy in order to put the regime under pressure? HA HA HA. The majority of Iranian 98% aren’t against Americans despite what they did and caused in recent history with their CIA acts. This 2% of politicians rule with such a force and have the military military and police on they’re side. People of Iran are all distributed over the country. This country has only provinces and can’t start ANYTHING to end this dictatorship. But people of America uneducated as they are thrive of playing world police in all they’re hypocritical glory of being the nation who bombed so many countries while Iran never did.  This is just an example and the most hypocritical shit is for them to say they don’t want to have iran nuclear weapons while USA is allowed to have them ??? There is already blood on his and his supporters hands and clearly in history the US has shown how corrupt they are what ‘putting themselves first’ on cost of innocents truly means...I’m completely heartbroken and it’s so clear to see that Americans are only satisfied by results at all costs when it’s about capitalism and gaining more build their richness as usual on the of others suffering.

Obama did do “jackshit” to help the economy, and while trump may have done some things, it doesn’t amount to what obama did.

As a right leaning person, I find this MAGA cult disgusting. If you like Trump for the values he defends, that's OK, but most of his fanbase just take his word for it and never question his statements even when they are obvious lies. That's precisely why they drop all the stupid shit we hear in this video.

Also, as a skeptical right wing militant, I don’t take republican statements as an undeniable truth and I try (as much as possible) to check informations, even if they come from my political baseline. That’s the only sane way to build up your own opinion. I don’t want to be manipulated, so I have to keep a critical mind. Avoiding your confirmation bias is the only way to an intelligent posture.

Are you still holding the opinion that this dude is not making up everything as he goes along because people blindly follow whatever he says?

Trump loves to brag about our country being the best at everything but we’re not doing so well with covid, and it’s lowkey his fault to failing to inform us all back when the virus was first notified. Him having rally’s vs schools, concerts, live events, movie productions, etc being cancelled say a lot for how hes attempting to handle “the people’s” safety during a global pandemic.

What exactly are you doing to help the current discord other than stand on your soapbox and wag your fingers at people you don't know about they're going to do.

@ObsidianGoliath," John Doe  You proved absolutely nothing. If you had two brain cells to rub together you would know that BLM doesn't exclude other races but merely acknowledging that black lives matter too. BLM doesn't mean that any other lives don't matter. And if your response to BLM is ""All Lives Matter"" then you a part of the problem. Black people in this country have been historically disenfranchised for centuries and merely want to be equal and not greater than anybody else. Common sense should dictate that when the most downtrodden are uplifted then so is everyone else as a collective. You are quick to get a ""gotcha comment"" that you let the obvious go completely over your head. I'm for Medicare-for-all, police reform, student loan forgiveness and any other measure that will benefit everyone regardless of race, creed or religion. That is the simplest fact.

Making all of trumps supporters out to be racist is wrong in its own right. Plus Joe Biden believed to own the black vote, which is not true because regardless of race they are allowed to vote for anyone who they see fit. I do believes that some Democrats are suited do do some jobs Republicans can’t and likewise the other way around, however a Democrat like joe Biden isn’t what this country needs right now, because of how easily he forgets things, and that’s a weakness other countries will attempt to attack, as well as the us citizens that want more favoritism, I don’t believes Obama’s a terrorist, but I do believe he wasn’t born in America, and yet he was able to achieve the highest position in America so that in its own right is an achievement, because that would’ve made him the first African American president, and the first foreign citizen to become president. The truth is harder to find now because all mainstream news media put twist the truth to there own interests, because they’re businesses who couldn’t care if they turn the United States citizens on each other.

@WakingPL,"​ @tashahanley1780  Majority of population will always be stupid in different countries to different degrees, but parties usually gather mass support which means masses will follow them. Those are not elitist groups, which means majority of supporters will vote without having any deeper knowledge. That often means they will be zealous even with minimal insight. I've seen many examples of this watching different interviews, some person confronted to explain what fascism is couldn't and as the simplest way of defense he got agressive. Another example I think of was interview about Sikhs and it turned out majority of Americans mistook them for muslims. Usually the lack of knowledge comes with stupidity, and there are plenty of other materials proving it. Than there are materials about presenting political programs atributing them to wrong candidate. As long as you say the name of backed candidate they will support nearly anything that they previously opposed when it was attributed to the rival.

@noahgray543," @elipulido5970  not getting into all of your discussion, but saying ""god didn't choose the future"" presuming you believe in an omnipotent and omniscient god that also created the universe, is absolutely incorrect and logically impossible.  Imagine, for a second, you were setting up dominoes.  Now, you know that, depending on the pattern you make, the dominoes will fall in a certain way, even if you dont directly push anything but the first domino.  You alsoknow, that if you change any point of the pattern, the dominoes will fall differently.  Now, in this situation, how would it not be correct to say that you actively chose how each domino would fall even if you only actually pushed one of them?  An omnipotent and omniscient creator, by necessity, does not allow for free will to exist in anything other than an emergent, illusory, form.  Everything that ever has, is, and will happen was, is, and will be because god directly and consciously decided it would be so.  You are - except for the scale - fundamentally no different than the dominoes.",5년 전,1,
@elipulido5970,Noah Gray ok and I never told you to question my religion I don’t believe in science that we came from monkeys no.

For the pure and simple matters of  he is against abortion and he is against illegal imigration. Not because of what his personal life is like. (Though I'll denounce him if he is convicted for sexual assault.) As a woman who is pretty into politics and I don't think I'm stupid lol I think it's unfair to only represent the bad arguments of the other side. We need open dialogue.

@Lex-loves-blueberries,"Gary Prime the funding should go to schooling, housing, and mental health institutions, pretty much anywhere where its lacking in public education and safety, which would not only help the american community as a whole but also lessen the power of the police. And with the defunding of the police it’s going to take away some of their resources, obviously, but when you give that money and responsibility to other branches of public safety it will spread opportunities for more jobs, and also take power away from the police force that hoards it but also provide a better, more stable policing system.   But like you said it’s not going to make them better, per say, but that’s where people want to insert laws cracking down on the police more and monitoring what they do their entire shift so that way people can have rock solid evidence if they do intentionally use too much force and so that way they can take those people out of the force and keep innocent civilians safe.  Sorry I highkey inserted myself into this but that’s the basic gist of defunding the police.",5년 전,8,
@leas.5596, @garyprime4134  How do you know for certain that redistributing funds wouldn't make the police force better?

@garyprime4134,"Lea S. How do you know for certain that defunding the police WOULD make the police better. Your question can go both ways. America is in one of it’s worst crime rates. We have many drug cartels, sex trafficking of children, gangbanging, kidnapping, murder, and all the crime going on the internet. We forget that there are evil people in this society that we need the police to take care cuz that’s their job. It’s to keep order. It may have worked 50 years ago, but with the amount of hidden crime going on now, defunding the police won’t help. Defunding the police would probably only work in a low crime community. High crime communities need police the most. We say defund the police but exactly where in America should we do it. Chicago?

@hasnains561,​ @briank2464  its becoming harder and harder to tell if you are being serious due to the maturity of your comments but i'll provide anyway. But i could say that you're also ignoring the fact that your president has asked a foreign country to intervene in their elections which is outrageous and is backed by a massive amount of evidence in comparison to your Jonh Duram report which has barely got anywhere in comparison to the discover of the collaboration of Cambridge analytica  and Trumps campaign.However Trump always finds a way to silence the people who oppose him.Just understand this is the same man who proposed to millions of people that injecting Disinfectant into themselves would heal them from corona virus. He would then go on to fire any medical staff which opposed this theory leading to the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians . Oh Boy what a great president he is!!!.I wish my prime minister told me to kill myself with disinfectant!!.Wake up mate you've elected a retard and you're now suffering the consequences as portrayed by you're failing healthcare system and the millions of Americans who get in debt and die to due it.But all Trump seems to do is blame Obama which is not a desirable trait.I think a coup against the president would do nothing but good as removing the man from power who fires his opposition and tells his own people to kill themselves isn't worth being a presidential figure and he's done nothing but worsen relationships with all his allies in Europe and around the world including Americas Strongest and closest ally The UK.Countries in Europe saying they refuse to be bullied by Trump anymore and the Uk -Us special relationship in jeopardy.,5년 전,0,

Hundreds of those kids were locked up in cages. This was a clear violation of international law, and experts with the United Nations’ Human Rights Council also said the policy may have amounted to “torture.”  Trump has told more than 15,000 falsehoods since coming to office. To quote presidential historian Douglas Brinkley: “There is no president that lied as if they were a form of breathing, except Donald Trump.” But lying isn’t an impeachable offense, right? Wrong. The very first article of impeachment against Nixon accused him of “making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States.”  Local officials in Puerto Rico have blamed presidential negligence and incompetence for the deaths of nearly 3,000 people in Puerto Rico, in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Trump’s response? He falsely claimed that 3,000 Americans didn’t die. He also tried to “illegally withhold” much-needed and congressionally appropriated disaster relief money. According to the Washington Post, Trump told White House officials that “he did not want a single dollar going to Puerto Rico. … Instead, he wanted more of the money to go to Texas and Florida.”  Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election identified 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president. More than 1,000 former federal prosecutors agreed that Trump’s conduct, had he been a private citizen, would have resulted “in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.”  Trump has not only been accused of sexual assault and harassment by dozens of women, but in June, the writer E. Jean Carroll also accused him of raping her in the dressing room of a luxury department store. “I haven’t paid much attention,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters, when asked to comment on Carroll’s shocking claim. But why not? Shouldn’t rape be an impeachable offense? “I wish there had been a third Article of Impeachment against Donald Trump,” Carroll tweeted last week. “The Abuse Of Women.”  Less than three months after entering office, in April 2017, Trump launched airstrikes against Syria, without a vote in Congress. Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu, a former attorney in the Judge Advocate General Corps of the U.S. Air Force, called the strikes “FRICKIN ILLEGAL.” And remember: As former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes has acknowledged, the lack of congressional authorization, and threat of impeachment from House Republicans, “was a factor” in the controversial decision by the Obama administration not to bomb Syria in 2013.  Remember how Trump declared a fake “national emergency” in February to circumvent Congress and fund his border wall? Well, Trump himself bluntly admitted that there was no emergency or even urgency: “I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster.” His critics, therefore, argue that the president acted “ultra vires,” a Latin phrase meaning “beyond the powers.”  In January, Cohen announced that he was postponing his public congressional testimony because of “ongoing threats against his family” from the president and his attorney Rudy Giuliani. In November, Trump attacked former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch as she was testifying in front of the House Intelligence Committee, prompting committee Chair Adam Schiff to accuse the president of “witness intimidation in real time.” This is the behavior not of a president but of a mob boss.  In Syria, Trump dropped bombs without congressional approval. In Yemen, the scene of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, Trump has helped Saudi Arabia to continue to drop bombs despite explicit opposition from both chambers of Congress. As an analyst in The Guardian argued, Trump’s decision to veto a bipartisan bill calling for an end to U.S. military involvement in the Saudi air war amounted to “flagrant defiance of the 1973 War Powers Act that checks a president’s ability to engage in armed conflict without express consent of Congress.”  Trump demanded that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be granted a security clearance, despite objections from intelligence officials who warned that Kushner could be compromised by his business ties to foreign governments. The president may have the right to give anyone a security clearance and yet, as House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler explained in March, “You can do things that are within your power that are abuses of power and that are crimes.”  i dont see an ongoing list off accusations and impeachment trials against Obama hmmmmm i wonder why maybe its because he's actually a decent president who dosn't abuse the power he has to silence others.",5년 전,0,

@GeneralAblon,"7:20 I love Jordan, but the Trump supporter, and I hate to say this, is not entirely wrong. If it was consecutive one term presidencies, the second of Trump and the first of Ivanka would match, provided the Trump supporter wants to indicate no Democrat wins between them. They do not match, hence they are all two terms, with election years of elections they won being listed on the shirt. However, the - between them is very confusing, so the Trump supporter is also still kinda wrong, in that what he seems to list is an alternation between a member of the Trump family and an opponent, which is not what he means.   Overall though, amazing how illogical, inconsistent, and hypocritical the die-hard, MAGA-hat-wearing, Republicans are. I am sure that, should the species survive the next century, or even decade, it will be stated in the history books lack of qualitative education, fundamentalist levels of belief in American Excellence, and high levels of lead in blood led to most of this.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@airframer120,Death Bone don’t even waste your time stating facts over emotions coz they wouldn’t get it...  trump is so racist but he ain’t doing a good job being a racist when he lowered the unemployment for black community and the job is rising for minority... he’s so racist that he doesn’t want illegals to be in this country but Obama did the same shit and deported more illegals but he’s ok... 8 years of presidency and didn’t do shit but help Americans to choose what bathroom they belong... he’s own state is still shit and crime rate is still up there...  it’s funny when you watch news either cnn or Fox News its the blue states that’s having issues and I wonder why....,5년 전,0,
@jackmehoff2503," @DeathBone4656  you're right, I didn't read all that, because a lot of it is rhetoric. Having a different perspective on policy doesn't make it ignorance. That's just a blatant disregard for understanding. Shows narrow mindedness to say the least. To say keeping the borders open is allowing criminals n rapists in, is simply regurgitating the rhetoric that a certain person in office spews to legitimize his want to build a wall... it's quite simply a blanket statement; painting all mexicans with a broad brush. As if we don't have criminals n rapists here already. By that logic we should empty the country entirely. After I read that, yes I stopped reading. Shows a lack of understanding of how the economy works. It would topple without said immigrants crossing over, n it's a fact",5년 전,0,

The parties switched ideologies in 1948, when Democrat president Harry Truman went against the grain and signed civil rights act into law.

@linktoday," @DeathBone4656  This post makes no sense, you say the left wants to be a government ran one but it's the people that are making these current changes. It's the people out there protesting and getting statues of people that wanted freedoms for a select few torn down. It's the Republican party that is fine with shooting peaceful protestors and the media covering it to keep people silenced and in line, the same shit that China does. It's been very clear the rise in hate groups since Trump came into power, people that are racist or homophobic are much more vocal because Trump gives that presence with Mike P. all but saying 'I hate the gays'. This leads to hate, this leads to white supremacy, and this leads to individuals losing rights like how Trump has tried to strip rights from the LGBT community. This is a man who saw someone who said there were bad people on both sides of a man driving into a crowd on black citizens. This is a man who makes stuff up about other nations and races to instill fear and hate to create nationalism in is people. He tries to make Antifa out to be terrorists, despite they fight the same fascism that we stood against in WW2, the same fascism he learned from a certain book on his nightstand. This president who sees his own words played back to him and pointed out how terrible every thing he said was and tries to come up with excuses, or Fox news tries very hard for him just for Trump to stumble over their Lincoln log wall of defense. And the worst part is, there are Republicans that don't agree with him on everything, but the parties have grown into this disgusting hive mind that it's so very rare to see a republican actually say something like 'shooting our citizens exercising their free speech is wrong and Trump should be ashamed.', instead those that think it's wrong are more likely to just bottle it up and ignore the rights being trampled on so they can still get favor from Trump and all hard leaning right wings.

@leapinglynx,"@★ Froggie Animation ★ So you support a sexual abuser of multiple women who also inappropriately touches children, has had secret service agents attest to his highly inappropriate behavior toward their wives and girlfriends, who can barely string together a coherent sentence, and who pushed thru a 1994 crime control act that was responsible for the mass incarceration of millions of black people over minor non-violent drug offenses? How woke of you.   He was also verifiably quoted as saying all of the following:  ""Poor kids are as talented as white kids.""  ""If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black!""  ""I mean you've got the first sort of mainstream African American, who is articulate and bright, and clean and [a] nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man.""  ""You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.""  He was also extremely disrespectful and derogatory toward Anita Hill during her sexual harassment hearings against Clarence Thomas, for which Biden took two decades to apologize to her (and even then only did so half heartedly, taking no personal accountability for his behavior).   As a senator in 1975, Biden also opposed ""busing,"" which was an effort to blend minority students from poor areas with white students from the suburbs. Regarding his support of this racial segregation, he said, ""Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle...""  And when Biden was asked in a debate how to address America's legacy of slavery, his response was to imply black people are just bad parents (the rambling quote is too long to post here, but you can look it up for yourself).  Oh and let's not forget this creepy gem that he discussed regarding his time in the pool with kiddos:  “I got a lot of — I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun, and the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again.” And he concluded with, “I love kids jumping on my lap.”  Yeah, a senile sexually predatory racist who inappropriately touches and sniffs children and other peoples' wives -- very ""intellectual"" choice. 🙄",5년 전(수정됨),3,
@leapinglynx,"@★ Froggie Animation ★ Nice copy/paste job. Do you ever have any original thoughts? I never said a single word about Trump and I didn't vote for him, so I'm not sure what your point is. I see that just like most moral relativists, you're going to completely ignore the facts I provided about Biden, who you openly state you support. All you can do is come back with unrelated complaints about Trump, which has nothing to do with Biden's immoral actions. How about you explain how you can support someone in light of all those things? How do you justify that in your own head? Everything I listed is 100% verifiable, you can look it up for yourself, although I'm guessing you're too biased to do so.  I honestly can't believe you think anyone who has a different opinion is a Russian agent. LMAO! 🤣 That's so ridiculous.

@leapinglynx,"@★ Froggie Animation ★ Girl, I gotta be honest, you're coming off a little unhinged. I didn't twist anything, he said and did those things. You're loopy if you think anyone who doesn't agree with you is a Russian agent. I'm actually shocked a grown adult would say that. I'm Scottish/German and I've lived in Colorado my whole life. I'm a political writer for a living and publications pay me to stay neutrally informed. I'm neither Rep or Dem.  The two party system is a tool of mind control; two sides of the same coin. It's a system designed to placate the masses, while the underlying agendas steam on unabated. The puppeteers instigate whatever they desire, while you are left thinking you had a say in the matter. They employ a form of social engineering called divide and conquer. It gets you thinking of others in tribalistic fashion based on arbitrary labels (left/right, black/white, women/men, gay/straight). It's designed to manipulate your knee-jerk emotions and bypass your rational mind. If they can keep you squabbling over petty differences, it ensures you will not look up long enough to see the true enemy.   So by all means, go on thinking Joe is fabulous. However, as one human to another, I genuinely hope you do more research into the forces at play. If you think Biden is going to be different from the other corrupt sycophants, you're fooling yourself. But that's your right, so go bananas. I don't agree with you, but I'll fight for your right to speak freely. That's the beauty of our nation -- and it's something we're going to lose if more people don't wake up.  I do hope someday you realize that just because you're presented with information you don't like, it doesn't mean it's ok to warp reality to suit your preferences. Facts do matter.

@leapinglynx," Hugh Ropp  I've definitely noticed that people on the far left do not possess as much self control or basic respect for their fellow humans. They do not tolerate any opposing viewpoint, no matter how respectfully or logically presented, and sometimes even resort to actual violence. They usually meet any effort at reasoned debate with slanders, insults, and spastic emotions. They're not operating from a place of cognitive ration, but a place of knee-jerk emotional reactivity. That's why they fall victim to propaganda so easily. In my career as a political writer I've met a LOT of people who went from liberal to conservative after they did more research and realized they were being manipulated. They gradually recognized the hatefulness and general lack of morality or boundaries of the left. However, I've quite literally never met nor heard of a single person who went from conservative to liberal. And I mean that in all seriousness. Not once. (And I've worked with thousands of people.) Statistically, it's been shown that as individuals age and mature they generally become more conservative. Today's liberalism is very much a ""me, me, me"" instant gratification based ideology. It tends to attract younger or less mature individuals who are not thinking along a broader time spectrum. They haven't researched the extremely racist roots of the democratic party and they haven't looked into its CIA ties with media. They haven't researched the declassified gov psyop programs being run. It actually makes me very sad for the people caught up in the lies. But there is absolutely no getting thru to someone that refuses to hear truth, evidence, or reason.",5년 전,1,

@ZachBPresentz,"This video sadly sums up the moronic mindset of at least 33% of the United States.       This is what Republicans were hoping for & counting on 20 years ago when George W. Bush permanently stifled our education system with his No Child Left Behind policy. Republicans knew that if people were educated and intelligent enough to research facts for themselves people would see right thru their bs. They'd realize that their platforms are bias & do nothing to help everyday people. They knew if the majority of people that made up the middle class were smart enough to realize voting for them is voting against their own best interests, George W. would most likely be their last Republican in the White House. But if you're able to keep a large portion of the electorate for lack of a better word, dumb, and pretend to be like them because you don't like the same people they don't and/or you believe in the same God as they do, then those same sad and ill informed people will gladly continue to be fools and vote against their interests....And boy did it work like a charm...

(https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/04/10/trump-university-settlement-judge-finalized/502387002/) That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, ""Okay.""

I couldn’t—you know, he was right in front of me, and I turned away. I didn’t want to touch him. He was bleeding all over the place. And I felt terrible, because it was a beautiful white marble floor, and now it had changed color. Became very red.” You said, ""That's cool!""

What Kim Jong Un blew up could have been an out house or a chicken house but it wasn't a nuclear power plant. No radiation gadgets show a trait of radiation in the air . Kim Jong Un later said he had a Christmas present for Trump . Trump said ""I hope  it's a vase "".It was the continuing of testing of nuclear weapons. The wall fell down all that money wasted.

@petershin5130," @jessehavlin1490 This attitude of yours is why people are leaving the Democrat party and supporting Trump lol. There is a difference between the concentration camps of WW2 and the detainment of immigrants. Tho living conditions could obviously be better, it's not like we are straight up gassing/exterminating them. He actually did condemned white supremacy during the Charlottesville protest, the media just cut that portion out. There is absolutely no evidence he has colluded with the Russians and Trump has been critical of the Chinese Government. The Governors deployed the national guard to stop the looters and rioters, NOT the peaceful protestors. And his tax reform is actually helping businesses out as it gives them more freedom to expand (thus creating more jobs). Also, let's not forget he signed the First Step Act, which will especially help incarcerated minorities, stepped up to Iranian Aggression while also remaining antiwar, and had the lowest black unemployment prior to Covid. Am I saying he's perfect? Not at all. I never said I was going to vote for him. But you can't deny that there have been some positives and that the media is playing us like fools. And I find it very hypocritical for people on the left to call ALL Trump Supporters racist and evil while they promote hatred themselves.",5년 전,1,
@jessehavlin1490," @petershin5130  You avert your eyes to the it. There is mountains of circumstantial evidence, and the direct evidence has mostly been blocked by Trump, which is not something an innocent person does. It still exists and his supporters willfully ignore it. His ""apology"" came after only two days along with ""some of them are very good people"", which is something he hasn't said about ""the Mexican invasion"". And good job on ignoring everything else I said, I guess repeating ""that's not true"" over and over would have shown you how ignorant you choose to remain.  And support hatred how? Trump retweeted ""the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat"". I've literally never heard someone on the left say some thit like that. Right-wing extremists have committed 100 acts of domestic terrorism in the last decade, murdering almost 100 people, and these incidences have increased since Trump took office. And who does he single out? Antifa. A tiny ass Anti FASCISM group started in Oregon with the admittedly stupid idea of punching Proud Boys at their rallies. Meanwhile the KKK and Boogaloo Boys are ignored. So the right has at least a dozen ultra-nationalist hate groups that commit and support violent acts and the left has Antifa? (BLM does not count, as their doctrine does not support violence, unlike the right-wing groups who explicitly do.)  I disagree with most conservatives but I don't hate them at all. I understand that people have different things they prioritize and are afraid of and that's what separates the true left from the true right. That's not what Trump is though - he's robber baron that's shown his entire life he doesn't care about anyone unless they directly benefit him. You don't make enough money to fall into this group.",5년 전,7,
@petershin5130," @jessehavlin1490  I didn't reply to the rest because I don't know much about Turkey nor him disrespecting the constitution so you will have to share me some sources on that. But where to start. There are countless videos of Antifa shutting down right wing speakers at college campuses. They regularly act violent towards people that oppose them. There are countless testimonies of conservatives saying they have been harassed and lost friends for simply being conservative. It was the democrat party that has continuously let down the Black Community down via welfare and destroying the nuclear family culture. The media constantly goes after Trump and his supporters (CNN got sued for defamation of Nick Sand). The KKK and Boogaloo Boys are being ignored because they are irrelevant to society. They aren't as prominent and widespread as Antifa. I agree that BLM isn't a hate group, but I just disagree with how they go about it because they don't talk about black on black crime nor the lack of two parent households. It should be ALL black lives matter. I actually do want to see the Black and Hispanic community rise up as they been through so much. In fact, I want everybody to have equal opportunity to success. Many of my friends are liberal and I could care less that they are because they are truly wonderful people.  But I mean I respect every president because in the end of the day, he is my President whether I like it or not and he does genuinely want to better our country. He wouldn't have taken the Presidency if he didn't care at all lol BTW I was gonna vote Yang over Trump.

@jessehavlin1490," @petershin5130  If you want to know more about Turkey, Trump's most profitable hotel is in Istanbul. When leaders were discussing condemning Turkey for it's human-rights violations Trump met with Erdogan personally and derailed it. Then he withdrew from Syria after which Turkey invaded. Turkey has had a hard-on for murdering Kurds, and there were a lot in Syria. In the first 24 hours Turkish troops murdered a Kurdish human rights advocate. The Kurds were on of our main allies in this area, and were the ones that helped us defeat Isis and we abandoned them. This is why the emoluments clause is part of the Constitution, to prevent a president from enacting policy that monetarily benefits him. The world was disgusted with us for this action, but it wasn't long before something else popped up to distract everyone.   I don't believe Trump has the Nation's interests at heart, because his actions bely his words. You can tell a lot about a person by the way they treat those close to them. This is the same man who publicly shamed his wife, describing an affair as ""the best sex he's ever had"" in a newspaper, who withdrew cancer treatment for his brother's grandson after their parents sued to get back into the family will, who has put construction companies out of business by refusing to pay for millions of dollars of work and using lawyers to stall lawsuits until they ran out of money. These are just examples before he became president.    Like I said I don't have a problem with the actual right, and I don't condone leftist extremists. In the end we're more similar than we are different but we allow our emotions to divide us. I don't like Biden but I think it's obvious that Trump is a manipulator that deceives people into thinking he cares, when his actions display the opposite.",5년 전,5,
@steveaustin2686," @petershin5130  Let's break this up so I don't kill your brain all at once.  Trump in a rally in Scranton, PA on July 27th, 2016 asked if Russia would provide the emails for his political opponent. https://www.c-span.org/video/?413263-1/donald-trump-urges-russia-find-hillary-clinton-emails-criticizes-record-tpp  Trump's OWN son met with people he was told were tied to the Russian government to get dirt on Trump's political opponent.

Then it was about adoption. Then when Don Jr's emails came out is when Trump finally admitted that the meeting was about getting dirt on Hillary from a foreign power which is illegal. Solicitation of a foreign entity for help in an election is a crime. https://twitter.com/ellenlweintraub/status/1179783410820292608    The Mueller Report did not exonerate Trump and explicitly said that it could not exonerate Trump. Mueller, due to the DOJ memo, punted to Congress and the GOP decided to ignore Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors. https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf  As for Ukraine. Trump himself said he would accept foreign help in an election. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2HsUhK-gI0  Trump himself has said he froze the Ukraine aid that was approved by a GOP House and GOP Senate. Funny how it was not about corruption then, but because Europe wasn't paying enough. Now that Trump is caught, it's about corruption. See the video of Trump HIMSELF answering questions on why he blocked the aid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz2WXSs5Bvk&feature=youtu.be  Trump illegally blocked the Ukraine aid per the Senate. https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/minority/fact-check-president-trumps-false-claim-equating-his-illegal-ukraine-aid-freeze-with-president-obamas-lawful-legitimate-pauses-on-aid  Trump himself on his OWN phone call memo asked for a favor when Zelenskyy asked for the frozen aid. See the bottom of page 2 for Zelenskyy asking for the aid and the top of page 3 for the explicit Trump quid pro quo. https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Unclassified09.2019.pdf   Trump rambled about various baseless conspiracy theories on the call, but when asked exactly what he wanted later by a reporter, Trump HIMSELF said the investigation into Biden. https://youtu.be/eJd1y0TPPl8?t=99  Trump's Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney admitted the quid pro quo HIMSELF on camera and said it was politically motivated. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDQt5iOnO-I  Even if you accept that Mulvaney was discussing the Crowdstrike theory for the quid pro quo and not Trump's I want Biden investigated, the fact that either was politically motivated is a problem.   Again, solicitation of a foreign entity for help in an election is a crime. https://twitter.com/ellenlweintraub/status/1179783410820292608",5년 전,4,
@steveaustin2686," @petershin5130  Here's Trump's racism. Trump & his dad settled a discrimination suit on renting to minorities where they didn't have to admit guilt, but they DID have to do the things they would have had to do on retraining, marketing, etc as if they were found guilty. https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FH-NY-0024-0034.pdf   Trump is STILL saying that the Central Park 5 are guilty YEARS AFTER they had been found innocent through DNA testing. The confessions were coerced & they settled with NY for $41M. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/18/18684217/trump-central-park-5-netflix   Trump said that Judge Curiel (of Mexican descent) couldn't be fair to Trump as he was building the wall on the border. Sorry, saying someone of a particular heritage can not be fair to you because of that heritage, is the VERY definition of racism. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDxlMelzl10   Here is the march Friday, Aug 11th, 2017 for the Unite the Right rally HOSTED by the neo-nazis. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIrcB1sAN8I   Trump reads prepared speech about denoucing racism, adds the violence on many sides himself, & takes no questions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMQWJDVg8PA   Makes a teleprompter speech denouncing racism with no deviations and without answering questions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_JEUAcZxn8  Both the neo-nazis and anti-fascists had permits to assemble. Trump claims many were not nazis when the nazis hosted the rally! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwIU7iUfhow  This speech was the one w/the very fine people on both sides comment, when one side WAS the nazis. The Unite the Right rally was HOSTED by the nazis! Trump ignores that the nazis came ready to fight the anti-fascists & blames all the violence on the anti-fascists.   Trump claims that the protest the night before was people protesting quietly about taking down the statue, IGNORING the fact that they protest Friday night WAS the nazis marching as shown above!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIrcB1sAN8I   Trump told 4 AMERICAN congresswomen of color, THREE of which where born here in the US, to go back to their countries. That IS racist. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381394234941448   I have known racists, including my grandmother who was racist. She was very good at publicly denouncing racism, but her racism still came out. Trump's racism has come out as shown above, especially his lying defense of nazis in his very fine people comments.",5년 전,4,
@petershin5130," @jessehavlin1490  The whole Middle East situation is an absolute mess to begin with so I can't really comment on that. I wish we defended the Kurds because they do deserve their own country, but Turkey is also a NATO ally (unfortunately). Trump stated that he didn't want to get involved in the middle east which I agree we should, but we shouldn't have abandoned the Kurds. Trump is a blunt character who says what's in his mind and I do cringe at some things he has said, but like I said, I truly don't think he wakes up in the morning thinking to himself, ""how am I gonna oppress black people?"" Ironically, black support for Trump has actually increased. Plus, I personally hate Biden more because firstly, he made that statement ""if you dont vote for me, you ain't black"". He's also against the second amendment which is a huge factor in my decision on who I choose. But to clarify, I don't think Trump is the best thing since slice bread and he should learn to tone things down, but I understand why people would vote for him.",5년 전,0,

@Dantithesis,"You can do this at a Biden or any Democrat rally too and come up with the same and or similar moronic answers. It's been done before and this has too. Nothing new here, except the candidates and the spin. The comments will be nearly identical as what is posted here.  The old man's shirt was correct, Jordan wasn't. At 7:14 mark It isn't the first year To the second year as the dash normally indicates, but should have an ampersand between the first and second years as the next name and years explain this error of dash versus ampersand & indicates they will all be elected in both years shown.  But then how many news reporters, anchors and people in general, other than me, say repeatedly, 'there's' when they mean there're for there are? 'There's a lot of cars here.'  There are or there're a lot of cars here. Most unfortunately.. How many people say 'myself' when they mean 'me' or 'I'? Too many because the English language seems to be taught by semi-literate people who don't know the language they're (or will it now be they's?) teaching.  I'm not perfect either, but I at least try and I catch myself and correct myself.  ---------- Nor did President Trump invite a foreign government to interfere in our elections. Watch unedited video.  Also the Left doesn't recognize sarcasm unless it comes from the Left. There are other things this President has said with sarcasm that they take seriously. I imagine some of the people Jordan talked to wouldn't understand that either.   The current Democrat party has become the Republican party I despised with all the censorship and one way thinking. The lies and propaganda. They are the Establishment they and I loathed. How disappointing and tragic for the party and country. But they have done it before. Look it up. Democrats become Republicans in history..  ------- I've been watching all of this since the beginning and have seen the lies by intention and omission and the powers that be know that neither side really pays attention to anything but sound bites and will not research beyond social media or main stream media these days. You're all a bunch of suckers for each establishment you adhere to unless you research heavily and watch and listen first hand or by unedited second hand audio and video. Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter and Google are not the only games of news in town. Nor are network mainstream news. They all have good points but more bad than good.  I well know that this is longer than most currently living humans can tolerate or take the time to read and I will get blasted with negative comments from semi-literates, as I have seen it done to others that actually explain things and that just solidifies my concerns above, about people's abilities to read and speak properly. Go watch ""Idiocracy"", the movie and see what we'll probably be like in the near future and have some laughs. Lack of discernible communication greatly hinders human interactions, understanding and tolerance.  -------- At marker 1:48 there are two black gentlemen in the background, right in between Jordan and his then current mark. I saw others in the background. You won't look for them but Jordan should and should have. At 500 attendees and 13% of the population, there should be around 65.  Check your integrity Jordan Klepper.

@ham-sandwich228,"Google User YES, the flu and cars kill a ton of people. But the difference is that COVID has NO SOLUTION. The best we have is quarantine and face masks, and a few other things like ventilators. The flu has existed for a very long time, but there’s a vaccine. I bet half the people who died this year wouldn’t if more people were vaccinated. And cars? People suck ass at driving. Maybe if driver’s ed was better things would change. But the thing with cars is that they’re essential to almost everyone’s daily life, and it’s a chance we’re all willing to take. COVID is at this point almost certain death, if not very damaging to those who do survive. Also, has got to be said: I’m white as shit, but I strongly believe BLM. I don’t believe in riots and burning by any means, but this doesn’t just appear out of nowhere. This is the result of YEARS of systemic racism and police brutality. I mean, people are peacefully protesting and getting shot at with rubber bullets and tear gas.

There's plenty of ppl that have no choice about social distancing.... essential workers, doctors, nurses, assisted living tenants, nursing home tenants, even just ppl that have to go into the hospital ffs. What if your loved one breaks an arm and has to go to the hospital, the only hospital that is inundated with Covid-19 patients?

But I don’t believe that anything he did swayed the election at all, he would have won regardless because thankfully there’s enough people in this country including democrats that aren’t so brain dead as to elect somebody like Hillary. And the fact that you Democrat’s believe in joe Biden for president is a complete joke. You can’t criticize trump for being creepy with women because joe Biden is worse than trump when it comes to that and he does it with underage girls which is even worse. The mans not even smart enough to give his own speeches, he’s a puppet who can’t think for himself he’s being controlled by corrupt people. Democrats are the scum of this country, they’re the ones who just want free money and to not work for anything, they’re the ones who are at these riots destroying buildings and beating up/ killing people. If you can get any evidence to me of republicans who support trump at these riots or wanting do defund the police please do share because this just shows that Democrats are ruining this country and republicans are the ones keeping it intact. I’d also like to mention that it was Democrats who have been plotting this pandemic and causing all the jobs to be lost, they want people to lose their jobs so they have to rely on the government for money, it’s all a plot designed to help the democrats win this election. If you think trump altered the election at all last year just look at what the democrats are doing to win this year.

Education institutions absolutely equates to intelligence. People that get into Harvard or MIT tend to be very smart people, but sometimes smart people can’t afford those schools. Sure, scholarships exist, but very rarely do you get everything paid for. When you go to college more often than not you’re learning real facts that have been scientifically proven. For example I’m planning to be an elementary school teacher, and I have interest in taking child psychology. I don’t think that’s based on opinion.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

My own brother is a huge trump supporter and he says the same exact shit. He has absolute no logic in his beliefs. They just don’t want to be wrong so they have to do mental gymnastics and say some fucked up shit to go to the length of trying to get away with their belief. They think if you believe something hard enough then it will become true. And the reason they say shit like “grab em by the Pussy” and vulgar and offensive stuff is only to distract you so that way they don’t have to defend themselves and argue on actual issues. So instead of arguing on a legit issue you are arguing about whatever crazy or offensive word they said. Every single trump supporter I ever met has acted like this. If you support trump and you aren’t like this then do better. Maybe not vote for someone who brings the dumbest out of everybody. Maybe have more respect for yourself and your country. If you vote for trump you aren’t a true patriot because a true patriot wants the best for his country and wants someone to show pride and respect for his country and set a good example for other countries.

Why did the impeachment attempts fail?  They claim to be so much smarter than him.  They claim he's divisive.  They are the ones who are divisive.  The real message of the video is don't be dumb.  I say look at President Trumps agenda. It's better than the Dems.  And he's keeping his promises.",5년 전,0,

Sadly their are a small group of blacks that are sell outs to their own race they actually think their Europeans. This may sound crazy but it bares  nothing but facts. There  are blacks that I don't  identify with at all.  They have personality disorders and think they are not oppressed it's denial at its best.,5년 전,0,

Those interviewed people had really simple opinions and swallowed the bait easily. Does this make them lesser people? Do they deserve jokes on their accounts? I believe no.

It is also the predecessor of the rococo which was dominant in the first half of the 18th century. The baroque style was used to restore the dominance of the catholic Church.  The romantic movement came after the enlightenment rationalist. The term enlightenment was used to say that the world is becoming more clear. Rationalism is the idea that everything is solvable through the use of the human mind. An example of this in the literature is the Robinsonade.  The romantic movement started in the 19th century and was pretty much the opposite of Rationalism. The romantic movement focused on feelings and creativity while rationalsm focused on the human mind and rejecting feelings. The art was also not creative since they looked back at the greek and romans. The 2 dominant feelings in the romantic movement are Weltschmerz and sehnsucht. Weltschmerz is a feeling of melancholy and world-tiredness. Sehnsucht is the feeling of longing for unattainable love or luck.",5년 전,3,

Which is ironic considering apparently America was the first to abolish slavery (Vermont in 1777), although country as a whole would be in Haiti 1804. But anyway. The reason I brought that up is because they were the first-technically to abolish slavery which was at the time outlandish idea, but refuse to join the rest of the world's socialist centered economy.   You can thank the rich and powerful for that one. In fact Capitalism wasn't adopted, or created somewhere in the 17th or 18th century, and not at all what George Washington-- or what the Colonists envisioned for the future of then United States. Believe it or not, what the founding fathers had in mind was Socialism. lol. I know ironic isn't it? But back to Capitalism. It is an antiquated economic solution, that citizens are brainwashed into believing is the true source of freedom. To Americans socialism of any kind is immediately compared to Nazi Germany, Cuba (Communism actually, but they refuse to realize that distinction) and Venezuela. (In other words only the bad.

@yikes7918," Achilleskneel  ""Ad Hominem"" isn't garbage. It's an argument taught in school (at least in mine) to develop who you should listen to. Would you listen to Marc Dutroux explaining you how to take care of children ?  Would you listen to Hitler explaining you how to treat races and ethnicities equally ? And just explain to me how the president of a country doesn't relate with the country he's leading ? You talk about empirical arguments and facts but your conjectures cannot be more wrong. The US being the greatest entity of all time is a conjecture, you can't predict the future, the US were just the latest to get n°1 position but no one rules forever. You say we want to be Americans but how would you know that ? There is no statistics about this, so the only things that would give you a hint is either having travelled to Europe or being born here (that's why people say """"I think you should visit other countires"""") You say that the reason why we would want to be Americans is ""solely for material reasons America has the highest standard of living humanity has ever seen"". Firstable I've never heard someone saying ""I want to be American ""solely for material reason"""" and it's likely no one has. And secondable your country having the highest standard of living is also a joke since with little effort in googling the questions you find this : ""In the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education, and per capita income levels, the United States is relatively high, currently ranking 8th. However, the Human Development Index is not considered a measure of living standards, but a measure of potential living standards were there no inequality: rather, the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is considered the actual level of human development, taking inequality into account. On the inequality-adjusted HDI, the United States ranked 27th in 2014, tied with Poland.[4]  In 2013, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Where-to-be-born Index, which takes into account material well-being as measured by GDP per capita, life expectancy, political stability, the quality of family life based on divorce rates, community life, crime and terrorism rates, gender equality, the quality of governance, climate, and unemployment rates, ranked the United States at 16th place, tied with Germany.[5]"" Thanks wikipedia by the way. So as you can see your statement is (again) false. ""The ironic thing is those who most benefitted from it denounce it the loudest."" Lmao, you mean the fact that the US injected money in Europe for getting allies and land to store nukes (Yes my country has a dozen of US nukes on his soil) after getting credit for winning 2 world wars by having waited for both sides to weaken (I'm being a bit rash but you get it). It was done in Cold Ward context and for getting economical allies, to develop further your own economy. So yes, we benefited from you but so did you. And I also think it's kind of normal for us, being fed up with your bullshit. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 was caused by your own idiocy but it had a lower impact in the US than in Europe, and this very crash is a great factor, for historians, to the growth of the nazi party in Germany. The crisis at the start of the 2000s came from you but you recovered in a short amount of time while all of Europe had a hard time recovering and this crisis may be the cause or a big factor to the Greek crisis which is impacting all of our economy. So of course, now that we see your leader is a real narcissistic dumbass which has been elected democraticaly, we have two reactions : ""Wtf we have underestimated their stupidity"" and ""Ah shit, here we go again"" which can be summarized as ""This is why other countries think America sucks."".",5년 전(수정됨),2,

@nl9444,"Achilleskneel 🇸🇬 Singaporean here. Obviously a standard of living figure is accurate only to the extent of what the indices are used, but a holistic consideration of factors like healthcare, life expectancy, literacy rates, crime rates, equality and GDP gives a rather fair assessment, although it’s not to say it cannot be better or ignores certain areas.  You mentioned the great American freedom of speech and press, unlike countries in Europe. Singapore gets that criticism a lot too from the West. It’s true we don’t have unrestricted freedom of speech and that is because we DON’T believe in the freedom to incite violence, racial hurt or sedition. Freedoms are important obviously but not when it harms the community. Racial and religious harmony are fiercely protected in Singapore because we’ve seen how divisive racial riots in the 60s were. That’s the difference between a collectivist society and one that is highly individualistic. No country is perfect and what works for one might not be valued by another. Harping on your beliefs that your country is superior to others merely shows your hubris and unwillingness to acknowledge that other countries don’t share the same things you value in the US system. American values aren’t THE only right values for society.  “Singapore has better opportunities” — sure we are one of the top trading and financial hubs in Asia but that is only because of good governance and leaders with foresight. My country did not even desire independence in 1965; we were kicked out of the Federation of Malaysia (for political differences) and no one expected us to survive. We have zero natural resources and hardly any land. My point being that achieving high standards of living is not merely about resources or ‘opportunities’, but about the quality of governance and longsighted leadership.   And quality of leadership is shown in how countries have been dealing with the covid-19 crisis. Like many other states in Asia, Australia and NZ, our govs  cooperate, work closely with doctors and scientists to tackle the covid crisis, relies on data-backed science instead of downplaying covid, recklessly telling the public about unfounded cures, or pushing the blame to Obama.",5년 전,0,

Every country has their own flaws but the severity of those flaws are subjective.  So I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS5WYp5xmvI I never really looked at the results of Trumps actions and I never really cared because I don't like him. From a purely economic view, Trump may be a good president but like Thomas Sowell said ""The president has 300 millions lives under him""(I don't remember the exact quote but something like this). I feel as if Trump doesn't care much about the people and wants to run America as a company. He was in support of the protest against the lockdown because he also wants to reopen the country even when experts say that it wasn't safe. He was against the protest against police brutality and even called unarmed protestors ""thugs"". I see him as a giant hypocrite and that's why I don't like him.   I think that Sowell made good arguments for his world view with statistics to back him up. A wellfare state might not work in America but I still think that a wellfare state is good.

@TengenToppaTurtle," Achilleskneel  historical examples just don't apply I hope you know this. Feudal Japan was an economic super power but also had a rape culture and used cheap labor of Koreans, so they're not comparable to today because those concepts aren't accepted. The same applies to your logic. Greece and Rome(along with many other countries/states at the time but just naming these two) were known to assimilate culture and while on voyages rape other shipmates. Democracy was considered 2000+ years ago but wasn't practiced in America til abt 200+ years ago. Concept doesn't stand for execution. America took American Democracy and benefitted due to slavery. The country entered a state of economic power because we didn't stop the slave trade til nearly 100 years later past other MDCs. By abusing free and cheap labor, the country's backbone was built. Democracy now isn't abt slavery but it started as being based around slavery. It's like if i use drugs during an Olympic sprint to be faster while everyone else on my team doesn't. Even though they didn't abuse the system, I did which gave them an unfair advantage to the other teams. That's how America started and to be fair, other major countries did as well. But the difference is other countries have admitted their faults and we have sympathizers like yourself who try to explain away our problems as the past. In states like Kentucky, segregation didn't end until the 1960s. My grandparents went to segregated schools all their lives . So it's not crazy to assume that because these ceos and managers of companies are older people from when segregation, racism, sexism, and homophobia was OK would hold biases based on their childhood because that's how they were raised. Systematic racism, sexism and homophobia is a thing. By law everyone is equal, but socially we are not. so when society uses business and corporations to oppress groups of people, it is expressed by those very people who you once would have idolized.

Germany has 9,179 deaths due to corona and a population of 83 million. CA has 7,891 deaths due to corona and a population of 40(39,51)million. 9179/83≈110 deaths per million (Germany). 7891/40≈197 deaths per million(CA). No, CA is not doing better than Germany.   In fact Germany doesn't have more new cases than their first peak in new cases unlike... I don't know... CA? Or America? Where there are new record breaking daily cases. How many new cases did CA have? Wow 10,806 new cases that's a new record for CA. How many did Germany have? Wow 642 new cases that's a new rec- oh wait 6933 new cases is their record in daily cases. Even when you look at deaths. Germany had 10 new deaths. CA had 124 new deaths.   Also, you are comparing a country against a state. But the state is still doing worse than the country when looking at numbers. Germany has a population density of 623 people per mi^2. CA has a population density of 254 people per mi^2. CA is doing worse than Germany even though it has a lower population density.  ""Why would the President need to intervene?""  Yea why would the president of the United States need to handle a pandemic that is affecting the whole country.

@daanydoomboy5593,"​ @TyetheRebel  I am not from the US either. From what I have seen on the media in my country, on reddit, on youtube, on twitter and on imgur, there are hundreds of protests happening in America against racism.   In America, it is a constitutional right to gather and protest peacefully.  In this ""land of the free"" I have seen dozens (I am not even exagerating, litteraly dozens) of videos where people are protesting peacefully and then suddenly the police starts spraying pepperspray, shooting tear gas, shooting rubber ""non lethal"" bullets, charging the mass, beating people. Even running police vehicles into the masses.  Now this troll @Achilleskneel tries to disregard all this as left-wing fake news, pretending it is not happening.   Yet, I have seen a video (so not an article) where: - police shoots pepperspray in the eyes of an alreadly handcuffed person - a policeman on a horse running over a woman who was just standing still, looking in the opposite direction - 2 police vehicles driving in a group of protesters -  an old man with a walkingstick (I don't know the correct english word for this object, but you know: a stick to help walking) who could not get away fast enough when the police charged, so the police kicked his stick underneath him away and threw him on the ground. -  another old man being pushed on the ground, falling on the back of his head. A lot of blood came out and he was uncounscious. None of the policemen at the scene did anything. They simply walked over him. - Protesters protesting peacefully, when all of a sudden police shoots pepperspray and starts beating the first row, without any warning. - Handcuffed people already on the ground, getting hit in the face with fists. - police punching an australian camera crew who were reporting the protests - police shooting rubber bullets at an american live reporter, live. -  a policeman so eager to hit someone, that he pushed multiple of his colleages away, trying to get to 2 other policemen who just got someone arrested, and beating that guy with his bat.  This is all by heart. I know there are more. This is all on video. Achilleskneel will say it's fake, but once again, it is on video.   and now recently, I have seen multiple videos about people in unmarked vans, with no badge number or any other identification, collecting people off the streets, dragging them into vans, without saying why or where they are going to. The people getting dragged in the van were just walking.   Now why is this terrorism? You can by bullet proof vests that say ""police"" on amazon. You can buy guns and those vans are hired (so you can hire them too). If you would then kidnap someone, there is litteraly no difference. You could be walking home, having done absolutly nothing, and you could be arrested on the spot, being dragged in a van, without a word.   Before this troll achilleskneel says ""that's fake too"", Trump admitted it himself and said he will do this in other cities as well. he himself calls it secret federal police  Geheime staatspolizei Ge-sta-po geheime is german for secret staatspolizei is german for federal police  This is terrorism. If you can get arrested because you protested peacefully or said something, which is your constitutional right, then that causes fear. This is not freedom. This is not freedom of speech. If you say the wrong thing, you can be kidnapped. It has been reported that those kidnapped people were denied of their phonecall and went hours without food or water. How is this not striking fear? This is the american government striking fear under its very own people. Fear of speaking out.   And yes, that is terrorism:  ""Terrorism"" /ˈtɛrərɪzəm/  noun  the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.   If you have any more questions, tyetherebel, I will gladly continue our civil discussion. sorry for the long text",5년 전,0,
@yz6134," Achilleskneel  So you didn't lie about how a state is performing better than a whole country?  ""Because you lied and we both know it."" Can say the same about you.  "" My homestate of CA has a lower death per million than even vaunted Germany, yet they just came out and are initiating a second round of closures."" No, it doesn't have a lower death per million than Germany. CA does have more surface area and less people but most importantly it has more new cases, more total cases and more new deaths. Also corona cases are rising in CA which is why they are initiating a second round of closures but maybe that data is too hard for you to understand. Bet you won't respond to that though.   ""I guess I may be biased due to the media.""  This quote was again from a different topic. I may be biased when talking about Trump and Obama but that doesn't mean I'm biased in everything. Do you think that you are unbiased in every topic? If you really think so then you are a joke. Even when people say ""I don't want to be an American"" you just can't accept that. People don't want to be American because America isn't  ""the greatest entity of all time"".

@yz6134," Achilleskneel  Not responding huh? Guess that's to be expected since Americans love to ignore corona and are tired of it thinking that they are doing good. You even thought that CA did better than Germany which it does not.  Trump even wants schools to reopen in fall while corona is rising AGAIN and really fucking hard. 74987 new cases just a week ago. But according to Trump that is ONLY because there is more testing. Trump even thinks he handled corona great with almost 150000 deaths. He also thinks that America has one of the lowest mortality rates even the best mortality rate in the world. Like you who thinks that CA had a better mortality rate than Germany.  America is number 1. Number 1 in corona cases and total deaths.  Edit: congratulations, America has a new record of 78009 new corona cases in a day. Florida being the biggest contributor with 12444 new cases and followed closely by California with 10593 new cases! The ""second round of closures"" is totally unjustified though.   I'm really jealous of America right now. Like I would like to live there especially in California where the death/ 1M population is 211. No way would I want to live in Germany where the death/ 1M population is 110. There were only 818 new cases. Germany is absolutely doing worse than California.

@dr.emilschaffhausen4683," @milkboy7906  Parents play a significant role in how individuals grow up and view the world. From overtly blatant teaching to subtle and non-verbal communication they shape the way you think and believe. From the news outlets they watch to the books they read. Your home environment has an impact on you as much or more than your friends and school experience.  The truth is that at the end of the day we're all Americans, and at one time that united us despite political differences. Traditional democrats and conservatives share a lot of common ground, but this connection is being eroded away by mainstream media and hostile political rhetoric.   Imagine what could be accomplished if we acknowledged our differences and made concessions to do what's right for the good of the nation. When we become a people unwilling to listen to opposing viewpoints we have lost our humanity.  Both sides of the political spectrum need to realize that neither side has a monopoly on virtue, morality, integrity or any other positive trait. The same goes for negative traits. For every immoral and corrupt politician on the right you can find an equally corrupt and immoral politician on the left. That is a travesty.  At the end of the day we all need to listen to each other and stop pointing fingers and blaming groups of millions of people at a time based on the actions of a few.   One of the problems we face today is the overt bias screaming at us from our monitors and tvs day in and day out via mainstream media. When news ceased being news a decade ago and became commentary with an agenda we lost an important part of society.  Today these ""news"" organizations are simply mouthpieces for the powerful men and women who own them.

@michaelcombrink8165," @just_very_queer  had to look up some stuff, still not sure what ""boi"" means exactly   i posted the following last year after a day at work, although it does not represent trump, it represents me and a fair attempt at what i think is ideal, that everyone should be respected, i personally think men and women are meant to be happily married in loyal relationships raising children in love to be the best they can be but i believe that we should still respect people regardless of their beliefs, and we should only interfere with freedoms to protect freedom (such as imprisoning a criminal to protect the freedom of others)  start of post the subject of ""guys asking to be called to be girls and vice versa"" came up, someone mentioned that they don't want to say the wrong ""title"" he she etc., For fear of getting in trouble. I felt I should form up my opinions around the matter and this is what I've got  My job is to be a good person, kind, considerate, helpful, fulfill commitments, strive to improve myself, make the world a better place and bring some smiles  I might be wrong but from what I've seen, not everyone, but a lot of people trying to live these ways are doing it for reasons besides physical attraction. Like To avoid the insanity and discomfort of dating and twitterpation (Bambi reference) Because they feel guys are jerks and are more comfortable with girls, or that girls are terrifying and are more comfortable with guys Because they fear trying and not being accepted so to avoid embarrassment they say they don't care To get attention They feel boxed in by cultural expectations of what it is to be a man or woman, (I personally think that men should feel free to sew and women should feel free to use a chainsaw, and maybe the teasing and harassment around things like this make people feel like the only way they can do something different is to be called gay)  And for those who do try alternatives because of physical urges, one thought I have is that marriage is about much more than physical urges, in a movie a few years ago called ""The Imitation Game"" the main character who was a man was physically attracted to men and not women, but happened to become good friends with a woman and just the way the actors are on screen is very much many of the details I believe are what the marriage relationship is for  That ideally marriage is a friendship, a partnership stronger than anything, to take on life's challenges and enjoy eachother in many ways the quirks, the humor, the flaws. To have someone you have weathered a thousand storms with, laughed a thousand laughs with, cried a thousand tears with  No matter the reason I don't think cruelty, or judgement, will help anything I think a lot of things are improved by understanding, kindness, respect, friendship, righteousness, listening, reaching out, helping, serving, compassion and more.  There are a lot of weird things in everyone's life and none of us like to be looked at weird or criticized for them, there are a lot of things we all need to work on, (debt, waking up earlier, diet, all kinds of stuff) but I think a kind word is more likely to help than a harsh one and that that is a good reason.

My IQ is 120, which is significantly above average. However, I have a learning disability that affects my ability to process non-verbal cues and spatial awareness; so I was in special education. When I was in first and second grade, there were no special education teachers in my neighborhood school, so I had to take the short bus to the school on the other side of town.  Other students with high IQ’s also may go on the short bus if they are, say, hard of hearing or on the autism spectrum. Also, mental illness is not the same as intellectual disability.

As you've explained, Trump thrives in a divided state and he's not likely to want to unify it anytime soon.

These kind of stereotypical narratives make it more difficult to understand what is actually going on.

The only reason all wars have been started by men(and they haven't becuase there were many brutal and powerful women leaders in history that started wars) is that men are usually given such roles that allow them to start such things.  Just from personal experience though, I'd say women would start many more wars if they were in charge across the globe.  Like let's say you found quite decent men and women to rule somehow.  You'd probably see the women starting more battles and wars once a problem comes up.  Generally they tend to get more hostile when they have an enemy but with men it could go both ways, it just depends on the guy",5년 전,1,

Off there are great women leaders but I'd say they weren't allowed to be leaders in the past because of their personality.   That's stupid because with the right upbringing anybody can become a great leader but in the U.S. case I would prefer a guy because really the people that even get a chance to run are the absolute worst of their kind so whatever bad traits women or men commonly have are going to be at their worst.

Now Biden’s running AGAINST your CORRUPT motherfucker.   Now the woman who complained in the 90s, is PAID & brought forward BY CORRUPT Drumpf. She’s a history of writing BAD checks, literally. It shows CRIMINAL INTENT, which means she’s a liar. Money moves those who are tinged with Criminal intent.

@beanismygod9732, @DynamicAero  it wasn't her that took down Laden. That was circumstance. That had to happen and whoever was in her position would have done it. And she is not better than trump.

@beanismygod9732," @insulam821  I respect your outlook. But since you're not American there's a large part of this you're not seeing unfortunately as im sure you'd have a lot of good to say on it. And not only you, but many Americans are blind to this as well. In this country it's extremely difficult to get a view of a politicians actions that's not through a funnel. This country needs some serious media reform because just about all of the mainstream media is far left, minus Fox which is far right and not much better either. It's pretty terrifying that this countries media has been engaged in the largest witch hunt since Salem. You mentioned that I sound like a strong conservative. It does sound like that, but that's only because I'm fighting against this witch hunt that uses no facts. There are no facts for them to use, so what they do is coverup his good deeds and take him out of context and spin his words to sound bad. He isn't perfect. He is a bit pompous and egotistical. But he's also done more good for this country than any President in modern history. Beyond political standings, he stands on the side of truth. That may be because he hardly is a politician. He only became one when he decided to run for president because he saw the countries downward spiral and had to act.",5년 전,1,
@DynamicAero," @beanismygod9732  Okay, so nothing Trump does ever is actually because he's so good, because it needed to have been done and would have been done anyway. Sounds good.   You do realize Clinton was investigated by Republicans 16 times in the past decade, right? Not once did anyone find anything illegal. The emails thing was found by the Republican Congress to not be illegal.

He has done some good things, like passing the stimulus check, which, while not much, at least is keeping families afloat for a little bit. But yeah, Clinton was the most qualified and exonerated candidate for President in a long time, perhaps ever, but populism generally wins and she was a severely unlikable candidate.",5년 전,1,
@beanismygod9732," @insulam821  a debate where the candidates hate each other but are polite about it sounds refreshing lol. There's also multiple parties on our voting tickets. Sadly though, the only ones that have a chance are the republicans and democrats since the 3rd parties don't have a platform. I wouldn't mind a libertarian winning, like Gary Johnson. You won't ever hear anything about him or other 3rd party candidates tho because people and the media focus on the big kahunas. As for Bernie, I'd say he's farther in the left than any of the other democratic candidates this race, except maybe Warren. Also, this isn't talked about much, but there is a clandestine communist party that's been growing for some time in America. Democratic socialists  are what they're called and I'd definitely say Bernie fits the bill. He's also uptalked cuba's government a number of times which hasn't helped his campaign. I believe he's a good man, but not what the country needs. Sadly a lot of these democratic socialists don't even realize that they're on the verge of (and sometimes are) communists.

That is how Trump got into the office, our government is corrupted it is hard you anyone other then a white old people with an out dated mindset.

News is fake they are paid to lie and make up rumors by democratic leaders to make people who don’t know politics act like they are stupid on camera like this video shows. As these riots go on in America it’s just another example of how big democratic celebrities and politicians are funding to bail people out of jail to keep the riots going to cause more chaos to blame it more on the republicans to blame on trump to create more rumors and more hate towards the actual good citizens of this country. There is no actual goodness to these riots fake news or democrats that hypocritically blame trump for things that they’ve actually done. Think about it all news media’s and sources have been paid off to start fake scandalous news like trump rigging elections in 2016 with Russian hacking the election. The impeachment of trump was all super unofficial and bs. Some points brought up in the impeachment was him and the Russians supposedly rigging the elections but therefore there was entirely no proof that every happens but if it was true the would of defiantly found proof. The impeachment was a whole waste of time.

@donovan3476,"🧡My Open & Long Love Letter to The Great President Trump🧡:  1st Real News is found on FOX, Sinclair Broadcasting, America One, Russian and North Korean State TV, where Trump is loved by ALL. 45 is really smart and a Super Genius. He knows words, many words which can be found in any children's books.Trump is the Most Dedicated President, ever to exist, evident by his Excellent Golf Prowess.  Starting really with nothing at all & only $14 million, borrowed from his father, he became ""A Self Made Billionaire"" who is very generous and donates tens of thousands of dollars to many charities, benefiting several clubs, his golf clubs.  He never lies to his supporters and tells them what they want to believe; self righteous indignation, smothered in a heavy dose of blissful ignorance.  Self-imagined, as a selfless, brave and a courageous war hero, a Superior Military Strategist who ""knows more than the Generals"", deserving of a great military parade where he can receive the Stolen Valor he so desperately desires & deserves. Those who thinks he is a sniveling coward are wrong. Bone Spurs are dangerous, contagious and can kill you. Trump kept his promise and is now worthy of The Nobel Prize for bringing American Soldiers ""HOME"" to Saudi Arabia & Iraq and ending the war, bringing peace to America & The Entire World. He is my hero and a ""Stable Genius"" with a very very large ""a-brain"". His speeches are even more awe inspiring than those made by the late great Jim Jones or Marshall Applewhite. I shall build a great temple in the shape & color of The Great Pumpkin in his honor, filled with oranges. nuts & bananas, to Worship Him. This temple (☭💒حلال), paid for by Mexico, shall rival those built for Kim Jong-un in North Korea. A Unicorn 🦄 lair was discovered in North Korea. Several will be imported to graze around this most beautiful garden ever seen. As Trump will proudly tell you, All Men Want To Be His Friend & All Women Want To Be In His Bed because he is The Greatest Sex-Machine The World Has Ever Seen.  If he grab you by the 🐈, he's only acknowledging your sexual desire for him and you are pretty enough to do. Therefore The Temple Garden will be surrounded by beautiful naked statues of Trump's virile & manly likeness, outshining the Statue of David sculpted by the amateur painter, architect and poet, Michelangelo. Once we join forces with our true friends & Allies; Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un & Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, America will be Great Again. I look forward to the day when my ""Dear Leader"" thanks me with a warm embrace with his great big giant hands, as appreciation for my blind love, devoted loyalty & unshakable bias. Followed by the blissful temple chant: Bing Bong Bong Bing Bong......... Those who are convinced it's OK to put children in cages, no doubt can be easily convinced it's equally OK to put people in ovens........... They can always say ""Just follow Mein Fuhrer's orders"".",5년 전,0,

There has to come a time when a Congress, which has already banned bribes, introduces legislation to shut down all these propagandistic, unprofitable outlets (Fox News, OAN, Newsmax, The Blaze, Daily Caller, Daily Wire, Daily Signal, Breitbart, The Federalist, Gateway Pundit, Townhall, etc.) in order for these rallygoers to ever have a chance to come back to reality.  ▰ On a final note, this is what a quick-witted person looks like, which is awfully different from the likes of Ben ""Gish Gallop Master"" Shapiro and Tucker ""Perpetually Perplexed"" Carlson.",5년 전,0,

@steveebling8480,"Obama is a conman.  He conned Americans into electing him President without any previous accomplishment in his life that didn't involve him conning people into electing him. He governed as an incompetent fool, without any basic knowledge of finance or history or climate or foreign or domestic affairs.   Obamacare perfectly defines this con man.   He promised full televised disclosure of the ACA legislation and five days for us to read the bill before Congress voted on it. Then wrote his bill in blackout secrecy and put it up for vote, unread by anyone, at 1:00 AM on Christmas Eve, when no one would notice, and no less a fool than Nancy Pelosi crowed, ""We have to pass it to see what's in it!""   And so, we have Obamacare. An ill-conceived, fraudulently advertised, incompetently implemented and administered, financially unsustainable nightmare of wealth redistribution that costs taxpayers $130 billion/yr. so 6 million formerly uninsured people can buy health insurance. Do the math! The website alone cost us $2 billion! This moral and financial catastrophe, written by insurance companies to enrich themselves, is the stupidest legislation in Congressional history and a disgrace worthy of the Obama name. Otherwise:  Domestically:  • He suffocated businesses with the highest sustained taxation in history and 97,000 pages of mostly asinine regulations that cost businesses $1 trillion/yr.   • He supervised the worst economic recovery since WWII. His best year (2015) saw GDP grow only 2.9%. He averaged a pathetic 1.9% of GDP growth/yr.  • He took office at the end of massive recession and the only direction was up! After 7 ½ tears, his economy grew +17.1% and Jobs +10.9%. The average for this period in the 10 previous elections is was GDP +33.5% and Jobs +18%.   • His economic forecasts failed every year.   • The Fed printed $4 trillion and bought treasury bonds with it to keep us solvent.   • Unemployment increased steadily from 34% to 38% (based on Labor Participation Rate).  • Average hourly wages increased by about 2%/yr.   • Median family income fell from $56,000 to $51,000.  • He wasted billions of dollars enriching his donners on failed Solar and Alternative energy farces.   • He added $10 trillion to our debt.   • He set race relations back 50 years by supporting the Black Lives Matter and White Privilege stupidities.   • His election was mostly financed by banks and universities.   • Citibank chose his cabinet.   • He censored or denied access to more government files than any previous President.   • He had the NSA spying on citizens, Congress, Supreme Court Judges, Federal Judges, and journalists   • He thinks the weather is out biggest problem.   Internationally:  • He made Hillary Clinton Secretary of State.   • He apparently slept through the Benghazi horror.   • He completely misunderstood the rising threat of Islam.  • He scorned ISIS as a ‘Jay Vee team’ and refused to acknowledge it.   • He created an environment if the Middle East where ISIS thrived.   • He pissed on Israel and supported the Muslim Brotherhood.  • He declared war on Libya without Congressional approval.  • He bypassed Congress to make a personal nuclear deal with Iran and got fleeced. They agreed to pretend they would stop their nuclear program but refused to allow inspections and got Obama to protect them from Israel and then did not even sign the deal.   • The Iranian nuclear fiasco ended with Obama refinancing Iranian terrorism with $150 billion of the Shah’s money, resulting in massive carnage in Syria.   • He foolishly thought if he made Iran a regional power, they would be good world citizens.   • He declared war on Libya without Congressional approval and mishandled it so badly that Libya evolved into a giant terrorist training camp.   • He mishandled Syria and Libya so badly that 400,000 Muslims were killed, causing (with Bush’s sincere help) the massive Islamic invasion currently ruining Europe and threatening us.  • He sanctioned the idiotic Paris climate deal.   • He sold more arms worldwide than any President since WWII.   • In 2016 he dropped 126,000+ bombs on seven countries without effect.   His record remains intact. He has still never accomplished anything competently in his life beyond mastering the art of conning people. If you support him, you’re a fool.",5년 전,0,

I am not for open borders but I know that all European countries US including have unfair procedures for people to legally come in our countries and live here as we can in theirs. Nobody  says open borders but don't ask someone to wait years for the right to move legally in your country and then complain they did it illegally.

So you can finally see how fucking ridiculous you look/sound when you try to prove your point by using other's ignorance? I am not even American, so I don't give a single shit, but all I know is that if you base your opinion about other ideologies exclusively based on ignorant people that supposedly support and live by those ideas , you are just as stupid as them.

@lcflngn,"I totally hear you. I told my kids (now 20 and 25) that the thing that truly disturbs me, that absolutely saddens me the most about our last 3+ + years is the cynicism it has engendered in them and many in their their generation. I grew up with Nixon and Watergate, we were actually called “the cynical generation” until we were stuck at the end of boomers (makes no sense, I could argue that all day elsewhere) but this is heartbreaking. My son already saw the world in black & white (not skin color, just no shades of gray about politics) and this has simply cemented his thorough disgust for our country, and for many of our people. Fortunately my daughter, the 20-yr old, writes to her congresspeople and tries. And at least they both vote, thank goodness for that. All that said, I work with college students every day, and they truly give me hope for the future. Feeling pretty disgusted as well, but there is actually a lot of brightness out there. If your daughter could find a club or some cause, some way of making personal, even incremental, change, I suspect she’d feel less depressed about all this.

And he hasn't changed.  What gets me is how stupid everyone who voted for him to get the wool pulled over their eyes that he was a skilled bizman. He's a conman.

@djqlxix2112," Achilleskneel , if it's proof of Trump's racism you want you can start with these...  - According to the federal government, Trump’s real-estate company tried to avoid renting apartments to African-Americans in the 1970s and gave preferential treatment to whites. - Trump criticized a black accountant saying:  “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.” And: "" I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks.” - In 1989, Trump took out ads in New York newspapers urging the death penalty for five black and Latino teenagers accused of raping a white woman in Central Park; as of June 2019, he still claimed that they were guilty more than 15 years after DNA evidence proved them to be innocent. - He said: “I think sometimes a black may think they don’t have an advantage or this and that. I’ve said on one occasion, even about myself, if I were starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I really believe they do have an actual advantage.” - He started his 2016 presidential campaign with a speech calling Mexican immigrants criminals and “rapists,"" and uses the gang MS-13 to put down all immigrants. - He called for: ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” including refusing to let American citizens who happened to be Muslim back into the country. - He said that the federal judge hearing the case against Trump University was biased because of the judge’s Mexican heritage. - He said that 15,000 immigrants from Haiti: “all have AIDS” and that 40,000 Nigerians, once they saw the United States, would never: “go back to their huts” in Africa. - Before the midterm elections, Trump demonized dark-skinned immigrants and produced an ad about a caravan of migrants traveling through Mexico. The ad was so racist that even Fox News wouldn't air it. Trump said that the caravan included: “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners.” - He called undocumented immigrants: “animals” and that they would: “pour into and infest our country.” He also said that migrants were bringing diseases into the country. - He always called President Obama lazy and claimed that he was a Muslim from Kenya. - He likes to ""exaggerate"" about crimes committed by dark-skinned people, comparing them to radical Islamic terrorists but never talks about the hate crimes committed by white people (usually Klan, Neo-Nazis, or both, but they're always a big supporter of his).  - He said that there were some: ""very fine people"" marching and carrying torches in a White Supremacist parade. - He likes to say that some prominent African-Americans are unpatriotic, ungrateful and disrespectful, and should be fired because they were exercising their first amendment rights. - He let more than 3,000 Americans die, barely did anything to help them recover from a hurricane (maybe he should've ""nuked"" it before it hit LOL), then called them: “politically motivated ingrates.” - He also has a pattern of criticizing African-Americans as unintelligent or racist. - He told four minority congresswomen (who are all American citizens) to: “go back” to: “the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.” - He liked the fact that David Duke, the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, endorsed him for president. - He has endorsed or praised politicians who've made racist statements defended the Confederacy or associated themselves with white supremacists, including Roy Moore in Alabama. - When promoting his casino (which he bankrupted. Who in the hell bankrupts a CASINO? LOL) he took out ads saying the: “Mohawk Indian record of criminal activity is well documented.” - He said that Native Americans in Connecticut were faking their ancestry, saying: “I think I might have more Indian blood than a lot of the so-called Indians that are trying to open up the reservations.” Maybe we should be calling HIM Pocahontas. LOL - Speaking of which, when Tweeting about Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he made fun of the Trail of Tears, a forced exodus that killed thousands of Native Americans. - He once called a Hispanic Miss Universe: “Miss Housekeeping.” - At one of his campaign rallies, he pointed to one guy in the crowd and said: “Oh, look at my African-American over here. Look at him.” - He said this (if you can make any sense out of his gibberish)... ""Can you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time!"" Look who he singles out as ""savages"": Tlaib: Muslim Omar: Muslim Pressley: Black Nadler: Jewish Schiff: Jewish AOC: Puerto Rican https://youtu.be/ajpDkwJbo1U",5년 전,9,

@phillipstoltzfus3014, @ritawilliams4362  He has cut regulations and taxes. He had and will have again the economy the best its ever been. He avoided a war with North Korea. He is working to stop illegals and human traffickers from entering across the Mexican border. He is putting and end to China ripping us off. He is ending the war in the middle east. He is a against killing unborn babies. He is rebuilding our military.  He is cracking down on social media and big tech censorship. He is standing with christians on their right of freedom of religion. He will defend the second amendment which is already unconstitutionally trampled upon. That's just off the top of my head.,5년 전,0,

They perceived the worst cruelties, like family separations, brutal beatings of children and adults, which sometimes resulted in death, and rampant sexual assaults against enslaved girls and women, to be more than any human should be expected to endure.

Sorry Hillary my not have been the best of the democratic nominees, but I feel she would have be more presidential then our current one. He acts like a child, should really lay off the Twitter.

Not only can anyone with the proper program prove the one posted as evidence was a hodge podge of copy and paste but EVEN without the program(publisher, illustrator or whichever program it is....) one can visually see the font is different throughout the document. Beyond that when it was first debated, a secret service agent attested to it being fake, and then so did Obama.  Obama claimed they did so to take the heat off of not having one/or any form of proof!!!  BUT let's pretend Obama really was born in the US, in Hawaii..... EVEN IF he was, his citizenship was transferred to being that of Indonesian citizenship!!! That AUTOMATICALLY makes him inelligible to become president, EVEN IF he had transferred citizenship back to a USA citizenship!!! Something he DID NOT DO!! He is an illegal alien, as he came into this country, same as his supposed biological father, As a college student. He has not maintained a student or work VISA, now long expired, and never applied for or followed through with naturalization and so, he is also an illegal alien!!!! Even to claim his marriage to Michael, I mean Michelle, makes him a naturalized citizen, they never applied for, were granted such and never followed through to completion if they did start the process!!! ALL of which disqualifies him, makes him ineligible to have become president!!!  My comment about Michelle being ""Michael"" comes from Obama's own lips via live press conference and later in an interview! In the press conference he didn't even correct himself only hesitated a millisecond if any at all after having said, quote, ""Michael and I""!!  Another set of PROOFS that he was not born in Hawaii and has never been a citizen is his PROUD admission to being Kenyan born like his father. He did so in his book, dreams from my father or whatever it's called... To which he had all not sold recalled, destroyed, changed & reprinted after his birth and citizenship was contested. That is just one proof from his very own mouth!!!  The other came once he left office and gave a speech at a Kenyan Nelson Mandela memorial opening, where he stated something to the effects of, ""it felt good to come back home having accomplished being Kenyan's first US president"" ANOTHER PROOF FROM HIS OWN LIPS!!!  Obummer was not president when 9/11 happened, but he did sign a beam from one of the detonated/exploded towers, on a 9/11 anniversary, to be placed into the new tower!

And then Donald Trump thinks he's going to run his mouth is so that they don't get paid. Obviously America distant understand what the impeachment was about. Both sides where a farce. Because it was exactly the truth of what he did. And there is no Democrat or Republican with the power of the NRA. Somebody was supposed to bring them his head on a stick. So you bet your ass he acted the way he did for a reason. And you bet your ass Congress acted the way they did for a reason..... Why do you come to me on the day of my daughter's wedding? Okay...

I hear many of you people in the comments labeling people like me and this crowd as “Dumb” and “Moronic” though I can say that not many of you have taken the time to think that maybe Klepper and his media outlet have mislabel other people such as me. This could be the reasoning for we Trump supporters mistrust of the Media.  I’d like either the Daily show or even Klepper to reasoned to this, and at least can explain his reasoning. Either that he is deliberately trying to misquote people, which would look bad on his part.

Mini-Mike was a billionaire (and a democratic candidate) so there’s another misinformed point. In terms of anti Semitism, if I type Catholic Church into a liberal, oPeN-mInDeD, democratic news source, I will only find a tonne of negativity as democrats have an underlying despise for Catholics and love to portray them as pedo-heads, but if you dare say anything about any other religion, then democrats will be first to point out that you’re hateful, bigoted or something.   Under Trump, we have signed a peace deal with the taliban and met up with Kim jong Un which is something unprecedented and historic. If anything, when Barack Obama was president. drones were sent to kill millions of innocents in the Middle East. So you’re points on “ww3” and “more wars” are just more nonsense that the ministry of truth “Twitter, CNN, etc” want you to believe.  Can you please give me an example of a war the trump has gotten us into. And what the hell your talking about when you say “lynchin”. When you say A “nuclear holocaust” I assume that you’re just being sarcastic.  When it come to hate crimes, search “Antifa” and watch 15mins of them before calling on republicans hate crimes.   I will say that I do believe in the 10 commandments , but you say that like an insult. What is wrong with the 10 commandments?????? Or is it the fact that they’re Christian, and if someone is pro-christian, then they are automatically a crusader and a neo Nazi.

He insulted their intelligence and they cheered him for doing it! Which makes me think he wasn't insulting their intelligence - he knew just how dumb they were.  No - I have noticed that Trump is a liar - using a euphemism (embellisher) does not make it better. Yes - for those with tiny brains, he is a great entertainer - that does not make him qualified to be President. And don't lie - Trump supporters regularly say they support him because he ""tells it like it is"" and they tend to believe every bit of bullshit he spews from his burger hole.  And I don't know - I have never seen a President lie constantly before now - not even Nixon or Bush Jr.   And you are an IDIOT! ""Transparent""? The ONLY thing ""transparent"" about him is that smart people can see right through his bullshit - but that is not intentional on his part. Where are the tax returns he promised to release? Why wouldn't he let anyone testify to Congress and fire the ones who defied that order? Why has he illegally refused all subpoenas, and held back every document he could from oversight? Why did he lie about his campaign's contacts with Russia? Why is he spending thousands, possibly millions of dollars to try to keep anyone from ever seeing his taxes or financial records? Why the secret meetings with Putin, and the one time an American note taker was in the room, he destroyed the notes?   He IS ""authentic"" though - an authentic piece of shit.

And Obama never had an ""apology tour"". He did, a few times, apologize for things we had done wrong in the past - as a real man and a real patriot would. Trump has never shown ANY sign of loving this country other than cheap symbolism - he loves money, and he loves himself - and maybe Ivanka - that's it.

@pdoylemi,"Some Dems are pro-gun, but most think there must be much more restrictions on them. Since you are young, you probably don't know that before the gun manufacturers lobby took it over, the NRA was one of the leading promoters of gun control - now they are just the marketing arm and lobbyists for the gun makers. I'm not a Democrat, but I am fairly liberal, and I like guns. I've been shooting since I was your age if not younger. But I would NEVER carry a gun. It is dangerous both to myself and others.  Also, the right wing's interpretation of the 2nd Amendment goes way to far, and yet, even THEY accept that people do not have an unlimited right to ""keep and bear arms"". If they did, they would support my right to buy (if I could find a supplier) a nuclear weapon - nukes are ""arms"". I should be allowed to own a fully operational M-1 tank if I want one, and RPGS, grenades, artillery, etc. Jeff Bezos could afford a private army and Air Force! So everyone acknowledges the need to limit that right.  The justification given for not having more gun control is twofold - personal protection and protection from tyranny. The first is fine IMO if we're talking about home defense or defense of a business. But when you take that into the streets, now you are bringing the danger to everyone - not just that you might go off your nut, or be a bad guy in general, but that you will not make wise decisions. I know about that first hand, as my mother in law nearly shot me. Over the objections of her husband, her daughter, and me, she had bought a Berretta 22 and gotten a concealed carry permit. She got a flat tire one night while her husband was away, and she called me for help. But she tended to be a very nervous, easily frightened person.  What she did not know was that I was not at home when she called - I was just heading home from my office. She excepted me to take at least 40 minutes to get there, but I was only about 10 minutes away. What I didn't know is that she was so scared being stuck in that parking ramp, that she hid in the back seat of her car with her gun.  When I arrived, I parked just opposite her car, and walked over surprised that I did not see her. But when I looked in the back left window it exploded - she had shot right through the window. I hit the ground and she fired two more shots before she heard me yelling at her. She was apologizing like crazy, and explaining that she had not expected me for another half hour, and with the garage light behind me, all she could see was a silhouette of a man looking into the car.    I took the damned gun from her, fixed the tire and told her to NEVER ask for that gun back.  As for the defense from tyranny, that is a joke. If the US military ever backed a tyrant, these pop guns would be almost useless. What WOULD be useful though is what it says in the 2nd Amendment - a well regulated militia - the justification for the amendment. And the Constitution explicitly describes what the founders meant by that. It was meant to be a force armed, trained, and disciplined by Congress, but under the command of the Governors and the officers they appoint. In other words - the National Guard. I do not believe for a moment that the founders ever intended for any goober with a few extra bucks to be able to own any weapons they wanted when they wrote that, they were talking about the rights of the people, as a group, to have their own armed forces rather than just having it all centralized under the control of the federal government.   As for the criminals - one thing that would be helpful - much tougher gun laws. First of all guns are FAR too easy for criminals to get here! I have a State Trooper friend who has told me they call I-75 ""The Iron Highway"" - because people without criminal records drive south to places like Georgia with lax gun laws, buy a bunch of guns and then sell them to criminals in Detroit and other areas. And open carry laws like we have are a problem too. There was a case a few years ago where a suspicious cop stopped a man carrying openly. He ran the serial number of the gun and the person's ID, and found he had a felony record and the gun was not registered to him. But the case was thrown out because it was deemed an illegal search since the guy was not breaking any laws that the cop could see - he had no probable cause to stop a citizen and check his gun because carrying a gun is legal.  We also need to make the penalties for carrying severe. Hard core criminals don't worry about a short stint in County Jail for a gun charge. I know this part first hand also. I was going into a police station because I needed to be bonded for a job as a loan officer - which meant I had to be fingerprinted. Turned out, there was someone with my same name who was wanted. And I fit the description - no surprise, am am about as average as it gets. So they stuck me in a holding cell with about 20 other guys while they checked to see if I was the right guy. The other people there were talking about jails and prisons around the state the way normal people talk about hotels or restaurants! One guy said something like, ""It's no big deal - it's only a three month bit, and it's in Van Buren County - that's one of the best places I ever been locked up."" And another replied, ""Van Buren ain't bad, but I'll take Ionia any day. The beds ain't as good, but the food's a lot better."" and so on. To me, a few hours in a cell waiting to get bailed out was nasty and humiliating. To those guys it was NOTHING. Some hardened criminal is not going to sweat a few weeks or maybe a year in jail on a gun charge. But how about 25 years in the State Prison? That will either make them think twice, or get them off the street for a LONG time if they get caught.   Look, you're a young guy - I am a military vet. The odds of ordinary people being able to defend themselves in public (or anyone else) are tiny - almost all documented reports of such things are of people defending their home or business. And many of those reports are pretty sketchy. You are probably as likely to kill innocent people. What is needed is a concerted NATIONAL effort to get guns OFF the streets. It would also help to end the drug war and other vice ""crimes"" that provide the money for criminals to get these guns. Bottom line - nations with strict gun control have far fewer homicides and suicides than we do. You can make all the arguments you like, but if your goal is to be safe, it is clear that guns are NOT the answer.",5년 전,1,

@pdoylemi," @greengay4924   Thank you for being open minded. And it sounds as if your family like mine is responsible with their guns. I started shooting somewhere around 13 or 14 with a 22 caliber target rifle. After about a year, my step father let me start shooting the 4-10 shotgun. Skeet mostly at first, but they we adopted a Springer Spaniel, and it didn't take long to see that she was a well trained bird dog. So, while I am not an avid hunter, I started hunting some pheasant on duck on our property with her, because she used to get so frustrated with me! We'd be out walking in the tall grass near the woods or out near the pond, and she would often flush a pheasant or duck, then she would turn and look at me, then look at the bird flying away, and then she would bark at me sometimes as if to say, ""Hey! Idiot! I did my part - now it's your turn!"" She was happy as could be when I took the shotgun, and when I managed to bag a bird, she was thrilled to go retrieve it and bring it to me as proud as could be.   I've got nothing against hunting or hunters - especially deer hunters - the herd needs to be culled by someone, but I have a soft spot for animals and just never enjoyed killing them. Eating them wasn't bad though.",5년 전,1,

Whether you agree with certain proposals or not, you seem willing to understand that those proposing it are not bad people, just people with different opinions. With people like you, I have hope that we can get back to being the kind of place where people can compromise, and work out their differences amicably, and I thank you for that hope.",5년 전,1,

The economy booming had little to do with him, and more to do with stuff Obama did at the end of his presidency to my understanding.   The only things Trump has done is build a tiny wall with money he took from other necessary places (one of which I believe was the CDC), he dismantled most systems Obama put up when he was in office, he banned an entire race of people over racism, he made a change in the tax that did something I don't fully understand, and he made it so that'll environmental protection laws got easier to break.",5년 전,0,

@RightfootWestHam,"""round 2"" The person being interviewd is saying that media is not covering the black supporters of donald trump 1:32 I see at least 4 black people in that shot alone... Even though Jordan Klepper is asking where these black people are? 1:45 ther eis a black person in the middle of the shot... and its also not really a fair question. Its common knowledge that any black person supporting donald trump will be hated upon and bullied , called ""uncle tom"" etc. To be a black person and a donald trump supporter take balls... and black people just as much as white people are generally cowards <- A trait that made sure we are still alive. You dont see anyone attend KKK rallies without their hood on and then walk in a ""black lives matter"" rally the next day for a reason <- This reason is that they can and will be targeted by intolerant people. So that is just journalistic manipulation when it is at its worst, its also rather ignorant to ask ""where are these black people "" when I did see at least 5 of them in less then 15 seconds  and 4 in 1 shot alone.",5년 전,0,

It just shows that you don’t personally know any trump supporters. Maybe you’re just used to not having people oppose and criticize your stupid comments in the little insulated bubble you live in. I have no guilt about anything you just said haha. I’m happy with what I do. I probably do more for immigrants and minorities in my profession and life than you. And I know that’s a fact. I can see pieces of shit on both sides of the isle. The scumbags who paint with a broad brush all of a majority of trump supporters because they are sore from getting their asses kicked in in 2016. People like you think to themselves “there has to be a reason Hillary didn’t win”. Then come the buzzwords you’re side is known for attributing to masses of people you’ve never met. Racism, homophobia, xenophobia, transphobia. Give it a rest and maybe get to know people before passing judgment. Until then, maybe you’re wrong and misguided. Just because racists and xenophobes exist don’t mean you get to slander millions upon millions of people that you’ve never met and know jackshit about. By the way, those numbers of minority votes may not have put him in the White House, but they sure will be the deciding factor in 2020 in some states. So keep thinking minorities need your help or the smug white liberals’ help. Guess what, minorities don’t want your help.

I agree that it is depressing, dysfunctional, dystopian and a lot of other ""d"" words (the biggest ""d"" is of course the one this rally is for), but I ALSO believe that people would do well in learning to appreciate gallows humour.  Secondly I kind of have a pet peeve against humour that is about laughing AT people. If you want to feel superior, try to lift yourself up instead of pushing other people down. We are all victims to circumstances and biases, and when people react in a way to try to justify their own existence and fears they usually grow extremely blind and cling on to ideas they shouldn't really be ""married"" to, but.. I also think that these people do affect society in a detrimental way and their intentional blindness is something that does justify actually being critical over them and their behaviour, and considering that the entire world is right now an innocent victim in a journey that they started by placing an incompetent, selfish, narcissistic, deceitful person as the president of one of the most influential nations in the world DOES mean that the rest of us do absolutely have a valid excuse to use humour as a coping mechanism.

We are not a two party state we have many parties representing a broad spectrum of people.  Our current government is made up of two main parties and several independents.  Our opposition parties are vocal and forthright.  We have one primary broadcaster who are very well established and trusted for there honesty.  We have a broadcast regulator who oversees all broadcasters and news papers.  All programs MUST be balanced and equal to both sides.  Our society is not driven by greed or money; we are a mixed society of lower; mid and high classes.  We have a fantastic educational system open to all and in the most free.  We have a health and welfare system second to none.  The people pay for education and welfare through taxes which are proportional.  We’re free, liberal, and open and in a general sense no inner hatred of colour, ethnicity or religion.  We are a population of some 5 million.  Thank god were thousands of miles from America (right now) and as far west in Europe you can get.  We have a TRUMP golf resort.  The only difference is that brat does not get his own way.

Yes, I can give you that these are some REALLY uneducated people, just based off of how they talk, not the side of the aisle they sit on. But it is true in America that the Democratic Party is more educated. That’s a fact. And then you’re gonna say “well that doesn’t mean anything unless they brainwash you” and I don’t feel our education system is “brain washed “ at all. We have a very good, intact, educational system.

Since the majority of female leaders were more likely to be married (norms of that era), they also felt that they had to wage more more wars to prove their leadership. But if we're talking about today's societal norms, it would be less likely for women to engage in wars because they would not need to ""prove"" themselves. There are various leaders around the world today who are women, but that does not mean that they are at war with other nations. Still, the US has to catch up with its leaders.

And I do understand cherry picking and heavy editing.  I've WATCHED ""FAKE Fox News."" I've also seen Trump's tweets. President Trump is a bully, which is something we discourage in our schools and to our children . These people are obviously clueless to the laws of the land and how politics plays  directly in their lives. They are simply there to support Trump no matter what he does, even if its terrible, like molesting women  & then bragging about molesting women. Or accusing our doctors, nurses & all medical personal, our hero's risking their lives, on the front line of stealing masks and gloves & selling them on the black market during this epidemic because he is too busy cyberbullying and pointing blame then to have time to bother with saving American lives!",5년 전,2,
@RightfootWestHam," @annechallenger8190  Good for you! You complain that Trump is lying to you? okey lets make a game out of it... for every lie you can dig up on trump during his time in the office, I give you 2 lies my prime minster has told during his time in the office. hopefully you get some perspective about the world. <- This is a challenge and I really hope you got a huge list to make it even close to competetive.   You talking about Trump being a dictator and not a leader... In my country if an elderly person is infected with corona they get an asprin and an open window, no co2-inhaler or anything like that. Its a special law where we allow elderly to die so they cant take up resources from people that might need it more... Working your whole life and paying taxes , and this is what you get in my country.   AS a person who have been the victim of bullying for well over 30 years and have been fighting bullies and bullying for about 20 years, enlight me what Trump is doing that you think is bullying, and what do you think bullying is? I know because I'm being targeted with it all the time to the point where I make on average 1 police report every year about it.   You say you discourage it in your schools, good so do we... but guess what it doesnt help or get rid of the bulling at all.   It looks like you have been misinformed about the ""grab her by the pussy"" comment that Trump made <- please read up on this before you going to use it as some kind of argument towards trump. I have actually studied this and is well informed, hence why I call you out on it because its rather obvious you are misinformed here.   Why would Trump make up that someone is stealing stuff? That makes 0 sense unless he suffers from some kind of strange alzheimer. <- And if that is the case I doubt he can be president.   Fact: Here in Sweden a person belonging to a right-wing party (somewhat extreme) bought a lot of masks and then sold them to hospitals and news stations for lots of money.    Also, thank you for providing context and arguments in another discussion I have with another person. you are in fact helping me ""win"" other arguments with other people just by being yourself... So go ahead anne Challenger and start that list.. the sooner I get it the sooner I can double that list with ease and hopefully as previously stated: You understand that ""trump is not that bad, he is in fact a great leader compared to the leaders who are considered the best leaders in the world"" <-",5년 전,1,

@A_name_is_a_name,"RomulessI well I was very right when I said American universities hold back these studies so it may be hard to find in your country. I’ll contact my professor and see if she can send me links. I argued in that format because I was indeed high and lazy. You have no way to disprove that so stop with the prejudice now if you don’t want to look any more stupid than you already do. “It’s as simple as that.” Lmaooo. Absolutes and simplicity is a figment of your imagination indoctrinated into your psychology. Thought policing and your own instincts wanting to find “the right way.” Gtfo. Ive taken enough LSD and other forms of psychedelics to have about 10 ego deaths now. You should EXPERIENCE that before even speaking on ego without coming off as ignorant. But you’ve proven to be talking out of your ass based on prejudice while stating that I’m doing that so would you mind being a hypocrite to somebody else. Like you have every freedom to keep going and that’s fine with me but seriously for your own sake and time it’s best not to waste it being paradoxical like the majority of souls.   Yes women and men both can lead. That’s been proven time and time again throughout history. All the way back to the stepp-tribes of Arabia when fighting the armies of either Assyrians or the Persians. Not sure which but within the era there were female leaders of tribes who could outsmart kings. I stated in my first comment that they’re basically the same in that regard. HOWEVER, the stages of menopause, motherhood, and menestral cycles have also proven in history to be the bane of female leaders. In our forms of, “society,” the majority of leaders being men and their issues have evolved an outlets for their forms of hormonal imbalances. Women have not had the time to do so. Therefore, in both western and eastern forms of leadership culture it is modeled around male hormonal expression, not female. That is why women are considered more spiteful to their followers. They have an entirely different set up of hormonal expression which effects anyone individually. (So I’m not saying women are a problem). It just is what tf it is. If you can’t handle reality and the truth within context then you’ll never fix the fucking issue. I love how you and many others assume right away that I’m some sexist guy just talking shit. Would you feel good about someone calling you what you’ve called me, when you actually give a shit about the problem and have spent up to 3 years researching the topic for the betterment of humanity. While the people who profess that they are truly virtuous and want to fix the problem silence you out of ignorance. Would you like to be in that position? I’m going out on a limb here and forgive me if I’m wrong. But no, I don’t think you’d be too fond of that situation. Put yourself in someone else’s shoes for a minute. Not every single guy or person is speaking out of individual emotional appeal. Especially not me. I want what’s best for humanity as a species but I want to objectively do it with logical reasoning so there is less error.   Onto the statements I made earlier though. Yes I was defensive of my position and came off more rude than I should have. Which gives reason for you to act out of prejudice. However, my points are no invalid just because it didn’t get ran through a pay to play institution in corrupt ass America. Or because my evidence doesn’t fit the popular narrative. Countless times in history many truths didn’t fit the popular narrative and were proven right. Such as homosexuality. It’s been part of our species and even other animals for as long as we can look back in time. Yet, the majority of people (specifically the Western Europe cultures) believed it was morally wrong for almost 1,000 years. That alone shows how the vail of ignorance can misguide. You’d feel doing the same damn thing. You see a red flag to your moral stance with me saying that women are not better leaders because of their hormones and their effects. You don’t take into perspective that it could be due to the agreed upon idea of what leadership is. You think that I believe men are inherently better. I do not and if my vagueness lead to you perceiving it like that then I’m sorry. Still doesn’t give you reason to morally grandstand and attack me. That is what makes you the hypocrite, based on your own position you made. I’ll see what I can find but look into it yourself. You won’t change your mind or be more open to concepts if you yourself do not possess the motivation to even do so. Stop being so uptight basically.",5년 전,0,
@A_name_is_a_name,"Mandy S from a psychological standpoint trump is spiteful towards though that are spiteful of him. An eye for an eye moral absolute. I disagree with that position, however tend to also act in the same manner at times out of my motivation for absolute fairness. From what he shows he’s playing defense against a slanderous corrupt institution. He use to believe that the democrats were right but saw something with the elites that he disagreed with. Seems like an old style businessman who wants his country to thrive. However, the only spitefulness I see is in his attempt to defend himself from personal attacks from people who don’t even know him. When he came in to the race in 2016 he was unprofessional which was an emotional niche not filled in our society. Leading to him being the underdog and gaining support through that position. He was indeed the underdog with even the president at the time making harsh comments about how he would never become president. Being bullied and slandered as an individual would lead any individual to do the same. At least he doesn’t focus all his attention on that and was able to keep North Korea at bay while returning industry to America. That’s his primary position. He and others who understand how banking works know that the leaders of the Democratic Party are using immigration as a form of debt collection to keep the banks up and running without confronting the debt crisis. The more people that come to the nation, the more debt they can possess over every individual person who comes. Legal or not. Therefore, they are using and misguiding people for profit. Trump doesn’t seem to like that, not out of morality, but out of logic. That will destroy our system and economy. Same as moving industry out of a nation based on industrial capitalism. That’s where the whole “make America great again,” position derived from. The democratic media misguided the people by professing that he was just a bigoted racist. Sorry to tell you this but when you’re a billionaire, to literally function as a businessman you can’t really be racist. Otherwise global investment in business would be subversive. This belief doesn’t line up with his actions. Therefore, the belief is false. Always watch a persons actions, not what they say or others says about them. Also, the democrats use the black community and fund the group polarization for profit. They keep racism alive and well to profit off the duality of the situation. Through getting the black people to believe that they are their saviors while republicans, nowadays, just want everyone to work fairly and prosper the community. Yes republicans hold dogmatic views, they aren’t perfect. But at least they don’t use social issues for profit. Not saying trump and the republicans are entirely right in their beliefs either. They have issues and corruption as well. I believe neither are good at leading and a man or woman with an objective stance would be better than any of either party. All a bunch of selfish lobbyists when looked at from a philosophical objective standpoint.   Onto the gender issue. I state women are not better leaders due to their hormonal expression. However, I was very vague and apologize for that. I meant their hormonal expression doesn’t fit properly into the agreed upon idea of what leadership is in society. From an objective perspective overview of history you can see that the majority of leaders were male. Yes female leaders exist and so do extremely successful ones at that. However, they are seen as lesser because the construct of leadership is molded around male hormonal expression. This is why females don’t fit the role of leadership. That doesn’t mean they have no ability to lead. I’m just saying that this needs to be looked into because i believe (and so do other psychology research groups) it is likely to be the cause for error. Women would be better leaders if the position of leadership wasn’t absolute and women were given the chance to lead as they see fit rather than having to follow in the footsteps and under the system that benefits male ideas effected by their hormonal expression. The ignorance of this as made the role of leadership dogmatic and only progressive if under the supervision of male constituents. Not female. This gives the perception that female leaders show characteristics of increased spitefulness from the perspective of the male constructed leadership role. As well as, other characteristics appearing that cause error in this specific construct. The construct of leadership needs to be reinvented to include female expression and their psychological differentiations.   I also have to disagree with you that some people are just inherently spiteful assholes (excluding psychopaths). If someone is doing that the majority of the time it’s because they perceive something false and are creating error in communication. Also, their moral principles do not align with the ones they are attacking, causing a perception that considers them spiteful. Too many individual experiences being generalized into a categorization without contextual representation. See what I mean?",5년 전,0,

@A_name_is_a_name,"RomulessI ok i see my major mistake was in stating the pack leader position. May have given a perspective that I meant it is right because it is instinctive. That’s not my argument. It’s part of the hypothesis but only in the sense of what is to be considered the construction of the leadership role (not what is to be considered logically or objectively right). When only strong males during times of anarchy and hunter gather tribes could do, thanks to natural selection and survival of the fittest. This understanding allows one to consider that we have indeed surpassed the need for the strong male leader ship role due to modern communication. Old communication was simple, “I kill you if you attack,” “we must attack to survive and prosper.” This “old style” was good for the time and the male leader but is now believed to be dogmatic in our proposal. I said it vaguely and under the wrong context because I was high af and not in the mood to fully explain my position. Told you I was just being lazy.   The only reason I’m actually stating it now is because when I started my source gathering I found that my institutions library has taken it down from their library website due to it being “socially irresponsible and giving not giving doxable name university a disrespectful representation of the arts&science departments.” That’s why I’m now contacting the leading professor, who is ironically a lesbian woman making a valid claim towards sexual representation in societal roles. Funny how hypocritical society and “credible,” institutions can be. You have, metaphorical, gracefully flocked like a sheep to this same counterproductive position btw. Not out of spite but out of ignorance. Which I have helped feed because I was high. So we were both wrong before and it’s mainly my fault for not properly stating my argument.

@A_name_is_a_name,"RomulessI Not trying to spam you, just want to fully represent my thought process and claim.   Look into the philosophical positions on higher-order evidence within the construct of platforming/non platforming. It dables in the idea that first-order evidence vulnerability to corruption is very real and easy to do. This is by socially accepted “credible” sources platforming individuals and/or ideas/positions not factually correct. So the first-order evidence being the idea platformed. the higher-order evidence is that of which constitutes the idea as credible. Higher-order evidence = credible source. The credible source using its position to control the platform for facts and absolutes can easily lead to corruption. All they have to do is platform an individual with first order evidence that is false. Now the people taking in this information are misinformed but can’t prove that because the higher-order evidence(credible sources), that they depend on to determine fact from fiction, is no longer credible but can’t be proven to be. This leads to a paradox by definition and is something that should be taken into consideration when approaching the idea of what is to be considered credible or not. I’ve been working on proposing a thesis called the bias paradox. which constitutes this as the determiner for the actuality of the paradox. Basically, without this determiner the thesis would be false.   The bias paradox isn’t incorporated into my former argument however the higher order evidence and platforming issue is and (once again for good measure) I’m stating it now so that you have scholarly insight and can make a proper claim with a better objective understanding of my position.",5년 전,0,

Looking at the comment section is both frightening and astonishing how effective media-based hate propaganda is 80 years after the Nazis similarly described Jews as racist and stupid for their endogamic and religiously backwards lifestyle. This is the same thing that happened in Bosnia too. You can go to any place in the world and make disgusting videos about any people. If you support this then it is actually you who are disgusting.

@RightfootWestHam," @annechallenger8190  Holy crap Anne, do you even know what cherry picking is? I try to explain what is going on here. This ""reporter"" or whatever he is supposed to be probably conducted 1.000 interviews that day, he found 1 person stating the most stupid shit... So out of 16 hours of recordings, 20 seconds of an uneducated person makes it to air becuase it fits the narrative that trump supporters are dumb, the other 15 hours, 59 min and 40 seconds or resonable trump supporters are cut out or its edited to the point where its no longer an intereview, its basically an editor picking what words he wants the person getting interviewed to say... This is a manipulation.   If anything your message here and you not being able to understand these fundamental things really shows me that you are what you accuse general trump supporters to be: ""obviously unschooled, ignorant, with extreme low IQs.  Even seem to be lacking in common sense and human decency"" <-   Some people have been telling me that ""this is a comedy and should only be viewed as such"" , and I inform them about people like you who see this and actually think that this is representative <- That's when they get quiet because Im correct about how people interpet these types of videos... It was made very easy since its bascially tells the story in the comment section so I didnt really have to prove anything, its already proven.   And you are incorrect and your logic is extremly flawed. Take the femenist movement or the Black lives matter movement as examples of how flawed your logic is. You have totalitarian ideology that is anti-democratic and in fact fascist movements that gets more followed and even ""educated"" followers... Heck it spread to my country and they are trying to apply police brutality towards black people in the states, but here! On the other side of the planet!!! So  no you are dead wrong there... Im even going to include my own experience here.   I support at team that is basically the ""Lowest class"" you can find, its basically homeless people that support that team <-  This doesnt mean I like them more nor less. I just means that homeless people like what I like , just like we both can enjoy a glass of Soda, like the same music , paintings or ideology... This doesnt mean we share opinions nor am I responsible for anything anyone does that is part of a group Im also part of. <- And this is really important for you to understand.   I would ask of you what you think racism is, most of the times I dont get an answer... but when I do, holy crap! Last murrican to answer that question stated that sexuality was part of racism, a femenist btw. When asking for source, she gave me the title of a book... written 2008, as if racism didnt exist before 2008. Wanna know something? Im from the country that had the first racist institute where we messured peoples sculls and conducted experiements and castrated people with different opinions, races or the mentally ill... WE are taught about this in school since early age. Im very well versed in what is going on here and the issues with these movements, but it doesnt mean I hold you responsible for any of them, heck I wont even hate upon you if you are a femenist.. but when you start saying ignorant things like : "" there was still a lot of  different Trump Worshippers saying stupid things and proving to all who watched this, that they are obviously unschooled, ignorant, with extreme low IQs.  Even seem to be lacking in common sense and human decency  with little to no morals at all."" <- I will react and try to give you at least 1 chance to understand how stupid your opinion is here.",5년 전,0,

The worst of the worst are the ones who act “nice” and try to get close to us. We know what you’re doing. Being nosy and trying to fish for as much info on us as possible. Pretending to be our “friend” so we’ll let our guard down and let you into our secrets and our secret and intimate gatherings. It always backfires when one of us hangs out with your people. You always end up using anything you know about us as a weapon against us. That’s why the truly intelligent people of color avoid white people like the plague. Even at work where we are forced to be in close proximity. We keep it short, to the point, and always on the topic of whatever the job entails.   Never let a white person in on any of your personal stuff. Never allow them in or they’ll start to get comfortable and start mouthing off and saying the n word and talking reckless racist shit. You always wanna keep them out of our circle. Let them stay over at their side and we’ll do the same. Integration is just a way to gain access to us and learn our secrets in order to take us down and destroy us from within. How many parts of our cultures were destroyed through this tactic that they use? Countless! The come in acting nice and pretending to be friendly and they just wait for the right moment to strike. All the while planning our demise. The so called “liberal” or “open minded” white person is worse than the Trump supporting idiot. Because at least I can see the threat  coming from the idiot Trump supporters who advertise and publicize their intentions.   But a white person who smiles and pretends while working behind the scenes to destroy us is way worse. You wanna look out for the threat that’s not obvious. Just like in combat sports. It’s the punch or kick that you don’t see coming that K.O.’s you. Not the telegraphed punches or kicks. That’s how I see liberal whites. They are the actual threat that is detrimental to us.

Hugo Chavez inaugurated socialist policies to the once economically flourishing Venezuela. These socialist and collectivist policies, in turn, devastated the country's economy. The government nationalized the food industry, distributing and rationing food, an obvious indicator of collectivist and socialist policies at play. This confirms that Hugo Chavez is a socialist.

Testing, contact tracing, using the DPA to manufacture PPE, early social distancing, yes-masks, and having had the pandemic response team still in tact - none of this was done early enough or at a high enough rate.

@yancy808," @trentolsen8232  Yep,  just an idiot here I will take that from a person with special needs like government dependency, No need to argue any further were all Americans here and I respect your opinion and choice. Stay true and strong to your cause because at that level of politics you and I are nothing but cannon fodder. I bet no matter who the President is we are not invited to the white house. So keep thinking the American people mean something to political officials. All I want is no government intrusion, lower taxes and no advise from some one in Washington to tell me  I have to say, do and act a certain way My Mother and Father taught me that, not some Liberal institution.",5년 전,0,
