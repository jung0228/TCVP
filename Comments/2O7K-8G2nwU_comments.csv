Yohan Bake was leading till 75% of the race because Blake had lot faster feet speed, but Bolt beat Blake in last quarter as Bolt had far longer steps as he is extremely tall with long  legs. So even though Blake was superior in leg speed, but longer reach of Bolt or tall flexible leg speed gave the ultimate edge to Bolt. I think as long as there is another tall, equally flexible with long legs with high reach are coming, nobody will be able to break Bolt's world record in 100M,200M world record. So many people would say Bolt is the greatest, but I would say he was born with privilege of such tall flexible body and longer legs which gave him edge over opponents like Blake.",3년 전,0,

The reason is there are more elite sprinters under 6'0 is because the world average height is under 6'0. Pretty simple.

Perhaps google Boca and River Plate hooligans and their rivalry as a starting point, then may be you can move onto the Russian football hooligans who were prominent and destructive in the 2012 Euro championship in France.

@sir_sack," @Suyaopnxt  I’m going to be honest here. The fact that you are trying to put down 100m runners and say they aren’t real runners/athletes because they don’t run as long as you supposedly do just goes to show your ignorance. Every runner respects those who run any distance. I guarantee you Kipchoge respects Bolt and Bolt respects Kipchoge. They understand the hard work that went into getting to where they are. The amount of force world class sprinter like Bolt put into a single 100m race is more than you’ve put into thinking about an intelligent response to any comment under this thread. Then there’s your 10km time which you claim to be 8 minutes. This is just idiotic if you’re actually trying to pass this off as your time. The world record is 26:11 which would make you and your gym buddies 3 times faster than the world record. If you actually run the 10km, what is your actual time? And you say you’ve won more races in your life than anyone in this comment section, well have you ever thought about the fact that many people here are runners and have run and won many races. I personally started running when I was 5 and won over 100 medals before I got injured when I was 12. So as I said before, what are your times? How many medals have you won? You talk and talk but have yet to give any actual numbers or times that aren’t complete B.S. to show your skill level. So please, don’t disrespect runners who compete in different distances. I’m personally an 800m runner and I respect every athlete from sprinters, marathoners, throws, and jumpers, besides you obviously. I have zero respect for you or what you stand for. So if you wanna troll, then go ahead do it elsewhere, just don’t put athletes who have trained all their lives down because you can’t compete with them. Goodbye.",4년 전,11,

And Lewis had to come from 2 metres behind to win..In 1991 that was an UNHEARD OF RESULT. Still to this day. Two men have never broken the world record in the same 100m final.

For this reason, it's harder to become an elite sprinter than a long distance runner; the best time I ever got in school was 11.4s.

@foralgorithm656,​​ @gauravnegi4312  I agree. Do you think humans are not practising academics as much as they should be doing for what they are capable of??. I think so as education comes with cost and so as one to live need money so some don't go in that path of greatness in academics also commercialzing education made humans see education as source for survival as to get job rather than pursuing academic endeavours. But there is one more argument for your take that I also agree is that humans want to achieve greatness in all aspects not just in academics.we are curious to know fastest strongest highest as a human we can be. even that is also academics in that way .curiosity and knowledge to discover human capabilities.,8개월 전(수정됨),1,

Life is a journey, everybody has their own, we all go through lows and highs. The highs make the life worth living. One could argue these athletes here experience greater highs on their journey than academics. Importance of or what we are as humans designed to do is again just your opinion. I don’t see anybody wasting their energy if they do whatever they love doing as long as it doesn’t harm others. Also you cannot compare academics centuries ago to athletes centuries ago, as sports was not on any level as we see it today. And if you ask an ordinary person famous academics, you get no names. This is your world! You probably know few names and read about them, but an ordinary person would say it’s a wasted energy!",7일 전,0,

I have experience in the field and as you probably know cycling doesnt exactly have a clean history. And I know how deceiving performances can be. Sporting federations cannot be trusted as they have shown in the past. The IAAF etc. Imagine the loss of revenue if it came out that their top athletes doped. Btw I dont want to target athletes.

@ak2pacalypse,It's the camera angle that makes it seem like he's behind. Look at the different camera angles at 12:33. You can see that even from the beginning he was never trailing. He is actually ahead very shortly into the race. It is somewhat of a myth that bolt has bad starts. His starts are very comparable to the other top sprinters. For his world record time of 9.58 he had an amazing start and was leading the field by 10 meters. Go watch the 2009 100 m finals and go to the part where they show the bird's eye view.,5년 전,118,

Bolt miss stepped once in his transition in 2012 so that might make it look slower. Well technically bolt first 30m are faster in 2012 because his reaction time was slower.

He has done it in almost every race he has ever ran except in Jamaica at pretrials when Blake won. Even the world record he set at 9.59 he pulled up before the finish.

@irvinrodriguez6341,He was actually pretty slow check olympics in 2004,6년 전,1,
@omarholder9036, @irvinrodriguez6341  so your logic for him being slow is a performance at the Olympics (which by very definition puts you in the top 1% of people on the planet) in 2004 when he was injured and only ran for the experience. He hadn't even converted to the 100m yet so none of the muscles for sprinting. He was 17 and still a 200-400 specialist at that point,6년 전,28,

@johnstephanos1128," @Blissed12  Yes, it is very hard, but there are 7 billion people on this planet and out of those 7 billion there are men that are extremely fast and there is definitely a probability that at least one out of those 7 billion can run faster than 9.58. Tell me that makes some type of sense right? They prolly dont have the chance because of different circumstances or they choose not to because they are interested on some other profession. Usain has the fastest time on record, what about the times others around the world ran off record that we don't know about. They probably run just for fun playing soccer or run to the store or just race each other and they dont even know their talent. It's a huge world we live in with a lot of talent that's unheard of.",5년 전(수정됨),1,
@Blissed12, @johnstephanos1128  there's 7 billion people on the earth there's definitely a possibility that someone out there has a superpower like telepathy or Psychokinesis. Tell me that makes some type of sense right?. They prolly can't show it cause they're scared of how people will react to them or maybe it's because there in someone poor secluded village in Africa so they can't showcase there powers to everyone,5년 전,2,

@patrickdelgado2213,Yohan Blake is too relaxed before the race he does not appear truly immersed in the task before him maybe he displays that demeanour because Bolt is in the race what's the rush after all Bolt will see us through even if I don't make it maybe he's thinking.At the same time Bolt is a bigger star so what's the big rush Bolt always deliver so I can afford to be a bit complacent and also why should I deny my fellow Jamaican a third gold medal in such a race.You can see he is just standing there with his two hands hanging limply by his side before the race.,9년 전,0,

@allfiner,"The title of the world's fastest man goes to the person who goes from zero to 100m in the shortest amount of time. No other distance counts. The World Indoor Championships has a 60m sprint. Bolt has never run that and the people who win it are not considered the fastest. Frankly, the 60m champions usually are people who have explosive starts and accelerate quickly. Rarely do they translate into 100m champions where sustaining maximum speed becomes essential. Maurice Green and Asafa were among the few who could translate their 60m prowess into 100m wins. Trayvon Bromell won this year's 60m championship, and came second in the trials, so he'll be interesting to watch in the upcoming years. There will always be people faster than Bolt at 20, 30, even 60 since a large mass means slower acceleration. But if we go by the rules of the sport, it's who gets to 100m first that counts.",9년 전,14,

@jonathanlewis13jl,Bolt broke his own World record at the World Championships in 2009!  9.58 The Olympic record before this was 9.69,9년 전,3,
@allfiner,"Kurt, Bolt holds the holds all the 100m records. His first world record was set in NY, 2008. That was 9.72. He then beat that time in the Beijing Olympics with a 9.69. Because it was the fastest recorded 100m it became the new world record. But because it was the fastest time ever run at the Olympics, it became the Olympic record as well.   Then in 2009 at the Berlin Championships, he ran 9.58 which became the new world record. However, in the London Olympics, he ran 9.63. 9.63 was not the fastest time ever run, so it was not a new world record. But because it was the fastest time ever run at an Olympic Games, it became the new Olympic record.   So in short, the current WORLD record of 9.58 was set by Bolt in August 2009 in Berlin, Germany. The current OLYMPIC record of 9.63 was also set by Bolt in August 2012 in London.  When you see the guys run the 100m in the Olympics, (heats and finals), in the top left corner of your screen you will see WR: 9.58 and OR: 9.63. That's for world record and Olympic record and Bolt owns them both.",9년 전,2,

I feel as if we should use him as the WHAT NOT TO DO when getting other athletes ready for the Olympic stage. Has got to be one of the stupidest things I've seen a top sprinter do at an Olympics. What was he thinking? It's not as if a 9.88 was going to scare Bolt or Blake or even Gatlin. He used up all that energy in the first round for absolutely no reason.,9년 전,79,

The test of speed in a vehicle is which car can get from 0-60 in the shortest amount of time. Who does it effortlessly or which car averages better doesn't matter. 0-60 the fastest. That's it. There is no ambiguity.   When it comes to humans, the question is, who can go from 0-100 in the shortest time possible. As long as the tailwind is 2.0 m/s or less and no one is doping, there is no other determining factor of who is fastest. It doesn't matter who gets the best reaction time. It doesn't matter who leaves the blocks and gets into the drive phase better. It doesn't matter who executes the best technique. All that matters is who goes from 0-100 in less time than ANYONE ELSE! That person is Usain Bolt. Until someone comes along who can go from 0-100 in less than 9.58, he is fastest. No ambiguity.

That is like say the believer does not have the capacity to evalulate things. Simply put, it is saying that the religious believer should not trust or rely on his/her own ability.....which is NONSENSE!

But he is not a Christian (although it seem to suggest he is religious). Asafa Powell, on the other hand, is a Christian. But, I was not suggesting that Powell has NO confidence in himself, whatsoever, and that this a result of his religion. I do believe that Powell has some degree of confidence in himself. What I suggested (in my original comment) is that since religious belief doesn't help a person excel or perform better at anything, Powell might as well rely on his own abilities, completely.   ",9년 전,0,
@muhammadnasif1496,"tmat04 why would a person who is not christian even did the cross sign?, you're being ridiculous now. you're the type who likes to assume things. I think you are really against religion to be that deluded. and you seems to generalize religion from what you understand about christian. I am a muslim. The concept in Islam is that you pray to God so that you can deliver the best, and you pray to God to give the best outcome for you, while you can be confidence in your ability at the same time. the thing is, you can plan and work out, but in the end, you can only just predict your future, you wouldn't know the exact thing that will happen no matter how prepared you are. If you're a sprinter, doesn't matter how well prepared you are, things my still go wrong. You can still get injure in middle of the race, you can still false started, no matter how well you have prepared. That is why you pray to God. Because we are incapable of controlling everything, we are bound to make mistake, no matter how confident and well prepared. So, saying that by believing in God makes you less confident is totally wrong. You can be confident in your ability through lots of effort and preparation, then you pray to God so that the unfavorable events that are beyond your control would not happened when it mattered. Being religious did help me to improve in my life, I believe that whatever happens, God had decided the best for me. So when I fail, I would know that there are things that I may have overlooked, and I would reflect on my own actions",9년 전,0,

@ThunderJuice,"+Ryder Washington Am I being too subtle or something? They weren't in Beijing because 1. they're teenagers (or in KBC's case, injured before the champs) 2. there are Jamaicans currently faster than them.  De Grasse is good, but he's a given for his national team being the big sub-10/sub-20 fish in the small Canadian pond.  I agree that Bromell vs De Grasse will be the premier sprint rivalry for the next decade, but the same way you count out O'Hara I can count out Friday, who did nothing of note in 2015.  But I won't, because I recognise that different athletes transition from junior to senior at different rates and with different successes.  Yohan Blake never won a World Junior title, which he should have in '08.  Now, he's a 9.69/19.26 man.  Harry Aikines-Aryteety won World Youth AND World Junior titles, beating Blake both times.  What has he done as a senior?",9년 전,2,

Gay's 4th place is 9.8! That would have been a world record in 1998. And at 7th place is Thompson's 9.98! That, very briefly for one day, would have been a world record in October 1968. If Asafa Powell had finished, it is certain that all ten finalists would have been sub-10 seconds. We may never see a men's 100 final like this again.",9년 전,7,

@robertyang4365,"It doesn't make sense that a prehistoric man can run as quickly as Usain Bolt can on a short distance straightaway.   They may have had to run to catch food, but their bodies were not nearly as well fed as the prime athletes of today.   Unlike predators such as cheetahs, humans worked in teams, like a wolf pack, using strategy to surround their prey. They weren't built specifically for short distance running, since, due to a nomadic lifestyle, their bodies were adept to long distance marathon type running/jogging. They also had to stalk their prey for long distances sometimes, so again, their bodies were adept at long distance running. They would be well rounded runners, decent sprinters, decent long distance runners, likely at the level of a high school varsity athlete on both respects.   At the time, it made sense for animals to work to their evolutionary strengths. Humans were not built to sprint, being bipedal and all. A healthy adult house cat at full sprint could easily match or surpass Usain Bolt. Thus, they likely stuck to mid-to-long distance most of the time.   In addition to that, throughout prehistory and history, homo sapiens have gotten slightly taller. Usain Bolt stands at 6 foot 5 inches, or 1.95 meters. He thus also advantaged by his longer strides. (That doesn't necessarily mean however, that an even taller person would be able to run faster, but longer strides is certainly an advantage if you have the same strides per second as a shorter guy running with you).   And it's not like Usain Bolt only relies on natural talent alone. Sure, the prehistoric man had to do a lot of running, and yes, they probably had to do a lot of sprinting, but remember that Usain Bolt has had far more time during the day to train running short distance. It's not like Usain Bolt sits on his butt all day, waiting for the competitions to arrive. Usain Bolt trains very hard as well. And the prehistoric man was a lot more preoccupied with non-running related activities (though not nearly as preoccupied with non-running activities as the typical modern day office employee).   Sure, it is definitely plausible that Usain Bolt would not be able to keep up to a prehistoric man on a long distance brisk run on rugged terrain, but it's insane to think that the prehistoric man would be able to run nearly as quickly as Usain Bolt on a 100m straightaway. Sure, the prehistoric man may have lived in tougher conditions, and would be better at Usain Bolt at pretty much everything regarding survival, but that really doesn't make up for their lack of constant physical training for this one singular event, coupled by a their lack of a constant source of nutrition and their lack of knowledge of the human body, all three of which Usain Bolt has.  Thus, it is very likely that Usain Bolt is one of the fastest humans to have ever existed for short distance running. But yes, he would be crushed by a long distance runner in a long distance race. For obvious reasons.",10년 전,3,

Many great African civilizations existed at the same time or before European or Asian civilization, such as Egypt (which is in Africa, not on it's own continent like you seem to have suggested), Zimbabwe, and the West African gold kingdoms (which were among the wealthiest in history, bar none). I'd say Africa has more than made its mark on innovation. (archeologists have found evidence of Mathematics existing back to 35,000 years ago, and for thousands of years medicine was far more advanced in Africa then in Europe or Asia as evidenced complex practices such as surgery, anesthesia, and tissue cauterization while Europe was dying from the Bubonic Plague) While I agree we are one people, suggesting that Africa will ""one day also make its mark in innovation"" doesn't exactly reinforce your message.",6년 전,1,

With slow twitch muscle fibres, we are all more equally matched, which is why you will see that, the longer the race is, the greater the variation in skin colour and ethnic background. Anthropologists claim this is likely due to the fact that caucasians have been domesticated for a much longer period in history, and thus having lost the need to actively hunt for their food and run away from dangerous threats, have evolved over the centuries to become weaker in this regard. If you don't use it, you lose it! Also, the fact that Africa is the home of the Lion, Cheetah, Crocodile, Hyena etc might have something to do with it!!

@oFlashoPoetryo,"Fastest loser means that he did not qualify in one of the top spots and he had to qualify for the final based off of time. For example if there are three heats, the top two in each will automatically qualify for the final.  Then the next two guys with the fastest times regardless of heat will advance to the final to fill out the Championship Race. Powell was the ""fastest loser"" meaning he did not place top two in the qualifying heats, he lost and had to wait to see if his time was fast enough to put him in the fastest two to qualify. This, then, made him the fastest loser because he was the fastest of the losers from the qualifying heats. It is general track and field Jargon and NOT meant to be rude. KIMBO MELLARK Lena lts ",10년 전,0,
@oFlashoPoetryo,"You cant expect a runner to have a perfect season every year. Injuries happen, mistakes happen, and even sometimes it's just not their year. You don't see anyone criticizing Wallace Spearmon. Americans don't call him a disgrace and make excuses and speculate when he had his bad seasons (In fact he had two bad ones in a row) excuse my French but sh*t happens. Now Asafa is on the comeback trail. The last thing you should do is shun someone and doubt them when they are going through a bad or unfortunate phase. You need to support them. So that's kind of messed up if they are doing that to Asafa. I don't think he should give up. I think he needs the motivation, which apparently according to you, hes been lacking from his fellow country mates and country as a whole. Its hard to perform well when you have no support.",10년 전,0,

Since 2009, both his 100m and 200m dropped off and he couldn't get near them but in 2012 at London this picked up again and he ran the second fastest 100m time ever. A PED cycle perhaps?",12년 전,0,

He goes from a world class athlete in 2007 but beatable to an unstoppable machine the next 2 years. Then his times got slower again until London 2012 when they explode again. Athletes use PED cycles so that their performance will be greatest at certain times. i.e. an event or race.",12년 전,0,
@mrchallengeperson,"Yeah in 2007 he was fairly new to 100m because he was a 200m runner, it seems realistic for someone with his speed to take a year to adapt to an event.

His time was 19.75, which at 20 shows great potential. If you know anything about sprinting, you can be a naturally faster runner than someone else, but that slower person can beat you because his technique is better. point is, being that it is his first 100m, chances are his technique would not be that great. ",12년 전,0,
@MrDuBears,"He may not fail the tests because of the drugs he may be using. I think he probably is the fastest person in the world when he's natural as well. He's been a phenominal runner since childhood. His most suspicious act was not being able to go sub -10 before Beijing with his PB being 10.03 by 2007.

@julabask,i think due to his incredible start if asafa was younger and trained against these people when he was younger and could last a race like this without an injury i think he was fast enough to stay in front of them. if he competed with these people when he was younger i think he would have been able to stay in front of them. asafa is an amazing sprinter maybe not better then usain but no one has ever had a better start. he trips his weight ahead of everyone i find it so amazing.,12년 전,0,
@julabask,i feel really bad for asaf powell he is an amazing sprinter his age may be catching up with him but there is no doubt he in history has the fasted start of all sprinters even at this age which he is definately getting old for this sport you can all see against the greats his start is better then all of them it always has been and still is unfortunately his age caught up with him and he strained a muscle there thats why he did not finish. he is still the fastest 50m sprinter. ,12년 전,0,

@trackman411,"however his turn was poor and i dont think it was because of the semi final either, yes he had to re-exert himself at the end but any lactate acid he built up would've been flushed & i dont know about the condition of his muscles but it doesnt appear in the race or afterwards that he had any unusual muscle issues like tightness - he has great speed endurance as his best is a 45low in the 4, i just feel he let it get away from him to early in the race -",12년 전,0,

@tecsas,"Well, then you should be a 100 metres coach! Everything they think and say about the disadvantages of being tall and running 100 metres is wrong.

@drstew1,The longer the muscle the harder to train and strengthen! Tyson Gay actually has an advantage...,12년 전,0,

@HottKitz,"Perhaps if it were true then my answer would be yes, but the BIG questions is; what case study are you going by? Can you send me the reliable source of information of where you found it at? I am a master with Google, Wikipedia (not quite lol), but I will definitely check into this. If it's true, then definitely yes, that is an unfair advantage as well. :)",12년 전,0,
@Mastermyth08,"Perhaps we should then also have blacks and non-blacks have seperate competitions? It's proven that black people run faster due to a higher gravitational point. The same thing gives non-blacks an advantage in swimming, maybe that should be seperated too.",12년 전,0,
@HottKitz,"I've already answered this Joe. I'm not punishing the guy by stating some distance formulas here. It's scientific fact. There are guys who can drive more power into the ground (or ""move their legs faster""), but they still don't cover as much distance as Usain because of his longer legs. Look at the race in one of his top vids & you will see that 2nd place runner has more powerful (faster) legs than Usain, but he is still not able to cover as much distance...",12년 전,0,
@HottKitz,"Youre wrong. Actually its the combination of both as I already answered this when I said theres guys who can ""move their legs faster"" (same thing as ""power to the ground""), but that is NOT the only thing that has the affect on stride. Stride is the distance that your legs can stretch (look up the def if you dont believe me).  So either way, if someone who can drive as much power into the ground still will NOT cover as much distance as someone who is close to power to the ground w/longer legs.",12년 전,0,
@TheA120100,"i'm sorry, but i can't help but laugh at the guy who has the last name ""Gay""",12년 전,0,
@1216RAW,"yes, but most people that tall don't have the raw ability and talant to cover 100m that fast. it's not bolt's fault he is a freak of nature. you can't punish the guy for being tall. your point is therefore irrelevant. ",12년 전,0,
@thesprintmaster,"What you just said is not a fact,Your stride length is dependent on how much power you can apply to the ground not how long your legs are, in other words how far you fly through the air with each stride not how big you strides visually appear to be. someone 5'8 could have a bigger stride length than someone 6'5 if their strides are more powerful. So if Usain bolt does have a bigger stride length than everyone else its because he's more powerful not because of his height.  ",12년 전,0,
@TheCALLofDEAD,hey everyone shut up he's the best just except it. This is coming from an american,12년 전,0,
@HottKitz,"It may be true that Usain has a slower start, but he still has a faster finish. It makes perfect sense what I'm saying, but a lot of people never bother to look at it that way. I'm sure that a lot of taller men can run, but they don't believe in themselves. They think that they are ""too tall' or ""too clumsy"", but all they would have to do is get in shape & start trying out more. Usain is definitely good, but he still has that distance advantage with his longer legs. ",12년 전,0,
@HottKitz,"Its a terrible belief to say that tall men cant run fast because apparently they can. All these guys here look rather tall (between 6'1""-6'5""), but you can see the advantage if you pay close attention. Watch the other video when Usain competes against the other Jamaican guy who keeps getting 2nd. You'll see that the other guys legs move faster, but Usain's longer legs cover more distance. Very unfair. What they need is taller men to believe in themselves & compete with Usain. U'll be surprised..",12년 전,0,
@HottKitz,"Speed equals distance over time is the formula, but in this case since its running with legs, you have to go by the example that I gave above. I dont have to ""know anything about 100 meters"" to know that what I said is a scientific fact. Not so much in this particular race, but in one of his other videos, it shows the other guy w/braids (runner up), his legs move faster than Usains legs, but he doesnt cover as much distance. I dont think that it's a terrible option, but rather a terrible belief.",12년 전,0,
@tecsas,"That's because you don't know anything about 100 metres. A tall guy like bolt would be considered a terrible option for running the 100 metres. Actually, bolt started in 200 mts and then tried 400 mts, but the training required for that is so hard that he preferred to try the 100 metres. Ever considered why 100 metres runners are so short?",12년 전,0,
@bolosantosi19,But don't forget that his taller frame means his start makes him slower than the rest. I believe its a rare case to see such a tall guy in a sprint event.,12년 전,0,
@HottKitz,"Yeah, but in my honest opinion, I still think that Usain Bolt has an unfair height advantage. I say this because taller people have longer legs, and longer legs take longer strides. So even if there is a guy who is short who can move his legs faster than Usain, Usain will sill win because he can cover more distance with his longer strides. That's why they need to have a height & weight classification. This is not really just my opinion about his advantage, it's a fact & I think it's unfair.",12년 전,0,

@maikopskoy,"so tell us, are you a muslim? do you believe in one God?  it's pretty worthless if i say this, but your footwork is amazing, the way you set it down and put potential energy in it (which is more than by Blake) the way you keep balance, the aerodynamic you have because of your abs, you don't have hair which is also good.  You've run 37.4km/h, that's damn fast, it's even hard for me to do it on a bicycle.",12년 전,0,
