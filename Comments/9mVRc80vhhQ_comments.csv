Anyways, this means that some suns may have had  different matter making ores we have never seen with even crazy properties. Any planet you can think of is probably possible.

@Bennnnnnnski,"I'm no physicist but it could be pretty normal (elliptical). This is my somewhat educated guess but take it with a pinch of salt.  The stars and planets all orbit around the centre of mass of the whole 2 star + planet system, and the stars likely have high mass relative to the planet so the stars orbit a point between them, therefore the planet orbits that point between the stars as if it was a single star with the combined mass of both stars. Unless the planet is very close to the stars then this would likely be a wide (and pretty regular) elliptical orbit",2년 전,0,

@mrsheldon9134,"Well, it is merely conjecture, so you'll have to decide for yourself whether you can accept it.  The astronomers can see that storms are moving on the planet. They can also analyse the reflected light from the planet, so they know the atmosphere is made of silicates. They know that glass is made of silicates. So they deduce that the silicates must be moving along with the storms.   As for how they can see the storms, you'd be surprised. Because there's no air in space, it's very easy to spot things. For example, the Voyager 2 probe is smaller than a car, yet it can be seen with a normal telescope. It is currently further than Pluto. By using much much larger telescopes, planets that are light years away can be accurately seen.",4년 전,150,

As for being able to see voyager 1 with a ""normal telescope"" that's Ridiculous. A large radio telescope can probably pick them up as a tiny dot due to voyagers parabolic radio dishes but an optical telescope absolutely cannot.

@pewpewTN," @cyn1xx8  South Africa? Bahahahahahahahaha That tells me all I need to know about your understanding of the world. Do you not even watch the crappy national news? Did you not see what was happening just a couple weeks ago? South Africa is unraveling & is incredibly crime & poverty stricken as it is. I don't mean like being ""poor"" in the US. I mean living in a mud floor shack in slums with thousands of people, no electricity, no opportunities & totally food & water insecure. I have a friend that sold off everything he & his family owned to immigrate to the US from SA. They weren't even among the poor, they were actually quite successful or they wouldn't have been able to get out at all. The people that don't live in slums have huge fences & pay for constant armed security. Sadly, the best job most of the people from the ""slums"" can get is to take a dangerous job in private security as that's about the only sector in SA that is currently experiencing much success. People in America are so brainwashed into hating their country without even realizing how unbelievably lucky they are to be living here.

THE RAINBOW THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE Revelations 4 and Revelations 22 Bible.   1After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, “Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this.” 2Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. 3And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance  like an emerald.    4Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads. 5And from the throne proceeded lightnings,  thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 6Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. 7The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living  creature was like a flying eagle.   8The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying:...... “Holy, holy, holy,.. Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!” 9Whenever  the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 10the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11“You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created..

@benjizp4,"Titan has hydrocarbons which are found in petroleum but they have a different origin in that they are abiogenesis - that is created without life. Instead Titan formed with a large complement of methane which us sensitive to UV light from the Sun. Over millions of years, methane molecules have one or more hydrogen atoms cleaved off by a UV photon to create a highly reactive methyl radical which on occasion will react with another methyl to form ethane, ethane can lose a hydrogen to become an ethyl radical which can then react to form heavier hydrocarbons. The heaviest molecules form a thick smog which eventually condenses on the surface.  The same process is responsible for the red or brown colours of the outer icy moons in the solar system as well as the very dark colour of comets.  It has been proposed that some oil on Earth is of abiogenic origin and comes from the Mantle, but the evidence for it is lacking.   ^^from Reddit , hope this helps",4년 전,0,

@Iamthewarner557,"“We shall show them our signs in the universe and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the truth. Is it not enough that your lord is the witness of all things?” [Quran, 41:53]  Universe A mobile phone is clearly something that was put together in an organised way, so it would be rational to believe that it must have an organiser. In the same way, when we see the order in the universe around us, isn’t it rational to say that the universe has an organiser?  “We made the sky a protective ceiling. And yet they are turning away from Our signs!” (Quran 21:32) Sky’s protection: The sky protects the earth from the lethal rays of the sun. If the sky did not exist then the sun’s radiation would have killed off all life on earth. It also acts like a blanket wrapped around the earth, to protect it from the freezing cold of space. The temperature just above the sky is approximately -270oC. If this temperature was to reach earth then the planet would freeze over instantly. The sky also protects life on earth by warming the surface through heat retention.  “It is He who created night and day, the sun and the moon, each floating in its orbit.” [Quran, 21:33] Sun’s orbit The belief that the Sun is stationary was widespread amongst astronomers until the 20th century. It is now a well-established scientific fact that the Sun is not stationary, but is moving in an orbit around the centre of our Milky Way galaxy.  Who could have mention this fact 1400 years ago? Only the creator of everything can tell this fact. This is a big sign for those who don't believe in Allah.  ""In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful."" This Message is from the slave and Messanger of Allah Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) to the Mankind. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. Furthermore  I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin. (And I recite to you Allah's Statement:)  👉Allah almighty our creator says, Say, ""O people of the Book! Come to what is common between us and you, that we worship none but Allah; that we associate nothing with Him and that none of us shall make as our Lord any other than Allah."" If they reject your invitation, then tell them plainly, ""Bear witness that we are Muslims (who worship and surrender to Allah alone)."" Qur'an (3:64)  👉Allah almighty says, Your real Deity is but One. He Who is Lord of the earth and the heavens and of all that is between them, and Lord of all Easts.

ISLAM IS FIRST RELIGION OF THE WORLD: 👉People thinks that islam came before 1400 years ago which is very big misconceptions among the people. 👉Last Messanger(Prophet Muhammad PBUH) came 1400 years ago not islam. 👉Islam is the first☝️ and oldest religion of this world and Islam is the only true religion. 👉Muslims believe that God sent different messengers throughout the history of mankind.

@elementalgolem5498," @zb0001  that would not be a planet but a star. it would be the glock - 19 star. planets orbiting it would therefore be called glock 19 - b (closest to star) glock 19 - c etc. 19 is a very small number so it would almost certenly already have a name by now. the first catalouged stars are the stars of our different constelations, and often have multiple names from different cultures",4년 전,1,

@edenalexandriab9120,"I have a question for you: do you want to go to Heaven?  Here's another: WILL you get there? Let me tell you 1. Whether you will go there and 2. If you find you're not on your way there, I'll tell you how to get there.  Only two kinds of people get to Heaven: perfect people, and forgiven sinners.  What is perfect? Well, not stealing regardless of how insignificant it may seem, not saying a single evil word against anyone - not to mention God sees our thought life. And like a judge in court, a penalty has to be paid when evil is done and laws are broken (e.g. if a murderer was let off in court there would be uproar so how much more God)?  In short - we arent perfect, at all. And rather than Heaven, God, if giving us justice, will have to make us pay for our crimes by death and eternal damnation in an everlasting fire and torment. THAT’s how much God hates sin.  BUT: There is a way that we can be saved. AND completely forgiven. Jesus - the Son of God - came down to live a perfect life without sin, conquering all evil and the devil's sinful, lustful traps that so easily ensnare us. Jesus overcame all of that, and was then sentenced to death on a cross.  While on the cross, God poured out the anger and wrath of sin on His Son - Jesus took OUR fine of damnation in our place. That’s how much He loves us. Unbearable pain and being separated from God. EVERY single evil thought, word or deed that doesnt line up with God' perfection, every sin you ever have/will commit knowingly or unknowingly, Jesus took the complete, undiluted wrath for.   And, like a fine in court, Jesus paying for it means that we can go free. Not just free, but we can experience God's love and be completely forgiven and saved from Hell as all punishment was carried on the cross and crucified there for all who believe. Instead, we can live immortally and eternally in Heaven.  After His death, Jesus rose again on the third day, demonstrating His sovereignty and power and victory over not just the sins of this life, but DEATH.  GOD HAS VICTORY OVER DEATH.  Soon Jesus will return and those who died believing in Him will RISE from their graves and go to Heaven, and those who rejected His salvation, message and teachings will suffer Hell to pay their deserved fines for all eternity without a second chance.  This is your chance now.  He wants you to repent (turn away from your sin and pursue God's perfect intent for your life, striving in the opposite direction).   It’s not only about escaping damnation, it’s entering God’s healing as well. God has a plan for your life, a plan that involves you being recreated into His perfect moral image AGAIN as we were before the sin in the garden. He loves you and wants to cleanse you - He will give you the strength. Now we can walk in His strength, experiencing His love, being taught what it means to be part of His family and too be given victory over sin and death.   He wants you to have faith in Him, letting Him take the wheel of your life (dont forget, when you're doing God's will you're following perfect love - following Him you can be certain that you are never doing the wrong thing- imagine how cleansing that feels).  What if I still sin when Ive accepted Christ's death and resurrection on my behalf?  Thats why Christ died. For your SIN. When God looks at you, striving towards Him or even falling, He sees the righteous life of Christ covering you you in place of your current, sinful reality. For those who strive to turn from sin, regardless of the pitfalls, God sees Jesus's life in place of your inability, and His blood so that yours will never have to be shed for your sin.  Religion = rules to be saved   The gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith alone in Christ alone. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong in time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He created you and knows you inside out.   Sound opposite? Thanks to our natural sinful nature, it likely does, but God knows our weakness and struggles and pitfalls with sin. THAT'S why He wrestled (and won against) every temptation YOU ever faced. Just pray to God, tell Him you are struggling and are unsure - God can and will work with even the slightest desire within you to follow Him and be free from sin. Ask Him to make you willing - if you are willing to be made willing, pray for it, simply shut your eyes and talk to Him.  When Satan knows people have left His camp, He won’t take it lying down, He often tries harder with more trials and temptations. But Satan cannot do anything beyond what God permits, He will only allow things that will strengthen you or bring you closer to Him if you cling to Him and trust in the promises of His word.  Where do I start to learn about God's plan and His promises to me? Well, these Bible relate directly to Christ's life and our redemption, check out Matthew (or Luke if you want a more detailed account). Do it in stages and try and imagine the events and miracles as they really happened - the Bible is a true account after all.  And when and note it says WHEN, you struggle and fall on this lifelong process, know you can pray for forgiveness, dust yourself off again and get up because Jesus already bore our guilt and shame. remember that Jesus is the ultimate foundation, the reason we are given Heaven in the first place.   If you lack faith (as i did for a long time) pray. He desires to give strength and faith to His children in time when they ask Him.  If you want to let Jesus into your life, even to help you to take the first step, then read through this prayer here to get the gist of it and then just say it - trust God and give it all to Him because He has the - perfect - master plan. If you take a step - just a step - towards Him, He will take a step towards you.  NOTE: YOU ARE NEVER TOO SINFUL THAT GOD CANNOT BRING YOU BACK HOME.  Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and there is nothing that I can do to save myself. I confess my complete helplessness to forgive my own sin or to work my way to heaven.  At this moment I trust Christ alone as the One who bore my sin when He died on the cross. I believe that He did all that will ever be necessary for me to stand in your holy presence. I thank you that Christ was raised from the dead as a guarantee of my own resurrection.  As best as I can, I now transfer my trust to Him.  I am grateful that He has promised to receive me despite my many sins and failures. Father, I take you at your word.  I thank you that I can face anything now that you are my Savior.  Thank you for the assurance that you will walk with me through the deep valley. Thank you for hearing this prayer. In Jesus’ Name,   Amen xxx",4년 전,0,

I believe this just due to how expansive the Universe is. However, answering your question, I partly agree with you. No way life could live hundreds of kilometers down. However... what about 5 kilometers down? 10? Maybe 20? Even if it is only microscopic, in billions of years, it could just evolve to become a fish. Or maybe there is already fish swimming a few kilometers down that we didn't see. I don't believe 100% that there is life on that planet, but it hasn't been debunked either.",4년 전,11,

@michaeljerman3938," @dracaves  There is no life on that planet. Life requires many things most of which that planet lacks, that's not to say that life can only be exclusive to earth, but to make life to start out is extremely difficult and even if life is made, it is hard to have it continue. Although Life is a strange thing and is very hard to find for many reasons including those that we don't know what we are looking for. An average person might just say to look for animals, maybe someone smarter might think to look for plants, animals, and bacteria, but to find bacteria is super difficult especially from these planets that are light years away, and plants and animals are not the only other ways life can exist but instead the ones we have here on Earth. Plants and animals are like a species of life itself, life can evolve like a plant gaining energy from the sun and evolve into many other type of plants, it can evolve into a cell that eats other cells and starts working together with other cells to eat more cells, but it can also and more likely evolve into completely different types of life that better suits their planet, our planet has 3 different kinds and all 3 are vastly different than each other. Bacteria on this planet simply couldn't begin to start out due to lack of minerals at the oceans bottom as they were explained as solid ice, the lack of available energy at the oceans bottom, and the chances that are simply against it starting, surviving, and continuing on. Although I'd love to see some life on other planets, this is just not one that we would be seeing some anytime soon, or ever.",4년 전,0,

Btw, none of the light we see from anywhere in our universe has taken more than about 14 billion years to get here.   We cannot see anything more than that because the universe is only that told, and therefore light from further away has not reached us.",2년 전,1,
@davidtran9455," @pickleballer1729  I know that the universe isn’t that big. But if we shine a light from here, since the universe is expanding, the light could go theoretically go for trillions of years to reach a planet. There is a lot we don’t know about space so this might not be right. It’s possible the universe could die before then, but we don’t know.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@pickleballer1729," @jeffgillson  Don't you think your reply is a bit much, just as the level of detail about these planets is a bit much?  Sure, they're speculating a great deal, and they should say that, but LYING?  If that's to be considered lying, then every single statement that's ever been made about politics or leadership or economics from any viewpoint is a LIE.  Opinions and speculation should be revealed as such, but those are not the same as lying.",2년 전,0,
@PlasticDoll.,"​ @jeffgillson  to say they are making it up is weird when we have telescopes and satellites that actively observe planets & stars at all times. it's just an observation of a planet's weather & atmosphere. they're not going to lie when anybody can search it up & look for it themselves.   besides those ""guesses"" are carefully made, educated & thought out observations, not just your average educated person. it's probably not just astrophysicists alone, but whether professionals and other scientists. let's not forget about computers and machine that can easily make a close prediction of a planet's atmosphere given enough information.  anyways we have James Webb Telescope in space now that can see galaxies in the past, 400-800 million years after big bang, much less individual specific planets.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

Methane is a gas (or liquid in the case of Titan) that has molecules that are just one carbon atom and 4 hydrogen atoms, not exactly the most complicated chemical structure to coincidentally find elsewhere in the universe. It’s a problem to conclude that the presence of methane means there is oil on Titan.",5년 전,0,

@ananttiwari1337," @cadenchristiansen3553  Bruh. First of, its climate change. Second of all, the rate at which the sun is expanding is very slow. The main cause is the emission of stuff like Carbon or Methane into the atmosphere which traps the heat. This is necessary so you don't die due to cold temperatures at night, but too much results in a lot of heat getting trapped in the atmosphere.",4년 전,0,
@cadenchristiansen3553, @ananttiwari1337  you also have to keep in mind that all the planets in the solar systum are effecting the our orbit putting us closer to sun there for heating us up also if you look at a graph of the earth heating over the past 100 million years you can tell that it is natural for the earth to heat up and cool down so in the end the effect that humans have on the earth heating up is very tiny so we should not switch to wind or solar power because both of them are less use full and they dont create that much power so you need a bunch of them in order to make enough power to sustain also i have been hearing the same bs that in 20 years we are all going to die in climate change i heard that over 40 years ago so as soon as they give REAL data i will belive that bull shit,4년 전,0,
@ananttiwari1337, @cadenchristiansen3553  You are looking at negligible effects. Yes that does happen but the amount by which earth heats or cools down due to the pull of other planets is SO miniscule that you can ignore it. I believe in climate change but not the political attitude of most people to it aka cutting down factories and stuff. The carbon levels and the average temperature occasionally peaks and valleyss' but this time it's much more than usual suggesting we might have started climate change by emitting pollutants.,4년 전,0,
@ananttiwari1337," @cadenchristiansen3553  Again, you technically can't predict anything perfectly. It just happened that after the industrial revolution the temperature increased quite a bit along with carbon levels. This anomaly suggests climate change but it might just be chance. In the end it's your choice to believe in something.",4년 전,0,
@cadenchristiansen3553, @ananttiwari1337  yea the main reason I don't believe that humans are the cause of climate change is because the political stigma behind it. and I have been hearing them say the earth i going into an ice age and that we are all going to be dead in 20 years and now its climate change and the earth is heating up I think that it is just fine that if people want to switch to solar or build more wind farms I just dont think we should do a full switch until there is better technolgy for that stuff cause right now that are not that good and i think it is really good people are trying to but less carbon in the air even if i dont think the earth is heating up because of it it still causes bad air and makes it hard to breath for some people i think that it is good that people are trying to do good for our planet i just think we should start with cleaning the oceans and stuff like that  i respect your view on the matter and i am happy we where able to have this talk it has opened my eyes on different sides of the argument,4년 전,0,

@kryplek7696,I might be wrong but if there were two suns and they were seperated you probably won’t have any shadows   The reason why is because one sun creates a shadow but if you add another then that second sun will overlap the first shadow meaning there will be no shadows or just one,5년 전(수정됨),0,

@thesatisfiedcustomer4869,"It’s funny how we’ve learnt so much about the universe and other planets in the past 50 years with the rapid advancement in technology but have managed to forget how to get to the moon.  Very awkward. Even when they’ve planned missions they seem to need twice as much time as they did in the 60’s. That’s health and safety culture for you I suppose. No risk takers left at NASA.  And with all these advancements in technology, improved air craft, stealth fighters etc, concord etc - it’s disappointing to see we are still farting about with bloody rocket technology that we pretty much had in the 1940’s. Surely they can do better than bloody rockets.  Again, the scientists probably spend too much time in health and safety & bloody anti-bullying classes to focus on building anything new.  They should stop obsessing about the atmosphere of these useless planets when we can’t even get through that bloody van halen belt. It’s like learning scuba diving theory before you even try swimming.  They need to sort their priorities out.   Useless.",5년 전,0,

@tonybaja5267," @Spladoinkle  imagine you crash land on this planet, and you have no choice but to jump out of your ship as its about to explode. you dive in with a super water suit, falling through crystal clear water. you fall asleep due to exhaustion, and you wake up to see yourself falling deeper and deeper for hours until theres no light remaining. You are falling at 47 KPH, you keep falling, you start hearing strange creature noises. THUD, you finally hit the bottom, only to see youself on a small rock, and you turn your lights on. Theres another cliff infront of you. You look up but theres only blackness, Then you slip off and you are falling again. only a fraction of the way to the bottom. the water temperature starts to increase, and you begin to see movements and hear strange noises. you have been falling for 5 hrs 8 minutes. you are moving at 89 KPH. You finally land on a block of Ice, 500,000 feet below the surface, thankful that no creature got you and you can finally die. You sit there, under the weight of 2395 african elephants. You will die from nitorgen bubbles in your blood shorty. as you slowly start  to hallucinate, you imagine thousands of terrifying creatures coming towards you, in a endless nightmare....",5년 전,11,

@Angel_isneifnrjrbr,"I’m surprised. I expected to come here and have to write many paragraphs of why this is wrong (as I have for many weird planet videos) but instead I find that this video is almost entirely true. My only issue is that on the planet with a water surface there would most likely be no creatures. There is nothing on that planet to heat up the water meaning it’s ice cold. I’m surprised it’s not ice. In order to remain water it would have to have a heat source, this would usually be the planets surface itself but that is coated in miles of ice 7 causing the hot air to be trapped underneath. I’m assuming the planet has an atmosphere trapping in the little heat existing to keep it water but most likely not enough for life. Anyway I’m not an expert in heat and atmospheres I’m just going off of what I know but if you know anything please confirm and reply, thank you! 🙏",5년 전,0,

@jonhart4563,Except everything mainstream is treated as if we have total understanding. The reality is that we know almost nothing and they ngs we think we know we actually don't know. Like gravity or how matter even exists. Can't be created nor destroyed. Or the law of entropy which is the opposite of what we are taught. Evolution can't be true if a scientific law called the law of entropy or the natural state of things is to decay.. unless acted upon by an outside force.. what's hot gets cold what's spinning fast slows down ect.. the Earth's magnetic field getting weaker the spin slowing down the moon goes 4 feet away every year and it's awfully close.  On and on.. doesn't match billions of years and the speed of light is Not a constant... If we will be humble which is the opposite of our nature.. Then we could have a chance of understanding... But no real knowledge doesn't matter only the agenda matters because the people who control our countries science ect are always the powerful who care not about humanity understanding truth they only care about their own power. Just lik how the Vatican suppressed what it supposedly believwd so they could sell salvation and have absoliyte power rather then freeing the people they enslaved them.. one of the great killers of Christian's was the Vatican and they did it In a brutal cruel way. They didn't care about truth any more then China does today or the USA for that matter. Only when We the People are in control can these truths flourish and understanding can be spread..,5년 전,0,

@wallythewall600,"Quartz is a naturally occurring mineral, the most common one in our planet in fact. If you heat it to it's melting point and then cool it, one of two things happens; if the cooling is ""rapid"", it solidifies amorphously and you get glass. ""Shitty"" glass that's not as clear and pristine as modern glass with it's additives, but absolutely still glass. If it cools really, really, REALLY slowly (think geological time scales) then it can crystallize back into any of the polymorphs of quartz that correspond to the temperature and pressure when it recrystallizes. He didn't mention the temperatures on the planet, but if one side's hot and the other cold, and the wind is transporting molten silica at 2km/s between the two, then it's perfectly reasonable to say that it does rain glass.",5년 전,0,

@wallythewall600,"To know it rains glass on a planet, you need to know 2 things; 1) A pretty rough range of temperatures for the planet (if it's hot enough to vaporize silica and then cool it quickly back into a solid state) 2) Is there silica on the planet That's really all you need to know, given those two things, silica will vaporize and solidify amorphously into glass and fall. ""It rains glass"" You can get the temperature by just observing the energy being radiated by the planet and applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The composition you can do with spectroscopy, feel free to read up on Wikipedia. Gathering this information is (with some simplification to neglect any technical finesse involved) just a matter of having the right instruments and being able to point them in the right direction.  I'm a geophysics student. Volcanology isn't my main area of interest, but I know a few things nonetheless. If you wanted to predict with exact certainty when a volcano erupt, you'd need to know; a very detailed and complete model of pressure and composition for the volcanic system, a complete model of the magma flow at least in the ""general vicinity"" of the volcano (several dozen kilometers in radius) or straight-out worldwide, and you'd also need to be able to predict any earthquakes with absolute certainty since those can trigger eruptions, and for that you need to know the stress states and detailed plate velocities for every square foot of lithosphere on the entire planet. We don't even have the instruments to do this. Some people on my campus are having some success with early-warning systems made by analyzing the audio spectrum of geophone output near a volcanic system and applying machine learning algorithms to single out subtle patterns that precede an eruption. IF you do get an early warning it can be anywhere from weeks to minutes before an event, and the machine learning models are very much tuned to work on specific systems and generally don't work for other volcanic system (this particular application by my campus was to a volcano in the Andes).  Although it may seem counter-intuitive because ""BUT THIS STUFF IS CLOSE AND THAT STUFF IS A GORRILION LIGHT YEARS AWAY!"", being able to say that something happens requires very little information, while being able to ""exactly"" predict when something happens requires ungodly levels of information and analysis.",5년 전,0,

But what if a planet didn't have to be Earth-like, or even in the goldilocks zone (a small circular orbit around a star in which a planet could sustain human-like life), to support life?

@RocketLauncherSkeleton,"Helpful but long-ass explanation as to why exoplanet names look like they were made by sitting on a keyboard.   Since there are so many exoplanets, the naming conventions had to be so that:     1. Planets could be easily categorised and identified 2. One could never run out of possible names.     Allow me to explain, and forgive me if this is boring, because it really is:     We'll start off simple. So for most planets, they take the name of the parent star and add a lowercase letter corresponding to the order in which it was discovered, with the first letter being ""b"", with ""a"" regarded as the parent star. For example, 55 Cancri b is named that way because the parent star that it orbits is known as 55 Cancri. ""b"" is added since 55 Cancri b was the first exoplanet to be discovered in the system. If it orbits a binary star center, then they add an uppercase letter, and then a lowercase letter just like 16 Cygni Bb, with stars having capital letters.      Ok, so you're probably wondering about the planets with monstrously shitty names like HD 189733-b, and I'm just about to get to that. HD 189733-b as you know is the planet which rains glass sideways. Very simple explanation. ""HD"" stands for the ""Henry Draper Catalogue"" which is a star catalogue. 189733 denotes the order in which the star was catalogued, in this case HD 189733-b was the 189,733rd exoplanet to be added to the HD catalogue. And of course, b is the order in which the planet was discovered.",5년 전,1,

It can be formed from liquid water above 3 giga pascals, by lowering its temperature to room temperature, or by decompressing heavy water. Heavy water is a form of water where instead of containing the hydrogen isotope hydrogen-1 that is found in normal water, it contains a different hydrogen isotope, deuterium. Making its chemical formula D2O instead of H2O. Deuterium is pretty much the same as normal hydrogen, exept is has an extra neutron.",5년 전,0,

@RocketLauncherSkeleton,"Since there are so many exoplanets, the naming conventions had to be so that:   1. Planets could be easily categorised and identified 2. One could never run out of possible names.   Allow me to explain, and forgive me if this is boring, because it really is:   We'll start off simple. So for most planets, they take the name of the parent star and add a lowercase letter corresponding to the order in which it was discovered, with the first letter being ""b"", with ""a"" regarded as the parent star. For example, 55 Cancri b is named that way because the parent star that it orbits is known as 55 Cancri. ""b"" is added since 55 Cancri b was the first exoplanet to be discovered in the system. If it orbits a binary star center, then they add an uppercase letter, and then a lowercase letter just like 16 Cygni Bb, with stars having capital letters.    Ok, so you're probably wondering about the planets with monstrously shitty names like HD 189733-b, and I'm just about to get to that. HD 189733-b as you know is the planet which rains glass sideways. Very simple explanation. ""HD"" stands for the ""Henry Draper Catalogue"" which is a star catalogue. 189733 denotes the order in which the star was catalogued, in this case HD 189733-b was the 189,733rd exoplanet to be added to the HD catalogue. And of course, b is order in which the planet was discovered.",5년 전,6,

@dustinf49,"There is a place with four suns in the sky — red, white, blue, and yellow; two of them are so close together that they touch, and star-stuff flows between them. I know of a world with a million moons. I know of a sun the size of the Earth — and made of diamond. There are atomic nuclei a few miles across which rotate thirty times a second. There are tiny grains between the stars, with the size and atomic composition of bacteria. There are stars leaving the Milky Way, and immense gas clouds falling into it. There are turbulent plasmas writhing with X- and gamma-rays and mighty stellar explosions. There are, perhaps, places which are outside our universe. The universe is vast and awesome, and for the first time we are becoming a part of it.   -Carl Sagan",5년 전,0,

That Is not even a joke and is a real Good question, Tajrin then replied with Maybe it’s Because Theres too many planets, which is completely understandable and make sense. I Don’t get how that Was a joke when he Was asking a question. How Did he ruin a non-joke by replying an Actual reason to the question. Once again, its a question, not a joke.

Of course it’s a joke, cause who in the world will actually say “why are they naming it like gift card codes” unless they are sarcastic. Before you say it wasn’t a joke, it’s sarcasm and supposed to be read in a dead, flat tone.  Every question isn’t a serious one, and many of them are rhetorical or sarcastic. This comment was   Great now everyone is gonna jump on me, just ask the original comment dude if he was actually joking or not. If he wasn’t then my bad, if he was then you could chill.

So ”her” im just gonna Call her that. Wanted to reply to the question, I mean. Clearly that Was a question, the sentence begins with a Why, However it doesn’t end with a ”?” But it’s Pretty obvious that it Was a question and not a joke, I just Wanna make that clear.

But think about it, Who just randomly says, ”Why Are they naming planets like a gift card Code.” Ending it with a ”.” But still starts the sentence with a ”Why” that doesn’t make Any sense.

Isaac Newton (Isasick Newbton) is a massive, great deceiver similar to the foolish shill Albert Einstein (Allburt Shillstein)   The wise inventor man Nikola Tesla knew that the World/Earth is a plane, not a planet. Tesla said:  ""Earth is a realm, it is not a planet. It is not an object, therefore, it has no edge. Earth would be more easily defined as a system environment. Earth is also a machine, it is a Tesla coil. The Sun and the Moon are powered wirelessly with electromagnetic field (the aether). This field also suspends the spheres (The Sun and The Moon) with electromagnetic levitation. Electromagnetic levitation also disproves gravity because the only force you need to conquer is the electromagnetic force, not gravity. The stars are attached to The Firmament (The Dome Ceiling of our enclosed World!).""  Don't beLIEve in the impossible, non-existent, make-belief; that we live on a mysterious, magical traveling ball in ""space"" !

It also makes more sense scientifically to name the star after important features like the quadrant it exists in or the type of star.

PS. The majority of the USA oil comes from the USA about 12 mil barrels per day but we use 20 mil bpd so the rest comes from Canada and a very small minority coming from the middles east (which is crude oil) and we pay for it so why would we fight a war for oil the pay for it thank you good night sweet dreams have a good day/evening or enjoy whatever it is for you,6년 전(수정됨),0,

Also, say your sitting down, I put a light on your left and a light on your back. You will have a shadow on your right and a shadow infront of you.

@vivianseitzinger2743,"assuming that GJ1214-b is just water, and it has sustainable life, i'd say it would be like the precambrian (when it cooled and the water was not hot anymore) or cambrian. the world there wouldn't have gotten to the land stage, so no mosasaurs or whales, seals, otters, and many more aquatic mammals. no birds either, just prehistoric fish-like creatures wich roam the seas, eventually evolving to a more incredible scale, and having a variety of deepsea fish, as well as normal fish wich dont go to the deep end. and by normal i mean lifeforms wich might be similar to our fish and crayfish. its a whole different world, so what could possibly happen?",6년 전,0,

The illuminated sides temperature is 1000 degrees Celsius (1832 degrees Fahrenheit), and the not illuminated ones temperature is 750 degrees Celsius (1382 degrees Fahrenheit). HD189733b has really strong and fast winds. Their speed is 7000 kilometers per hour ( 4349 miles per hour). Because of those weird occurances, HD189733b has glass rains.

@Rydo416,"The names for the planets are named after their telescope mission. For example, COROT-7b is named after the telescope mission COROT, and it being the 7th exoplanet discovered by COROT. Planets usually have A or B in their number, as the full name is given to the star of their system, for example the sun of COROT-7b would be called COROT-7. Also, Earth is not named after dirt, it is named after the Goddess Gaia, which is the personification of Earth in Greek mythology. It is also the reason why the supercontinent 300 million years ago was called Pangaea.",6년 전,7,

All the nutrients would have to come from photosynthesis, which only happens at the upper layer of the ocean. But the ocean is so deep, and the ocean floor is covered by hot ice, making a barrier between the water and minerals and other nutrients. And because of the depths and because there are no islands, mountains or continents that are able to reach the layers where photosynthesis occurs, the upper layers would be like a wet desert with almost no nutrients. Also depending on how hot it is; if the water is warm there will be less oxygen (assuming we are talking about life and photosynthesis resembling that on earth). If there is higher forms of life, they will probably be small plankton, not giant monsters.",6년 전,0,

It would be amazing to see giant, fiction-like creatures on this planet!  Tbh most of the life on earth just doesn’t amaze me. I want to see something new and big.

When you triple the size, you increase the volume by 27x and when you increase the size of a creature from a bacterium to a huge monster aka 1000000 times, you 1000000000000000000x the volume and surface area by a significant amount too. This increases pressure exponentially and would mean that no big creatures can exist at that depth!",6년 전,3,

That one shadow would only appear where if you took each shadow you get from each and only left where they overlapped. It would probably not look like a normal shadow, but more like a lump",6년 전,0,

@bluewolf7354,"I have an idea... A space survival game located either in ""COROT-7b"", ""HD189773-b"", ""HD189733-b"" or ""Titan"", all the mechanics would be available in every planet, but you'd need to figure out how to survive based on where you think you are, and every one of them would have different dangers you'd have to deal with (Natural disasters, climate conditions... wild aliens, some hostile and some friendly, etc.). The difficulty determines the planet you're more likely to land on. For example, if you choose the easiest difficulty you'll probably land on a planet like Titan (Where climate conditions wouldn't matter as much as in other planets but you could find aliens) or HD189733-b, while the hardest difficulty would get you to the other two. You could still land in a dangerous planet in easy mode, but things would be a ""little bit"" easier, you'd need less resources to repair your shelter, suit and tools, food would be a bit more common or you could find ancient ruins filled with traps and (Probably) some useful stuff. You'd have your own shelter with a decent temperature and it would be safe when any natural disasters occur, but you'll have to repair it from the outside if something gets damaged (Either a wall or door, temperature regulator, electric generator, or you could upgrade some of these). There could be a way in which you could be able to communicate with humans, however, it'd be impossible for them to rescue you and they'd die in some way, but you could loot the ship for scrap and repair their suits for yourself (If they're not destroyed, of course, alternatively you could repair the ship and redirect it to your home... just to have the system fail and crash into another planet where you'd begin almost from 0).  ¿What do you think about it? I'd do it if i knew how to make a good game, but since i don't even know how it'd turn out i'd rather leave the idea here for someone else to use it, and IF YOU DO IT, make sure you can create a gliding suit that can make you fly in Titan.",7년 전,0,

@kaitourobin3206,Well to be fair cancer is a mutation  of the body. Not a sickness. Everybody are similar but also different.  So treatment will work for some not for all. So you will have find a new solution for each individual. Plus all humans have cancer. Most people dna/cells have a self destruction mechanism that kills itself before it spreads. Problem with people with cancer is that self destruction no longer works and mutations cells grow instead of healthy one. Even if you able to remove the cancer cells (which is hard since cells grow at a rapid pace) the original case can remake news ones. Even if you attempt to reprogram the DNA not to mutant that alone cannot guarantee future mutations. So in the end to live is to die.,7년 전,22,

@dale00474,FYI: Two shadows is not possible. You have a point and two light sources. As both light sources can not share the same exact point of origin they will have two different lines of sight. Turn on a light above an outstretched hand then another slightly to the side. The new light source would illuminate the shadow once cast below the hand. In the case that one light source is not as bright as the other still one is more luminous and would cancel out the other while the other is unable to overpower the one still causing a single shadow. To prove this go outside with a flashlight. Plant a small stick in the ground and shine the light at the stick you'll notice no new shadow appears. You can also do this inside your own home with the overhead light in your room. Open the flashlight feature on your phone and raise your hand to make a shadow. Now shine the light at a slightly different angle as the light above and notice the shadow you once were casting has disappeared. I'd be curious to know your resources on this.,7년 전,0,

Things like the look of its surface and the conditions you can find there are rather science fiction I think. Don't forget, a planet is not emitting any light, only reflecting.

Why don't they pay for their own shit ? After all it was their choice to become a YouTuber. I mean with your logic we might as well give them money to pay their bills and give them money to pay for their rent or mortgage or car insurance or their cell phone bills and so on and so on. Hell we might as well buy them a new car lol. Do you see my point ? And one last thing THEY CAN GET A FUCKING JOB LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD.

@FlamingVaIIey,"Listen here pal, I don't personally support this channel to have a patreon, but YouTube HAS ALWAYS been a business, and it is an actual job, uploading a video it's not as simple as just record and upload. It requires a lot of work, sometimes even days worth of work in order to upload a single video. And before you tell me ""oh but it's just a web page, it is not a real job to just make videos"". It is entertainment media, the same as T.V. or even the movies that you watch. But I bet you don't go around telling actors and actresses to ""get a real job"" do you? The reason that so many channels have relied on patreon as of late is due to the fact that YouTube has been very topic sensitive and will easily demonitize a video for whatever reason they deem fit which is a lot of bullshit for youtubers who have it as their full-time job and put time and effort to create quality content, but sure. If you want half-assed content that also takes too long to upload then by all means, go ahead and keep complaining about youtubers wanting actual revenue for their work.",7년 전,6,
@ravenofshadows2830," @FlamingVaIIey  You are an idiot lol. First off your comparing YouTubers to actors & comparing YouTube videos to movies or T.V. Shows lol that is how stupid you really are lol. First off,Actors don't have Patreon accounts and their is a huge difference between YouTube and movies for example, In movies or t.v shows their is alot of production & marketing cost not to mention advertising. A movie can cost millions of dollars to make and that's just the cost to make the movie, then even more money spent on advertising and marketing the movie then even more money to pay the actors but you know what is the biggest difference between YouTubers and actors is ? Talent. Anybody can do YouTube but it takes actual talent to become an actor. That is why not everyone makes it in Hollywood. You say YouTube is like a full time job but I'm sorry in a real job the customers don't pay you your boss does. He or she is the one that pay you. Like i said before it was there choice to become a YouTuber. No one ask them to start a YouTube channel and make YouTube videos. So why should the viewers or subscribers give them money or pay for their equipment ? Especially when there are YouTuber's that scam people and take advantage of people. I've seen some of these Fortnite YouTubers take money from little kids and children but i guess that is ok in your book. Fuck out of here with that bullshit.",7년 전,2,
@FlamingVaIIey," @ravenofshadows2830  Seems you are the only idiot here as you can't think through what I said correctly. Yes indeed making movies or tv shows cost a lot of money to make and to be an actor requires talent aside from charisma, but guess what. So does YouTube, of course there is always mediocre youtubers who just take advantage of trends and shit, but in the same manner there is shitty actors who make it big on hollywood for no reason whatsoever. Or have yoi forgotten about the ghostbusters reboot? In the same way not everyone becomes a movie star, not everyone becomes big on YouTube. I don't support mediocre and stupid channels who give no shits about the content they provide, I support the youtubers who put real effort and time, including high quality hardware to provide their audience with high quality content as a way to repay the decision from the audience to DONATE. As I said before, YouTube has become a shitshow for content creators and their monetization system is worst than it has ever been, yet you still sit on top of your finger crying and complaining that they will only provide if we pay, which is completely ridiculous to think of. And another thing, free-lancers and individual business owners get paid by their customers which is the same as then being their bosses, but it seems you are way too shut in your own little world full  of stupid ideas on how it should work.",7년 전,3,

That was their choice to become a YouTuber so they should have to  live with their decision and support themselves Instead of asking their subscribers & viewers too support them. How about these YouTubers try supporting themselves or don't make YouTube videos if they can't afford to pay for the equipment they need to make videos but no they want their subscribers & viewers to pay for the equipment they need and that is just like a rock band asking their fans to pay for their instruments lol.

It's. really not that complicated to become successful, All you need is the will, Drive, and determination. Instead of bitching and complaining how about you actually do something about it. You want to change your life and do it and not just talk about it. Here are some steps to becoming successful that i found.  First off stop being lazy because laziness isn't going to get you nowhere in life.  Step 2, Set a goal that you want to accomplish then follow through with it.  Step 3, Make a plan to achieve your goals & if the first plan doesn't work then make a plan b, c, and so on until you achieve your goals.

B. you could have not commented to my original comment or not have responded or replied back to any of my comments towards you, Which would have been the end of it. And finally C.

So if these YouTubers are not making money from doing YouTube, Then why continue to do it. ?  Where in a normal job you know at the end of the week or every two weeks, Depending on the job, That you know your getting a paycheck.

Science takes everything into account. All of those planets are sure to exist without a doubt. Now that we know the exist... How did you find out their size, makeup, and climate again? Because of the red / blue shift of the planet that you didnt observe, but inferred existed because a star got dimmer? Totally reasonable,. Ohh wait. Don't scientists now say that the speed of light can change based on the amount of space? Like space = energy and if too much space exists then energy condenses into more matter changing the speed o light? So how does redshift and background radiation work again.

On the day of judgement every scientific fact will be a prove against every disbeliever. Science doesn't contradict God. It proves He exists. The church has violated faith and doctrine. Science is signs .. from the only and not-just-for-the-arabs God Allah! The Qur'an contains so many scientific miracles and God tells us in it to observe the creation. But people insist on seeing God Himself. But let me tell you something (out of love!): this world is a test and time here is limited. You will come to life again as you did a few decades/years ago. You were nothing and then you became a human with intellect. The universe is not a bunch of endless coincidences. It is a thought-through creation that keeps expanding. Nothing comes from nothing. Big Bang you say? It is mentioned in the Qur'an. Evolution you argue? Well, maybe there was a kind of evolution, but the human being as known nowadays was not part of it. They may find fossils of other species evolving other thousands of years .. But homo sapiens is not part of it. We are the pinnacle of this creation .. given intellect and free will. And SCIENCE is one of the the biggest SIGNS of the One and Only God!   My advice: seek forgiveness and guidance from Him (He's not a man and unlike anything created).  Peace",7년 전,0,

@gioc.1908,"Hello Martin, I hope you're well. I must tell you  that you've misunderstood the verses or probably reproduced the misinterpretation of somebody else.   The Qur'an is God's word and eternal, that's correct. It is also correct that Jesus is described as a word from God. However, this doesn't mean that Jesus was the eternal word of God and equal to Him! Let me explain to you, why.  God compares the creation of Jesus to the one of Adam by saying: ""Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is that of Adam. [...] He said to him BE and he was."" (Q, 3:59)  If your explanation was right, then Adam would have to be considered divine, too. But the mentioned verse clearly shows that Jesus is a different kind of 'word'. He is not like the Qur'an, but he is like Adam: created by God saying the word BE.   Regarding the evolution.. I don't know a lot about fossils, but I do know that Islam is the truth. Some insist in the evolution thing. For me it doesn't really change a lot, since my point is that even if there was some kind of evolution the human being was never part of it (except for changes that God might have made, of which we lack knowledge).",7년 전,0,

@PeliSotilas,A lot of people wondering why the planets are named such ways need an explanation so I will do so. 1. Insert the name of the Satellite which discovered the planet (for example Kepler or Gliese) 2. Insert the number which explains the order the solar system was discovered (Kepler 1 would be the first solar system/star that the satellite discovered Gliese 165 would be the 165th solar system the satellite discovered) 3. Insert the planet of the solar system in the alphabetical order (Kepler 265-a would be the star itself and Kepler 265-b would be the closest known planet to the star) Now we are familiar with the basis of the names of planets and stars.,7년 전,0,

@UNOwen1,"+RealLifeLore; Hi, a couple of things - the first, you incorrectly say 'the primary light source is our sun...;, what would happen if there were 2 suns' 0;33).The Sun earth's STAR, other solar systems DN'T have 'suns', per se - as it's really, a 'proper name (though it's so misused). Their star could be ringed by them (in their language) THEIR 'sun', but, not necessarily.  The other thing - which - if I were you, I'd not only find disturbing, I'd see what could be done to REMOVE it (it does NOTHING for you), there's some fool who has YOUR video, but, it's one of those 'reacts to' things, so people DON'T watch this, DON'T give you the count, but, him, and HE's done NOTHING to earn it.  As I don't wish to give this a-hole ANY attention, I'm putting the name as briefly as possible, not as a link so no one can click on it); it's the same name as yours, with s 'REACTION!' added on.  It's BAD ENOUGH people STEAL others music and do NOT much, and honestly believe they 'made something new', but, to make a video, of themself, saying stupid SHITE, and making DUMB, IMMATURE faces, w/out ANY ACTUAL W-O-R-K - just STEALING YOUR VIDEO, it's WRONG.  One last thing(s); the temperature on Titan IS cold, but, it's NOT 'bone-shattering', the correct phrase is 'bone-CHILLING' (5:51) - 'shattering' refers to (As an example) something being hit with a lot of force - enough to BREAK, I.e., shatter, whereas 'chilling' refers to exactly that; it CHILLS. Yes, there IS a differemce between ringing it what you said, and the CORRECT thing, and people who'd 'quibble' over 'little' things really don't understand how important it is (esp. In things such as science 😉) to be ACCURATE, because being a few, or a little whatever off, CAN make the difference between a successful mission, or failure, between life and death'.  I'm NOT trying to 'nit-pick', but, as this is a video to help EDUCATE people giving the wrong information doesn't help, doesn't set good examples. In all of the universe we've so far found out about, it seems Earth is the 'VERY BIZARRE place' place, NOT the other way around' (5:54).   Keep up the good work 😉.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

So Saturn of all places is out of the question for now.""  I then told them, ""welp. I'm fucked anyway. Might as well help explore this place before I go.""

@Thatguy25461,Hmm let's drop some knowledge. So USA uses the imperial system ie feet pounds tons inches yards farenheit etc but this system is only used in the general public. Almost all scientific medical or industrial settings use metric. So if your checking your height it will be feet. If your a scientist doing science you'll use meters. The main reason for this is that the imperial system is buried in the people of USA our parents and our parents parents know the older measurements and for companies to change things like oven settings  to Celsius or product height to meters would be too costly so we keep using imperial. I do believe that we are slowly converting to metric anyway.   By the way everyone here is wrong Kelvin is the best measurement for tempurature freezing is 273° K and boiling is 373°K,7년 전,0,

@joebeastyg5686,"Let me get this straight... We seem to ""know"" more about the bottom of an ocean on a distant planet that nobody's ever physically seen with their own eyes than we do about the bottom of our own planet's oceans. We also seem to ""know"" some pretty specific weather patterns on these ""newly discovered"" planets that we can not actually see, yet we are still arguing over the validity and cause of few degree change to our own planet's climate. So, now that we have ""confirmed"" the existence of over 1000 planets outside of our own solar system, when do you think we'll have the ability to surpass the 7-8 mile depth record and finally ""confirm"" what we already supposedly ""know"" about our own planet's core?  It's truly amazing what people will believe today without so much as questioning how or why they should. The information in this video sounds more like science fiction than science fact. And it may be true that the information presented in this video isn't some kind of secret as it can be found all over the internet. I know. So what, right? If I had seen something like this 10 years ago I know that I would've felt that much smarter for watching it. That's because it merely would've confirmed my belief that the universe is a wild and crazy place where anything is possible. But I can't and don't think that way any more. Millions of people have watched this video. And millions of people probably believe they now ""know"" some really cool ""facts"". Very few people will question what they saw. And fewer still have the guts to speak their mind in fear of ridicule. That's not how science is supposed to work. Yet that's exactly how it does today. We really don't know all that much about the environment around us that we live in and can actually see and feel. But if you want to believe that we have the ability to determine the wind speed on Planet Z9000, where it rains Pop Rocks from cotton candy clouds, because some guy with a telescope and a computer ""confirmed"" it from his office from a distance 2000 light years, good for you. I only ask that you repeat it to yourself a few times so you can hear how it sounds before you laugh at me or anyone else who calls BS on this stuff.  👾",7년 전,0,

@yorkthe1,"Gaius Octavius Thurinus like I said don't reply. These are theories not facts, it's what someone believes. Question did they get any samples to prove what they're claiming?",7년 전,1,
@گایوساکتاویوستورینوس,"It's not ""what someone believes"" -- it's a scientific consensus.  That means that these theories are substantiated by science. If we were capable of travelling to other planets, we would likely experience the things this scientific consensus proposes.   The difference between belief and consensus is pretty clear. You can believe in a god. You can believe that the Earth is flat. Science doesn't support it, but you can believe it nonetheless. A consensus is formed on a concrete scientific basis that provides insight on what may or may not be happening. Something that we've already observed or know about.  As for ""looking thru a huge telescope"" -- most of these exoplanets are discovered through observatory initiatives. These discoveries are then refined. Typically with the use of a spectrometer, which can now be used for real chemical analysis.   We don't need a sample, much in the same way as we don't need a sample of the Sun to understand that it's hot, or understand how the vacuum of space works, or understand that other galaxies exist. Scientific process doesn't operate solely on physical evidence. If it did, you wouldn't enjoy most of the liberties you do today.  Boiling down something so important as planet classification as ""looking through a telescope"" is uneducated. It's also wrong.",7년 전,3,

@گایوساکتاویوستورینوس,"yorkthe1 That isn't the case at all. The first exoplanet was hinted at as early as the 1920s. The scientific community theorised that they existed. Unsurprisingly, thanks to that hypothesis, the first exoplanet was discovered in the 80s. Callback to the fact that you don't need concrete evidence to substantiate a discovery. That example of yours wasn't a ""scientific fact"" -- it was a void in knowledge due to lack of instruments and scientific capability. A void that was already being filled with theories and conjecture. So... uh... no, but nice try.  Speaking of which -- we now have those instruments. We have the capability. Ergo, we are able to find these exoplanets and assess their content. You clearly know nothing about astronomy. You know nothing about the method, and you know nothing about the practise. Please read up on spectrometers. Please read up on the processes involved in locating and classifying an exoplanet. While you're at it, prove that we're ""lost"". List these scientists that seem to think that exoplanets don't exist. Link their peer-reviewed papers. I can guarantee you won't find even one.  If you can't be bothered, don't reply. This idea of yours that exoplanets are all somehow fake is a theory, not a fact. It's what you believe. Question -- do you have any clue what you're babbling on about, or is it playing devil's advocate for the sake of playing devil's advocate?

@AStrangeTree,"Well, if it inhales CO2, it almost certainly wouldn’t be in the same way we “inhale” oxygen. What I mean by this is we use oxygen as an oxidizing reagent because O2 is at a high energy level, and can mix with other compounds at a relatively high energy level (like glucose) to give off a lot of energy. CO2 is a kind of “dead end” molecule, in the sense there isn’t an exploitable lower energy state to generate energy for an organism. Thats why plants use CO2 to store energy by converting it to glucose, and not to release energy like we use oxygen.  Tldr: if the species “inhales” CO2, it would also need to inhale a sufficient oxidizer as well",7년 전,0,

Life arose in the waters and the land. Some died, some changed. Hundreds of millions of years passed. A meteor smashes into the Earth and causes one of many great extinctions. Still not perfect. But, good news, we're not actually around yet. Anatomically modern humans don't show up until around 200,000 years ago. When the conditions were right.  So, in other words, we're here because the planet was in the right condition for us to emerge.

I love all things space geek and am a sponge when it comes to this stuff. I always question what we are told as scientists often say they aren't always sure about anything. So are all the facts just theories or are some actual facts? We don't know enough about our own solar system and even our own planet, so how can scientists say what's happening on planets we can't see? Sorry for long post. Just very interested and confused. Keep up the good work and videos. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍",7년 전,0,

@kiirakunn,"Mixtape Dropper you have to keep in mind these are all theories. None of this is 100% sure. They have the technology and very good team of scientists to assume what is happening on planet just by observing it from space. Knowing the temperatures is probably calculated by how far the planet is from their star, etc. Also they could send some little thing to fly and collect info on the planet as a one way mission, not sure. Just my guesses. But just like alot of things in space its guessing. Even the title of this video has word ""can"" in it indicating uncertainty. Then again, this channel is extremely kid friendly and leans more to fantasy side, not scientific one.",7년 전,3,
@HaggardPillockHD,"Zooey ! You actually have no idea what you're talking about.  For starters, we do not have the tech to send probes (or ""little things"") to exoplanets or other bodies beyond our solar system.

The iluminat makes clones and demons inhabit them . The earth is not a ball. Jesus is Lord and savior. The only protection from these fallen angel deceivers pretending to be aliens to cover up the fact that they r interdimentional  demons . The ancient aliens are ancient demons.  they freemasonluminato. has made an anti creation model. to purposefully take GOD . The creator out of the model. to make an evolution coincidental big bang model to fool everyone into a false construct of reality were god doesnt exist. to make u doubt god. and Jesus .  to make u an athiest liberal brainwashed consumer sheep.... The earth is flat and Jesus died for ur sins for equivalent exchange to allow u into heaven as a new creation..... gravity is a lie. Density is why ur on the ground.  your body is denser than air.  the Fallen angels. and the devil . they deceived the world into the perception of a godless universe .  to fool u into a slave and steal ur soul. The earth is flat motionless and domed like the bible describes.  Jesus is Lord and savior. truth n light . so his opposite is The master deceiver capable of this huge lie. is the litteral devil himself. The earth is flat.  certain angels were thrown out of heaven like Lucifer. onto the flat earth ENCLOSED.  to keep them in .  Density is why ur on the ground. .. Jesus died for ur soul . his life was equivalent exchange . to pay for ur sins. to allow u to be reborn into heaven.  The earth is flat.  The moon gives off light opposite of the Sun . cold rays. if they taught  this it would prove a balance. if a balance was proven .their would need to be some one that put that balance into being. a CREATOR.    The earth is flat.  Jesus loves u . Ancient aliens are ancient demons. ur soul is angelic .and ur body .is demonic. Jesus is Lord and savior my protector and the only way thru the firmament . . we as humans are not accidents. we r far from it. we are all . subspecies of god. we r what a cat is to a lion . us to god. . as subspecies of God's. we r creators. and or destroyers. only on earth can u be both creator and destroyer . . but after earth . u can only be one. and angel or a demon. . Jesus is the way the truth and light.  seek Jesus in these end days.   he is protection,7년 전,0,

@RobinsonLaneScaryNed,"Extremely simplified explanation here:  When light reflects or passes through objects in space, analysis of said light can show that certain colours/wave lengths are blocked or dimmed. What's blocking the light is the protons/electrons of elements. Certain elements block certain colours with certain proton/electron movements. One made up/watered down example; red and blue do not show up as much as the other colours. Oxygen has been know to block red and blue. Therefore, there is a lot of oxygen in/on what we're looking at. From there, scientists can gauge other things, like temperature, based on proximity to the planets host star, and weight/density, based on the speed at which it orbits its star, etc.  Edit: A lot of nerds will want to burn me at the stake right now for butchering the accuracy of this system of analysis, but it gives a good idea of how we get information from intergalactic star systems.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@raidermaxx2324,"Cool vid, but I just want to address the point that unimaginable “sea monsters” could exist on water worlds that are the size of mars and larger... this would probably not happen due to the crushing gravity that exists at the bottom of the ocean.. as you mentioned, this would form a type of water, called “Ice-7” which is harder than granite..  That said, life as we know it, needs the 3 things, chemistry, energy transfer, and water.. because of the ice-7 forming a barrier between the liquid of the ocean, and the minerals and energy that would normally transfer into the ocean via “chimney” smokers and volcanos, cannot exist as we know it.. therefore in an ocean that is derived of minerals such as carbon and even more so, plate tectonics, it’s highly unlikely life as we know it would evolve...  So why then, if the oceans under the ice cap of the moon Europa, are 60 km deep in some places, wouldn’t this Ice-7 and crushing gravity also prevent life as we know it? Well no, due to the fact that Europa is the size of our moon, meaning the gravity is 1/10th of ours on earth due to its lower mass.. therefore, even at 60 km deep, the pressure in the salt water ocean that is hypothesized to exist on this Jovian body, is akin to the pressure felt at 11 km deep in our very own oceans.. This is why, we are sending probes to Europa to survey and eventually submarine the depths...",8년 전,0,

Someone (Edit, Galen Diamond) also mentioned dead stars that are diamonds and the way it happens is by Stellar Nucleosynthesis where hydrogen gets fused into helium, the star runs out of hydrogen fuel and stars fusing helium, and so on, up until carbon. Then these stars blow off their outer layers in their death throes, further heating and compressing the carbon, resulting in a dead core that is a diamond the size of a planet.

Just because america is america doesn't mean america make technology but,the scientst do.  All america as gouverment can do is sponsoring.  If you consider hitler as smart then you must be dropped on your head. If you think killing innocent people is smart then you must be a lunatic. Politics dont have much to do with technologi/science beside sponsoring. You can bring your racial talks that shows me how smart you really are.  Some scientst or should i say sadistisch doctors where pro nazi but that does'nt mean they where educated by the nazi's. Highway/rockets/child support  Where great things to sponsor so they did.  But in the end they had debt and, lost the war because they where to weak to war.",7년 전,0,

@iamgroot4611,"I've always doubted that they could even correctly say what a planets ""atmosphere"", what the planet surface, etc is really made off. Or that they can know what a storm's wind speed is. And I truly believe there is NO way anyone could know that kind of stuff no matter how advanced the technology of their equipment is. It's just guess work. They can't even figure out a majority of things on earth that they can touch and test with equipment first hand.   (I'm guessing no begins the posts from people that are gonna act intelligent & try to sound all smart like they know what their talking about & have it all figured out. But they actually won't know what their talking about with no true science to back their ideas or statements up with.  I recommend they go find that ""missing link"" they've been looking for for a  thousand years, yet haven't  found because it doesn't exist.

As for space exploration, that's assuming we survive to achieve the technology capable of doing it ( not likely with all of the war and our planet dying at an exponentially faster rate ).

@ForeverFlame88,"One cannot measure distances of greater than about 25 light-years using parallax since we don't know EXACTLY where (not only does the Earth go around the sun, the sun orbits the galactic center, etc. so determining exactly where Earth was 180 days ago is all the more difficult) the Earth was sixth months ago using the Earth's ORBIT around the sun as the base of the triangle. Just ONE light-year has an angle of ONLY 0.017 degrees already! If u think Red Shift measures/accurately gauges distances 2 distant objects, u need 2 know that red shift is QUANTIZED (only at certain energy levels), absolutely ruling out the Dopper Effect explanation, may b caused by tired light, (Light may lose energy naturally as it travels and remember that since light has mass, it is affected by other objects with mass. A solar sail works because light has momentum and therefore mass. If you believe light has energy, and energy is mass according to Einstein, then you believe light has mass.) objects moving @ right angles to us, & when gravity is acting on an object. There's this object moving TOWARDS us that is still red-shifted!!! There's this pair of objects connected with radically different redshifts that proves the big bang wrong. In addition, in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, near the center, where the velocities are extremely high, the red-shift is somehow washed out. This strongly implies that strong motion DESTROYS the redshift, instead of creating it. A galaxy has even been measured to have a DECREASE of one quantization in redshift, which should be impossible if the universe is expanding and the redshift is due to the doppler effect. YouTube: Stretching the Heavens: A New Cosmology. Google Science vs Evolution Pathlights. We can barely make out PLUTO with our best telescopes and yet we are told astronomers have detected a planet 1,300 or so light-years away?! Think about it. The object MAY be thousands of light-years away but we cannot measure those distances. We are simply TOO TINY, to put it humbly. And yes, there may be no such thing as deep space. Perhaps the ""far away"" objects are just super-tiny. It's possible. How could we know the difference? The Cosmic Background Radiation is much too cold to have come from the supposed Big Bang. It actually comes from stars. The heavens shall pass away with a great noise... interesting how from a biblical perspective, the big bang is in the future, where the heavens will be passed AWAY, instead of in the past, where it supposedly created the universe.",8년 전,0,

@nisteven,"First lets explain something basic. When light hit something, it absorbs different aspect of light and reflect others parts. Ever single element on the periodic table reflect a different combination  of the color spectrum. When Light from a sun hits a planet, a good amount of the light is reflected back into space. Which then travels across the galaxy.  With are instruments we can catch a hold of this light as it pass by us. Of course this light is to dim for are eyes to see it. We use a device called a  spectrometer. Spectrometers take a signal from whatever they are looking at (whether it is a rock, or a cloud or a whole planet or a star or a galaxy or a nebula, etc.) and spread the signal out into its components.  Of course they spectrometer that work with invisible light such as x-rays. Which can give us much more info, that visible light cannot.  The density of a planet can be found out. Because ever planet pulls the sun just a tiny bit. So base on how it pulls the sun it revolves tells us it density.  I stop here, so I dont go on forever, but we have hundreds of different ways we use to tell how other planets are. One last thing, the hardest thing to do is to actually find a planet. We believe they billions of planets, within this galaxy and yet we only found thousands, because of how hard they are to find. Yet once they found, it a lot easy to figure out how they work.",8년 전,1,

@MrDulguN,"HOW SCIENTISTS CAN TELL WHAT A PLANET IS MADE OF: Sorry for yelling. Elements (iron, oxygen, gold, carbon...) are made of atoms. Atoms have a central, positively charged nucleus made of protons and neutrons. Atoms also have negativity charged electrons that orbit the nucleus. These electrons exist in energy levels around the nucleus. Elements have different numbers of electrons depending what element it is. If light hits an atom, an electron will absorb the energy of the light and change energy level.  It will then drop back down to its original energy level by emitting energy in the form of light. This emitted light is equal to the difference in energy between the two energy levels. We can detect this light that comes from other stars and planets. We can use a machine called a Spectrometer to observe the light. The colour of the emitted light will change depending on how much energy it has (blue has the most energy and red, the least). A Spectrometer will display these different colours on a screen with the relevant colours lit up. Because elements have different numbers and arrangements of electrons, the pattern of colours on the screen is different for each element.  We have performed tests in labs to see what the patterns for different elements are. So, we need only match the pattern from the light of the distant planet to a pattern of a specific element or group of elements.  This is simplified but gives a good idea of what happens,",8년 전,16,

@nihil1,"Using spectra. Spectrum is a decomposition of light into its frequencies (colours, if you like). When you look at spectra you can see ""spikes"" and ""valleys"" that indicate emission and absorption by certain elements and/or compounds - the same way people do here to investigate gases in labs. We combine this with our knowledge of the parent star to know the temperature and the phase of the elements found. Spectra can also reveal a lot of other things. For example, widening of spectral lines can be indicative of strong star winds, because the Doppler shift caused by the gas movement. Though this is probably not what people used to propose those fast winds in the video - they probably come from atmospheric models that take into account temperature differences.",8년 전,0,

@MrMarinus18,On that ocean world; the life in the ocean comes from sunlight which only directly affects the first few dozen meters of water. Making the ocean much deeper won't make it anymore alive and will in fact do the opposite. The shallow seas on earth can spawn more life than a practically bottomless ocean. Since photosynthesis can't happen past the Photic zone going any deeper won't make more life but just make it further disperse. (To be clear; I know of the geothermal vents that support life without the need for the sun but while it's very interesting and can tell us a lot about evolution. The amount of life that subsists on that is negligible compared to everything else that is dependents on solar energy.),8년 전,0,

@skinnykin1,I've always thought it would be interesting to find an alien race who came to our solar system to populate Titan. These creatures could be used to those frigid temperatures and actually use the liquid methane like we use water in their physiology.  I know it would be strange but imagine some advanced alien race like this existing. They could live at our doorstep but we would never have anything to do with them. To them we would be living on a hellish planet of molten rock(ice) with scorching temperatures.We could never trade with them or be near them.   I wonder how different alien life could be if the theory that all life needs liquid water is not true and that something like liquid methane could be used instead. I realize the properties are very different than water but it is interesting to me.,8년 전,0,

Thats why our sky is blue, and other elements/ compounds have the same effects but with different colors.

@TKDWILSON,"@kyrie curry 230 throw a paper air plane on a bus.  Its motion will not be different than if you and the whole system were at a ""stop"".  You just dont understand basic physical science.  Your answer about the crazy tall bus YES in a vacuum.  You are pushing against the air in your example and the air is the friction that is acting against the bus.  Since the object you drop has to deal with friction of the air, once you let go of it from the chopper, it starts to slow, much live the bus would if you stopped pushing the gas.  Now, if you were in a frictionless environment then the bus would never slow down, and if there were no air particles for the dropped object to hit on the way down to slow it, then it would land exactly straight down into the bus, regardless if you are dropping a feather or a bowling ball.  I really hope you can let me or someone help you understand the basic science of stuff like this.  When things speed up, slow down, or change direction that is called an acceleration.  Everything that is not speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction you are not going to fell the motion (but you can feel the minor changes of direction if there are bumps in the road at all as you slightly change up down etc, so if you are going 1000mph on a jet, or 600mph there is no way for you to tell inside the jet without looking at a sensor or out a window).  So the earth can revolve 1000 mph and unless it speeds up, slows down, or changes direction you wont notice.  The earth can go around the sun at 65,000 miles per hour and you wont notice without an acceleration.  It can orbit our galactic center at 480,000 miles/hr and you wont notice because it never sped up, slowed down or changed direction.",8년 전,12,

If a plane does that ie leave a surface (carrier) going at 1000mph and is independent itself for 10hrs , goes into the air and starts moving at half the earth's speed isn't it gonna result in different times for similar distances since the ground is moving.?.

@moregasmthepowerful2959,"HOW SCIENTISTS CAN TELL WHAT A PLANET IS MADE OF: Sorry for yelling. Elements (iron, oxygen, gold, carbon...) are made of atoms. Atoms have a central, positively charged nucleus made of protons and neutrons. Atoms also have negativity charged electrons that orbit the nucleus. These electrons exist in energy levels around the nucleus. Elements have different numbers of electrons depending what element it is. If light hits an atom, an electron will absorb the energy of the light and change energy level.  It will then drop back down to its original energy level by emitting energy in the form of light. This emitted light is equal to the difference in energy between the two energy levels. We can detect this light that comes from other stars and planets. We can use a machine called a Spectrometer to observe the light. The colour of the emitted light will change depending on how much energy it has (blue has the most energy and red, the least). A Spectrometer will display these different colours on a screen with the relevant colours lit up. Because elements have different numbers and arrangements of electrons, the pattern of colours on the screen is different for each element.  We have performed tests in labs to see what the patterns for different elements are. So, we need only match the pattern from the light of the distant planet to a pattern of a specific element or group of elements.  This is simplified but gives a good idea of what happens,",8년 전,15,

You are basically trying to discredit all sources other than your own mind, yet you lack the knowledge to create any kind of educated statement and take data from random sources when it fits your needs.   The device you're using to comment here sends electromagnetic signals out.  Depending on the frequency, many of those signals follow the curvature of the earth.  There are so many things that take into account the curvature of the earth.    The reason why planes don't have to take into account the rotation of the earth is because the planes move through air.  The air is rotating with the earth just like everything else.  If I jump into the air am I going to suddenly start moving at 1000 mph?  Of course fucking not.  Are you seriously trying to say that no one has ever flied planes or dropped bombs when you can literally see it happening at airports every single day?  What the fuck is going on in your head.    They obviously took into account the earth spinning when going to and coming back from the moon.  Who the fuck told you they didn't?  If you leave earth, you will be orbiting the sun at 514000 mph or whatever you said.  There are so many reference planes and gravitational effects that you must take into account when traveling through space.  Ever looked at the sun or the moon?  They're round are they not?  Why the fuck would the earth follow some separate set of laws of physics?  Gravity exists, and because it exists large masses must gather in spheres as no known materials can support the loads associated with keeping an earth sized object from collapsing on itself.

If you could somehow hover in the air inside a bus you will not move to the back of the bus.  Movement between you and the bus requires a force.  Force is generated by an acceleration.

The Earth is HUGE, so it seems flat but if you look into the horizon and the ocean side you can visibly see the slight curve of the horizon, why is that a thing?

All does questions can be answered if the earth is round. 24 hours it takes for the Earth to make a full spin cycle, 365 to make a full cycle around the sun, but it's not exact that's why sometimes it's 366, the days are longer in the summer because the planet is closer to the sun while in winter it's farther.

If a planet is far more massive, but less dense, then it is more likely to be a gas giant, and is probably composed of lighter elements, like hydrogen and helium surrounding a rocky or molten metal core.  Determining densities is a lot trickier because we need to know the mass and volume of the planet.

@PellosMaxhthc,"Kyrie Curry 230  It's sad how it is 2017 and we still have uneducated people like you. If you knew anything about mass, the distribution of mass or Newton's law of universal gravitation you wouldn't be asking for proof that the earth is round. So here is the simplest proof for your small brain:  1. The Moon: Aristotle (who made quite a lot of observations about the spherical nature of the Earth) noticed that during lunar eclipses (when the Earth’s orbit places it directly between the Sun and the Moon, creating a shadow in the process), the shadow on the Moon’s surface is round. This shadow is the Earth’s, and it’s a great clue on the spherical shape of the Earth.  2. Varying Star Constellations: After returning from a trip to Egypt, Aristotle noted that “there are stars seen in Egypt and Cyprus which are not seen in the northerly regions.” This phenomenon can only be explained if humans were viewing the stars from a round surface. The farther you go from the equator, the farther the ‘known’ constellations go towards the horizon, and are replaced by different stars.  3. Look at Other Planets: There are certain characteristics all planets have, and it will be quite logical to assume that if all planets behave a certain way, or show certain characteristics – specifically if those planets are in different places or were created under different circumstances – our planet is the same. All of our observations show planets are spherical (and since we know how they’re created, it’s also obvious why they are taking this shape). 4. The Center of Gravity: Consider a sphere. Since a sphere has a consistent shape, no matter where on it you stand, you have exactly the same amount of sphere under you. (Imagine an ant walking around on a crystal ball. From the insect's point of view, the only indication of movement would be the fact the ant is moving its feet. The shape of the surface would not change at all.) A sphere's center of mass is in the center of the sphere, which means gravity will pull anything on the surface toward the center of the sphere (straight down) no matter where it's located.",8년 전,18,

@Taricus,"First, we can figure out the mass of the planet by its orbit around its star.  You would use Kepler's 3rd law of planetary motion.  A terrestrial planet would have a very different mass than a gas giant.  Then, if you're pretty lucky with the star system being edge on so that the planet passes in front of the star, you could use spectroscopy to examine the light.  Each element and molecule has its own wavelengths that it will absorb (has to do with the electron obits).  Think of it like a chemical fingerprint.  The planet's atmosphere will absorb some wavelengths of light, depending on what makes it up.  You take that data and you compare it with the wavelengths of  light from the star alone.  Subtract out the parts that the stellar atmosphere absorbs, and then you get a good indication of what it is like.  Some planets have even had wind speeds determined by looking at the doppler shift in the absorbsion lines.    Gerry is right more or less, but the math really isn't all that hard.  The planetary motion one is just G(M+m)P^2=4(pi)a^3...  It's easier than it looks.  G is the gravitational constant and always the same.  M is the mass of the star, little  m is the mass of the planet.  P is the period of its orbit in earth years. everyone knows pi, and 'a' is just its distance from the star (in astronomical units, so just how many times earth's orbit is it).  So, if you know how long it takes to orbit its star and how far away it is...  You know the mass of the star.  You just solve for little m and you can tell if it's earth sized and rocky or a big gas giant and work from there :P  The spectroscopy you can do by just comparing the image to spectroscopic images of different elements (or have a computer do it for you, because it will go faster).

@luuk341,"Well, it starts with watching a planet transition in front of its star. From the amount of light from its host star it blocks we can determine its size pretty well. Then from its size we can determine its mass. We can then also determine how far away the planet is from its star and we can find out its orbital speed. From the mass, size and distance from its star we can make an educated guess as to what the planet is composed of( i.e. rocky, gas or ice) Temperatures on the surface can be estimated since we know how far the planet is from the star and how much energy the star puts out over a given amount of time.    Atmospheres are a tricky subject but there are techniques where light absorption, diffusion and scattering are used to estimate atmospheric composition.

@MikeSavaiano,"@Kyrie Curry 230: Before I elaborate, I'll begin by saying that my IQ may very well be below-average, so I won't bother taking offense at that. Also, it's fitting that I should mention that I used to be a devout Christian myself (a Roman Catholic, to be exact), who very much wanted to accept as fact, for example, the creation story of Genesis. You can see where I'm going with this; it got to a boiling point where I could not handle the stress (aka cognitive dissonance) that all that [self-]indoctrination was inflecting on me, and I eventually ""blew up"" like a supernova and became atheist. OK, now that I've shared that li'l anecdote, onto what I wanted to say.   Not to purposely be inflammatory, but you apparently must not know the definition of faith, because accepting to be true scientific theories that have been aggressively peer-reviewed before they left the confines of academia and made their entrance into wider society, is nothing near the same as blindly believing in Old Testament fables that were composed by dubious sources and have had the luxury of not having to pass through the filter that is peer review, and which many times are forced onto congregations with no wiggle room for alternative theories.  In addition, scientists always leave the end-product theories of their tested hypotheses open to modification, augmentation and even refutation. Unlike the Law of Gravity, the Big Bang is still but one of quite a few alternative theories that are equally probable at the moment. However, just because we have not yet definitely solved the mystery of how our universe came into existence, doesn't mean that I should just throw my hands up in the air, take the lack of evidence at that particular moment as definitive proof of some vague higher power and proclaim, ""Welp, goddittit, guess we should just give up on those theories"".",8년 전,2,

Many things in life are counter-intuitive. The Earth being a spinning globe is just one of them. Australians being ""upside-down"" is just another.

Flat Earthers don't understand science, they really don't understand physics, they don't even understand the heliocentric globe they try so much to attack.

It's been known since the ancient greeks, just by observing eclipses and looking at the changing stars in the night sky dependant on where they were on Earth at the time.

There is NO reason to lie about the heliocentric globe. Every reason I've been told (To hide God, because they are hiding land, because they want us to feel insignificant, to push atheism and evolution) are BULLSHIT.

Can do demonstrate that it's absolutely impossible for us to have been indoctrinated with facts at school?   Syphons work in a vacuum. That's all the evidence you need for gravity, and since gravity exists, the Earth can be nothing but a ball.  The FACT Polaris can't be seen from everywhere on Earth refutes the flat Earth. The FACT you can tell your latitude by the position of Polaris is proof of a sphere. The FACT there are solar days and sidereal days of different lengths prove the Earth spins on itself while orbiting the Sun. The FACT there are 2 celestial poles, with different stars rotating around them in different directions, is all the evidence you need to show the Earth cannot possibly be flat, but is indeed a spinning ball.   Flattards have NO explanation for the 2 celestial poles. They have to outright deny their existence, for the sole reason that that alone shits on their flattard beliefs.   Flat Earthers WANT the Earth to be flat, as it makes them feel smart, it makes them feel special, it makes them feel as they're in on some secret forbidden knowledge, like they are the few who have been released from the shackles of Rothschild-sponsored indoctrination via the government-endorsed education system. All that gives them a massive hard-on.   I tell you this from experience dealing with them: There is not a single flat Earther I could consider smart. They are unable of understanding simple concepts, like the importance of reference frames, inertia, or how the horizon is not a fucking eye-level.

I know it seems like the globe is some nonsensical bullshit created by scientists to indoctrinate us, but surely what you really want to know is the truth, right? So, if the earth was actually round you would want to know, yes? So hear me out.   This thing you keep mentioning with rockets... rockets do work in a vacuum, and I'll explain. First of all you seem to have a problem with the whole combustion in a vacuum thing, well rockets don't work like your car or a fire that require the oxygen in air to burn, they bring oxygen with them that is used to burn the fuel. Makes sense, right?  Next, you seem to be confused what rockets ""push"" off of in space. I understand this, because this too used to confuse me, but its actually very simple. Imagine that the combustion in the rocket engine is like a big explosion, pushing everything outwards equally, so everything gets pushed away including the rocket and the exhaust gas, however the exhaust gas is much lighter than the rocket and gets pushed at a very high speed, whereas the heavy rocket is only pushed a small amount. However, because this explosion is continuous, and without the drag from air because the rocket is in space, this means over time rockets can be used to achieve very high speeds.  Also, because rockets bring their own oxygen like I said earlier, this makes them burn much hotter so they are much more powerful than a jet engine of similar size, but become very inefficient.  And then there's the thing with the atmosphere rotating at the same speed the earth does. I mean this one's pretty obvious, otherwise we'd be experiencing 1000 mph winds all the time, right? But you seem to have a problem with wind existing in this environment. Well, the atmosphere is a very complicated, which is why the weatherman is always wrong, but most of it comes down to temperature. You know that when air gets hot, it expands and rises, yes? Well on scales such as the earth, this effect is very noticeable. When some section of air is heated more than the surrounding air, such as when the sun is rising, it expands and rises, but this leaves a gap that has less air in it, therefore having a lower air pressure, so cold air from the surrounding area rushes into the gap to fill it and equalize the air pressure. On scales as big as the earth, this simple effect can make large amounts of air move quite fast, and this is what we feel as wind. Almost all other kinds of weather are just really complicated variations on this central theme of ""hot air rises, cold air rushes into the gap.""  Now there's some kind of confusion you have with planes and the rotation of the earth? Well the reason this isn't a problem is because everything on earth is also going around at 1000 mph. So when you jump, you don't fly off west at 1000 mph, because you are already travelling at that speed, and there's nothing to slow you down because the atmosphere is also travelling at 1000 mph with you. So it feels like you're not moving. ""Of course,"" i hear you say, ""If I'm travelling at 1000 mph with nothing to slow me down, why don't i just keep travelling in a straight line and eventually leave the earth?"" Well the answer is gravity. The earth's gravity pulls you back down to the surface. If you were unaffected by gravity, you would indeed simply keep traveling straight at 1000 mph until the earth's surface curved away from you and you were in space, but luckily you are kept on the ground by earth's gravitational pull.  And finally, the whole zooming-in-on-ships thing is wishful thinking and any claims of the effect being a mirage are false as water mirages raise things instead of lowering them; this is the same effect that causes people to be able to see things further than the curvature of the earth would allow, think of them all, the Chicago skyline from Michigan, those salt flats that get flooded by a centimeter, the bedford levels experiment - all over large areas of flat water that acts like a lens, raising the faraway object over the horizon, instead of pulling it under. In any case, the sea is far to choppy for these kinds of effects to work anyway. And flat horizons? Come on, no human who has spent their entire life within the earth's atmosphere has ever seen a curve. People claim to see the curvature from a plane, but they are tricking themselves into thinking that. Again, everyone is vulnerable of wishful thinking, even people who think the earth is round. It's a physical impossibility to see a curved horizon without going so far away that you can see from edge to edge. Think about it... if you're in a plane and you think you see a curved horizon, imagine the plane was removed. Now, if you turn around, how does that curve continue? Surely that would mean the horizon was lower on on one side of you than the other, which would only occur if you were actually in space looking at the earth at a funny angle, which is impossible. No, on a ball the horizon is always flat. It's just perspective.  Did I answer your questions correctly? Would you like to know anything else? I'm open for civil discussion, and I hope you are too because I think it's always good to look at things through other people's perspectives, because I might be wrong, and so might they.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@kalamrashid78,"Will Porter Now I did not research on this and I CBA but anyways I'm going to link my physics and chemistry skills to this... methane is CH4 so it is a hydrocarbon. reason why we can get methane from dead plants and animals is because they contain lots of hydrogen, we have 80% of water in our body which contains hydrogen. Carbon can easily be made through waste products of respiration, an essential reaction for all living organisms. We get oil underground because the dead plants and animals have been squashed and heated under many layers sediments. Due to the heat, the hydrogen in their body can react with any remaining carbon in their body or most likely the carbon most rock contains (due to reacting with air or acid rain). In titan, the air seems very polluting and toxic so most likely contain a lot of carbon (it is acidic) also its very rocky XD. And hydrogen.... well idk but ik that the sun is a mass of huge amount of gas where hydrogen and helium are reacting so I think the hydrogen is in the air. And I guess they just react? Even though its under low pressure. Yknow what... I might research and get the full answer but hey, I tried my best?",8년 전,1,

@Nictator42,"The deep ocean might be too deep and large for life to start on its own there. Since the bottom is made up of ice-VII, it is likely that deep sea thermal vents will act very differently or not appear at all. It is a large planet, so the core is probably still liquid, but if the parent star is only second generation, it might not have many heavy metals in the core. Also, any heavier elements necessary for life are likely extremely dilute in the massive ocean. Finally, any foreign meteors and comets that might bring complex chemicals like amino acids or phospholipids are likely to sink and get stuck in the uninhabitable transition layer at the bottom of the ocean. Life on Earth likely started in shallow tide pools or estuaries with lots of chemistry going on. Perhaps if already fully formed space borne proto-bacteria were introduced by a comet or if enough phospholipid bubbles formed over time and slowly trapped heavy elements and complex chemicals, then life might've started there on its own, but it would be challenging. It would also be a very precarious ecosystem as well, since any nutrients that found their way to the ocean floor would likely be lost forever and completely removed from the planet's carbon cycle. To combat that, I can foresee large colony-like structures that internally recycle their own carbon forming in that ocean. Like some cross between a slime mold, a microbial mat, and man-o'-war. Since those things would be colony structures, there likely wouldn't be much of an upper bound on their size, so they could in theory become kilometers wide if enough nutrients existed in the ocean to sustain organisms of that size. Perhaps dead colonies could become almost like floating islands. You can really go wild with what might be possible. Just getting life started there in the first place is probably the hardest part.

The planets around them are then given a lower-case letter in order of discovery: Tau Boötis b, 55 Cancri d.  However, if it is a planet, it will be named based on which satelite found them Kepler, the space telescope which spotted the new find, is examining star clusters, and each new star it discovers within them is named after  it: hence Kepler 22, the 22nd star with a confirmed planet found by the telescope: 22b is the first planet in that system",8년 전,2,

@lmelior,"A lot of these hypotheses come from physics models of the planetary system.  There are generally a lot of assumptions involved, and most of the time we just assume the planets are roughly similar to our own, though in different places relative to the star.  We have varying levels of confidence when it comes to different measurements.  For example, many of the planets detected early on are ""hot Jupiters"" detected by the parent star's wobble.  The characteristics of the wobble allowed us to predict with very high confidence the mass of the planet and its distance to the parent star, and the measurements of the star's light allow us to estimate its size with high confidence as well.  These planets are generally so massive that the only similarly massive object we know of is a gas giant, so we start extrapolating from there (i.e. the proximity means it's almost certainly tidally locked, a Jupiter-like atmosphere would create massively strong storms, etc.).  If all we know is the mass, though, it could technically be some solid, ultra-dense chunk of some strange matter.  In contrast, the TRAPPIST-1 planets (and all of the other 3000+ planets discovered by the Kepler mission) were detected when the planets passed in front of the star, dimming its light ever so slightly.  This gives us the physical size of the planet.  Combined with the ""wobble"" measurement, we also get its mass.  Those two measurements allow us to calculate the average density, which in turn gives us insight into what the planet might be made of.  There are still many assumptions beyond that, though.  As the many videos have said, once JWST or one of the new generation of giant telescopes come online, we'll be able to detect specific elements through spectroscopy.  The only exoplanets directly imaged so far have been very large, but that will change soon enough!",8년 전,1,

@Hellion232Z,So does ANY person in a room with two light sources. The assertion that we only have one shadow on earth is just stupid. I'm 30 seconds into the video and I am already in the comments complaining.,8년 전,26,
@brodielogue8274,Hellion232Z he's talking about if it was just a sun listen to him and mabey u won't sound like the stupid one,8년 전,6,
@Hellion232Z,"I did listen to him, maybe you didn't. He DOESN'T say it's only when there is one sun. I'll quote the video here...  'Let's begin with shadows, your shadow on earth is always alone and you're always used to seeing it this way as it follows you around during the day. You're also used to seeing everybody else with just one shadow.'  While I agree he WAS trying to explain it with suns. He states that YOUR SHADOW ON EARTH IS ALWAYS ALONE.",8년 전,6,

@studyisfun4379,that isn't about the mysterious four suns that dawn on all footballers. That is actually because of the floodlights that are bright enough to form somebody's shadow. This is the most elementary principle in light that every opaque object forms a shadow.,8년 전,0,
