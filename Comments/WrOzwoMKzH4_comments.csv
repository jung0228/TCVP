Hand Mr. Yang a sharp knife.   Step 3:  Leave and return in 36 minutes.  All 700 pounds of your beef will be fully cut up and ready to wrap for your freezer.   Mr. Yang won't even break a sweat during the entire process.    Even if you pay him only 10 cents per pound to for butchering the entire animal, he is still making about $125 per hour for his time.

Buy some beef suet to grind with the meat scrapes. Makes the best hamburger. Don't use game fat. Game fat isn't very good. Plus most big game animals don't have much fat. If you freeze the meat alittle before you make hamburger it grinds easier. Leg bones I freeze for my dogs. I've been butching my own game for 37 years. I also age my meat if it's in the right conditions temperature. Elk I let hang for a good week. Or more. Enjoy your meat!",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@j.r.777,"Wow, very cool video! I was born and raised in San Diego but in 2003, right before I turned 30 years old, I moved to a very rural area of Colorado that is predominantly an agricultural community. A majority of people out here don’t buy meat in the grocery store. Instead, most people buy either a whole cow or half a cow and then keep the meat stocked up in their chest freezers along with chicken, pork, deer, elk or anything else they want to eat. I have always been curious how a butcher breaks down a cow after it is harvested. I am absolutely fascinated by this video. Thank you for making this video and showing how everything is done. This was a very educational video and I have a whole new found respect for the butchers that process these delicious animals!",4년 전,1,

@kimmiewise1044," @Penguin-kr9do   Please look at my comment where I cite research that shows that nerve cells are merely a vehicle for the actual mechanism that causes pain, that being action potentials. Plants contain action potentials that function identically to animals meaning that plants feel pain.   I would prefer you read and respond to my comment before repeating something I already debunked. Thanks :)",4년 전,4,
@Penguin-kr9do," @kimmiewise1044  I don't see any other comments by you. It's probably blocked because it contains a link.  Either way, I don't need to see your research. ""Action potentials"" have nothing to do with pain. Pain is a feeling, which happens in the brain. Nerve cells carry signals to the brain, where the brain interprets those signals as pain. Plants cannot feel pain because they don't have complex nervous systems and a brain.",4년 전,1,
@kimmiewise1044," @Penguin-kr9do  Action potentials have everything to do with pain unless you are just willfully ignorant on now nerve cells and the brain function in humans and animals.   “How do neurons transmit signals throughout the body? One part of this transmission process involves what is known as an action potential. An action potential is part of the process that occurs during the firing of a neuron. During the action potential, part of the neural membrane opens to allow positively charged ions inside the cell and negatively charged ions out.  This process causes a rapid increase in the positive charge of the nerve fiber. When the charge reaches +40 mv, the impulse is propagated down the nerve fiber. This electrical impulse is carried down the nerve through a series of action potentials.” Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, FAAN   Action potentials are the electronic pulses that our brain interprets as pain as any middle school biology students could probably tell you.   Those action potentials have been found in plants via applying anesthesia and showing that when put under plants do not move. Meaning that, identical to the animal nervous system, plants have action potentials that process and react to information as a human brain would.   Meaning yes, by scientific discovery, we now know that plants can feel pain.   If you are wondering where the “brain” of the plants are we are still working on the exact nature of this discovery so it will take a while for that piece of research to come out but many botanists predict that it would be the root of the plant.   Have fun eating potato brains you absolute psychopath! (This is a joke don’t reee).",4년 전,1,
@Penguin-kr9do," @kimmiewise1044  You're an absolute moron. Action potential are high school physics, not neuroscience. They are the very simple mechanism for transmitting electricity. They are nothing more than a tiny battery. They have nothing to do with pain and are used for the transmission of all electric signals in the body.  Please stop using your extremely rudimentary understanding of physics to act like you know how the brain works.",4년 전,3,

In the last 10 or 15 years I have purchased 4 whole beef (cows, if you don't understand the term ""beef"") and had them slaughtered (that means killed) and butchered.

@shinbehindtheveil6805," @brians_beanwater8048  Never in this Universe, as it is, I'd compare killing a dog to killing a human being. With that said, I agree with you on a certain point - with additional clarification. If I ever saw a well-nourished man killing a dog (or a cat) for reasons not including providing necessary food (obviously, if it's not the case of a homeless person, starving to death) or self defense (in case of an overly aggressive dog attack), I'd consider him/her a psychopath. And if it's not some deep continental region of South-eastern Asia, or China during ""The Great Famine"" - people then and there were and are struggling for a proteins sources - hence the bizarre dietary adaptation, which remained in some parts of Asia (especially China) independently of the quantity of ""normal"" food today.  The video is obviously not about dogs or cats. It is a cow - slaughtered for providing necessary nutrients to humans, not on a whim.  You have used the loaded language - trying to impose certain ideology that is so overwhelmingly present all around us: medical and pharmacological professions joined in corruption, mainstream media floods all of our everyday lives with advertisement of a ""healthy life style"" by employing self-proclaimed ""icons and role-models""- healthier than eating store-bought processed junk packed with chemicals and sugar, for sure, but there is nothing healthy in so unbalanced dietary regime.   No wonder we humans crave for and enjoy juicy, fatty, tender steak - and that's universal. Also, no wonder vegans/vegetarians need to take fistful of chemicals - artificially produced supplements - that diet simply lacks essential nutrients (not to mention the taste). And, one more - no wonder ""celebrities"" in mass are used (and abused) as a tool for vegan lifestyle propaganda. Ask me what I think about mental state of the vast majority of those people. Just take one glimpse at the Hollywood empire...  i wish you all the best - not trying to impose you my way of thinking. I will align with Christ. Do whatever suits you best. Leave this skillful man (and the likes of him) do his trade and provide food for us and his family.

@gerardcaccioppo4539,That first piece of meat that you cut up on that cow I cook the whole one of them it's actually called the steamship of beef we cut the round part off and ground that up for hamburger but I'll tell you it was good it took me about 18 hours to cook that over an open fire I just cooked it and then I would do some carving and then I throw it over the other side be ready for carving and that's all I did all through the whole day and I'll tell you the sandwiches that we would make it with Alexa that was a great party we throw it fit a lot of people you'd be surprised when you slice it then but that was a great breakdown on what you did that was really cool today there are really no butchers around anywhere you go to the supermarket it's already broken down to them all they do is slice it into steaks they don't break anything down a lot of them need to go to a place where there's a real slaughterhouse and learn how to do it the right way,6년 전,0,

Nothing is a personal attack about what we try to say, it's only about one subject which is causing a lot of harm. Meat eaters claim it's a personal choice to eat meat and in our opinion there is a lot about that not true. There is a sentient animal victim of your choice. As we can be healthy without, it makes it completely unnecessary to do so. Also it is catastrophic to the world if everyone continues to eat meat. Meat is the leading cause of ocean dead zones, fresh water pollution, deforestation, habitat loss, species extinction, methane, land use, fresh water use and antibiotic resistance. This will have a huge impact on the lives of many people now and in the future. Also this situation we're in is because people had a choice to eat animals which caused those wet markets to exist.

Breaking down a side which is hanging on a trolley hook creates its own issues and strength is a necessity. what he did on the table requires minimal strength. Also almost no one uses a hand saw anymore. That was just for show as most of the work is done with a knife on the cutting block or with the band saw.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@brentwinfield9840,"🐂🐂 5th gen meat cutter here. We own our own custom slaughter and specialty shop.    Couple ideas. Check out Hex armor aprons ect. Not puncture proof, but very good cut proof, and so much lighter.    Clod heart....try this... 1. Cut it in half horizontally.  Call it a mock brisket.  Smoke and cook as such with seasonings for a great way to merchandise.  Carters love it because its lower cost, and so much more tender. Fool proof to cook. 2. Clod heart: take the large tear drop muscle off the top of the seam of gristle  that runs diagonally to use as a steak....the larger of the two muscle of your ranch stk. Butterfly it, nick the larger""top"" piece.  Its now a heart shapped steak to merchandise as a ""sweet heart steak"" try carving initials ect on the top of the butterfly.  #3. Clod heart.  Ok my personal invention.  I call it the TAILGATE roast. I'd love for this critter to take off nation wide.  Ok. Cut your ranch stk out of the clod heart 2 in thick. Flip it face side up. Cut a checker patter almost half way down. Flip it over, turn it 10 °or so and repeat the checker pattern. So each piece is barely held together.  Repeat with a second 2"" piece.     Use twine to tie the two roasts side by side. Smoke, roast ect. Each section pulls apart as a finger food. Like a beefy chicken wing. Dry rub, or marinade...each cut section allows for great penetration of marinade.     Dip each section in sauces. Half ranch, half bbq. For a spicy side add red pepper flakes to avoid the vinegar flavor of hot sauce. Thats our favorite.     Great vid. We do it differently, but the same. Its great to know how to do it manually.  Off grid kinda. I prefer more bandsaw time for spread.  You did great",6년 전,0,

@kimmiewise1044,"Arsalaan H My dude, many other animals use tools to kill and consume other animals. Chimpanzees come to mind in which the first discovery of another animal using tools beside humans were a chimp troop who figured out they could use sticks to dig out bugs and eat them. Since that first discovery, chimps have also been discovered to break large sticks into spear like weapons and hunt other monkeys and EAT THEM ALIVE. We also have carnivorous birds who have used tools to kill their prey AGAIN WHILE THEY ARE STILL ALIVE AND SCREAMING. Dolphins are also reported to use tools for hunting, elephants, sea otters...  In fact, most of these other animals also kill for pleasure. Meaning that they don’t even eat their prey, they just like to kill lower intelligence beings for entertainment and practice. We have record of a species of monkey that broke the femur of another monkey and just watched as their victim laid their in pain until it died. Didn’t even eat it. Just stood there and watched it scream in pain until it died for fun.  It’s honestly a miracle that we have the compassion to kill animals quickly and as painlessly as possible, given what our closest evolutionary relatives do to this very day.",5년 전,0,

Not making mistakes comes with experience, and your tutor should know this and expect a few mistakes.

I do believe its also important to note that he's likely only ever dealing with properly aged meat which makes a massive difference on butchering. Its damn near a crime how little the big markets age the carcasses prior to butchering, but that's the ""time is money"" in economics. :/",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@gregsall5872, @donavanmcelroy6263  would be really hard to guess just because each butcher charges different same with the farmer and the weight of the steer (also pasture raised etc) In Minnesota if you personally buy a full cow it is around 2200-2400 and about 300-400 for processing but you get about 650lbs or so. But from a butcher im sure this is around 4-5k (granted its half a steer),6년 전,23,

@MetzgerFamilyFarms,"Beef estimates.   Amounts and totals will vary by size of animal and market price.      1/4 share of a 1300 pound steer X market price of $1.10.

Equals $406.25  Processing and 1% sales tax will add another $175 for. Total estimated cost of $$581.25  This should yield about 140 pounds of beef for your freezer.  For an average cost of about $3.83 to $4.17 per pound.   This typically produces  1 pkg of two 2” Filets.  3 pkgs of two 1” NY strips 4 pkgs of one 1” sirloin stk 4pkgs of two 1” Ribeyes 45 pkgs of 1lb ground beef A few other steaks and “whole cuts” available are skirt & flank which makes fajitas or can be marinated & grilled.  Roast include Arm, Chuck, Round, & Sirloin Tip.  Brisket and short Ribs for smoking. We have recently been keeping the shank too which is great for beef and noodles.

@cypheri1339," @user-lz7oy7st3p  We are omnivores. It is in our nature to eat both plant-based and animal-based foods. If you raise an animal with kindness, treat it well, give it the best life it could have for the time it is under your care, and slaughter humanely, you are treating that animal with respect. If you go hunting for wild food, you are being respectful if you successfully make a quick, clean kill. Causing the absolute minimum amount of suffering during harvest is how you respect your food. I raise chickens for eggs. I don't want to slaughter my animals because they are not intended as meat birds, but you can bet your butt that I would if my family needed food in hard times. It would hurt my heart to do it, but in the end they have been treated well and lived comfortable lives during their time on this planet. One day in the future, when I have the equipment to do so more easily, I would like to start raising meat birds of my own so that I don't have to buy much (if any) industry-raised meat. Truth is that most animals that are raised for industrial meat production are not treated kindly. I would prefer to be sure that my food at least did not suffer more than necessary.",6년 전(수정됨),16,

@KatieKatouree,HuniiTea no veganism is all about ethics. Plant based is the dietary form of no animal products. Sure it's a free world you can claim to be vegan and gut out an animal but you aren't really vegan you just eat that way. Or it's a means to support your fam.

@huniitea1520," @KatieKatouree   Veganism is simply abstaining from using any animal products, dietary AND/OR even household items like makeup. Most vegans I know who also avoid animal products in everyday items do it purely because they don't enjoy putting animal products in their body or on their body. It's an umbrella term, and again, does not dictate their actual opinion on the killing on animals.  I'm simply correcting since Veganism became such a narrow term these days. It's misleading.",6년 전(수정됨),6,

@ldwithrow08,"A long way from the neighborhood butcher and store keeper when I was a kid. Old Mr Adamson would notice his stock of beef was getting low and fire up hos old pickup. He'd drive out to some farm and talk to the farmer. They would cut a deal on a cow and he'd load in into his truck. He'd load it so the head was to the rear. As soon as the cow settled down he'd take his old Navy Colt .36 cal pistol and shoot it between the eyes. It would fall with the head hanging out of the tailgate and he'd cut the neck veins and the cow would bleed out on the way to town By the time he got home it would have finished bleeding out. He'd hang it head down in the shed back of the store, gut and skin it and let it cool overnight. In the morning he'd break it into  quarters and cut it up and into the meat case it went. There was never any thought of aging or anything. When the neighborhood housewives found out he had fresh beef, they would descend on the place and the cow would be gone in 3 or four days, and it would be back out the country with the pickup. I suppose there was some sort of inspection required but the beef was gone before it could be inspected. This would be about the end of the Truman administration.",7년 전,0,

This comment will put me on some watch at my police station for sure, but I’ll go in depth for clarification: humans are just like most mammals in terms of body parts, as most living things currently on earth originated from a common ancestor. This means that the different cuts of meat that you see here are merely interpretations of the science behind the animal, and therefore simply via the the transverse property of geometric logic, you would be able to get similar cuts of meat on a human.  In other words: the mere fact that we have the science for it opens us up to the possibility of that happening.  The real question is whether anyone is sick enough to do that.

I see more of my former classmates going on to higher education which requires math (such as myself) than going into any field that requires knowledge of how to butcher livestock.   Not to say I'm railing against learning how to butcher--it's pretty neat--and if more schools offered it then all the greater. But math is pretty freaking vital for many career paths whereas knowledge of butchering really... isn't. Even for career paths that don't involve daily application of math, most of those same career paths also don't include butchery so I'm not quite sure why they'd teach it over math given your line of reasoning.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

I personally don't like the hands-on (unless it's the cooking itself), but I'm greatly appreciative of those who do, like the butchers on display on this channel, and many others. Society doesn't move forward without all of its parts.",6년 전,1,
@danpt2000," @Selvyre  yea, don't get me wrong, I do think math is important and great, but beyond basic arithmetic most people don't use anything more advanced in everyday life.  I remember going thru Trig proofs, differential equations even in early high school.  It felt like a fun accomplishment to make it thru those subjects at the time.  Although learning about compounding interest and other stuff does help a lot if you thinking about investing money. I've interacted with people from all walks of life, there are many people who haven't even been exposed to some of the most basic maths that are even taught in 5th, 6th grade. I once met a Manager of a jet engine overhaul and repair facility, who seemed to not even know how a basic line graph/plot works. Some blue collar people might look at us white collar workers thinking we make the big bucks and think we probably don't deserve what we have, but they don't see the years of studying that got us to where we are.",6년 전,0,

@loveluca6981,You Call That a Knife? THIS is a knife ---|===>,7년 전,3,
@SeemsLogical,The knife doesn't look like anything amazing. That's a rubber handle and the steel is probably something stainless. In terms of the materials stainless steel is cheaper than high carbon steel and rubber more expensive than plastic but cheaper than wood. It's probably on the cheaper end of the price spectrum. But even with cheap materials the knife is only as good as how it is maintained and Jason looks to take good care of his knife.,6년 전,0,

@mattw3340,"None of the things you have mentioned equal pain perception. Plants do not have neurons, spinal chords, nociceptors, complex neural structures necessary for perception of pain, let alone brains at all. To suggest responding to stimuli means something has the pain perception capacity of a warm blooded mammal is utterly ridiculous. Not to mention blatantly unscientific. Science demonstrates one thing more clearly than anything mentioned here, and that is the fact that cows are very capable of experiencing pain. As for 'preliminary studies that show plants can...remember stimuli'. There are countless published papers that demonstrate this beyond doubt. It's a scientific fact that plants can remember stimuli. They cannot, however, experience pain or suffering from pain. That isn't even remotely close to the same thing.",6년 전,0,

They are merely vehicles that animals use for the real basis of pain. The real foundation of pain or even feeling is Action potentials and plants have been studied to have identical action potentials to humans and animals. It is these action potentials which is the very core of consciousness in all living things and has lead botanist to theorize that plants not only feel things like pain and joy but to even have a quantitative intelligence.

@jasonferguson4247,"My father was a retired meat cutter. He went to a trade school and worked as a journeyman and apprentice until he was a union certified meat cutter. In my eyes he was an artist. He would order the larger cuts and then cut the meat to order. A meat department can make or break a grocery store. Order too little and customers go elsewhere. Order too much and the store could lose a lot of money. He had to know shopping trends for holidays and regular shopping days. The meat on display had to look good or people wouldn't buy it. He couldn't just cut a steak and just toss it on a tray. He had the best work ethic of any person I've known. Always super clean, wore a dress shirt, pants, shined shoes and tie under his work coveralls. Shaved everyday and kept the hair on his head buzzed so no hair would ever get on the meat. I was able to go to work with him a few times and he ever seemed to take a break. At 60+ years old he never complained about working in a freezer all day or working with a knife with bad arthritis in his hands. He seemed disappointed when I decided to go to the military instead of becoming a meat cutter like him. He never said it but I think he was. I retired from the Army the same month he passed away.

@itsalwayshalloweenexceptwh5118,"+anast dime Most mammals have similar anatomy, similar enough that if you've butchered a rabbit you know how to butcher a cat. It's best not to eat the liver of animals that mainly or only eat animals, so I would suggest you don't eat the liver of cats and dogs. There's an issue with possible vitamin A overdose. I also recommend, if you're going to eat dog, that you get a breed that is specifically used for the purpose as livestock such as the Nureongi aka the Korean Yellow Spitz or the standard sized mexican Xoloitzcuintli, or Xolo for short aka the Mexican hairless dog .  I would advise against kidnapping and eating someones pet, not only is it theft it's also a health hazard since you do not know the health of the animal. They can have parasites, diseases and be on one or more medications. I also advise against eating strays, the parasite risk is quite high and you do not know the health of the animal. It's cheaper and safer to buy cats and dogs that were raised as livestock (if the farmer did his job properly) compared to buying them as pets and getting them checked out by a vet before eating them.",7년 전,1,

I dont get why, people are meat also, we are omnivores so we should eat everything and not these 4 farmed animals that westerns eat only.Cannibalism always existed and in modern days cannibals should be treated with more respect because at the end of the day they are people that just enjoy a nice piece of human body part/organ over a cow or dog meat.Have you ever tried it?",7년 전,0,

@itsalwayshalloweenexceptwh5118,"+anast dime Human flesh is said to taste like pork. I don't have any firsthand experience though. Make sure to get the human flesh donor's consent. If you don't want prion disease do not eat the brain and the viscera. Just because we are omnivores doesn't mean we should eat meat of our own species though, just like in nature with other kinds of animals some species do practice cannibalism and some don't. I've read about it and the scientific consensus is that humans are not by default a cannibalistic species. It's practiced out of religious reasons, in times of war  between tribes as a deterrent, in times of extreme famine out of necessity (north korea for example) and of course the well known scenarios where people get into an accident are stranded in the middle of nowhere and eat the dead to survive. Naturally cannibalistic species will eat their own even if other appropriate sources of food are abundant, but with humans we don't see this except for a few outliers (like that guy in china who ate those people) and the other reasons I've mentioned. But as long as you get the donor's consent I don't care what you do.",7년 전,1,

@itsalwayshalloweenexceptwh5118,"+anast dime From a financial perspective it's much better to eat herbivores and omnivores compared to eating animals like dogs and cats whose diet mainly consists of meat (and with the cat only meat, they are obligate carnivores). We have to feed dogs and cats a good proportion of meat to raise them for food, when it would be easier to cut out the middle man and eat that meat in the first place. Herbivores, like cows for example, can get energy and nutrition out of grass which is something we humans can't do with our digestive system. Cows literally turn grass into beef, something we can't eat into something we can eat. Makes much more financial sense, especially if you have hilly stone studded grassland where humans can't grow crops on.",7년 전,3,

@kirstencleigh3183,"Much of the ""trim"" as he calls it is ground up into ground beef. Ground beef is usually made from all the scrap pieces that are cut to make roasts and steaks more evenly shaped. Sometimes some of the roasts and more obscure pieces are also ground, depending on what the demand is. When I buy a half steer, I end up with about 80-100 pounds of ground beef. The only parts that are actually thrown away are parts that are too tough or unpalatable to be used, like the thick membranes, silverskin, and glands. Everything else is ground up or used for soups and stocks (like bones)",7년 전,0,
@kirstencleigh3183,"b.murphy: Cows are females and are used for breeding and milk, bulls are intact males that are used for breeding, and steers are castrated males used for meat. When you eat beef, it's pretty much always a steer, which means it does have a penis (castration removes the testicles, not the penis). Many random scrap pieces are used for pet treats (bully sticks? dried penis)",7년 전(수정됨),0,

The Porterhouse is from the  chateaubriand end of the tenderloin and the T-bone from the smaller, tapered end. If the chateaubriand is cut into steaks then they're fillet mignons.

I always was so intrigued as to how skillfully the butchers could cut the meat at the seams like that, and was always interested in seeing the process of getting the meat into the cuts we see and buy at the shop. I had watched many times how the last stages were done, but never the full pieces still together, being cut into the smaller ones.",7년 전,0,

Animals do not produce enough B12 naturally they HAVE to eat dirt to get it. So your B12 comes from dirt you idiot. Not to mention many livestock animals have to ALSO get B12 supplements from B12 injections because there is no B12 found in the dirt due to humans chemical fertilizers destroying the B12, so you're most likely getting B12 supplements if you eat meat. Humans also use to get B12 from eating plants that had dirt on it because they were not washed, but now humans wash and sterilize all plant food so the B12 is removed and destroyed.

Then I need to alter the grip in one single cut and that is much harder physically with a glove. Also, my cutting hand rarely comes into contact with the flesh. The glove  on the one hand also protects in case you slice through the glove, you will feel the pressure on the glove first than your own skin first. The cutting hand can only get cut, if you lose your grip and run your fingers over the blade in the case of a slippery handle (pretty rare though). . If you ever try to do fine precision work using a tool with a glove on, it tends not be as good as without the glove. There is just a lot of extra sensory ""things"" going on without the glove.

@thomasmanning829,"I'm the 4th generation of a top quality beef slaughterhouse family. Never in 90 years did we ever slaughter a cow. Only steers and heifers. Cows are mother bovines. Steers are castrated males. And heifers are females but never mothers. The thing is if you butcher a cow you're going to have an old tough animal with low quality meat. Ideally you'll butcher young beef, less than 2 years old. Try feeding lots of grain with plenty of barley for excellent white crumbly fat (as determined in the cooler after butchering). The breed is also very important too. If you think you can butcher a Holstein cow and get anything but hamburger you are mistaken. Cattle are bred for various purposes. Learn about beef breeds (as opposed to milk breeds).",8년 전,0,

@MikhailBakunin,"Quick search says this: One cow is about 1650 lbs (beef cow; dairy are lighter), and of that about 675 lbs is meat. If you ate an 8 oz (half a pound) portion of beef every day, it would take you 1350 days, or more than 3 and a half years, to eat all the meat in one cow. So, one cow could give about half a pound of meat to 1350 people. The size of a beef cow does vary though, so I'd say it probably averages out somewhere between 1000 to 1400 people",8년 전,0,

Don't argue a lot of the important ppl in history were vegetarian or vegan. That was because they could afford it back then.

@sound-iz5ji," @7uci4er  Thank you for answering the question. That's all I was asking. However, that's different though. Cutting up humans for dissection is largely done for science and the medical field, not as a trophy like it is for animals. Humans cutting up animals and calling it art is more akin to a murdering psychopath butchering their human victim and calling it art. Because it's to be proud of what they have done which is the feat of taking a living beings life away. Also, similar to human murder victims, animals did not consent to being killed, nor did they want to be killed. Humans butchering animals and calling it art is almost as messed up as a murderer butchering a human and calling it art because both a animal butcher and a murderer of humans have done it for selfish reasons just to have dominance over another sentient living being. And it's egregiously bad for humans to butcher animals as well because it's not even necessary for us to survive or live healthily.",5년 전,0,

Particularly in cattle, males tend to be very large and sometimes aggressive. Artificial insemination removes all risks involved with keeping a male on the premise. Furthermore, artificial insemination reduces the risk of transmitting diseases. The entire artificial insemination procedure is much more hygienic than natural mating. All the tools and equipment are sterilized both before and after. The entire procedure is altogether a much cleaner and sanitary process.",7년 전,2,

It's not the regular mans fault we mistreat animals to eat in this modern age. Blame commercialism not meat eaters for the horrors of modern meat farms. What works for you doesn't work for everyone.

Parshva, the earliest Jain leader (Tirthankara) whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, lived in the 8th or 7th century BC. He is said to have preached nonviolence no less radically than it was practiced in the Jain community in the times of Mahavira (6th century BC).[16] Between 4th and 1st centuries BCE), ancient Indian philosopher Valluvar, whom modern researchers assume to be of Jain origin, wrote an exclusive chapter on veganism or vegetarianism in his work Tirukkural, emphasizing unambiguously on non-animal diet (Chapter 26), non-harming (Chapter 32), and non-killing (Chapter 33).[17]""  """,8년 전,0,

@sound-iz5ji,"MasterJP28 You're right this is just outright sick and demented. Humans don't need meat to survive. Seeing an animal being cut up into pieces should be seen exactly as seeing humans being cut up into pieces for food. It's not good. Also maybe you shouldn't eat meat, the animal didn't choose to be killed, nor was it necessary. I don't eat meat, so 'we' doesn't apply to me.",7년 전,0,
@MasterJP28,"I personally am a meat eater and won't be changing that anytime soon. I feel like cattle being killed ""not being necessary"" or ""their choice"" is irrelevant. We are predators by nature. Just as a lions eat their pray, we too eat meat, ""we"" as in humans in general. Humans being cut up is not an example that fits this situation. I don't see anyone here advocating cannibalism. While you may feel strongly against eating meat, that doesn't mean that others can't enjoy a butcher at work. This video is showing a professional working on their craft. You also need to take into account that while you may think that avoiding meat is saving animal lives, there are everyday products that actually use animal ingredients such personal hygiene products, contraceptives, liquors, etc. This isn't something we just came up with, it is a practice that has been with us since well before civilization started. Sure it may seem ""primitive"" but so are other things that we do like grooming. Also don't forget the insects that fly or crawl around us. If you kill one, take a moment to think if it was necessary or if they chose to die.",7년 전,5,
@sound-iz5ji,"MasterJP28 It is absolutely relevant. That's like saying it is ok to kill and eat humans because we are predators by nature. Just because it is ok for lions does not mean it is ok for humans. It's not ok to kill and eat humans. And it's not ok to kill and eat animals because it is unnecessary because we don't need meat to survive and they are innocent creatures that want to live and feel pain, humans do it for taste, not survival like lions. We have the ability to stop unnecessary killing and suffering by not killing animals, animals are sentient they feel and think and deserve to be left alone in nature.  If other animals want to kill them that is ok, but as humans we have something that separates us most notably from all other animals and that is our reasoning and intellectual capabilities of our brains, so why not use those reasoning skills to make other decisions in our life that we have called morals and ethics. We have morals. If thought logically and reasonably it is easy to determine that killing innocent animals needlessly is morally wrong, immoral.  We are not lions, that is a terrible excuse to do something, let alone make moral choices. We don't base our morals on lions. They do it for survival, humans do not.  There should be no  animal products. Animals should not be used in any product, that is immoral.  I try not to kill anything, unless I feel that it is directly harming or threatening my life.  Living things come in an order of importance relative to humans. House flies being less important than a cow, cows being less important than a human. All should be left alone. Killing in self defense and self preservation is something that I could see as necessary. Some insects harm or even kill, I should be allowed to defend myself against harm. That is morally consistent with my previous statement.",7년 전,0,

@kevintong4079,During the 60's and 70's we were taught the correct way of cutting up a carcass. It is so sad nowadays it looks so different or is it just the way the butcher is now taught the so called 21 st century way.Our forefathers or I am sure the REAL butcher masters of the good old days know why there is no longer many of the traditional butcher shops around. In our days our training as well as naming the cuts were crytal clear . Nowadays its described so differenty .Example the leg or round used to consist of the following ; shin ; soft shin; thick flank ; topside and silverside . After this is seperated as little trimming is done to ensure that whatever cuts were selected it all has its own unique taste ; texture and uses. We would have all been fired in the way this butcher trims the meat as the owners would go bankrupt. This is what you call wasteage to the minimum to maintain profit margins . Also the whole tenderloin nowadays is what we used to call Fillet steak and fillet steak used to be just a certain part ie the part that is on top of the rump . The balance if the tenderloin is left on the bone to get proper tbones with 'fillet' attached to it .,7년 전,0,

OK you might want to say that, ""Well a cat can't choose but we human can choose!"" To a certain extent, not really. Human body requires a right proportion of amino acid in our diet to grow/survive. To achieve so, we can either pay a lot for veggies in order to achieve the amount and ration of amino acids in non-animal products; or we can pay a lot less to buy a piece of meat which meets the requirement easily.   Not everyone can afford going vegetarian, let alone vegan.   Also, have all the non-animal food product such as veggies, mushrooms, beans, etc. consented to being eaten?",8년 전,1,

Your whole focus is on superficial and inconsequential matters dressed up as something important. You are the rot of affluence. It killed the Roman Empire and probably will be the end of us too.   God has everything to do with sanity and everything else for that matter. God is absolutely central to everything meaningful in life whether you like it or not.

Do you hear your vegetables scream when you crunch them with your teeth? Or did you already kill them horrendously with fire? LoL... Everything you say is simply meaningless and ridiculous. Just know this: The United States is the greatest country in the history of mankind (in every way imaginable) because of three basic things: Christianity, the freedom and protection afforded by the Constitution and Bill of Rights and Capitalism. Those three powerful things and all their ramifications are truly important and relevant to everything.

Don't really want one either. What a headache, eh? In fact, and I'm going out on a limb here, but I don't think anybody alive in America today was ever owned or an owner of slaves.

@mattw3340,"Adrian Elimian But the evidence that this isn't how it is in reality is overwhelming. The published science on captive bolt pistols shows 90% stunning efficacy, when placed in the correct way, by an expert. So even then 10 cows in every 100 are not effectively stunned for slaughter. In reality most people using these aren't experts, aren't in controlled experimental environments, have external pressures (I.e. processing speed matters), and failure rates are much higher. We kill more animals every 2 weeks than we have killed humans in all of the wars throughout our species existence combined. So a 30 in 100 failure rate quickly adds up to a lot of animals suffering. Then consider countless hundreds of hours footage of horrific animal abuse in slaughterhouses, which only ever sees the light of day when someone sneaks in and films secretively. I know two ex killing floor workers personally, one of them is now vegan, both have told me there's no such thing as humane slaughter.

@3Sphere,"This is such an interesting but fallacious argument. Just because there is abuse in the industry is no reason to become a vegan. These are two very different things. The cure for that evil is change, not abandonment of a very nutritious and vital food source for an omnivorous race.   The solution to feedlots and slaughterhouses is a different kind of husbandry. That's where the small farm and grass fed, intensively managed ranch comes in and just like organic farming it is well on the rise. Before 1940 there was no such thing as organic farming because it was ALL organic farming.   I believe we are in the process of going back to that model because people are becoming aware that the chemical and hormone laced, dead food in the supermarket is crap and there is a much healthier way. The positive evidence for this change picking up speed is the fact that organic farmers and responsible ranchers are beginning to make a lot of money and big ag and mega ranching are having a hard time keeping up. The Revolution is already under way.",7년 전,13,
@internettoughguy,+3Sphere  The issue is not just the abuse in the industry. The fundamental concept of raising sentient beings to be slaughtered for food is obscene.  Just imagine we were doing the same thing with black people. It's not really a stretch since we did actually enslave them at one point in time. We keep the women pregnant continuously so they keep producing milk. When the babies are born we keep the males for 2 years then slaughter them. Just cram the crying infants onto a conveyor and at the end of the line bash their heads with a captive bolt. They don't have any significant intelligence at that age and have no concept of death so its not really a big deal. Their mothers won't miss them. Of course we have to allow a select few of the males to mature so they can mate with females to keep up the mass breeding. The majority of the female babies are allowed to mature so we can keep producing more and more to keep up with the demand for milk and meat.  We can do this with Asians too.

I understand that this was for technical reasons, maybe for video reasons too, since the butchers at work wear long gloves.  This was a happy baby cow one time. Synthetic meat is going to be so much more cost competitive against this.   Looks very labor and resource intensive to bring packaged meat to the supermarkets from the time when a baby cow is born.  The labor intensity is very visible in here.

I assume you are your own doctor, optometrist, network engineer, shoemaker, etc., because you know, it's the only honest way to live since you believe people whom eat animals should all be out there killing them with their bare hands themselves.  Along that vein, I assume you think people should be experts in everything they use and do in life - that this just doesn't apply to animals only.  If you insist that it applies to animals only, then how you explain/excuse yourself?  Is the animal rare or on the extinct list?  Is it your pet and someone stole it from your home and tossed on the BBQ?   Regarding your comment about ""never had this same talk with a person after they'd seen what goes on inside a slaughterhouse""....I'm pretty sure you're living a very ignorant life because I can bet the stuff you own and use was most likely made by someone hunched over in a stuffy sweatshop in some third world country.  Yet I bet you still look for bargains and sales and sleep fine at night.  I bet you know crazy stuff goes on in the restaurant kitchen but you still go out to eat.  I'm curious what makes you think your food is treated better?  After all, it is grown in poop and handled by people whom may or may not have washed their hands.

Also how about you look at it this way : you are advocating for cows not for the cow's sake, when you boil it down you really are looking out for yourself, it's your selfish desire not to feel bad, you don't wanna be sad or hurt by seeing and knowing that cows out there are being hurt and killed and eaten. It hurts YOU, saddens YOU , makes YOU uncomfortable.The cow really neither knows whats gonna happen nor has the capacity to know, and if killed through a bolt it fucking dies too rapidly to feel it even.

@7Davidnm,"Hytiide I'm not sure how they do it in America, but in my country the animal (In this case a pig) live surprisingly good. They live a happy life with their other animal friends, and get fed exactly what they need, then when it's time for their days to be over, they are taking out and get a quick air pipe thingy which instantly make them braindead. The reason they use the air pipe thingy is because if the animal feels stress or fear before it's aparture, it will release a certain chemical making the meat not as good, and ofcourse to make it as humane as possible. So the point you made with the animals seeing other animals get killed infront of them is outright wrong in this case, as it damages the meat and is just plainly inhumane. Ofcourse i can't talk for everyone, but it's like this in this case.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@mdecourcywheeler,"Josiah Michael it is, there are less and less butchers because people buy their meat from supermarkets, where the meat is cut up on a production line. Whilst the people cutting that meat up are butchering the animal. I don't think they qualify as butchers.   So the traditional butchers, as in an individual who masters the art of butchering animals and runs a shop or stand, selling almost exclusively meat, is a dying trade that's fallen victim to supermarkets. As for the aggregate number of people in the world who butcher meat for consumption, that number is probably significant lower too as production lines and Fordism will have resulted in fewer people butchering more animals per hour than the traditional method.   So whilst meat production and consumption have quite possibly risen in the last few decades, the number of butchers has almost certainly dropped.",8년 전(수정됨),5,
