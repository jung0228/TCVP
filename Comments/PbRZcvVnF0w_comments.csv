@rebekoko,"Watching this in the future, 2025, and we still feel disgusted KK was allowed to wear the hallowed Bob Mackie Marilyn Monroe Dress. We now know the fragile art piece gown was damaged by the aggressive attempt to get it on KK’s body, which failed because this dress was hand sewn while Ms Monroe wore it. This is why we see that abomination white fur to cover the fact it did not fit KK at all. The dress was returned torn with precious crystals missing  and more unspeakable damage was caused. Bob Mackie himself was opposed to this as were most of us. KK looked awful and destroyed a precious piece of fashion iconic history. Yes, we’re are still not recovered…",6개월 전(수정됨),0,

@Cc07,"How you dig deep to compliment kourtney tells me everything about your style IQ, she did what she did as a fuck you not for the sake of the theme or fashion. The entire clan was there to basically cover the costs of the Marilyn stunt bs and obvious she didn’t wanna be there and has made this clear throughout their infamous history.  As for kim and kardashians, kim would have been dragged regardless but probably a lot less with a replica- just another using her for fame. So many still jealous and hateful of Marylin or creepy to her like hugh hefner.. Not to mention all the hassle going blonde for a boring af slickback. khloe and kendal shined, blake overal was my fave.That is the glam and big show we all wanna see.      Kourtney probably felt very punk and rebellious in the moment and that’s cool for anything but the met. I’ve never seen something so awful minus the dumb sheer or avn dresses with a cheep nude thong under. It’s one thing to do this at some random event but not at an event all about fashion. I know this is old but I just saw the BTS footage behind the dress concept and design, it was an intentional fuck you mess.     For whatever reason, they’re going on and on about being icons for fashion and it’s tired. No one is more of a try hard than them and kanye. While others, style comes to them naturally.   Either way, call a spade a spade, it was dumb and dirty what she did. I think the event is a bit overwhelming high society crap but it’s also this giant beacon that the fashion world is forcibly centered on. With all that said, it’s still awful what she did and there are worse things happening in the world but man don’t pretend what she did was appropriate at all.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

The buyer paid for that!!!!!has nothing to do with Kim's idea…. her greed her thoughts why she had to frolic around in the dress what Merilyn Monroe did best... all in all the magic of this dress is no longer magic to me! what a selfish person and ego to enrich their own wealth… in 3/4 minutes at the Met Gala…and the buyer even worse!!!! that he approved it.. no respect for Merilyn Monroe at all.. terribly stupid Merilyn Monroe always said that people like this exist; NO RESPECT... for what she actually wanted to be and wanted to radiate who she is and was!!",1년 전,0,

@jozefbols4386,"Luc, you look smashing dear! First of all: Kim K should be ashamed, she well never be as fab as Marilyn Monroe!! Do not like that family. Why?? Well, that entire family (including the kids) are completely unworldly!!! They feel so much better than the common people (the plebs), they are haughty, arrogant and know-it-alls!!! Plus: they think they own the world! OOO, are they beautiful according to you?? Plastic fantastic yes, almost everything about them is fake!! If you were to take that away they would look like you and me, dear people = PLAIN!! Sorry, they make me so mad with their behaviour. And no, I do not hate them, there is a huge difference between disliking and hating!!! REMEMBER THAT people! - Alicia: I love the cape but not for this gala, so you are right, Luc! The dress is top, on its own. - Anitta: the color of that dress, love that very much, the pearls are a bit to much, but hey, thats my opinion of course ;-) - Love the feathers on that short cape of Anna, but not the fabric, nor the dress! - Ashton is gonna give you a lift I think! But love the outfit cause it's so out of the box! - Awkwafina: WTF??? What is going on with that outfit, it is beyond FUGLY, It seems to be composed of all kinds of fabrics and prints, in short, a huge miss match!! - Bad Bunny is mad and going over the edge!!! What is going on with that outfit, he looks so stiff, poor guy. - Bella's boobies are going on a rampage!!! Love the bustier, she looks a bit gothic on chique haha. - I love Billie but this is not her best look and she knows it!! Billie, go your own way dear, do not listen to stylists!  You are a rebel, stay a rebel!! - Blake is ALWAYS spot on!!! She is a beauty, she shines and whatever she wears is FAB!! Her husband gives her the spotlight, way to go, Ryan!! - Camilla dear: this is a huge NO!!! In the video of her song 'Havana' she wears a short dress  (Charleston-look) and that looks smashing on her, she should wear daring sexy dresses, not these 'modern' type ones!! - Golden Godess Cardi B, I like it, she looks fab!! Sorry Luc, do not agree here! - Chloe: ........................................................................................................... NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO girl!! - Emma, love that skirt but would have worn an other crop top (something silver). - Emma Corrin looks indeed dandy hihi, top .... hat LOL. Nice and funny look! - Evan wears something daring! Outfit not bad but that fabric is a big no go! - Gigi, I love her very much, she is a stunner!!! But this outfit is draining her, such a pitty. - Hailey: dress is okay but those panties: BLACK, really???? - Katy girl, never let somebody push you in a dress like that again dear!! - Kendall: where is that skirt going?? It's not my cup of tea, sorry! - The rest of the family: Khloe: lame, tries to imitate her sister, Kim!  Kim: shame on you girl!!! You can not tip on Marilyn, NEVER!! That dress is old, delicate and extreem vulnerable, and you, a nobody, wants to wear that dress, you should be very ashamed!!! She and her family have no respect at all for people or precious things!!!! Travis looks sharp and swag!! Kourtney: I do like the cropped shirt but not put together like this! The skirt however looks like she pulled it down so you can she a part of her spanx pants!!! Not a good look. Kylie: why do lots of them like to wear weddingdresses to a gala or event??? Looks like a child playing dress up. AWAY WITH THE KARDASHIANS!!! Sorry not sorry, can not help it, really do not like them at all, they are all so fake ;-( - Lizzo, that coat is ' tres magnifique', the dress less but it's fun! She loves it and that is good to see, she has spunk!! - Megan T.S., you are right, Luc, that 'mesh' is not the same color as her skintone and therefore ugly!! If the only used the gold fabric, would been so much better! - Nicki: LOVE the look, but that top part, MY GOD!!!! Those bazookas are really trying to escape, desperately!!! Poor boobies, so 'cornered'. LMAO! - Nicola: a big kodus, girl, this is THE look, looking good sweetie!!! Big thumbs up! - Olivia: like Luc said: fire the stylist!! The hair is TOP! - Rosalia: Way too messy that outfit 👎🏻 - Russell: you are taking it to the next level and it's f*cking FAB!! Respect! - S.J.P: SATC at the MET-gala!!

@addictedtosurgar,"Very confusing situation with the whole Marilyn dress because Ripley's said it was returned undamaged...then suddenly its damaged?? Also she didn't ask to wear it, the idea was presented to her and Ripley's (the fame hungry establishment that it is vs an actual museum that respects history) was more than ecstatic to have her wear it! This was just a bad case of being mislead by a team of stylists who thought they were being ""iconic"" and trusting the wrong guidance...and above all a GROSS misuse of history by the very people who claim to protect/respect it... Ripleys already held very little respect as museum, this just made it lose so much more. This is why the historical related industry was so appalled. It has nothing to do with Kim but since people love to hate her it's all a bandwagon bashing from people who don't even truly care about history or Marilyn Monroe's heritage.

Idk but I really loved it 3) Lady Gaga I loved the royal Blue Dress with the Pearls all over the chest and she was on theme. Gorgeous. I know Sydney’s & Oliva’s & Sabrina wasn’t on theme. But Honestly I Don’t think people even care being on theme honestly they just wont to wear what they wont, I feel like people at the Met gala don’t care about the theme they just don’t care about the Rules 🤷🏽‍♀️ for me personally idc if they are on theme or not as long as they look stunning and not Stupid they are fine.

@brettmastema7056,"When I originally heard about Kim's wearing of the dress. My friends who like that horrid family said I am mostly being mad because it was Kim. Which only made me think ""of course she would not give a crap about how she could destroy the dress with her famously fat rear end."" Considering that the dress did not fit the year's theme and she was supposed to be immediately changing out of the dress and into a copy, for the evening, i didn't see the point in traumatizing the dress. Also had not understood why a Ripley's believe it or Not museum would spend so much to obtain the dress and let Kim possible destroy it. (unless it was an insurance thing) I feel that a Florida Ripley's tourist museum does represent, to me, the level of culture Kim K should be credited with.

The design of the copper dress is the architecture of the Empire State building; the colour is the copper of the statue of Liberty; the green/ish, turquoise is to show how the statue has oxidized over time, and the constellation print on that is an ode to her first appearance in gossip girl at Grand Central Station as it is the same constellation as on the ceiling.

The only things they have in common is wealth and they were both photographed a lot but I’m sure marilyn was photographed more and everyone famous is rich and photographed a lot. Kylie was the worst dressed. And I think Blake should get more credit for the concept and her look was one of the more eye pleasing ones.

@omaralejandrobouamraniarte9089," @daniellesene7574  Actually no one really knows how it disappeared. However, I’ve read most historians believe that, during the partition of India and all the process of decolonization,the royal families experienced a huge economic recession. Hence, in an attempt to save themselves from bankruptcy, they sold many of their valuable belongings such as jewelry, which were easy to trade in the European market. That way they’d manage to make some money (plus if they didn’t, the Indian government would take all those pieces away). So most likely, the Maharaja of Patiala sold the necklace Cartier made for him and then claimed it was stolen. Then it probably went thorough many hands after ending up at an auction. Such an amazing story  All that being said, I completely agree that it’s horrible that such an important piece of Indian history is being worn by a white celebrity.

@aishayu7065," @3kxi761  Very true and we both agree. I’m just saying they did make some attempt at preserving the dress. This is from a Vogue article: « The truth is Kardashian only actually wore the original dress for a matter of minutes. Given the fragile nature and historical value of the dress, she wasn’t about to take any chances. In fact, her whole process of getting dressed reads like a highly sophisticated military operation. First, she left her hotel in a dressing gown with barricades set up outside to obscure the view of any waiting paparazzi. She then arrived at a small fitting room by the Met Gala steps that was especially organized for the occasion. There a conservationist from Ripley’s was on hand to assist her in white gloves. “I’m extremely respectful to the dress and what it means to American history. I would never want to sit in it or eat in it or have any risk of any damage to it and I won’t be wearing the kind of body makeup I usually do,” says Kardashian, who changed into a replica of the dress also owned by Ripley’s once she successfully climbed the stairs. “Everything had to be specifically timed and I had to practice walking up the stairs.” »",3년 전,0,

@marciasagadore2158,"Seeing Kim not only wearing the dress, but trying to fit into it in the first place, made me sick. Marilyn's body was her own, and the dress was made to fit to Marilyn's natural female body. Kim's entire body is plastic and fillers, and no matter how much of her own flesh she decided to lose on a diet, the front and back implants would never fit the dress as it was meant to fit a normal human woman. She looked cheap, phony, and ridiculous, trying to look like something that she never could, and trying to impress people who probably weren't even alive during Marilyn's life, nor know the significance or back-story of the dress, anyway, so what was her point, except the usual ""look at me, look at me"". For her to be allowed the opportunity to destroy the dress, and I believe it was destroyed, as seen in the video of multiple people yanking and trying to pull it up over her full-body girdle, made me throw up in my mouth. I was waiting to see the fragile fabric rip in the hands of the people who were forcing it up over Kim's unnatural shape. Also, Marilyn had to be sewn into the dress, so how is this one being held together - safety pins?!  Do you know what a safety pin would do to the sheer, delicate, and fragile fabric?  In the world of museums and national artifacts, I believe that a professional's opinion should be called for to describe the irreparable damage that's been done to the dress, including Kim's body oil, body makeup, perspiration, and skin cells that have permeated the fabric.  Ripley's should also be forced to publicly describe this damage to the world, and give a reason for it. Obviously money doesn't buy brains or class.  Allegedly!",3년 전,2,

Well, they were soldiers in the 1800s fighting Native American tribes for the US government's distubing idea of Manifest Destiny, so it's not a ""great"" part of history, but more like a very important part of history. The Native American tribes they were fighting were the most skilled fighters. Apache, Comanche, etc. The Comanche were arguably the best cavalry fighters to ever, ever exist. Fighting them alone would have been...let's just say, you'd send your very best. I expect they did considering the Comanches eventually lost the Indian wars. Plus the Buffalo Soldiers are considered the first Park Rangers. Should be brought into the history books more often. The only way I ever learned about them was by listening to Bob Marley. 🙄   ""American Plains Indians who fought against these soldiers referred to the black cavalry troops as ""buffalo soldiers"" because of their dark, curly hair, which resembled a buffalo's coat and because of their fierce nature of fighting. The nickname soon became synonymous with all African-American regiments formed in 1866."" -nps dot gov",3년 전,14,

And she looks like the every woman, of course women have different body shapes but when I see Marilyn in that dress I see my own body and I think a lot of women would. Kim on the other hand, has single handedly lead a whole lot of women and young girls to have body dysmorphia and believe that they should have the body of a barbie doll and attempt to live up to the absolutely impossible standard that is Kim Kardashians body. Kims body is her body and of course she is entitled to look how she does, but she is absolutely not by any means a champion of body positivity. I mean her and her family have advertised diet teas and lollipops ffs. I just don’t think Marilyn would stand by any of that. And thats why I have such an issue with Kim wearing that dress.

There was more to be done for a cohesive look.  Either go for a respectable woman of the period look, and have some more pastel color in the hair - headband, feathers, hat, anything. Throw away those sleeves and get white or pastel gloves and color-fitted choker. Some jewellery in pink or green like massive but elaborate earrings with necklace could work well too.

@lrose1310,"I saw Pahari talk about it on tiktok. There's also some people saying that the family might have sold it or that it was a loan piece from Cartier to begin with. The Maharaja did commission Cartier to create the piece, so it is a Cartier piece (which is probably why they bought it when it resurfaced). Apparently the Patiala family wasn't very popular either. Which might be why we don't hear a whole lot of pushback over this in general. I personally think it should be returned to India and put in a museum at least.",3년 전,15,

It was found in some kind of antique store or auction, damaged and with many of the gem stones missing.  Cartier bought it and restored it with lab-created diamonds and CZs.     I have no skin in this game, but I don’t think it’s terrible that Cartier bought & restore it.  Nor does it bother me that they lent it out the choker part of the necklace to be worn by Chamberlain at a gala event.  It wasn’t damaged at the event.  What is jewelry for, if not to be worn?      In my opinion, an ancient, locally-crafted piece of jewelry or art would be something else entirely.",3년 전(수정됨),16,

Besides, if truly you know about the dress, it's said to already be so delicate,it has holes in some places that's beyond repair and what not. So if she wore it, we would have seen all the deformities.  This is a little white lie that has got you all breathing steam for nothing.  Also, even if by some miracle (highly unlikely) if, which I strongly doubt! So what if Kim wore Monroe's dress, isn't it to honour the late actress. What did Kim do? Did she murder, rape, steal, abuse or commit an unimaginable crime? Is Monroe a saint herself? Did she die a virgin? Or for a just cause? That no one, much LESS, THE Kardashians cannot wear her dress.  If you want to argue based on the delicacy of the dress, and it's rarity, I understand.

However, being a Marilyn stan, fashion critique or neither, these kind of comments were not necessary. They were actually really messed up. Marilyn M. and Kim K. are different people from different origins and times, this is true but the things we're saying about Kim, they're pretty similar to the nasty things Marilyn M. had to hear when she was alive (not cool ayo). Also, treating her like a child, making up these ""I am Marilyn"" interpretations on top of treating her like trash is not cool. Just because she's Kim K. and there are things she does or says that we don't necessarily agree or take a liking to, doesn't mean we can just continuously trash her like she's not even human.

@emc7056," @lasagnekiller  let's be honest, the obsession with women who die young in unfortunate circumstances such as Marilyn, Princess Diana, Amy Winehouse are never appreciated when they were around, their immortality is what makes them so famous. When Marilyn was around she was a mistress, a dumb blonde, a bad actress - but she was able to defy all that by becoming a cult icon, “She broke the mold and challenged the authoritarian structure"" just like Kim Kardashian did when she went from being an unknown celebrity with a sex tape to being a household name. Regardless of if you don't like KK, her and Marilyn's story have a lot of the same themes, both women hated by the media who somehow managed to turn it into a career.",3년 전,3,
@kleineoOoStern," @emc7056  And what if they have some similarities in their careers and lifes ? It doesn't change the fact that Marilyn even if she was seen as a bad person back then is today an icon and her possessions are historical artefacts that should stay in a museum because her story, persona and career lead to big changes in our society and impact the way feminity is viewed even today. The jewels from Hepburn are stones which can survive to a red carpet but this dress is already 60y old, it is extremely fragile and is now damaged because of Kim K and her need to be assimilated as an icon by appropriation of someone's biggest fashion statements and not just with a respectful homage. Kim could've worn the replica without having to endangered herself with a dangerous weight loss and still show the parallel between herself and the story of Marilyn. She didn't have to damage an historical garment to make her statement because the similarities between them are already here. Wearing the replica of the dress and saying to the world that she pays homage to Marilyn while respecting her wish to be the only one to ever wear this dress would've been the perfect way to be a Marilyn for a day and show how she is becoming an icon herself in a similar way but without damaging an historical piece. My mom's brooch inherited from her mother was her little treasure and she told me that she didn't want anyone to wear it because it was already damaged and fragile. She died in 2018 and her brooch is in her little box in my bedroom ever since. I often look at it to think about her and our memories together and all of my family regularly ask me about this tiny brooch but I'll never wear it and would never allow anyone to do so because it is extremely fragile and because the wish of a deceased person is still a wish we have to honor and my children will learn to respect their Grandmother's wish like we all should've learn to respect Marilyn's wish to let her dress untouched after she wore it, Kim missed an opportunity to be respectful and show restraint and grace.",3년 전,28,

@gothicavictoria1341," @emc7056  They are not remotely the same. Marilyn Monroe had to fight worse misogyny in the the 50's than Kim probably ever will being a celebrity in the 21st century. Marilyn had talent as a model, actress, and singer. She collected more books than diamonds. She supported racial equality. Kim Kardashian is the opposite of Marilyn in almost every conceivable way. Kim is a nepotism baby and her sex tape has been suspected of being orchestrated by her mom, which is the biggest ick factor, but does not compare to the sexism and the sex symbol iconography forced upon Marilyn. Kim is not known for being down-to-earth like Marilyn and as far as I'm aware does not collect books like Marilyn who thought of them as treasures. They're both shrewd business-women, for sure, but Kim is also known for exploiting people and communities. Where Marilyn was outspoken even in her time for equality and supported Ella Fitzgerald by sitting first row at all of her performances, Kim Kardashian as well as her family are known for exploiting minorities for attention and money and culture appropriation of black culture. From wearing culturally significant hair to selling shirts with the images of Tupac and Notorious B.I.G with her family name plastered on it, Kim's comparison to Marilyn Monroe is insulting. Their lives might have some similarities but those are few . Marilyn had talent and was harassed by the media to the point of overdosing while Kim is a nepotism baby who exploits people of color to make more money. They are not remotely on the same level",2년 전,0,
@emc7056," @gothicavictoria1341  Honestly, your points are weak and we aren't talking about how down to earth Marilyn Monroe was (not that you would know anyway) No one said they were the same, however they are both women who have used being sex symbols as a way to make a living. I'm not a fan of Kim Kardashian, but she did help a woman of colour who was wrongfully incarcerated. What you don't understand is that you are picking one woman apart and putting another on a pedestal, with no actual qualified reason, which is very contradictory and anti-woman in itself.",2년 전,0,
@gothicavictoria1341," @emc7056  ""I know this man is horrifically racist and probably a white supremacist, but he did give money one time to a charity that feeds children in Africa, so he can't be that bad."" To a much lesser extent, ignoring Kim's exploitation and cultural appropriation of the black community just because she helped some people of color in what was a possible publicity stunt sounds really ignorant. Despite your supposed dislike if Kim, you don't show it by defending her actions. I also never said they were the same, I was interpreting your words as comparing Marilyn Monroe to Kim Kardashian, which they aren't even comparable in several regards. Saying that my arguments are weak while then calling me anti woman and contradictory is hypocritical and itself anti-woman. You say I'm incorrect, but you haven't pointed out where I'm wrong. I believe this stems from your misunderstanding of why Marilyn is an icon. Marilyn Monroe came from a working class background, used the dumb blonde stereotype as a bit and a cover, and was and is regarded as a business woman, actress, singer, and supporter of black musicians. Her memory has been whittled down sex symbol who possibly slept with the president. Your lack of understanding of who she actually was is both sad, and the very thing you accuse me of, anti-woman. Criticizing Kim Kardashian for her multiple attempts at black phishing, cultural appropriation, and exploitation of minorities as well as wearing an iconic dress meant for historical preservation is not being anti-woman. Marilyn Monroe did more in her life and means more to people than Kim Kardashian, who is a nepotism baby and grew up in an affluent family in LA, is because of Monroe's journey from a girl from a blue collar family to a Hollywood darling to a woman dragged down and harassed to the point of taking her own life. It's insulting to ignore why Marilyn is iconic to American pop culture and history, call her admirers a cult, and call critics of Kim Kardashian for wearing a piece of history anti-woman. Just because both were women does not mean that Kim meets the same level of honor and iconography as Marilyn. I'm not the one who doesn't seem to know what they're talking about. Kim Kardashian is an exploitative nepotistic business woman who should not have worn a dress literally tailored for a woman far more iconic and culturally significant than she will ever be and calling her as such is not anti-woman. Defending Kim Kardashian, even if you say you don't like her, sounds like a brand of feminism in which women can do no wrong and criticizing women makes you anti-woman. People can and should call her out for wearing the dress of Marilyn Monroe. It's insulting to Monroe's memory to suggest that just because she and Kim share the same sex and have similar struggles with the press absolves the latter from criticism. Even while you say you don't like Kim Kardashian, you are inadvertently putting her on a pedestal for doing something that deserves criticism and ignore the times where she has exploited or attempted to exploit the black community and other minorities and then criticize me for putting Marilyn on a pedestal. Just because Kim did charity one time for incarcerated women does not absolve her of the harm she causes while black phishing for magazine covers or cultural appropriation by wearing culturally significant black hairstyles. Before you comment further on Marilyn Monroe, it might serve you well to do some actual research on her life. Because it really seems to me that you're the one who doesn't actually know who she was or why she's an American icon. You're participating in behavior that is itself anti-woman or at least ignorant by shielding one woman from criticism because of a biased charicature of another and comparing the two as if the two similarities I've mentioned before are all that is needed to absolve the former.

No. You do not know either of those people that you are criticizing/complimenting and you sound silly.

Meanwhile you call others anti-woman and use Gen Z as an insult. Saying neither are better or worse while not knowing anything about Marilyn and comparing her to a nepotist like Kim shows how little you know. If you don't understand why Marilyn Monroe is admired long after her death and why she's iconic and Kim isn't, then you can stay in that bubble of yours. There's a good reason why Marilyn is better than Kim and it comes down to how she lived and what she was really like in her private life. You don't want to learn and that's sad to me. Nobody's going to write a song about Kim a decade after she dies because she's problematic and not nearly as iconic.

@laurakastrup,"The thing is: Marilyn and Kim are sort of in the same situation, Marilyn Monroe was an iconic sex icon, she still is to the older generation (it’s really weird when your dad begins simping for a dead actress but you know, it happens)   Kim Kardashian is sort of the same, although instead of being an iconic actress in black and white films, she’s famous on Instagram, Twitter and her streaming service isn’t doing half bad, on top of that both women have their every sex life published.   Personally I don’t think Kim Kardashian was doing it out of spite, but because she saw herself in Marilyn Monroe. I agree the dress shouldn’t be worn (out of fear of the fabric literally being to frail to hold up) but a reconstructed dress (like the one she wore after the red carpet) isn’t half bad   Both women aren’t stupid either, Marilyn, allegedly, had an IQ of 140 something but was told to act dumber to be the “blonde bombshell”   As much as Kim Kardashian is controversial, her financial statements isn’t half bad, she’s capitalised on people finding her to be a sex appeal by launching multiple companies in her own name, some of them have flopped but not all of them (look, you gotta try different avenues and sometimes it doesn’t work out, I respect it)   NOW IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GILDED AGE AND THATS WHAT IM MAD ABOUT.

His outfit is a play on uniforms of the United States Colored Troops (USCT) that were established at the birth of the guilded age in May 1863, a few months after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. He is honoring the history of African Americans in America. I think he is one of the few that hit the theme right on its mark this year. Plus the added modern touches such as the gloves and such make it more of an artistic fashion statement inspired by the guilded age as opposed to a costume.

@andreajohnson1521,So I just wanted to take the time to give you a little history so you understand what Ashton Sanders was paying homage to and referencing for the time. Of the Gilded Age. He was dressed as a Buffalo Soldier an ( African American cavalry regiments of the U.S. Army who served in the western United States from 1867 to 1896.)  If I may say so myself his outfit was impeccably tailored and did not look costumey because it was executed with a nice modern flair.

@kiwisoup1863,"Ashton Sanders's outfit actually hit the Gilded Age theme pretty accurately.  See, we don't call the Gilded Age ""golden"" for a reason. It's gold /covered/, not made of gold. It seems shiny and glamorous on the outside, but below the surface, it is anything but. The Gilded Age was the era where monopolies like Standard Oil flourished at the expense of the working class, and was rife with the bloodshed of the Civil War.   I bring this up because Sanders deliberately wore that suit as an homage to the Buffalo Soldiers, an all-Black cavalry that was established in 1866 (well within the bounds of the time period) to fight in the Civil War. As a black man, he would not have gotten to enjoy the luxurious lifestyle of the Astors or the Vanderbilts. Instead, he would likely be on the battlefield fighting for his right to exist or suffering under the extreme conditions of the workforce.  The suit itself is not made to be an exact replica, but to capture the essence of the uniforms worn by the Buffalo Soldiers. It still, however, carries a similar silhouette and incorporates the motif of the blue and gold heralding in a way that is reminiscent, but not 100% historically accurate to the actual clothing the regiments donned as they rode or marched into battle.",3년 전,1.4천,

@Janellabelle,"Not quite. But close. They were established in 1866. The Civil War ended in April of 1865. They were established for the sole purpose of suppressing, and if necessary, obliterating the American Plains Indians (Apaches, Comanches, Blackfoot, Sioux etc- basically the most advanced fighting tribes) in the US government's disturbing pursuit of ""Manifest Destiny"". The Buffalo Soldiers indeed gave the American Plains Indians hell, and were a crucial factor in their eventual near total annihilation and brutal defeat. The black regiments that fought in the civil war were absolutely NOT the Buffalo Soldiers, though maybe a couple black civil war soldiers that lived and weren't maimed AND decided to continue their occupation in the US military (a rare case indeed) perhaps joined this regiment. Why not. They were paid more doing this than at other jobs and given more respect. The Indians are the ones that actually gave them the nickname ""Buffalo Soldiers"". You can easily remember this by their name and where the buffalo were located. In the west. Whereas the Civil War was fought in the southeastern United States where there were no buffalo. Lol. Here:  ""American Plains Indians who fought against these soldiers referred to the black cavalry troops as ""buffalo soldiers"" because of their dark, curly hair, which resembled a buffalo's coat and because of their fierce nature of fighting. The nickname soon became synonymous with all African-American regiments formed in 1866."" -Npc dot gov  Also, the Buffalo Soldiers are considered to be America's first Park Rangers. 🖤  Edit: typo",3년 전(수정됨),13,

People should absolutely stop trying to find something between the lines in order to have their opinion underlined... it's horrible! There are so many anti racist people, who are more racist than any other proclaimed racist, nationalists who are in fact chauvinists, and feminists who are man haters.... We should stop with that!!!

This nickname was given to the Colored Cavalry by Native American tribes who fought in the Indian Wars. The term eventually became synonymous with all of the African-American regiments formed in 1866.

@cookieridergirl,"The one thing I’ve learned from watching these videos. Hardly anyone ever follows the theme!!!! And I don’t get why?!?!!!!! That what makes it fun and funky and not just mundane everyday “let’s wear a pretty (sexy) dress, or a suit.” Like shit I would of been happy just to see people try and dress gilded age let alone reimagine it. The dresses from that era are gorgeous!!! Why wouldn’t someone want to have a moment to wear something we don’t really get to see anymore. Any gender could have fun with it. Seeing more men in the women cycling clothing, bloomers, would have been amazing. Even would have loved to see more women in bloomers. This was a liberating moment for women and women’s fashion. Let’s celebrate it. And it would be such a fun way for men to try more feminine clothing as the twist at the time was how these bloomers was women’s fashion going more masculine. To not capitalize on this fashion style is an absolute shame with all those ruffles and fabrics and draping. 😭 But on top of that, NO HATS. The hats are so fun and over the top compared to what we wear now. And NO PARASOLS! COMMON!!!!!! 😤   I would jump at the opportunity to dress like this. I sorta think it’s a shame we don’t anymore. Idk what it is about this style but it just feels classy. And I’m not someone who dresses up at all. I never wear dresses. I know that the era itself was not perfect or great for women and really anyone besides white men. Bunch of elitism. But I still can’t help but think it’s classy AF. And maybe more gender swapping could have poked fun at it and shown how much the world has changed since then. Even if we aren’t perfect now, still so much has improved so why not take a twist on history to show that off. And maybe I’m more in love with a Hollywood fairytale version of the gilded age fashion, but then at least give me that. 🥺  I’m just so disappointed at never seeing the theme. Specially when it’s meant to reference an era of actually history and isn’t just like a word, but a real point in history that had a distinct style. Use it. It already exist. They didn’t even have to think that hard just Google a look from that era and copy it. It’s not like it was a random word and you have to interpret what that word means in fashion. 😫",3년 전,9,

@romeoslover817,"My opinion:    Most of these women would have benefitted by looking at some books or something that modeled what people actually wore during the time period.. The stylists have no excuse for the outfits that really missed the mark.   The clothing worn by the upper clas was heavily tailored ala couture  to the women.   most of this stuff looks too “off the rack for me.  Maybe it is because I have  a background in sawing and tailoring.  that the dresses are supposed to be inspired by, but underboob crop top takes away from everything else.  Nicky Minage better not move around or the girls are goin to be presented.

It was also matched to Marilyn's skin tone, and cut for Marilyn, Kim isn't Marilyn so it was never going to give the same effect. It seemed like such a pointless moment in the dress?

@Feverm00n," @mlbumller  That’s… a really disgusting, insensitive thing to say on multiple levels. And I say this as someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts for most of my life. Telling someone to commit suicide or saying you wish they did doesn’t become okay just because you don’t like them. We all don’t like somebody, so when you say that kind of stuff you just normalize the behavior of wishing a traumatic, self-inflicted death on someone bc they’re unlikable to you personally. And some of those someones may already be on the edge. Suicide is incredibly traumatizing for loved ones for a myriad of reasons and it literally has a contagion factor; it often creates ripples of immense pain in its wake. So for Kim K specifically; her self-inflicted death, were it to happen, would not only deeply traumatize her family, friends, and children, but her visibility would likely result in additional suicides of people completely undeserving of your grossly inappropriate spite.  For all of Kim Kardashian’s shallow, oblivious, self-obsessed endlessly irritating qualities, I’d choose ten Kims any day over your self-indulgent, myopic vacuousness.",3년 전,5,

God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think.

The lines and cuts in the dress are very accurate to the gilded age accents in the major building in NY at the time that had those kinds of accents.  Copper was used in piping and sewage back then an it was much cheaper and safer than steel, so the copper makes sense.  However, as time when along copper became less popular and more expensive as it heats even more rapidly than steel or stainless steel.    Blake did a fantastic job thinking outside the box, and frankly this years theme sucked as many of the years themes have sucked and I'm tired of the ""hollywood glam, remember history"" trope.

@johnpearson1258,"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",3년 전,0,

Also just to let you know Nicola Coughlin is pronounced as Nickola (like the c is hard if that makes sense?) and Coughlin = Cocklin! And I loved her outfit, and she wore a wig, which is one of my many thoughts regarding Kim's awful look- she's worried about the bleach in her hair, which was slicked back and not even visible, when she could've worn a blonde wig???? Would've been tacky I think to wear a Marilyn wig but something  could've been done there. But yeah, dress should've stayed on display no need to bring it out- we have a museum here in Ireland that has like some famous outfits idk- I visited when I was like 15 and they had the outfit from Birds (is that the movie lol) and there was some stuff belonged to Marilyn there and I just think iconic pieces of clothing like that are better on display- like completely different but one of the revolutionary leaders from Ireland his uniform is on display in the national museum in dublin and I'm almost sure the blood from when he was killed is on it like clothing in museums is more impactful- kim made an iconic dress look cheap like those shoes? and there was no impact and it didn't fit the theme at all. For olivia I think this is one of her best red carpet outfits and the make up and hair were fab but it doesn't fit the theme that much- would've been a great Grammys outfit cause I didn't like that black one she wore. Would've loved more plays on the theme and actual bustles- when you mentioned oscar wilde I thought of how creative it would've been for someone to incorporate dorian gray into their look that would've stood out I think- like the gruesome look- idk there was a lot to play with like blake used architecture, why not look at literature etc. disappointing overall but I will say I like Emmas- her new vogue video shows the thought she put into it and I think it is a very Emma look like it fits Emmas style???",3년 전,0,

@gwennythwhite9633,"Okay, when hearing this theme, I had an immediate idea for what I thought would be a fun outfit/event (because everyone is loving these carpet gimmicks or outfit transformations). I thought wearing a traditional mourning dress of the era--heavy, dense, deep black, fully period accurate. Hoever, in line with how a woman is supposed to 'come out of mourning' slowly color is revealed or added in the dress. Traditionally colors are supposed to be re-added to the wardrobe in a specific order. Usually starting with subtle navy colors then slowly becoming lighter in color, then finally patterns can be reintroduced. Imagine revealing a navy stripe or strip of fabric, then as you proceed down the carpet you nonchalantly reveal more and more bright colors until finally at the end of the carpet it transforms into a bright ensemble! Bonus points for runny mascara like you've been weeping that is subtly wiped away like shedding layers of grief.   Anyway just a thought...",3년 전,0,

@caitlyncarlisle2946,"As a former designer with two degrees in fashion design from FIT and years of working in the industry for the likes of alexander wang and having studied costume design--my favorite course, I am confused? by many of these looks--some that blatantly reference the 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's...everything but gilded age. And there's no excuse. They have the time, resources, teams, designers, money... everything and yet? Given a day I could design something for this theme that would have been better than many of these looks so I have to agree with you on much of this.  also... I said it before and I'll say it again... why the hell is Addison Rae at the MET gala? She's had like one b movie, one song, cozied up to the Kardashians but is basically just famous for being a tik tok star and doing her makeup... alright. I don't understand the appeal of her... she's very average for celebrity and very annoying. She belongs nowhere but social media-definitely not the MET gala which should be reserved for icons of a generation. Those that make influencers seem so very high school, who change pop culture somehow or make huge strides within their humanitarian efforts... that's who to invite. Or maybe even actual artists? since it's held at the MET and all,  we could  perhaps embrace fine artists more, less so another makeup tik toker.  People will look back and see Addison's picture from the night and be like, who's that? Who cares? I think there's other people this applies as well to but especially her.  And her dress...blah. Forever 21 much? I could go on so I'll just say this: STOP inviting Addison Rae to the MET gala, right? (did you even touch on her? maybe I'm mixing up MET review videos. However, my point exactly: who cares.)",3년 전(수정됨),0,
@lubazak636,Sorry but Anna Wintour’s outfit was ugly and non flattering. I thought Blake Lively won.  No one should be allowed to wear Marilyn Monroe’s iconic dress. Kim could have worn  a copy and it didn’t look that great on her since she dosen’t have Marylin’s skin color.,3년 전(수정됨),0,

Which just leaves things confusing even if you like kind of know things about the subject (putting my absolutely useless bachelors in history to work) The statue of liberty is definitely gilded age, I’ll give that to her. But the main pattern on her dress is referencing the empire state building which was built in the 30s and is squarely art deco (and I normally love an art deco reference). It doesn’t really mesh stylistically with her other reference points (such as beaux arts architecture) and there were so many better things you could’ve referenced from the period.

Kim’s “hard work” to become rich and famous was to be born to wealthy parents, and make a sex tape. She is an insult to kind, compassionate, hard-working women everywhere.

@jacobblack863,"I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   ""This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth""  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9",3년 전,0,

Mind you, I agree with the technical aspects of what he says that she REALLY needs to hire people ""who actually knows what they're doing because it's like throwing away opportunity after opportunity"". I've been saying the same thing for awhile. That Grammys dress? My gosh. I know some people liked it, but even as someone who likes olivia I wouldn't be able to defend a dress like that from an objective standpoint. Poorly fitted, awkward design, cheap looking lines of glitter, sad colours, regardless of designer label, it was a shame. Her management truly needs to DO SOMETHING about her 'glam team'. I'm going to throw in her makeup artist too. Her makeup looks don't suit her as much recently. Saved only by olivia's natural beauty as the canvas. But the met's makeup is a muddy mess. In photos under great lighting, yes so beautiful. But her MUA has been aging her look these days. Dramatic makeup can look amazing, but this was a heavy overloaded dump on her eyes. Only her hairstylist seems good. However, I loved this purple Versace slip dress, I wouldn't call this a flop, it's beautiful. Not really consistent with MET's theme no matter the backstory that explains it. But beautiful.

I understand and appreciate the dedication to her y2k style but they often have a hard time translating it to the carpet in the worst way possible.  I also have a bone to pick with her hairstylist, Clayton Hawkins.

@annalisehowe3106,"@urfartstinks hmm you maybe right, I still don't like the comments he made about her as a person though, I definitely think that Olivia's team of stylists and make up artist drop the ball a few too many times and they need to step it up because her outfits might get predictable over time. I get that they were going for a more grungy look while still trying to keep the theme in mind but  it could've been done better and could've looked a little farther I  the archives to get inspirations. I personally like the Versace dress and I think it's very gorgeous especially on the red carpet under the lights but it definitely was not close to being on the theme. The only thing I could consider being on theme was the back of the dress which was unfortunately covered by the hair, which I think would've looked better if they had pinned it up.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

However, even then, her beach waves for the grammys felt stiff and lifeless compared to her usual voluminous waves. Idk what happened that day. Even her makeup was sad.

@xxesaye, @Chas-q4w  you underestimate the amount of creativity input she has with everything she does. Why do you all expect her to have a fashion sense of Blake Lively when this girl is 19 years old and has only been in red carpets for a year? Olivias brand is all about authenticity. Her outfits are very ON BRAND. She is navigating what she likes and has admitted she doesn’t know much about fashion but she’s figuring it out. My god. Y’all need to get a grip wanting her to have everything figured out at her age and at the rate she accelerated her fame. I promise you no one is losing sleep over her outfits and she will continue to thrive.

@Chas-q4w," @xxesaye  I actually agree with you in  defence of Olivia. But you're speaking about olivia personally while we're referencing her team in particular. Olivia would thrive on her own.

If you don’t follow her interviews and team everyday, then you wouldn’t know that they get input from Olivia and receive the OK. Olivia is one of the artists that is IN CHARGE of her career, from her music to her outfits. Even with her Met Gala look, with the headpiece, she gave the final decision that she wanted to go with the butterflies instead of the central headpiece (which would have been way better). You can watch her Vogue Get Ready With Me video there. Her wardrobe stylists, make up artist, and hairstylist all work for Elizabeth Olsen, Hoyeon from Squid Game, and SZA.

In light of the exhibition, I think it was brilliant that KK brought the iconic Marilyn dress out of the archive. (Btw, she lost 15+ pounds so that she could wear it without damaging it, and she was whisked from the event to get her out of it at the earliest possible moment.) There are great paintings that we never get to see because they’re in private collections or stashed in museum basements, and it’s a shame — this was kind of like that. P.s.

But it's funny that when they literally appropriate Catholicism everyone followed THAT theme. 🤔  Also Fredick Robertson should have allowed ONE dress.  Three different people were dressed like lion fish on LSD which made it seem cheap.  And I'm so offended on behalf of Marilyn that Kimberly K shunted her plastic ass into that ANTIQUE dress for the sake of her own ego when she had a perfect replica.

But I also think that in the right time and place, letting history “live” again outside the context on an archive is exhilarating and necessary. It gives an object a chance to reach more people and for historical context to be brought into the current day.   HOWEVERRRRRR. What I DO mind is that this risk was for no reason! It was not the right time and place. There was no REASON that it had to be this dress. It’s got nothing to do with anything related to the context of the Met.

Plus, THAT dress was not only made just for her, for her to wear while singing Happy Birthday to President JFK.  Would KK ever have the iconic status to appear for such an occasion? No.  THAT dress not only was custom made for Marilyn, but it had to be sewn onto her body.  If anything the level ostentatious excess that KK has symbolized in presuming to wear THAT dress for a gaudy, trashy occasion, not because the Met is trashy, but because so many of the invited guests are indeed trashy.  KK’s purportedly using her private jet to fly the gown and its entourage to various places around the country in preparation for the event quite simply just underscores just how differently the billionaire class live than the rest of us, or CAN live, just because they’re so smart, so rich, so entitled.  So bah humbug to KK and her presumptions and to the bulk of the gala’s invitees.  That was and still is Marilyn’s dress, so why did it have to be violated by having it to be on KK’s body.

@kerberose,"Just wanna put it out there that I think Ashton Sanders' look deserves some review and more appreciation: the style of the suit feels reminiscent of a bellhop uniform, possibly a reference to POC being in positions of service especially during the Guilded Age, in a similar way that Riz Ahmed dedicated his outfit to immigrant workers during the Gilded Age. Furthermore, denim was invented around the 1870s, and his contacts and fake fangs are a reference to the creation of vampiric tropes in the late 19th century. Of course there's also the details pointed out in video of the corseted look added to the uniform, as well as the gaudy, golden detailing on the outfit, as well as epaulettes that add to the references.

Scientifically, it is obvious she cannot, fit into Monroe's dress because their statistics is different, no matter how much weight Kim lost.  Besides, if truly you know about the dress, it's said to already be so delicate,it has holes in some places that's beyond repair and what not. So if she wore it, we would have seen all the deformities.  This is a little white lie that has got you all breathing steam for nothing.  Also, even if by some miracle (highly unlikely) if, which I strongly doubt! So what if Kim wore Monroe's dress, isn't it to honour the late actress. What did Kim do? Did she murder, rape, steal, abuse or commit an unimaginable crime? Is Monroe a saint herself? Did she die a virgin? Or for a just cause? That no one, much LESS, THE Kardashians cannot wear her dress.  If you want to argue based on the delicacy of the dress, and it's rarity, I understand.

@emc7056," @rebecky5ever  People don't seem to respect Kim either, she wore a dress that is definitive of the gilded age and by the general response from the public, you can tell they don't see her as a person either. Kim and Marilyn are very similar women - both vilified by the press, both pigeon-holed as airhead women, both able to play up to their characters to the dismay of the public and both progressed their careers by glamour modelling. I think Marilyn would be sad to see the public condemn Kardashian, being that she also went through the same hardship. I study conservation of historical fashion but I think a lot of the opinion expressed are based on internalised misogyny and not the scientific conservation of the dress. If you really care, go and find a job in a museum and stop tearing women down on the internet as a hobby.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Blake and Billie, Nicola Coughlin just looking like she's having a literal ball, Ashley Park mixing historical with neon modern, Gemma Chan with those massive blingy panniers, Cynthia Erivo for tying in Black history while making the look modern, GODDAMN QUEEN LIZZO absolutely nailing it, and Ben Platt adding a fun Victorian twist to a classic black suit in a way I actually really loved with that lil corset jacket and pearl pocketwatch chain   Worst?  Julianne Moore. Yeah it's a reference to Jackie Kennedy, but ugly and ill-fitting. A sad echo of something much greater. It looks like a beige maternity dress. Jackie's had the appliques, it had more complex draping, more interest, and just enough structure for the otherwise flowy dress. Julianne's is just... There.  Amy Schumer. Lizzo and Nicola Coughlin show that plus size women can absolutely nail it and look amazing in every way. The blue color is ok on her, and I don't even hate the off-the-shoulder look with this dress. But the detailing on the dress is bland and frumpy, the length is odd, and for the love of god, she needs to fire her hairstylist.  Paloma Elsesser. Again, plus size women need to start demanding better! The top looks so ill-fitting, almost like the bust is several sizes too big and is deflating, and what is with the cheap looking mesh straps on the corset? It looks like a Wish knockoff of a much nicer dress. I don't hate the concept, but the execution is dreadful. Also, she's showing how important styling is- the necklace she wore is dragging her down and making her look slumped over.  Emily Ratajkowski. Just... Girl stop. Please.",3년 전,40,

@kingofamon2217,"The term ""gilded age"" comes from Mark Twain to describe the reality of the mass socioeconomic conditions of that time in the US and western Europe. Behind the glamorous, opulent exterior coating of gold, wealth, and ""beauty"", there is a rough, bleak, dark, and not pretty at all reality for the vast majority. For most, the gilded age was a time of immense suffering, destitution, and abject poverty, the 15 hour work days, terrible polluted and sickly cities and towns, child labor, and the relentless, ruthless exploitation of people and the environment, all for the benefit of a few who were part of a privileged bourgeois class, those who got to dress in obscene fashion like this.  Kind of funny how these rich privileged people only know the era as a time of opulent consumption and not as an era that led to a powerful emergence of the working class via labor unions and other organizing, to take power for these exploiters and back to themselves, so they try to emulate those privileged exploiters and so many clap like seals at the theatre and show, all while most of the country (and the world) is living paycheck to paycheck in economic insecurity or downright abject poverty, the irony eludes them and so many of the celebrity idolators.",3년 전,187,

@Magpiebard,"In an effort to give Alicia Keys maybe a ~tiny~ bit of redemption, is it at all possible they were trying some kind of odd modern take on art deco? There was a decade of overlap, and sorta, kinda, if you squint and give a LOT of grace to it, the skyline design could, in theory, look like a take on that. Maybe. It wasn't on theme, but at least the dates were a tiny teeny bit there. Wrong color and not the greatest execution (oh dear god why don't more designers take fashion history? Perhaps actually stay awake in that class? Spend some time in the library? Just a wee thought.) but compared to so many of the others, it looks at least a tad close. Granted, close by way of a drunken chipmunk doing it's best to design something, but close. Ish? Maybe? (Yeah, I know. I'm reaching. But damn it, I really like the cloak and am trying to get enough close up shots to take a swing at embroidering something similar and am reaching because I like it. But, she tried? A little bit?)  ~Have to add here, as someone who has made a LOT of corsets.... Bella should beat with a shoe ala Naomi whoever fitted her for that black leather corset. Her boobs are both squished AND overflowing, flat AND bulging. The fact they managed to do her SO wrong is almost admirable. That is a corset you make, growl, shake your head, throw something, rip off the dressform, go for SEVERAL large drinks, pass out in your misery and then wake up and redraft the sucker again.

Whoever bought the dress for $5m clearly felt comfortable lending it to her for the event, so at that point, what's it to any of us randos what happens to the dress? It's not like Marilyn Monroe is gonna wear it again. 🤷🏻‍♂   You could put the dress in a display case for however many years and it will occassionally be seen by people who will look at it and go 'huh', or you can have Kim Kardashian wear the dress and have people spitting mad about it and be talking about how scandalous it is that she wore it—not unlike how people would've been gossiping about Marilyn Monroe for wearing it to sing to JFK.",3년 전,0,

Like Marilyn’s sweat ,makeup and ect was in that dress which now Kim’s sweat and makeup is on it instead which takes away ALOT of what makes it special. Not to mention that was a very important moment for the feminist moment it’s literally NOT JUST A DRESS and Kim ruined it . I honestly hate her for this . It’s like the guy said but it’s like going to the Mona Lisa and throwing paint in it . Should be illegal I feel to do this to historical items .

@girlsquad224,"Creativity emerges from limitations (in this case: the theme). Because it challenges the designer to work around it making innovative and artistic design solutions while respecting the given context. Most of the designers and/or fashion houses in the event definitely forgot or disregarded how to ""design"" accordingly. Just as some here mentioned, some outfits are just straight-out advertisement for the brands. It's truly another missed opportunity that other brands and designers alike would prove that they are at least still worthy of their success status/ creative recognition they receive. Most want to stand-out but not in a good way. And it's become a lame overused excuse to wear uncreative, incompetent (theme-deviant) outfits. The theme is relatively facile. It's either be inspired by victorian/ gilded age fashion/silhouettes, incorporate gold (gilded) detailing, or derive from other artistic expressions that signifies the prosperity of the era. I know most of the time it's not the celebrities' fault as they are only sponsored. It could've been understandable to some extent. But considering the amount of attendees who did not conform to the theme is quite disappointing.",3년 전,0,

@bofhzerozero777," @jen.m.3781  actually she wasn’t wearing a bra. The “pointiness” is the shape of her natural boobs, unsupported or covered by a bra. You can compare it with images from the time and see they look nothing like the “pointiness” of the bras.  In any case Kim doesn’t only have the wrong body shape to be wearing that same dress for the same effect, but especially the wrong skin tone.

I so enjoyed the video you did explaining the theme.  The detail you gave, the depth of the history … it was so well done and it had me so excited with the possibilities …. and then ….. meh.  Honestly.  Anna needs to have a serious chat with the designers.  Most of these celebrities have no fashion sense or understanding of their own.  They’re styled to death and most of them often badly so we can’t really be expecting them to know wtf to do for these Gala events.  The designers though?  There’s no excuse where they are concerned.  If they cant be arsed to do their homework and give it their all for this night of all nights …. it makes me a bit upset, really.  This night is all about honouring, celebrating, and preserving the very craft they endeavour to be a part of and they can’t manage it.  This should be a night of non stop gasps and feelings of admiration for the skill and creative talent of these designers.  Maybe Anna needs to start opening it up to complete unknowns only.",3년 전,1,

Not only the physical damage that can be done to it, but as someone who is a HUGE Marilyn fan, I think it should have been left alone in her honor. It’s upsetting that just because someone has enough money they can tarnish the history of one of the most iconic garments in history. This is no hate towards Kim because I am a fan of the Kardashian’s, but this was a miss all around. This doesn’t come across as honoring Marilyn, it’s just an attention grab considering it had NOTHING to do with the theme. If the theme was the golden age of Hollywood or something, that would be more understandable, but regardless this dress should never be worn by ANYONE.

You don't know me but I wanted to spread the good truth of Jesus Christ and I encourage that you stay and learn more❤✝️.  See God created the first of humankind and gave our first descendants dominion over the earth and things in it but we soon rebelled against God and so sin was born into the knowledge and actions of humankind. Thankfully enough we have the opportunity to rid ourselves of sin and reconcile with God the holy father through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ the son of God. He died on the cross for our sins and took the punishment we were supposed to receive, defeating sin in the process and freeing whosoever seeks salvation in him.. giving unto them a new and beautiful life with him as a born again child of God. I would love to see each and every single person on this earth receive salvation and avoid eternal damnation so I spread the good news in hopes that I can get as many people to repent and receive Christ before his second coming. The kingdom of God is near. I pray that who ever reads this considers a life in Christ and repents from the wickedness of this world before it's too late.

@callanengstrom2532,"As a history buff, the 1870s-1900s is SUCH a rich time period full of insane fashions and incredibly important political and cultural events. There was so much that could've been done with the theme, from fashion references to historical event references.

@Khs1606,"But I think it was on theme actually, Thom Browne I believe said it was a white tie inspired by the gilded era and Kourtney's is a deconstructed version of Travis' look since this is the first time he's dressed a couple together he wanted to make it cohesive.  When I saw it I thought Kourtney's looks specifically could be a reference to the textile mills and tailoring industry that bloomed in the gilded age along side other unskilled labor forms ( mining, railroad workers etc) did with all the immigrants coming to east coast to work, especially New York. Fun to see them with a New York designer as well for this theme. I don't LOVE the look but it's def not getting the credit it deserves! :)",3년 전,2,

It's from the behind the scenes article Kourtney's platform posted.  “Thom presented us with his vision, which was Travis being perfectly polished in a gilded era-inspired white-tie formal look and me being an extension of him, like melting off him almost—the unrefined, undone version, using all of the pieces from his look to create this raw take on a Gilded Age gown using men’s apparel (with the muslin cummerbund corset and the bustle made of his jacket). We were the first couple he had ever dressed together, and he said that it was very important to him that we tell a story as a couple and go beyond just a surface-level Gilded Age tux and ball gown.”",3년 전,1,

@bootsthehouse_1,I’m sorry if I sound stupid but why is it so bad? She only wore the dress for when she walked the carpet I believe and immediately took it off and wore a replica for the rest of the night. Apparently she altered her body to fit the dress so the dress would not stress. It makes sense that she wore it as they were both sex symbols of their time and are seen as such. I honestly don’t have that much of an opinion about it. She was one of the only people that technically wore an American sketch on the carpet and introduced some people to Bob Mackie. But if she wore the dress with reverence which it seemed she did then I don’t see much of a problem. Also I am by all mean NOT a kardashion fan I just don’t see why this dress should be held behind glass for its eternity if it’s worn with reverence which it seemed like she was.,3년 전,10,

Perhaps Kim would have achieved a more glamorous effect with her natural dark hair color than with this unnatural bleaching.

@ricardogaliano9333,"I think they messed them up, which is pretty common because everything that goes from the 1880s to the 1940s is pretty blurred for many people. The Gilded Age is quite strictly understood as the period between two big national crises (the Panics of 1873 and 1893) which, as usual, opened the door for a bigger concentration of wealth for the most aristocratic bourgeoisie in the US and certain new wealths that niched from the collapse. It mustn’t be confused with the Belle Époque which starts with the foundation of the Third French Republic until 1914. The period between the second half of the 1890s to 1916 is identified in the US as the Progressive Era with the growth of social activism, suffragism, Taylorism and the Socialist Party of America. It does have its own art forms and investigations but so many studies concentrate in the politics and economics as something separated from art that it is rather overlooked or misrepresented. In fashion that was a sort of transition from bustles to flappers and in architecture more institutional classicist and Romanesque buildings were combined with the American Craftsman movement, inspired by arts and crafts and the Art Nouveau.",3년 전,0,

All three of the tycoons mentioned in your historical context video have extensive ties to New York. If anything, I feel like Alicia Keys’ design was meant to showcase how the Gilded Age and its richest participants bolstered American progress and helped develop skyscraper cities like New York City. In fact, Andrew Carnegie’s steel was used in the construction of the first skyscraper in the United States which is revered by Ralph Lauren’s skyscraper detailing. Additionally, I think the silver dress and the silver detailing go perfectly with this alleged homage to Andrew Carnegie and New York progress as the dress and details almost mimic steel itself. The historical nod to famed Gilded Age entrepreneurs combined with Alicia Keys’ ties to New York captures the theme so well to me!!   Even the hair was giving spiral steel staircase energy!!

Next, Blake Lively's dress was an ode to Art Deco architecture and the statue - it was a WONDERFUL dress concept, even if it didn't fit the theme by like 10-20 years. Chloe Bailey's dress - despite being hideous - can be read as an extremely clever exploration of how women of the era used shaped garments to alter their silhouette. I genuinely liked it, when seen through that lens. Emma was adorable. Kendall's skirt was the most historically accurate thing in the whole video. Oh - and Kim only wore the real dress for 10 minutes, stated she didn't wear body makeup at all to avoid staining it, and wore a replica the rest of the evening. It's a good move to start dialogue - since her and Norma Jean Kelly were complete oppostes - Norma Jean didn't want to be Marilyn. Kim DESPERATELY CRAVES to be seen like Marilyn.",3년 전,181,

I also think the dress is iconic because of the who, the where and the when surrounding it. without Marilyn in that particular context, it's just a sparkly dress, something Kim has done before. the only reason we're even talking about it is because she took it's meaning from Marilyn, and there's something icky about it",3년 전,11,

@Mistardmuster,"Something that occurred to me was that several of the looks from this year would have fit into last year's Americana theme, while some looks from last year might have fit better last night. As an example Addison Rae's basic corset gown from last year would have been a slightly better fit given its shape--it's more reminiscent of late 19th century than the 70s popstar gown she wore this year--which would have fit much better last year. Kim K's wearing Marilyn's gown makes absolutely no sense in a Gilded Age theme but would have made much more sense in an Americana theme. It feels like all the designers are having a collective stroke and have no idea what they're doing anymore.",3년 전,31,

@noladiorez8305,I think the Gigi Hadid look did follow the theme. What is a bustle if not a way of 'cheating' to create a shape? The gilded age was about creating the perfect shape of that time. To me Hadid's gown made a (a being very important in this context) perfect shape. A perfect shape because our societies prefer a multitude of shapes. We do not have one type of perfection anymore. Anyway Gigi Hadids gown did do a Gilded age. It cheated its way into the perfect shape. The look both accented her feminine shape (the figure hugging dress and corset) and accentuated a layer around that - a shape we desire today: sexy but our own; feminine and at the same time a woman herself decides when that feminine shape is fully shown or seen.,3년 전,1,

@jennifercaballero4659,"I feel like the answer is pretty simple. Kim basically popularized the bbl body. which shien, fashion nova, all those types of brands took inspiration from. Those brands have made money off that body type by using models that are cut out copies of the Kardashians. Influencers that look like her also dress similar to her. We have now grown correlate that body type to cheap bodycan tight dresses sold by these companies. When we see kim in these high fashion pieces they end up looking cheap because we’ve already seen dresses that look exactly like this, only in cheaper fabrics and worn by influencers.",3년 전,137,
@northwoodfalls1403,"It’s impossible to say this without it coming across mean spirited which isnt my intention.  I don’t have the time or energy to hate on people I have no connection to.  The Kardashian’s exemplify the reality that there is an ocean of difference between being a brand and having style.  They don’t have style.  They just don’t.  Not in the Fashion sense of the word, anyhow.  A stylish person can wear a t shirt and jeans or sweat pants (like they live in) or a formal gown and it would all seem natural, effortless, and it would MAKE SENSE.  Their own essence would embody the clothing and some kind of alchemy happens and it’s just THEM and its interesting.  The Kardashian’s don’t wear their clothes, their clothes wear them and it never ever looks coherent.  Even Kendall, who seems lovely, actually, and who objectively has the most fashion sense of them all, doesn’t quite have it.  She mostly copies what her model friends do and, again, the clothes wear her.  It just is what it is.  Kim without Kanye telling her what to wear is just Kim falling back on what Paris told her to wear.  And that’s kinda what seemed to have happened with this huge mistake.  She reverted to Paris Hilton but she doesn’t have that true IDGAF that Paris has and it just …. was a famous dress wearing Kim Kardashian for the night against it’s will.",3년 전,72,

@mar1narasauc3,"IN DEFENSE OF CARDI: She is giving me Portrait of Madame X/John Singer Sargent silhouette and styling, She is literally GILDED in that she is dripping in gold but again the silhouette and neck line is highly referential to the gown in the 1883/1884 Madame X painting. Sargent was an icon in portraying sensual, feminine beauty during this period, consider the history of the painting, courtesy of the Met itself:  ""Working without a commission but with his sitter’s complicity, he emphasized her daring personal style, showing the right strap of her gown slipping from her shoulder. At the Salon of 1884, the portrait received more ridicule than praise. Sargent repainted the shoulder strap and kept the work for over thirty years."" Could you think of a more Gilded Age story to translate for Cardi B?  In the painting, the shoulder straps themselves, symbols of Madame X's daring sensual style AND her censure, are gold chains attached to the neckline with circular gold embellishments which already resembled the Versace coin motif.  I think the translation of the Versace coins  to a completely gilded version of the dress is genius, it's a rejection of Cardi and Madame X's censorship, and a celebration of Cardi's unabashedly sensual and bold style in the modern era.",3년 전,35,

Even now with Kim Kardashian we have a commodification by those in power of the black body. It’s truly a mind fuck to see Kim K and Billie Eillish in a bustle prancing about, both 200 year long extrapolations of a woman who died in captivity and whose body was reduced to shame and a style. I hope people search out more the meaning behind what we wear and what we deem beautiful.

Proof is :Kim K wears her dress, and there is a documentary on Netflix about her ! I think she should have worn an inspiration of that dress, to not damage the original one.

@heleenaassefa5203,"Theory on why there were so many flapper/20's looks- The designers were ultimately interested in pushing their ready to wear collections. The 2000's revival also inevitably means a 70's revival, since many 2000's trends were directly influenced by the 70s. The 70s were inspired by the 20s, which explains the confusing number of flapper/1920's looks on the carpet. Designers probably forsee a  20's revival, so they skewed the theme a bit for profits's sake.",3년 전(수정됨),509,
@chubby_cheesecake_cheeks,I think the first guy was more like military style part but I kinda find it off because it’s more modern military uniform. 😂 it’s the same uniform my cousin wore in the academy.

@taylorgayhart9497,"If you look at the history of the Met Gala and theme I think you can better understand why people don’t adhere to theme the way people wish they did. The theme for the Met Gala has typically been simple, the first one was “The World of Balenciaga” I believe, and so many people wore Balenciaga and many didn’t. The theme wasn’t a requirement for dress, just a fun way to make a boring charity event a little more interesting. It wasn’t until 2004 that we even saw the first “costume” with “Dangerous Liaisons: Fashion and Furniture in the 18th Century,” and even then it was one actress in an 18th-century hairstyle and inspired dress. It wasn’t until 2013 with “Punk: Chaos to Couture” that we saw a lot of people exploring the theme and having fun with it, and honestly think peak participation was with “China: Through the Looking Glass”, although “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” was my personal favorite. This one had the most potential in my opinion, but I think people are back to just wanting to wear a pretty dress, and aren’t as interested in investing the time into exploring the theme.",3년 전,25,
@chantellwarren3581," @tabathaogost4982  That’s such a weird claim. A theme doesn’t mean a costume party. No one’s was claiming that.

Stop making it seem unreasonable for people to ask fashion designers to be creative. They make pieces like this all the time for their collections. Blake lively choose to reinvent the theme. Hell even a reporter was dressed to match the theme. It’s upsetting because they don’t want to have fun with it and be creative which is the essence of fashion.
