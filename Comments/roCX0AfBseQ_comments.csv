@TheRankAmateur,"Been doing a variant of this for uears now. Instead of blending the bell pepper, onion, and tomato, I fine-chop it, and simmer with olive oil, garlic, basil, rosemary, and thyme, then apply to the bottom of my baking dish. Over the top, melted butter with some of the same herbs/seasonings, because it's French. Butter is required. 🤪 I usually have to make double of the piperade at the bottom, because it's great with so many things (including straight out of the baking dish 😂). To those trying out this recipe, don't fear it! I did initially, and a friend of mine helped me level my cooking game by making me take it on. Definitely worth it!",3개월 전,0,

@leo_8492,"Even though he said chicken stock, you can see the carton says vegetable stock, so it's totally fine.  There's not really an exact quantity in terms of how much vegetables you need. For a larger serving, use a larger baking tray and use as much as you need to fill it up. Your only limitation is how much red pepper sauce you have, so maybe double the quantities you see here if you need huge amounts, but it's not an exact science. Best of luck :)",1년 전,2,

@SpellboundWolf,"That looks wonderful. :) I had no idea what this dish was even made of before your video. The flashback Mr. Ego has is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in a film to this day. I haven't ever seen it before or attempted since. It's incredibly emotional & just think about it for a moment. The food is crafted SO well that it triggers a memory back to his own mother's cooking, a comfort food from his childhood. I think I cried when I first saw it because I was so emotionally moved. It's one of those scenes that I wish I could relive with fresh eyes. I hope the people whom wrote & animated that moment are very proud of themselves.",3년 전(수정됨),9,

@dervakommtvonhinten517," @python1972  ​ @3L3M3NT4LP4ND4  how does it make it easier? salt draws out moisture, no matter if its iodized or not.   and even if flaked salt is better in the cooking process which i doubt since the flakes tend to cause salt concentrations instead of finely granulated salt that spreads evenly, then why not call it that?  the name ""kosher salt"" doesnt make any sense since all salt is kosher. and when you give a recipe you have to name the ingredients you NEED. kosher salt isnt needed. to say ""use salt"" does the same job. thats why i called it pretentious.   its the same as some cooks saying ""use some himayalan pink rock salt"". makes it sound more fancy but ultimately doesnt matter. its NaCl and thats it.",4년 전,0,
@python1972," @dervakommtvonhinten517  How does this not get through your head?  Salt works.  Kosher salt works BETTER because those salt ""concentrations"" help draw more moisture out of the meat.  It's called kosher salt because it is the most effective salt for KOSHERING meats.  Finely granulated salt is not good for grabbing, and professional chefs measure in pinches not salt shakes, it also doesn't create even layers, the salt disintegrates in the heat due to it's small size.

@chandrawagner4061,"Ok! I made this last year and it was pretty good but a little bland (I think part of that was the blender issue). Something was missing. I made it again today, changing some things, and my fiance (who only says ""it's okay, to even professionally made stuff) came out and said ""that was actually really good"". He thought it would need more seasoning or just taste like vegetables, but it didnt! I'm so happy! So heres tips for people who dont have everything Babish does: -roasted the peppers in the oven, 450 for 30 min. I dont have an open flame.  -my blender is not high power like his (it's a ninja, didnt ""cook"" the sauce). I cooked the onion, garlic, peppers, and blanched tomatoes in a skillet prior to blending.  -I also added to the sauce fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, fresh basil, and a bay leaf while cooking, before blending. A touch of olive oil in the blender, salt and pepper. The sauce was amazing! Could add the chicken stock, but it I forgot and it was fantastic without it. And it goes great on chicken. -Last tip, before going in the oven and after arranging the vegetables, combine olive oil, fresh thyme, salt and pepper (any other desired seasoning), and pour it over the veggies. THEN put the parchment over and stick in the oven.   While i changed the recipe, i really want to thank Babish because this is the kind of really involved, long time frame dish I was scared to make and you showed me I could do it too! And now I've made something that took a long time but was really fun to make and my fiance loved! Thank you!",4년 전,3.9천,

In my family, the baked version shown here is referred to as Tian, which also describes the dish it's baked in. You must try la vraie ratatouille provençale, ideally with vegetables picked fresh the day you make it. I think it's even better the second day, served at room temp topped with a fried egg and some crusty bread.",5년 전,1,

@generalcodsworth4417,"Yes, confit byaldi and ratatouilli are both vegan. It is said in the movie that ratatouilli is a peasant dish. Meat was expensive a few centuries ago, so peasants ate vegetables.  Just because it lacks meat does not mean it can't taste delicious. The problem with vegan food comes when people act like raw, unseasoned lettuce and cellery is a vegan meal. These raosted vegetables with herbs and salt would have a very distinct taste that doesn't resemble rabbit food",4년 전,12,

Showing your appreciation actually takes , for you, some kind of skill,in the sense that you need to put your ego aside, you understand that? Appreciation is like a compliment,direct it towards the interested,not towards the internet. Had you said anything that resembled trying to directly communicate with the video poster,it would have been a true compliment,but no,you had to go with the idiotic repetition of something and adding a personal feeling about it; that's what I blame. By doing that,you do it for likes,not for the appreciation you claim to give. You wanted to be cool on the internet,like your gen wants. Thats what I'm revealing.

From my perspective, the only bit which could suggest hypocrisy are the last four words. But it's difficult, at least for me, to find the poster's tone and goals behind fourteen characters (excluding spaces and punctuation).

I truly never seen something so intricate and perfect. This is beauty and grace. Am I the only one seeing this for it's worth? At first I was annoyed at a certain someone but as I read on, I just felt happy. Glee. Laughter.

@marchel121707,"I agree with Toto to an extent, Why do people comment things that we can clearly see in the video? Unless it’s a timestamp joke or a question. But I also I see this Toto’s type all the time in comment sections. They love to argue and “expose” hypocrites, fake fans, and trigger people for the fun of it. I have no problem with it since it’s really just harmless. But that doesn’t mean I’m annoyed by it. Like, do you really have to be an asshole? In society’s terms they would see you as a complete moron who is just rude. Smh, what are boomers doing?!? Toto’s type are usually men/women who are above 20 who probably eat shit. Why? Cause they speak shit, talk like they’re intellectuals, and call us out for being zoomers. Example: “Nuh uh, you a zoomer. You really can’t be bothered to think on my level. You are just like the others.” Sounding like an edgy teen-headass. (Ngl, I think they get off to the arguments, just saying :/ )   On to another thing, why does their bait work so well? Cause emotions are easily triggered. They do this to boost their ego in times of great sadness, they are also mega Hippocrites. Hippocrites are internet goblins who are fat and ugly, it’s like hippos. You know what else they have in common with hippos? Their mouth, their mouth is so big that it just spews words and bullshit.

@dragonrblx9080," @mirabile1221   If so, I have but one conclusion to say. I will be the JoJo Narrator at the end of every episode, every sad death, every season, and every major event. Here is my Conclusion:   This war, indeed, was started by two people, whether good or not. One, was the Commenter, whose comment was not only positive, but wholesome and honest. While on the other hand, the replier, replied with almost toxic levels of negativity, not only ridiculed the commenter, but also sought destruction, and chaos. Well, he got what he wanted, in some ways. But in others, he lost ultimately by his own undoing. Either side, made good points. But one would lose, because of themselves. So I tell you this, the final lesson to this 5 or maybe even 6 month war.   While yes, there is indeed a “bad side” and a “good side”, neither were completely justified and or right. So, who ultimately won? For that, that should be your choice. No one, including your family, should persuade you to agree with something you may or may not have ideals that agree with them. So go ahead, choose a side. It doesn’t matter now that it’s over. But be aware that some people will disagree or agree with your choices, and statements. So with that, I end this. See all of you later, and stay safe in quarantine. Farewell, comrades. PS. If I have anything to add to it, this reply will be edited or modified.",4년 전,5,

@Oursonliquid,"shreks_swamp, it is still a common dish in south of France. It comes from occitan (a medieval language spoken only in this area). During the 18 century, most of this language was used as slangs. « Rata » means military ration, and it became the name of this dish : easy to cook, not expensive. Most of the military of the french army ate this dish if they were in the area, and peasants too. That’ s why it’s not very well considered",5년 전,95,
@mr.joseph7088,Well...still...roasted vegetables have never hurt anybody. Thats probably the reason why Ego had that flashback. Because it quite literally reminded him that his mother used to make that same food. The first food he ever ate and loved was his mother's.,5년 전,81,

Eating Remy's dish at the end reminded of his mother's cooking and the love she poured into making him meals because she loved him thus making him come to understand why Everyone can cook.

@shaibalmondal9669,He was Gordan Ramsay xd,5년 전,1,
@Leto_0,"I think it's a combination of what you guys said. He was almost definitely depressed, and he was probably searching for the heart warming home cooking feeling, and maybe his mom was also a great cook.   He was sad as a boy though, so he was probably dealing with something like a missing father, or maybe he thought differently than most people so he was an outsider his whole life. He seemed intelligent so I think he was a jaded, cynical intellectual, who enjoyed criticizing everyone else. One of the reasons people criticize others is to tell themselves that what they don't have or can't have isn't worth having.   And that all comes together to create a downward spiral, up until you have a life changing moment that shifts your perspective and lets you experience some of what you've been missing.",5년 전(수정됨),29,

@gameplaysz5306,"“La vida de un crítico es sencilla en muchos aspectos, arriesgamos poco, y tenemos poder sobre aquellos que ofrecen su trabajo y su servicio a nuestro juicio. Esperamos con las críticas negativas – divertidas de escribir y leer- pero la triste verdad que debemos afrontar, es que en el gran orden de las cosas, cualquier basura tiene más significado que lo que deja ver nuestra crítica. Pero en ocasiones el crítico si se arriesga cada vez que descubre y defiende algo nuevo… el mundo suele ser cruel con el nuevo talento, las nuevas creaciones… lo nuevo, necesita amigos. Anoche experimente algo nuevo, una extraordinaria cena de una fuente singular e inesperada, decir sólo que la comida y su creador han desafiado mis prejuicios sobre la buena cocina subestimaría la realidad. Me han tocado en lo más profundo. En el pasado, jamás oculté mi desdén por el famoso lema del chef Gusteau: ´Cualquiera puede cocinar´. Pero al fin me doy cuenta de lo que quiso decir en realidad: ´No cualquiera puede convertirse en un gran artista, pero un gran artista puede provenir de cualquier lado´. Es difícil imaginar un origen más humilde que el del genio que ahora cocina en el restaurante Gusteau, y quien, en opinión de este crítico, es nada menos que el mejor chef de Francia. Pronto volveré a Gusteau… hambriento”.",5년 전,0,

@esewey1296,"La vida de un crítico es sencilla en muchos aspectos, arriesgamos poco y tenemos poder sobre aquellos que ofrecen su trabajo y su servicio a nuestro juicio. Prosperamos con las críticas negativas, divertidas de escribir y de leer, pero la triste verdad que debemos afrontar es que en el gran orden de las cosas, cualquier basura tiene más significado que lo que deja ver nuestra crítica. Pero en ocasiones el crítico si se arriesga cada vez que descubre y defiende algo nuevo, el mundo suele ser cruel con el nuevo talento; las nuevas creaciones, lo nuevo, necesita amigos. Anoche experimente algo nuevo; una extraordinaria cena de una fuente singular e inesperada. Decir solo que la comida y su creador han desafiado mis prejuicios sobre la buena cocina, subestimaría la realidad; me han tocado en lo más profundo. En el pasado jamás oculte mi desdén por el famoso lema del chef Gusteau: Cualquiera puede cocinar. Pero al fin me doy cuenta de lo que quiso decir en realidad; no cualquiera puede convertirse en un gran artista, pero un gran artista puede provenir de cualquier lado. Es difícil imaginar un origen más humilde que el del genio que ahora cocina en el restaurante Gusteau´s y quien, en opinión de este critico, es nada menos que el mejor chef de Francia. ¡Pronto volveré a Gusteau´s hambriento!",5년 전,0,

@dilatado3048,"El trabajo del crítico es sencillo en más de un sentido. Arriesgamos muy poco, y sin embargo usufructuamos de una posición situada por encima de quienes someten su trabajo y su persona a nuestro juicio. Prosperamos gracias a nuestras críticas negativas, que resultan divertidas cuando se las escribe y cuando se las lee.  Pero la cruda verdad que los críticos debemos enfrentar es que, en términos generales, la producción de basura promedio es más valiosa que lo que nuestros artículos pretenden señalar. Sin embargo, a veces el crítico realmente arriesga algo, y eso sucede en nombre y en defensa de algo nuevo.  Anoche experimenté algo nuevo, una comida extraordinaria hecha por alguien único e inesperado. Decir que ese plato y su cocinero pusieron a prueba mis preconceptos equivaldría a incurrir en una subestimación grosera, cuando lo cierto es que ambos lograron conmover lo más profundo de mi ser.  Antes de este suceso, nunca escondí mi desdén por el lema del Chef Gusteau: “cualquiera puede cocinar”. Pero, me doy cuenta, recién ahora comprendo sus palabras. No cualquiera puede convertirse en un gran artista, pero un gran artista sí puede provenir de cualquier lugar.",5년 전,0,

@scarlet3080," @MSRooky350z   (edited because I misunderstood your comment. My bad, I wasn't concentrating) Anyway, you asked when do we need to call people stupid, right? Well, obviously not for this one. This is about people discovering that ratatouille, a food, is made of ingredients that they didn't expect when they were kids. This assumption was harmless, so why should we call them stupid by knowing things a bit late than others? It's different if they actually act stupidly like you said, and harm themselves or others in the process.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@MSRooky350z," @oddluck4180  first of, that's exactly what stupid means. seriously.   but to be more precise, the problem is not, that they as kids did not recognize a vegtable that was shown as an ingredient 5 seconds before the ingredients were put together, that is indeed stupid but i would let it slip because they were children (maybe? i mean, 12 years ago is not so long ago, assuming everyone saw the movie the first and only time when it came out...)but that they literally took that into adulthood. You can't deny that it speaks volumes to not think about something that was obviously important enough to be remembered for 12 years and brought up under this video. Just accept that not thinking is stupid and good is, why are we discussing it? And there where obviously enough people who have thaught and remembered, so what makes them different? You can try to find an excuse for every stupid mistake, just so you don't have to face the reality of some people beeing dumber than others. i have never even mentioned any repressesions for them, they just have to face the fact that they are obviously not that smart. that's all. i haven't even mentioned any hate or things like that against them. i just pointed out how stupid that mistake is.  and your example is pretty flawed. it belongs to the same group of animals and is closely related to dinosaurs and was long considered one. no one ever considered these vegetables to be any kind of sausage. Or does anyone still believe they have meant the peppers...  it would have made more sense if you have compared a t-rex and an ichtyornis^^",5년 전,0,
@scarlet3080," @MSRooky350z  Another I want to add is how you think it's needed for the grown-ups to research about a movie that they watched as a kid. Ratatouille is a great movie, but most people wouldn't think about it that much throughout their life to the point they want to do research about what's the food made of. I watched Ratatouille years ago. I liked it, but it was never my favourite movie and I wasn't very invested in it. I forgot most of the scenes so yes, I didn't know what ratatouille is made of. And there is no French restaurant where I lived, so I have no knowledge about it. If you're gonna ask why I'm not searching about it ... well, why would I? I have no passion in cooking and I've got every food I need back home. I cared not for ratatouille, moreover of what it made of.",5년 전,0,
@MSRooky350z," @scarlet3080  they SHOWED THE INGREDIENTS, was that not obvious enough? it is stupid according to every definition of the word, so why shouldn't we call them that? you don't know that the more intelligent people are, the more they think about everything they know or experience, do you? I have not mentioned it (at least in the beginning) as a bad thing either, i just said it was stupid because it is. is not facing your own stupidity helping anyone? does it kill people to face the fact that they were stupid?the only people making it a bad thing are people NOT WANTING to realize that they are not as smart as others and try to make points. as long as you realize that you are not up to the same level and behave like that and stick to what you know, beeing stupid is nothing bad at all. so, who are the people who are really  discriminating or making it a bad thing? the bad intentions were give by people, not by the word itself.",5년 전,1,
@scarlet3080," @MSRooky350z  Facing our own stupidity is different than calling other people stupid. Let them face it their own, no need to insult them. That's my point. But you know what?

I admit that I can see your points now and I do agree that stupidity isn't bad at its root. I simply dislike the way you call people lacking of brain cells, and some other things you said.

@SunyiSideUp," @MSRooky350z  You're very strange. It's a cartoon. The animated version of these vegetables might have not been clear to someone who watched it when they were a child. In the final dish, all you see are colorful disks. It's not like it looks like regular ratatouille, which usually just has cut up pieces of vegetables and is easily identifiable. Besides that, it's not like American children don't eat those vegetables. What is your point? You sound like you just want to be right. Like, congratulations, you're smarter than American six-year-olds. Would you like your prize, now? (Also, contrary to the name, ratatouille is only served towards the end of the movie. Remy cooks a lot of things before he finally makes the famous ratatouille.)",5년 전,1,
@SunyiSideUp," @MSRooky350z  like, I know for certain you watched a movie as a child and misinterpreted something. I certainly did. Especially if it's outside of your culture. How is this such an outlandish concept to you? Is it just because the description ""American"" was used? Because I've noticed Europeans love to do the whole ""Americans are stupid"" thing about shit they do themselves. I know a lot of Korean people who misinterpreted stuff from movies because they're American or English and they had cultural differences. But not you, you came into this world already knowing everything about every culture on Earth and never misinterpreted anything from any movie or TV show you watched as a kid, and you knew every dish and every ingredient in every dish that everyone eats around the world, even when it's cut into an unidentifiable shape or animated in a movie, and all Americans are dumber than you, even though you're watching an American cooking video with an American cook who you probably think is pretty talented and knowledgeable, if you're here. 🙃 It's jackass behavior. Also ""American"" doesn't mean we're all the same. ""American"" is a word used to describe people who are citizens often of the United States or also of any county within North or South America. We are every race, culture, and a multitude of Nationalities. We're immigrants and Natives and the descendants of slaves. We can't possibly all fit into your stereotypes and I'm tired of y'all looking at MAGAts and deciding they represent my Halfrican ass and every other ethnic person living in this country (or these continents). It's fucked up, like, I'm not even one of the people who thought there's pepperoni in ratatouille, because I've eaten it a lot (I'm a New Yorker and I like French food, which is easier to find in NYC than many American cities), but I still don't think anyone is stupid for thinking the red disk in the PIXAR ratatouille, which doesn't look like regular ratatouille, is pepperoni. Especially as a child, who is probably used to seeing little slices of pepperoni like that, and isn't aware of what goes into the regular recipe let alone the fancy version Remy comes up with. Add that to the fact that so many people are saying they're NOT American and also thought it was pepperoni, and this is even more stupid of you. I'm not saying we don't have idiot hellspawn in America that make it hard for everyone, but Jesus, the idea that someone's geography can affect their intelligence is literally colonial bullshit and it has got to stop.",5년 전,1,

So being a chef, even if not professionally anymore, I cook dinner for her from scratch to make that night special. I'm always looking for new dishes to try out every week to give my grandmother a variety of choice, improve where my skills are strongest, and most importantly challenge myself to actually try to do things that are way outside of my culinary comfort zone {swinging-by-the-belt-loops cooking, experimenting, etc}! (I'm admittedly that one cook who's always going by the recipe in front of me, from the ingredients' exact measurements down to the last period. The idea of tweaking recipes here and there always bugged me. Unfortunately, that black-and-white way of doing things stunted my professional growth as a result. Never too late to change things, right?} @Binging with Babish, you're one of my go-to sources for new recipes and dinner ideas!  I recently made the ratatouille again. Since I don't have a mandolin slicer that worked properly and I can't manually slice anything equally thin to save my life, I had to improvise. I changed the recipe just a teensy weensy bit, replacing the original 1/8"" slices with a medium or large dice (size can vary by preference).

It's an online joke that originated from Frankenstein where people confuse the monster with having the titular name instead of Frankenstein's monster. The rat's name (Remy btw) gets confused with the title of the movie too so people started joking that his name was Ratatouille's monster.

@youthgirl08,My grandma did a different version of this recipe that was so great (since she has died I've been craving it like crazy). My grandma would wash all the veggies then she would let them bake open before cutting them in the oven to let slightly crisp. Then after taking them out she cut everything in cubes & put in a casserole dish to bake again except this time with seasoning (same as above in video). After she brought it out she put it in a bowl to serve & added what juices was left on top (there typically was a good amount of fresh hot seasoned juices).  It was so good. *Homer Simpson drool *,6년 전,0,

@Kurokun01,"Not my own answer, but  ""Jason Kelly Jason Kelly 2 months ago I like how everyone thinks it was made of meat and cheese. Ratatouille is a peasant dish, AS MENTIONED IN THE MOVIE ITSELF! Peasants had no access to meats and cheese in France, so they made do with vegetables and spices. Pepperoni and mozarella would've not only been from Italy and thus twice as expensive due to import prices, but also something peasants had no access to anyways. Most of culinary genius was invented by the poor. Naturally flavorful foods were reserved for the rich and nobility, so the poor had to discover ways to create flavor through experimentation, trial, and error.""",7년 전,10,

Does it bother you that much or is it just another opportunity to shit on America as is so popular on YouTube, despite the fact that most people making those comments don't know any more about the U.S. than Americans know about you.

@potato-whiz,"T0pMan15 no I'm saying if someone puts a tomato in front of a person and they go, ""oh, that's a pepperoni,"" then yeah, we have problems. I'm saying your perception as a child has nothing to do with your education level or awareness. I used to think all kinds of silly things when I was child that I learned wasn't so as I got older. I have personally never seen the movie and don't know how much the tomatoes looked like peppeeonis, but we are all only guided by our experiences. All of us. If that's what you're exposed to when young that's what you'll see. There's also this perception that everything that originates in America is shit. Why? It's just sausage. You don't have sausage in your country? And have you ever actually has pepperoni? It's bomb. If you were watching an animated movie and some character broke out some pepperoni would you know what it is just by looking? How would you distinguish it from any other form of sausage? You just need to feel superior and smarter than everyone and chose the dumbed possible place to weild your bull shit superiorty complex. People like you are why the YT comments section is cancer.  Chao!",7년 전,0,
@T0pMan15,"Coolcookiegirl if you watch this youtube clip you can clearly see the outlines of a tomato. I don't think everything originates in America, but pepperoni is not authentic to British cuisine. Britain and Germany are well known for their traditional pork sausages. Spain is more well known for cured sausages like chorizo. I've tried pepperoni, it doesn't wow me that much. The only time you experience pepperoni where I'm from is on a pizza. American's use pepperoni in their cuisine much more than other countries.   You can distinguish different sausages by colour and size",7년 전,0,
@potato-whiz,"T0pMan15 I didn't say you thought everything originated in America. I said there's a propensity to label everything that originates here as shit when it isn't. Pepperoni originated in the US and is an American take on spiced salami. That's what I don't get. It's just sausage. Not sure what it not being authentic to British cuisine has to do with it. I know chorizo, I'm Mexican. We also don't use pepperoni that much either. It's not some American staple. It's mostly used on pizza too and the occasional sandwich and salad. We're hardly eating sausage every day. That seems to be a misperception you have.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
@T0pMan15,"Coolcookiegirl I'm saying that pepperoni is not authentic to British cuisine nor any other  European/Indian/Chinese cuisine (it was just an example). Therefore you wouldn't expect to see pepperoni in any of these cuisines dishes. You asked me if I had sausage in my country and I said yes, but pepperoni is not part of these traditional cuisines. Nah you're right, the American staple is just putting a ton of cheese or sugar in a dish and there's a lot of Americans are simply 'amazed' by that. Lmao. Like cheese is good I get it, just ask the French/British. But not every dish needs cheese.  An american recipe I saw for a chicken pie added a ton of cheese and I was like that's a crime lol! A savoury meat pie does not need cheese in it at all, just pour some gravy over it and you're good. Another example, American recipe to make teriyaki: Soy sauce, Honey, Brown Sugar (like really? Honey is already sweet you don't need to add more sugar)",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Also, I don't care which way. To be, or not to be, tomatoes. WHO cares.

@T0pMan15,Sarah Folsom do you think I studied the film as kid lmao? No. But I had the brains to realise it was a tomato.

@potato-whiz,"T0pMan15 ok, so not only are you a know it all try hard but you have no idea what Americans actually eat and enjoy. I never said pepperoni was authentic to Britain or anywhere else. I was pretty clear it originated in the US and is an American take on spiced sausage, as many countries have done their versions of. There's nothing wrong with it other than it's American and you inexplicably look down your self important nose at us. What's hilarious is you don't even know how ignorant you actually. ""You guys put salt and cheese on everything!"" Man...you really are just a pompous ass. America is a big country with a lot of different cuisines and flavors an tastes. You saw a recipe once and think you know everything about what we eat. That's too hilarious.  P.S. you were that appalled at how much cheese was in the recipe you saw?

I just wanted to thank you and show my appreciation on this awesome video, if I hadn’t seen it I would’ve never even thought of that idea so thank you so much!",5년 전,0,
