And a grades of fucking Giants bro in a crazy Giants that were exhumed back when they were taking all the giant bodies out of the United States and hide them in various places and other parts of the world you can still find a few caves few places where the government has a hidden stuff like a Rupa where you can openly go and view the graves of giants that are setting system caves almost like a museum. Here in America that she got hidden by all the people in the thirties forties and fifties religious revisionism of History we had here around United States and in Europe. Said by Native American ancestors that these were evil cannibalistic monsters as extremely intelligent as they were extremely Barbara stick what's really unique is some of these horns skulls were found in various parts of the world with the Giants first I thought they were fake until they were examined X-rays and examination showed that these beings being called supernatural beings had horns That Grew naturally supposedly they're called the Nephilim the children of Dark Angels That Grew into misshapen horrific Twisted inhuman monsters I'm not sure exactly what I believe or not the fact remains that there are giant bodies across the world and they're not just a random person here there with an out-of-control pituitary gland their genetic race of people whether they were the intelligent well control super intelligent Anunnaki or they were the brutal insane creatures these white skin red-haired giants that were spoken of all over the world and across United States here they're seeing everywhere everywhere that they were pyramids everywhere that there were Stone Hills and we might solve the giant sites were huge stones have been moved around to make giant fortresses and Effigies and burial mounds Stones way too big to where we don't know how they are moved to can't quite figure it out well these Giants were there and they put the best stone axes posing the same what you doing now but in a longer process and I guess when they're done they're quite magnificent like this darted in the Stone Age process but then they took it further and further. Supposedly some areas there were giant metal axes forged in Fire Island places where they didn't have access to metal they built very well with stone and even seem to know way to melt stone or liquefy some type of stone and to add to these axes and to make them and there were supposedly some that were created made somehow almost out of a concrete or liquid stone or somewhere just the blade made it as you did but then they were modified and modified again and again make it something extremely unique and cool but the very least they found some the way you made them just much much bigger.",2년 전,0,

@jesusisgod2953,"Are you saved? Where will you go when you die? Heaven or hell?   The Gospel, which means the Good News is the news that God Almighty, the Creator came in the flesh as Jesus Christ to take away the sin of the world. The one God is a trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son came and laid down his own life to save ours.  His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for our redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. Although God's creation was created perfect, having no death, sickness and disease, the creation became corrupted through Adam and Eve in them disobeying God. In this rebellion the creation became fallen through the curse of sin and mankind became separated from God. This world is fallen, but God offers reconciliation to him through his provision at the cross. Ultimately God will restore his creation to perfection when he returns but those that reject his offer of redemption will remain condemned by their sins and go to hell.   John 1:1,14 KJV In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and THE WORD WAS GOD. [14] And THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH, and dwelt among us,  1 John 3:8 KJV He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.  Isaiah 9:6 KJV For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty GOD, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.

@ralphm4132,"3:03 this brief shot is critically important and I want everyone to understand the significance:  The axe blade does NOT bear on the sides of the hole, only the ends. Every blow with the axe drives the axe head into the hole. If that force went to the sides, the axe handle would split very soon, and even binding around it would not help much.  Because the force is applied to the ends of the hole, they are in effect trying to stretch the handle lengthwise, and the grain of wood is very good at resisting tension.",2년 전,1.6천,

Nun haben wir die meisten Wälder ja aber weggerodet, und der größte Teil der Landschaft sind Äcker, Dörfer, Straßen und Städte..?   Eigentlich wissen wir doch, dass der Wald (den wir am Meisten kaputt machen) extrem wichtig für ein Überleben ist.(auch als Gesellschaft) !?! Warum machen wir die Wälder unserer kleinen Erde immer mehr kaputt, obwohl wir wissen, dass es Scheiße ist??  Menschen, und ihre Logik ..  - Das oberste Gebot eines Jeden Survivalers sollte doch sein, die Wälder zu schützen, und möglichst zu ihrer Gesundung, und Vergrößerung beizutragen!!?

@jlongmasbartholomew,"I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days. Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians. And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge"".  1 Nephi 1-3   Hello friends, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  The verses above are the first three verses in The Book of Mormon.  I know this probably isn't the most ideal place to talk about religion but I really do want you to know that God loves you.  You may not love Him or care about Him at all, but He still will continue to love you.  You are a beloved son or daughter of God.  He knows you personally and He truly and deeply desires for your happiness.  He loves everyone who has every lived on this earth, with a perfect equal love regardless of their race, gender, ethnicity, faith and values and beliefs.   The Lord loves you more than you can think or comprehend.  ""He inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile"" 2 Nephi.  He is our loving, caring Heavenly Father.  We are literally His children and creations.  When we were in the womb, he knew about us"" Jerimiah 4:5.  He knitted us and we were created in His image.    I testify to you that you and I are not a mistake.  He knows the very moment when we stand and when we sit.  He is familiar with all our ways and knows us personally who we are.  The hairs on our very head are numbered.  God loved us so much, He sent His Only Begotten Son for us, that we may be able to return and dwell in the presence of God again.  The Lord has not forgotten about us even when it feels like He has.  He will never forsake us.  When we are happy, He and His angels rejoice alongside us.  When we are sad, He heals us and lifts us up from our trials.  He has always been there for us.  He has always been our loving, compassionate Heavenly Father and God.  Will we always be His children and people?  I testify to you that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ.  Both love you exceedingly and rejoice when you are happy. They both love you so much.  They love you with a love unfeigned.  They will never ever stop doing good unto you.  I know that The Book of Mormon is true.  ""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost"".  Moroni 10:4  I promise and testify to you, that if you will read The Book of Mormon, ponder on its message and ask God if it is not true, you will come to know of its truthfulness, whether its true or not true.    Remember my friends that God loves you with all his heart, might mind, soul and strength.  He wants you to be happy.  He knows what you are going through and dealing with right now.  He desires for you to return back to Him.  Unfortunately, He has been misrepresented and seen as a cruel and angry God who anticipates for us to slip and writes down every mistake we make waiting to punish us by those who do not know or know Him fully.  My friends, God has stored many opportunities and blessings for you.  He is incredibly eager and desires with all His heart to bless you abundantly.  He wants you to live with Him again.  He only wants the best for you and your well being.  He wants to experience everlasting joy and indescribable happiness in this life and in the life to come.  He wants you to partake of His goodness and come and follow Him.  The Lord does not care how early or late you decide to come unto Him.  I testify to you that if you have strayed and wondered off the path that there is hope in Jesus Christ, The Savior of the world.  The Lord accepts those who come unto Him whether your early, late or just in time who desire to change.  The Lord will accept you wholeheartedly and forgive you if you are willing to change.  The Lord will welcome you and will always be ready to embrace you with open arms.  The Lord will lift us up in our trials and use us to bless the lives of those around us if we are willing to change.  If you desire to learn more, you are always welcome to visit comeuntochrist.org.  There you will learn more about The Church of Jesus Christ and our core beliefs and values.  If you have taken the time to read The Book of Mormon and this comment, thank you.  It takes a huge leap of faith and a lot of courage to muster enough faith to read in the Book of Mormon and to believe in something in a personage that you may never see in this lifetime.  Although we may not be able to see God and Jesus Christ in this life, I testify to you that they are real.  They do truly exist.  I promise you that if you will pray to know of their existence, you will come to know whether they exist or have been made up.    You are my friends.  The Lord loves you and despite all our weaknesses, complaining, arguing, and shortcomings, he still loves us and will forgive us if we will humble ourselves before Him and diligently seek correction and do whatever is needed to repent.  Remember that The Lord is always available to talk to through prayer 24/7.  No question sounds too silly for Him.  James wrote, ""If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him"" James 1:5.  If you must know whether or not something is true or evil and deceptive, you can always pray to God.  He will help you know what the truth is and what is not the truth. He will never be too busy to talk to.  He will give you strength you need to overcome and conquer your temptations and will give you the strength you need to endure through your trials and afflictions.  Paul said that The Lord will not give you temptations that you cannot resist, but that in your temptations, He will provide a way for you to resist, overcome and conquer them.  He will provide a way.  He wants to bless you and reward you abundantly.  The Lord knows you and will not forget you.  You are loved.  You are utterly amazing.  You have incredible potential.  You are not forgotten or ever will be forsaken.  You are special.  You are unique.  You are one of a kind.  You have been reserved for this time and The Lord needs you on His side.  It simply would not be the same without you.  Thank you for your time.",3년 전,5,

Bu çağların hiç birisi yaşanmadı.Amozn ormanlarında 2000 li yıllara kadar taş devrine girmemiş kabileler budu bilim adamları.Arada sırada haberlere çıkardı.Gerçek şu ki Amazon ormanlarında Avrupadan daha büyük ve kalabalık şehirler ve nufus vardı.Tarım yapmanın imkansız olduğu asidik topraklarda bir çeşit torf geliştirerek tarım yapmanın yolunu bulmuşlardır.Sözüm ona çok zeki modern  bilim adamları bu torfun sırrını hala çözemediler.Fiziksel ve kimyasal çözülme inanılmaz fazla olduğu için  taş yok.Bu yüzden taş devri saçmalığı da yok.Hiç çivi tel v.s kullanmdan ağaçlardan devasa evler yapmışlar.Tarımın imkansız olduğu topraklarda tarım yapıp bu kalabalık nufusu beslemişlerdir.  https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x10etha    BElgesel. Amozun kayıp şehirleri.Mutlka izleyin.Bize öğretilen medeniyet tarihini sorgulycaksnız. Aynı şekilde Maya medeniyeti bizim Ege bölgesi kadar bir alanda kurulduğu halde 10 milyon  civarı nüfusu(16. yüzyılda avrupa nufusu 30 milyon) patetes ve mısır yetiştirerek beslediklerini itiraf ediyorlar.ama Daha düne kadar Aztek ve Mayaların yazıyı  bilmediklerini iddia ediyorlardı.Nasıl takvim yapmışlar?Piramit yapmışlar? Diye soran bilim adamı da yoktu.Aslında bizim kullandığımız yazı siteminden daha gelişmiş insan yüzlerinden oluşan bir alfabe kullandıkları ortaya çıktı.Afrika'ya  avrupalılar(Aslında Moğoların önüden kaçan orta asya beyazları)  geldiklerinde Timbuktu gibi bir krallıkla karşılaştılar.Gelişmiş şehirleri ve bu şehirlerin kanalizasyon sistemleri vardı.Gelişmiş katılımcı beledeyicelik anlayşıyla yolları ,binaları,kanalizasyon sistemlerini birlikte yapıyorlardı.Milyon ciltlik kütüphaneleri vardı.Avrupa'da böylesi yoktu.Malide yaşayan Dogan kabilesi sirus takım yıldız ve astronomi hakkında bu kadar kadim bilgiyi nereden öğrendi sanıyorsunuz.Modern siyasetin katılımcı belediyecilik anlayışını çok daha önce uygulamışlardı.Bugün atalarından kalan binaları her yıl yine birlikte tadilat yaparlar.Aborjinler yine çok sıcak büyük çoğunluğu çöl olan bir coğrafyada yaşadıkları için günde 12-14 saat uyuyorlardı.Yani rüyalarda yaşayan bir insan  ırkıydı.Kültürleri böyle gelişti.Uyku enstrumanları bugün modern pisikiatride bu ilkel isnanların uyku hastalıkların tedavisinde kullanılıyor.Mühendislik harikası bumeranga ne demeli? Moğol ordusunda savaşan Aborjin generaller. Minyatürlere dikkat ediniz. Çok daha fazlası çinlilerin elinde var.Çinde ve Moğolarda yer alan yüksek  aborjin genini açıklıyor(K DNA).Tayvan halkı da aborjin kölenldir.Hani şu küçük ada devleti olup dünyanın en çok ihracat yapan devletlerinden.Avrupalılara göre bu aborjinler evrimin kayıp halkasıydı.H Hayvan gibi avladılar.İçlerini doldurup avrupada müzelerde evrimin kayıp halkası diye sergilediler.Orjinal  uzak doğulularda pigme ırkındangelemdir.Çin minyatürlerinde Moğolarla ve aborjinlerle karışmadan önce pigme çinlileri çok rahat görebilirsiniz.Endenozya takımadalarıdna filipinlerde hala yüzlerce pigme  köyü vardır.Papua yeni gine  halkı pigme ırkındadır.Andaman adları siyahdır.Pasifik yerlileri siyahdır.Sadece malezya ,Endenozya gibi ülkelere moğolarla  karışmış çinli göçü olarak bu bölgelerin genetiği değişti.Endenozya ve Malezyaa hala çok ciddi bir çinli nufus var.Endenozya halkının  boyu bu yüzden ortalama 1,50 olup dünyanın en kısa  halkıdır.Daha izoledir.Kuzeye doğru çinde moğolarla ve türklerle daha fazla karışım olmuştur. Moğol ordusunda aborjin generaller.  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mongol+abirginal+sodier&atb=v229-1&iax=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fb%2Fbd%2FLiu-Kuan-Tao-Jagd.JPG%2F250px-Liu-Kuan-Tao-Jagd.JPG&ia=images  tayvan aborjinleri: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mongol+abirginal+sodier&atb=v229-1&iax=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2F0%2F01%2FTaiwanese_Aborigine_leopard_fur_by_Torii_n7550.jpg&ia=images  Şunu unutmayın medeniyet coğrafyaya öre şekilenir.  Aynı şekilde İnka  kültürü bir dağ medeniyetiydi.Medeniyet kurulmazz diye coğrafya dersinde öğretikleri Kongo Havzasında avrupadan daha kalabalık bir nusuf vardı.Belçika kralı Leopol da sadece 13 milyon Kongoluyu öldürmüştü.Buarya dikkat edin.LEopold motoksiletine atlayıp soykım yaptı.Tıpkı Hitler gibi.Belçika halkının hiç suçu yok.Sanki Kongonun zenginliği belçikaya akmamış gibi.13 milyon öldürülen nufus Kongo nufüsunun   yarısıydı Düzenli tarım faliyetleri olmadan bu kadar nufusu besleyemzsiniz.Sadece Kongo Havzasındaki nufusun bile neredeyse  dönemin avrupası  kadar olduğu gerçeğiyle yüzleşiyorsunuz.Bu insanlar acaba o dönemde sıtma ile mücadele yolunuda biliyorlar olabilirmiydi?Tıpkı geliştirdikleri  torfu soykırımlar ve medeniyetlerin çökmesi sonucu unutan amazon yerlileri gibi...Nazka çölü, şili patogonyda pigmeler bir kültür kurdu.Pigme ceninlerini uzaylı diye gösterip sulandırlar.Bu bölgenin dnası genetik haritalarda hala soru işaretli bırakılır.Avrupanın ilk sakinleri siyahlardı.Morada yaşayan Yunanlılar hala %50 E1B1 sub-sahra etiyopya geni taşır.Osmalıdan ayrılan gerçek yunanistan burada kurulmuştur..Osmanlı sayesinde balkanlar  30 yıl ve 100 yıl gibi ırk savaşlarını yaşamadığı için I ve E gibi siyah insanların geni hala baskındır.Diğer Avrupada aşağıda blgeselde yer alan Kazak Niyazov ataları Hunlarla gelen ve diğer moğolların önünden kaçan kıpçak vs kabilerin genleri baskındır.Bu gerçeği örtbas ederler( bu göçşler çin şu siteye baknız:  http://www.realhistoryww.com/   )  .İspanyol kaşif amozon nehrinin 20 km gittiklerini başkentlerin nehrin sağlı solu 20km  bitmediğini bu kadar  büyük şehrin avrupada olmadığını yazmış.Tüfek ,mikrop ,çelik belgeselini izleyenlere söyliyeyim.Sanayi devriminden çok daha önce Bulat çeliği Türk moğol ordusunda kulanılmış.Bulat çeliği diye araştırn .Yine ŞAm çeliği.Orta asyda aşı ve mikropda biliniyordu.Aynı aşılama yöntemini çiçek üzerinde osmanlılarda uygulamış fransız seyyah kalem yazmış.HAtta mezar taşın üzerinde dahi  türklerin çiçek aşını bir çeşit aşılama ile halleddiklerini  yazar.Veba taşıyan fareleri  moğollar  mancınıklarala  kıpçaklar üzerine atılıyor.Kırım kalesinde bunalrada avrupaya taşıyor.sibiryada yaşayan bu kavimlerinde  savaşçı olamasın sebebi çok zor iklim.Yiyecek kaynakaları kısıtlı.Diğer kavimleri i yağmalıyorlar.Altayalarda bol bulunan demir filizi ve kalori çok yüksek  sibirya kömürü sayesinde daha güçlü silahlar yaparak yayılıyorlar.Aynı şekilde top tüfek avrupadan çok daha önce asyada kulanılıyor.Yiliside , kundaklı tüfeklerde.Wikipedia Barut imparatorlukları makalesine girip çapraz refaranslarla türk yayılmasıyla avrasya boyunca batıya doğru geilşini  barut'un batıya doğru sürdürdüğü yolculuğu çokiyi anlarsınız.Neden Siyahları ve Türklerin medeniyete katksı sıfır yazıldı avrupa merkezli yalan bir medeniyet kuramıyla anlayacakınız.İngizler roketleri ilk defa kenilerien akrşı savaşan Mysore sultanı Müslüman Tipu sultanın ordusnda görüyorlar.Dha sonra Napolyona karşı bu roketleri kulanıyoarl.BAbür şahı ekberde hintliler karşı kulanmıştır.BAbür koca hindistanı babürnamede yazdığı gibi soamanlın gönderdiği mühendis ali kunlun yaptığı toplar ve kundaki tüfeklerle yenmniştir.YAni wikipedia barut imparatorlukları makalesine girsenzi avrupanın bu barut imparorlukları dşında kaşdığını itiraf eder.Avrupdan ateşli silah aldıüğız yalandır.Onlar çeliği ve topu tüfeği bizlerden öğrendi.MAcar urbaın fesna eolduğunu wikiedia ingizce saydası bile itiar eder.Pek çok şeyi yalan yazdıkları gibi bunuda yalan yazmışladır.Şahi topunun Dökümcüsü demirci mehmet efendi mühendis Fatihtir.Fatihn iyi  bir mühendis olduğu topkapı sarayıdna bulan çizim deterlerinden anlaşıyor.eli yatkın.   http://realhistoryww.com/  İnsanlığın saklanan kayıp sır tarihi?Peki siyahları neden medeniyet dışı yazdılar? https://tr.pinterest.com/yavuzgk/black-europia/  Gerçek orta çağ Avrupa kralları ve çarları.Orjinal hiristiyanlar.

@deathincarnatesplace,you wanna know how people really made the pyramids. getting water from a frozen river. when you are hairy and live in the cold you have to break the ice and when the water is so cold you warm it in you hand because of a cavity that will eventually kill you. well you let the damn ice heal and so break it constantly  and grab and stack the pieces and if nothing has ever tried to eat you there? well you come back and find a huge stack of them still sitting there frozen. after a while it is an igloo on the lake with a hole in the center. you fish and shelter there till spring if the water is a river moving in only to get water and fish makes it a long house eventually. to connect the different domes you just place a fire stone which is basically a deep dish grinding stone and now a lamp or fire starting stone. it will melt a whole when you get done connecting them and it takes three people not to be frustrating.  sealing the top make stalagmites grow full size and only happens when you have a large family who want there own warming fires. then you have to fix the top when you get to much wind. the chimney when it gets to big the roof collapses but if you use the short cave hole (original version used by survivalist hiding from police in alaska. i got distracted but the fire hole attract animals and they try to get in through so you make column max two feet high. people are short. then animal use the door head first can turn around and make easy fur and food almost no sepsis because the stick their heads in and you stab them in the neck they try to turn around and then bleed out if you get it right. then you have to gut them to get out. of course you get to eat them instead with a pack of hungry wolves and this is how people domesticated them when wolves where large then them.,4년 전,0,
@deathincarnatesplace,a teepee can have stacked shale around it but it gets to heavy right. so stack length wise and stack pottery clay bricks if lighter also if big enough make columns of stack clay bricks to hold it up and you get a sarcophagus and clay house and permanent teepee like in egypt. this simplest oldest home ever can't be found as they all collapse eventually because they are just teepee with siding that is just accumulated stuff and most collapse as people grew big heads and inbred rather then get eaten by the neighbors at cannibalism was the thing in the winter and stuff that forced you to have diarrheic symptom was normal.,4년 전,0,

@cymar1000,"OMG, I'd love to do that........go out with little or nowt, and end up with a stone shelter (with a resin-waterproffed roof).    How I'd love to go straight back to the finer skills to build a shelter with a chimney, in order to allow others to camp there, in case of a storm/heavy rain/snow etc.  Somewheree up the mountains.  BTW you ut to look up BUSHCRAFT GR (he's filming from Greece with his dog Bonnie), or the YT channel Primitive Technology.  BUSHCRAFT GR shows you how to survive in the wild, regarding taking the £/$30-40 (depending on where you are either the UK/US), emergency survival kit.  BTW, people need to learn Morse Code.  SOS goes like this......DitDitDit-DaaaaDaaaaDaaaa-DitDitDit.  Where the capitals are, that's where you have to make it heard, then the long drawn out (Daaa, the Dit's are short), be it on the whistle, the Naval tapper or a torch.  That's when most, who know Morse Code, will listen out.  Today's tech is more sophisticated, but the good old-fashioned ways seem to be lost (except for me LOL, but then again, I was taught by my grandad, grandma, dad, uncles and all those oldies LOL).    It also helps having knowledge about what is magnetic (stones, sand, etc).  That's why I always say to take a magnet.  If you can, a £50 survival kit ( including a flint/carbon-steel firestarter and scratcher, a compass, a saw, a hatchet/axe/hammer, knife etc.  You can get this here with the links below this post.  If you're like me, you'd rather go local and natural, go for local flint or rub wood together until smoking well.  That can be done by taking a roll of natural long/short wood shavings with you, and doing the rest yourself (shaving natural green wood bark and drying it out over the fire yu already have).",4년 전,0,

@jlongmasbartholomew,"I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days. Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians. And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge"".  1 Nephi 1-3   Hello friends, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  The verses above are the first three verses in The Book of Mormon.  I know this probably isn't the most ideal place to talk about religion but I really do want you to know that God loves you.  You may not love Him or care about Him at all, but He still will continue to love you.  You are a beloved son or daughter of God.  He knows you personally and He truly and deeply desires for your happiness.  He loves everyone who has every lived on this earth, with a perfect equal love regardless of their race, gender, ethnicity, faith and values and beliefs.   The Lord loves you more than you can think or comprehend.  ""He inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile"" 2 Nephi.  He is our loving, caring Heavenly Father.  We are literally His children and creations.  When we were in the womb, he knew about us"" Jerimiah 4:5.  He knitted us and we were created in His image.    I testify to you that you and I are not a mistake.  He knows the very moment when we stand and when we sit.  He is familiar with all our ways and knows us personally who we are.  The hairs on our very head are numbered.  God loved us so much, He sent His Only Begotten Son for us, that we may be able to return and dwell in the presence of God again.  The Lord has not forgotten about us even when it feels like He has.  He will never forsake us.  When we are happy, He and His angels rejoice alongside us.  When we are sad, He heals us and lifts us up from our trials.  He has always been there for us.  He has always been our loving, compassionate Heavenly Father and God.  Will we always be His children and people?  I testify to you that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ.  Both love you exceedingly and rejoice when you are happy. They both love you so much.  They love you with a love unfeigned.  They will never ever stop doing good unto you.  I know that The Book of Mormon is true.  ""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost"".  Moroni 10:4  I promise and testify to you, that if you will read The Book of Mormon, ponder on its message and ask God if it is not true, you will come to know of its truthfulness, whether its true or not true.    Remember my friends that God loves you with all his heart, might mind, soul and strength.  He wants you to be happy.  He knows what you are going through and dealing with right now.  He desires for you to return back to Him.  Unfortunately, He has been misrepresented and seen as a cruel and angry God who anticipates for us to slip and writes down every mistake we make waiting to punish us by those who do not know or know Him fully.  My friends, God has stored many opportunities and blessings for you.  He is incredibly eager and desires with all His heart to bless you abundantly.  He wants you to live with Him again.  He only wants the best for you and your well being.  He wants to experience everlasting joy and indescribable happiness in this life and in the life to come.  He wants you to partake of His goodness and come and follow Him.  The Lord does not care how early or late you decide to come unto Him.  I testify to you that if you have strayed and wondered off the path that there is hope in Jesus Christ, The Savior of the world.  The Lord accepts those who come unto Him whether your early, late or just in time who desire to change.  The Lord will accept you wholeheartedly and forgive you if you are willing to change.  The Lord will welcome you and will always be ready to embrace you with open arms.  The Lord will lift us up in our trials and use us to bless the lives of those around us if we are willing to change.  If you desire to learn more, you are always welcome to visit comeuntochrist.org.  There you will learn more about The Church of Jesus Christ and our core beliefs and values.  If you have taken the time to read The Book of Mormon and this comment, thank you.  It takes a huge leap of faith and a lot of courage to muster enough faith to read in the Book of Mormon and to believe in something in a personage that you may never see in this lifetime.  Although we may not be able to see God and Jesus Christ in this life, I testify to you that they are real.  They do truly exist.  I promise you that if you will pray to know of their existence, you will come to know whether they exist or have been made up.    You are my friends.  The Lord loves you and despite all our weaknesses, complaining, arguing, and shortcomings, he still loves us and will forgive us if we will humble ourselves before Him and diligently seek correction and do whatever is needed to repent.  Remember that The Lord is always available to talk to through prayer 24/7.  No question sounds too silly for Him.  James wrote, ""If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him"" James 1:5.  If you must know whether or not something is true or evil and deceptive, you can always pray to God.  He will help you know what the truth is and what is not the truth. He will never be too busy to talk to.  He will give you strength you need to overcome and conquer your temptations and will give you the strength you need to endure through your trials and afflictions.  Paul said that The Lord will not give you temptations that you cannot resist, but that in your temptations, He will provide a way for you to resist, overcome and conquer them.  He will provide a way.  He wants to bless you and reward you abundantly.  The Lord knows you and will not forget you.  You are loved.  You are utterly amazing.  You have incredible potential.  You are not forgotten or ever will be forsaken.  You are special.  You are unique.  You are one of a kind.  You have been reserved for this time and The Lord needs you on His side.  It simply would not be the same without you.  Thank you for your time.",3년 전,0,

@yankee_crusader96," @williamwhite9481  have you tried hitting it with a club like the guy in the video did? also no offense but you don't look like you weigh that much. I'm 180 lbs and most of the saplings i take down are max of 4-5 feet, so i just grab the top and pull it down until it snaps.  the tree you were trying to break was a small tree, not really a sapling.  a sapling is usually like max 5 feet.",4년 전,0,
@williamwhite9481, @yankee_crusader96  i weigh 140. The trees you must be breaking might be about 2 1/2 inches then. Which makes sense because before recording that I snapped one that was about 2 and a half. It was tall though and I had to climb about half way up. If it was shorter though it would probably be easier. The one I broke was about 20 feet tall but 2 1/2 thick,4년 전,0,

@ADRooney1,"The first tool was actually 2 tools, a hammer (branch mallet) and the stone cutting tool. Think of the axe as both in one. Each is used for different jobs. Just because you can cut a tree down with a chisel, doesn't mean you want to. This is largely what technology development and tool making are like. You need Z to craft X, to craft Y, so you can now work on F.  Specialized tools are a matter of efficiency, and efficiency was the name of the game when you lived or died based on what you could get done in any given day.",5년 전,8,

@muradismayilzad3374,"According to research published in the journal of Communication, stone tool making triggered the evolution of speech and teaching of our prehistoric ancestors in Africa. The first sentence was probably the “bad tool”. ""We think the use of tools improves language evolution, and it would be much more useful to say something about chipping stone than other emotional words,"" said Thomas Morgan at the beginning of the study. ""Yes, no, here, there, it was very useful to use sounds and gestures in concepts that do not express emotions such as good and bad,"" he added. Thomas Morgan from the University of California, Natalie Uomini and his teams from the University of Liverpool had previously conducted a series of experiments on the ""Oldowan Stone Chipping"". In order to confirm this idea, the Oldowan stone chiping technique was tried to be transferred to 180 university students in five different ways. Then, by looking at the Oldowan tools produced by the students, the way of telling it gave a much better result than the imitation, non-verbal presentations and gestures and the process could be completed in a much shorter time. Oldowan Technology Oldowan was the oldest known stone tool chipping technique and was probably used by Homo habilis. It is also possible that Homo rudolfensis, Australopithecus garhi and Paranthropus boisei used this technology. The oldest known Oldowan tool is dated to 2.5 million years ago and consists of chips produced by hitting a hard stone on volcanic stone. Oldowan technology remains unchanged until 1.8 million years ago. But later on, the Ashooter hand axes, which are a little more complicated, begin to appear. Article: Morgan, T. J. H., Uomini, N. T., Rendell, L. E., Chouinard-Thuly, L., Street, S. E., Lewis, H. M.,… & Whiten, A. (2015). Experimental evidence for the co-evolution of hominin tool-making teaching and language.

Life expectancy has been explained so much too. The age was so low because of infant mortality. Other than modern medicine of the last 150 years and having more ways to blow ourselves up I'd say we haven't come very far at all except for poisoning ourselves and living lives of cheap comfort and obedience.,2년 전,0,

Because they can put someone who is way better than you in the same league. I think you should start a ""Boy Scouts"" of your own. One that is less concerned about what happens after death, and instead, one that is concerned about what you can do BEFORE death.

The reason being that the Celt will often be very useful or even required to build so many other things and it also allows you to gather wood right off of a tree which means you can get the really sturdy wood instead of the sticks that have been laying on the ground for god knows how long!   Although that being said...i didn't watch this video when i made my first Celt and so i made the mistake of not leaving space between the stone and the sides of the handle, so my first Celt immediately broke!

@SanduTheMountainDweller,"Hey guys I have a question In the video primitive said ""Don't let the sides of the head touch the sides of the hole or it will split"" I've heard that if you put a layer of leather around the stone before fitting it into the gap it will reduce the shock and prevent splitting, however doesnt that kinda make everything touch, which is what primitive said not to do? stone touches leather, leather touches wood, but on the other side I totally see why leather there would help preventing a split, but I'm really unsure about all this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AENymqT6V4g This guy did it Tell me what u guys think I was needing help on this",5년 전,0,

@garymcpeters7541,A local gentleman practices American Indian stone knapping.  He demonstrated how Indians set the blade in the handle by tapping the end of the handle nearest the blade on a log or the ground to set it.  To remove it they tapped the back of the blade on a log or the ground so it could be used as a hand axe.  This way they carried one tool with two uses.,7년 전,0,

@kooroshrostami27,"I am very surprised the wedge of the axe doesn't cripple the joint when he hits the tree, seems weird to me that the heating of the joint and then hitting the wedge into it forms a sufficiently solid connection that it would withstand the impact and the force when chopping on a tree. Even though he makes sure that the sides of the wedge doesn't touch the wood, I would still expect the wood to split vertically at the top and bottom of the joint.

@jamesrogers47,"While I find his videos fascinating, I think humans can aspire to more than a Neolithic lifestyle.  Put another way, camping out all the time gets old.  Thoreau could advocate the virtues of simplicity, but when he got tired of roughing it by his pond, he could always return to life in the big city. This young man knows that the primitive lifestyle he presents in his videos is an affectation he engages in for educational purposes.  I doubt he would choose to live like this without any escape.",7년 전,1,

@vidura,"You should encourage him to stay mute. When 99,999999999% of our species loves nothing more than babble about most unimportant things (usually their own ""thoughts""), what a welcome sight it is to see someone who isn't pathologically narcissist, unlike the rest of our species.   There is nothing for him to say which cannot be said with text. Our world is filled with human-made noise pollution. Only few rare individuals are innocent in this aspect. He is one of those, almost extinct category of humans. A human who seeks harmony with nature, not to conquer and molest it.   Would do many people awfully good if they could just shut the fuck up for few days. To really learn what objective reality is. Very few can close their mouths long enough for there to be born any kind of wisdow. If you are unable to listen to the universe itself, then there cannot be any kind of meaningful existence. Just hollow beings with nothing of value to say. Just like 99,99999999% of our species.",8년 전,6,

@alexwansss,"vidura  True, many VERY loud individuals on YouTube, that's just the nature of the platform. They need to grab your attention, and their content alone isn't interesting enough, so they scream. It's sad if I'm being honest.  There's this clip of people watching Primitive Technology's videos and reacting (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xHThOzlGZk), and one of the pairs of people kept saying that he's boring and not engaging. I totally disagree with them, but it seems the internet generation has lost the patience/ability to process information that isn't in bite-size and in your face.  I don't think it is necessarily narcissism, but the outcome is the same, and I gotta say it can get hella annoying.",8년 전,1,

You act like idiot who started boxing, and after month said ""It's so fucking boring, I only get hit in face and fight with others"" and stoped boxing.

@Tazzspaz,That chopping looks rough.  Curious if you have thought of thinning the handle more? Or do you have any historic examples suggesting thickness? I suppose the logistics of a celt that thick may preclude a thinner handle.  In trying to educate myself more on use of axes I have seen multiple folks talk of the value in having a thinner handle to flex and absorb more of the shock. Thinner as in much thinner than the typical store bought handles.  the tool cult guy on YT described this.,8년 전,0,

@chrisgibbs3509,"I always wondered how this design would avoid the problem of splitting easily after a few hard chops, so to learn that the sides of the hole don't touch and to learn to start with green wood and fire bake/heat it, then also to learn to use it above/below a knot to help avoid splitting was critical.  Real world use vs. designing on paper... a wonderful reminder of how important it is.  Also loved the comment that once your stone axe gets a chip that you must grind it down or chip gets worse (all that pressure/force then focuses on chip area vs. smooth design that transfers force smoothly to allow axe to work well and last a long time).  I want to know if author has studied other ancient man made tools or objects to help reverse engineer what their original uses likely were  (birdstones, bannerstones, boatstones, gorgets, plummets, etc)  ??",8년 전,0,

@Indrius,"Evi1M4chine That's just simply false. The only way to increase motor unit recruitment is by forcing neuromuscular adaptation. The only way to do it is to lift or pull progressively heavier weights. You will not cause neuromuscular adaptation by lifting light weights (or producing weak force in some other way) or by getting stuck and lifting the same weight without attempting to lift heavier. The body is a very efficient machine, it doesn't become stronger if it doesn't need to (i.e. is not stimulated to do so). That being said, while bigger can be stronger, the two factors do not necessarily go together. Hypertrophy (muscle mass or ""size"") and strength are trained a bit differently. You can become stronger at your current body weight, but eventually you will plateau and to continue getting stronger you will need to gain more mass.",8년 전(수정됨),14,
@willroske8406,"Indrius he's actually kinda right you were explaining how you gain muscle and back in the stone ages you had to have more crude tools (like shown in the video) and if you have ever tried to hack down a tree with a modern axe it's difficult, now with an axe with stone instead of steel it is a lot less sharp so it would be 50 times harder back then. It is scientifically proven that human like ancestors were much stronger, bigger, faster, taller, and healthier. We live longer because of medicine. Back then a cold would kill you, now we just go to the local CVS or Walgreens and pick up some cold and flu medicine and poof your better in a couple hours. So yes in a way the men were ""all ripped like him"" P.S. There are other ways to gain muscle than lifting",8년 전,1,

If you want to see how ripped and fit people were go to pre-industrial civilizations like isolated hunter gatherer tribes in remote Africa, S. America and S.E. Asia.

Was originally shooting for a 3/4 groove but the stone just kept saying celt, so going with the celt.  Different type of handle now though.  Was going with a pin oak for the 3/4 but will change to a handle design that will work for a celt. Hopefully the pin oak will still work. Will be sure the stone doesn't touch the sides.  Will model it after the one you've made.  By the power you use to fell the tree, it looks like you definitely have a great design worked out.  On a side note, I love the way you shot the bow video, with repeated tries over and over until you got closer and closer to the target by feel.

@crabe804,"Well...Iron is quite elastic, when all stones are brittle. So, even if stone can be harder than steel, you need to do the blade thicker (see the video description) and the edge nearly blunt (see also the video description) to  endure the cut.

@danielatroncoso5725,"Publicado el 22 de mayo. 2015  La fabricación de un hacha de piedra incluyendo el mango de utilizar sólo herramientas y materiales primitivos. Es  un celta (pronunciado ""selt"") un tipo de hacha con una cabeza de piedra  pulida metido en un agujero o muesca en el extremo de un mango de  madera (que no debe confundirse con una ""Kelt"", refiriéndose a una  persona celta). El jefe tomó alrededor de una semana y un día para hacer lo que elegimos para que sea de un particular gran trozo de basalto. El martillo de piedra utilizado para dar forma al basalto era de cuarzo. Este martilleo involucrados, picoteando, esmerilado y pulido de la cabeza en la forma final. El mango se tomó un día y una mañana para hacer. Un cincel fue hecha de piedra y un mazo hecho de un registro. Estos se utilizan para cortar el árbol del mango y darle forma, una vez hacia abajo. El fuego se utiliza para endurecer la madera y también para ayudar a dar forma a la mortaja. A continuación se utilizó el hacha para cortar un árbol el día después de que el mango era un árbol en sí. Es  una herramienta más eficiente para la tala de árboles que el hacha de  mano que hice y que en el momento de subir el vídeo ha cortado 4 árboles  que voy a utilizar más tarde. Debido  a que esta hacha de piedra es más contundente que un acero de una sola,  la hoja tiene que golpear el árbol en ángulos mayores de 45 grados- de  lo contrario la hoja sería rebotar. Así celtas fueron utilizados más como cuñas que los ejes modernos.",9년 전,0,

This guy also wasn't rather original with the title he put for the video, he put the EXACT same thing that Primitive did for his video.

On top of that, you can also estimate how old something is, by looking at how deep something was buried when you found it. The deeper it's found, the older it is.

@matthewmarting3623,2 reasons. What can't be worked easily with stone tools can be turned to charcoal and scraped out (those long fibers inside need to be severed and I find it painful to do a socket like that with modern chisels). Second benefit is that heat hardens the wood - important for a socket like that.,9년 전,5,

@matthewmarting3623,"Luis Luis Nah, just a hardcore do-it-yourself-er and student of all technologies. I spent most of my free time messing around in my shop. To be honest, I never understood the actual mechanism of fire hardening of wood and haven't done any testing. I have no idea if it cross links the fibers or tightens them... Depending on the mechanism it may make splitting more likely. But if it's like many other materials, hardness will increase abrasion resistance, resist deformation, increase strength etc.",9년 전,0,

OK, some might know when to start but pretty damn sure they will hate every moment of it. Zero enthusiasm, just the thought of ""i'm gonna die here, 2 weeks tops unless i do something"". Gotta make a knife, wait how? oh a rock, sharpen it, my hands hurt fuck, this should do, oblong but its soso sharp. Gotta master fire, how did PT did it, ok a stick, 5 sticks later, my hands hurt, it keeps breaking, triggered. Need food, scavenge mode, found 3 mushrooms. I'm gonna die, god why have you forsaken me. Time to fish, how the fuck am i gonna catch fish. How do you even make a spear, bow, how do you even make an effective bow. I'm gonna die, too hungry, i'm gonna eat my own leg. Dang rain, need shelter, wait need food, wait don't have tools. I'm gonna die, god why have you forsaken me. While on another island where PT lives, he has a house, a fucking oven, bow and arrows for dayz, another house, and a bloody workstation, with pottery, with slippers, a potato farm, scorpion pets, a chicken, and to top it all off, a fucking heated floor and he has a loom too.",8년 전,19,
