@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏ Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the   ‏ Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏    https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42    🌹  ‏https://youtu.be/YtQGJ1pS6Fs   🌷    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO/view    🌻    https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U    🌼    https://discoveritsbeauty.com/mobile/   🌺",4년 전,1,

@Ser_Matticus,"Seeing their attempts at such a car/camper hybrid has had me thinking of my own version.  Leaning to a sort of, hybrid with Hammond and Clarksons.  First off for the tower, instead of a solid block of weight and air resistance utilize a collapsible square tent structure with a form of lockable scaffolding that can extend up with the tent fabric to make the second floor.  Then to prevent fall over from a stiff breeze utilize cables or ropes mounted at the top of the tent to anchor it down.  This solves a height issue but also a weight one since you’re using lighter materials for the structure. So hopefully better fuel efficiency.  As for the Hybrid idea with Hammond have it possible to setup extra tent space around the main tower and vehicle in a form of U shape and have it attach to the main tower/vehicle tent.  Additionally setup this extra tent so It can detach from the main tower and vehicle, probably attached via velcro edges so you can collapse the tower and drive away for distant activities or food/supply runs.  Plus since the main tower is still part of the vehicle it grants the privacy needed for changing somewhere else.   As for why I didn’t include anything of May’s design his design. While flawed still works fairly well and is simple with room for improvement.   It was only the ambitious over engineering from the other two that inspired this form of hybrid idea.",2년 전,1,

That's the appeal to the sky fallacy. The incandescent light bulb hanging from my ceiling is spherical, so my floor must be spherical too. You see how that kind of thinking is nonsense right.

BTW many people have measured large frozen lakes for curvature and found none but you don't have to believe them because you can test it yourself.

Matthew 7-15 ""And I saw another angel fly in heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. And he said with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour is come when he will judge; and worship the One who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water. And another angel, a second, followed him, saying, The great Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that made all nations drink of the wine of her fornication. And another, a third angel, followed them, saying in a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he will drink of the wine of God's wrath, which is prepared pure in the cup of his wrath; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment shall be for ever and ever; and those who worship the beast and his image will have no rest day or night, or anyone who accepts the mark of his name. This requires the patience of the saints, those who keep God's commandments, and faith in Jesus ”(Rev. 14: 6-12). And yet, it is written: Fear God and repay Him Glory, for the hour of His judgment has come, and worship the One who made it heaven, earth, sea, and springs of water. ”- Revelation 14: 6, 7. It is written: John 3:16: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. And he who rejects the gift of salvation is written: Revelation 14:10 He also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared pure in the cup of His wrath, and will be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb. And it is also written: For there is nothing secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. Luke 8:17. This world is going away and if you want to be saved, give glory to your Creator, repent! And this is the golden verse of the Bible: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Amazon prime has been the best thing for them, bigger budget, same laughs on top of everything else they look like the genuinely enjoy what they do with the extra freedom. Its hard to know everything going on behind the scenes but Jeremy made it clear he didnt really like working with the BBC, glad Hammond and May followed in his footsteps knowing the trio is what makes the show. Understandable Jeremy punched a guy and theres probably more to the story and things to consider with possibly both sides to blame but regardless its crazy to see what top gear has become, its not the new presenters of the show its just the fact the shows boots can and i repeat never ever be filled or even match what the original trio had it was top notch.

@kennedymcgovern5413,"So I happened across a youtube channel from England today. Youtube sensed my interest in cars and recommended ""Top Gear."" I clicked on it, and checked it out.  The host of some little Europussy who spends about half of his air time tossing tantrums at his betters (Americans). It is one of those things that makes you cringe, not because of what he is saying, but rather because he is saying it from the other side of the internet where you can't reach him to punch him in his decaying, yellow, british teeth.   I did not like this man, and I did not like his act. So let me tell you what I did about it:  I used this little magic device on my desk, moved it to the corresponding proper place on the screen, clicked it and...  ...magically...  ...I found myself watching something else.   It was amazing! I couldn't believe it actually worked! I did all of this, without having to write a single nasty email to anyone demanding that the platform shut down his channel.   I am going to write a book about this amazing new technology I just developed, and advertise it on CNN, MSNBC and BBC, where all of the people are who really need to learn it!

Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the   ‏ Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏    https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42    🌹  ‏https://youtu.be/YtQGJ1pS6Fs   🌷    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO/view    🌻    https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U    🌼    https://discoveritsbeauty.com/mobile/   🌺",4년 전,1,

@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏ Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the   ‏ Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏    https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42    🌹  ‏https://youtu.be/YtQGJ1pS6Fs   🌷    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO/view    🌻    https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U    🌼    https://discoveritsbeauty.com/mobile/   🌺",4년 전,1,

@SurprisinglyDeep," @TomorrowWeLive   @Tomorrow We Live  Humanity evolved homosexuals through mutation so that some people would naturally be inclined to adopt orphans in order to have children to take care of them when they get old.

Many homosexual couples adopting orphans probably spend just as much as if not more effort on raising the orphans than heterosexual couples do raising their biological children.

@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏ Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the   ‏ Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏    https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42    🌹  ‏https://youtu.be/YtQGJ1pS6Fs   🌷    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO/view    🌻    https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U    🌼    https://discoveritsbeauty.com/mobile/   🌺",4년 전,1,

Jeremy fits in at Second Place here because while his car is two to three stories tall, take the top floor off and extent the second floor to add a little more balance and it just might work. Hammond's takes Last Place because of how overly complicated it is.

I think I would like to do something like this and put some real time and money into it and make it enjoyable and fun to do. And if all goes right I'd have a airtight comfortable place to sleep in! But it's a bit more tricky when you are limited to only your car to build on top of or whatever. I would think it would be better to use a truck or van right? I don't know. It depends on how good your build is and of its airtight so no air can get in. I feel like this is one of those ""it sounded like a good idea at the time"" kind of thing.

It's also the reason why driving behind a truck is more fuel efficient and race car drivers sometimes drive directly behind their opponents (the less dense air created by the truck or car provides less resistance)",10년 전,0,

@AdammP,"***** Done a bit of research.  1.7 The Road Traffic Act 1991 states that: a. A person is also guilty of using a vehicle in a dangerous condition if he uses, or causes or permits another to use, a motor vehicle or trailer on a road when the purpose for which it is used or the weight position or distribution of its load, or the manner in which it is secured is such that the use of the motor vehicle or trailer involves a danger of injury to any person.   THE MAX PENALTY FOR THIS OFFENCE IF COMMITTED IN RESPECT OF A GOODS VEHICLE IS A £5000 FINE, PLUS 3 PENALTY POINTS AND DISQUALIFICATION  b. A person is to be regarded as driving dangerously if it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving the vehicle in its current state would be dangerous. In determining the state of the vehicle for this purpose, regard may be had to anything attached to or carried on or in it and to the manner in which it is attached or carried.  THE MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR DANGEROUS DRIVING IS 2 YEARS IMPRISONMENT. THE MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR CAUSING DEATH BY DANGEROUS DRIVING IS 10 YEARS IMPRISONMENT.",10년 전,1,
@TheMijman,"Weak End Well in those circumstances the car was legal. Since the car he drives wasn't dangerous, It didn't pose a threat to anyone and only fell over when it was parked (most likely it was pushed over for comedic effect) . So it wasn't dangerous, plus it's the BBC so they would have gone through the necessary safety precautions to ensure it was safe.",10년 전,3,
@AdammP,"*****  ""b. A person is to be regarded as driving dangerously if it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving the vehicle in its current state would be dangerous""  lol 1:30 it could easily have toppled over onto two lanes of oncoming traffic.... you can't say that isn't dangerous. personally i just think if a normal civilian tried to do this it would be shut down in minutes. just because its Top Gear they seem to have gotten away with it.",10년 전,0,
@TheMijman,Weak End I'm sure they took the right safety precautions. Also it's no unstable that a normal lorry. Just as tall. Why does it matter now anyway? No one died so it was safe enough (In this context).,10년 전,1,
@AdammP,"well a lorry has more weight and a wider wheel base, and has been through manufacturer testing.. i don't see normal lorries swaying about as much as that did. this vehicle is custom built and hasn't been through the same manufacturing guidelines. there is no comparison because nobody knows at what speed or force is required to tip the Citroen over.. another reason why it's a risk. you say nobody died and it was safe enough, but really is that a good statement to make? what if it tipped over into the opposite lane blinding a driver and killed a bunch of people. i thought the whole idea of the road traffic act was to prevent accidents by having safe legal vehicles on the road. fair enough nobody did get injured.. but from what we saw in the video there was a risk. and the portion of the traffic act i quoted is suppposed to eliminate this specific risk, am i wrong?  Jury's out on this one.",10년 전,2,
@TheMijman,"Weak End Yes you're right. Please go ahead and sue the BBC. Just quote that and you'll be away.  I'm sure they didn't test their vehicles and acquire suitable licenses and such.  And no that is not a good statement to make, hence why I said ""(In this context)"".  Also the Citroen has a low center of gravity, allowing it to sway a considerable amount without it tipping over.",10년 전,1,

@okinawaskate,"@PumaM90 well not to get technical but. it says ""this sale 5.73 euros  and 4.66 liters"". 5.73 euros is $7.53. so that means one liter is $1.61. There are 3.8 liters in a gallon, so 3.8 x $1.61 is $6.12. So they are paying $6.12 a gallon. pretty fucking expensive. Almost the same as japan. ",14년 전,0,
