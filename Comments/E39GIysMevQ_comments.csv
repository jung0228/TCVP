@Spindrift_Productions,"NO WAY!!  50 seconds for a quarter to fall 7.5 miles. There is a thing called AIR  that slows it down. TRY 22 minutes to fall 7.5 miles. Any dropped object is accelerated by gravity, but only until wind resistance is equal to the force of gravity. At that point the object is at what is known as ""terminal velocity."" The object will go at that constant velocity until it hits the ground.  In a fall of 7.5 miles, the period of acceleration is short enough to be neglected: the quarter will reach terminal velocity in a few seonds. So for all practical purposes all you need to know is the terminal velocity of a quarter. A quick Google says 20 mph. I trust it enough to say that it will take 22 minutes a quarter will fall 7.5 miles.",8개월 전,0,

@howardking3601,"The reason the Kola bore hole was stopped is that the rock was in a plastic state, and clogged the drill. That is not an insuperable obstacle. To go significantly deeper without new developments in technology, you could start with a huge conical open pit, like the typical copper mine. The heat would not be nearly so great because of the exposure to the air. And who knows that the rock would be of the same type everywhere at the depth of Kola? I suspect it varies. So I think much greater depths could be reached; though the cost would be prohibitive. But the crust is too thick: it will probably never be penetrated by man. And that's probably a good thing.

@stevenwendellnelson5228,"Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better. And addressing/thanking the CREATOR, LORD GOD at the beginning and end of your prayers would be a good idea 😊 Or just be my friend if you don't want to say the prayer 😄 I'm trying to help you get right with the LORD🙏  Amen. 🙏🙏🙏  You should prostrate yourself if you don't want to do spoken prayer, or do both ☺ Please worship the LORD GOD and not any idol.

@Svinosapiens,Pardon. Has anybody already mentioned? Kyiv not Kiev   “Kyiv” is an official Latin transliteration of the city’s name in the Ukrainian language. This is not the only language spoken in the country - but it is the only official one. Ukraine has adopted standards of rendering its toponymic names from Cyrillic into Latin using Ukrainian transcription and hopes the international community will use it too.   “Kiev” comes from the Russian way of pronouncing Ukraine’s capital name. This spelling and transcription became the most common internationally during the 20th century. For many Ukrainians today it is now associated with so-called “Russification” - banning the use of Ukrainian language in print and other actions by Russian Empire and then Soviet State to strengthen Russian linguistic and political positions in Ukraine.,2년 전,0,

So it's not possible to dig very far anyway. Unless we use some coolants to go further.. Also the pressure of that hot liquid lava is rather crazy. At this point, what is the point of reaching any depth anyway if it's superhot liquid lava under immense pressure? Cool thing is there should be no gravity in the center of the earth, but what is that even good for? Beyond those 70km might just use some extremely insulated submarine type of thing.. although insulation materials are not very hard by nature so it's probably impossible to hold pressure and insulate that craft at the same time. The task is way above tech we have.. And it's not likely we could discover something useful anyway.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

So if we drilled as far as they did in Russia, we should in theory be able to make use of that energy/heat to heat much much larger areas.

The crust seals off the magma, which is under the extremely high pressure of all above it. If released. It would geyser up with shocking force!     I lack the maths skills to calculate how much force this would entail; it would be dependent upon the variables: the diameter of the bore, the actual depth (the crust's thickness itself varies), the temperature, the pressure. It is possible that the result would be molten rock and ores--essentially, lava--would shoot up several kilometres high! We would have done nothing less than opening a volcano--right onto the faces of people who had burrowed down.     If we can manage the heat, and we can redirect the pressure, we likely would find deposits of ores we can use to build.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Have you ever realized that everything dealing with space are animations? That's because you are forced to believe shit that isn't true.   That's how mind control works. For instance, the video Journey to the Andromeda Galaxy.  I thought, how do they know so much about a place so far away?  They've never been there.  Then, I finally concluded, they're making 8t all up.  Why? I know, but do you want to know?  The majority of people on earth, which does not exist as you know it, are afraid to know.   This is how mind control works.   All in all, this is how God will send you to his Hell Trap.  He baits the trap with a golden carrot called heaven.",3년 전,0,

@zakmartin," @jaymahoney7227  Well, two things: First of all we don't know for a fact that the core of the Earth is hot. The general scientific consensus is that it's hot, but the scientific consensus has turned out to be wrong on many other ""settled"" issues. Second, a falling object travels at around 118mph and accelerates 9.8 meters per second squared (9.8 m/s2. So maybe it wouldn't have time to ""incinerate"". I'm not a mathematician, so I'm not even going to try to calculate the speed it would be travelling as it fell towards the Earth's core. Third, if we're going to assume that a golf ball would be incinerated, can we pose the same thought experiment and replace the golf ball with a ball made of some heat resistant material? I'm more interested in what would happen to the ball in terms of gravity, velocity, acceleration etc., rather than what would happen to the ball itself. Okay, so that was three things.

In practice, of course, you'd have to contend with the heat (you're passing through molten rock and then molten iron) and the pressure from outside; also the gravitational effect of the moon - because the centre of gravity of the earth-moon system is not the centre of the earth - and the whole thing is precessing - and there are currents in the magma and iron which would bend your tube out of shape - and - and - etc.",3년 전,1,

@minzhouabct240,"Our environment is not a colosseum. It chooses those who suit them, not the strong. It is the weak (the simple-minded) who suit their environment (and become part of the war machine). In order to adapt it, people are losing the ability to remain independent (especially to think independently) and their talents are diminishing generation after generation.   People are divided into different prisons of the mind. Not only are they used to these walls, but they are born into them. They feel secure as a brick, and they even enjoy it so much that they are willing to sacrifice everything for words like ""glory"" (or ironically, ""freedom""). Modern finance is based on credit (trust in one's own system or government), so these wars of ideas are extremely important. Money can generate money and it is not necessarily the elite.   The one who born with power is not the smartest either.  The 1% is not necessarily capable of conspiracy, but it is easy to reach a tacit agreement.(It can’t be 100% of those 1%. Perhaps 1% of 1% is enough to Influence the key.) 10% often mistake themselves as 1%.  Be aware of the various slogans, including ""freedom first"" ""my country first"" ""me first"" ""xxx(whatever it is ) first"", “they evil, we justice”, ""weeds rock the world"" ""we deserve it, let it end"". Why do we have to follow any of them or any other supposed prophecy? Having an ""I"" obscures the true self (losing oneself) and that one inevitably becomes anxious, nervous and distressed to the point of insanity, often resorting to conceptualised nomenclature. If people keep ignoring their inner loss of themselves and unconsciously clinging to various images (e.g. the body) or concepts (e.g. the Holy Name), World War III and the end of the world is inevitable, and it may have already begun in Europe. Energy don’t know they are the force. Water does not know that she is water, and darkness does not know that he is darkness. When a man is seeking the brightness, he is blinded by dreams of various lights. Most serious or intense busy people are dreaming, while the awakened are at peace because they are comfortable with the darkness that does not know the ultimate truth. All we need to do is to have faith in ourselves (our unknown true self), whatever it is, it is always here, right before you, all kinds of image or sounds, or sounds of thoughts just part of it. A flying arrow does not really move, any moment is an eternity (If there is an ""author"", some kind of ultimate power, it must always be here for us too). Yet within every yang is always a yin, and every belief/hope is based on doubt/fear. If you are already 100% sure of something, there is no need of a belief.  (We can find at least four truths, ""Awakening without leaving the present moment is real"" ""The present moment is eternal and real"" ""My real feelings are real, such as the fear of death"" ""I am real and true"" (This is mindful practicing in a real way, each concept falls into place.) So the real ultimate war between light and darkness is within us, not outside.(If there is an everlasting war between light and darkness, it has nothing to do with races, nations, religions. It is a war between faith and fear, or hope and fear ,or faith and doubt.) Mind yourself first. Loose both inside and outside light and dark.  Let it (mirror/darkness/inside) be. Let it (image/lights/outside) come and go.  Talk, even argue, don’t curse ,don’t fight, even war. (If necessary, for some kind of emergency, we can bet on a sports match. Every life is unique, not just a statistic.)",3년 전,1,

@danielwarren7110,Whats the deepest thole we can possibly dig is the clickbait. Then states if humanity decided to put all its resources into digging with current technology. And then he lists the holes currently dug. But no mention of what is the deepest we could possibly dig. If humanity put all of its resources into digging they could do a pit and allow more air flow and all other things which would be deeper than the current two deepest holes as one stopped years ago due to lack of resources to go deeper (Russian) and the other was digging for a resource and obviously stopped when it had found it. The reason your keys are always the last place you look is you would be an idiot if you continued looking for your keys after you find them. It will always be the last place you look whether that is looking 3 or 20 places. So the video only talks about what humans have done but the title and intro talk about how deep humans could dig.

@zaceishen7974,"How To Go To Heaven According to the holy Word of God in the King James Bible!       It is very simple to be saved and takes only a minute to explain. Please let me show you how to get to Heaven from the Bible, God's Word...  Man is a Sinner in the Eyes of a Holy God.  Isaiah 53:6, “All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.”Romans 3:19, “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.”John 3:3, “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”Romans 3:10, “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.”Romans 3:23, “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”  There is a Price For Our Sin―Burning in Hell Forever.    Romans 6:23, “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”Romans 5:12, “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”2nd Thessalonians 1:8, “In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.”Revelation 20:15, ""And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.”Revelation 21:8, “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”  Jesus paid that price by dying on the cross and shedding His blood; Christ was buried and bodily rose again the third day!  Romans 5:8, “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”John 3:16, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”1st Timothy 1:15, “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.”1st Peter 1:18-19, “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ...”1st Corinthians 15:1-4, “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.” This is the Gospel.  By faith in Jesus Christ ALONE we are immediately saved.Galatians 3:26, “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.”John 11:25, “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.”John 6:28-29, “Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.”Ephesians 2:8-9, “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”John 14:6, “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”John 6:40, “And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.”Mark 1:15, “And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.”Acts 26:18, “To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.”Romans 10:13, “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”1st Corinthians 3:11, ""For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”Galatians 3:26, “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.”  Salvation is NOT found in a religion or good works, but in a Person... The LORD JESUS CHRIST!

@Unknownety,"Falling 40 meters only takes 2.018 seconds, not nearly 3 seconds, so I guess someone wrote ""just above 2 seconds"" somewhere and had that misinterpreted to ""almost 3 seconds"". Air resistance wouldn't majorly slow one down at these speeds so it won't contribute much to lessening one's fall. (by the time one hits the bottom one would be traveling at about 71 km/h, rather slow all things considered.)  However, it is correct that it does take about 11 seconds to fall 600 meters, terminal vilocity is reached after about 6-7 seconds and from there it is just another 250 meters left to go that only takes another 4.5 seconds. (If one falls belly first that is. Resume a more streamlined position and 8 seconds is easily beaten.)",3년 전,0,

THE RAINBOW THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE Revelations 4 and Revelations 22 Bible.   1After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, “Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this.” 2Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. 3And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance  like an emerald.    4Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads. 5And from the throne proceeded lightnings,  thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 6Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. 7The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living  creature was like a flying eagle.   8The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying:...... “Holy, holy, holy,.. Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!” 9Whenever  the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 10the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11“You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created..

@jessicaalfaro145,"Ok, since we didn't get an answer i'll try to answer the video's question ""How far can we possibly dig?""  TL;DR: Less than 50km maybe.    (Gotta say i'm not an expert on any field so feel free to correct me, i would love to learn new stuff)  Ok, first we wanna know how fast does temperature increase when going down, for that i'll only use what i was given in the video, if there are 66°C at 4000m and 180°C at 12,262m we can assume that temperature goes up 1°C every 68m approx. (assuming linear increase). So there is that, now we need to know about our equipment.  Mining drills are made of hard materials, I will be workind on some i could find info of:  If we used had a drill made of steel (Probably would melt at 1200°C-1300°C) and ignore electrical power loss over the huge distance/terrain difficulties, you could get down to 80-82km, so we could, maybe get beyond the crust.   If we used a tungsten carbide drill (Probably melt at 2700°C) and, ignoring the stuff above too, we could get to 183km down!  But.. not everything it's so bright.. we need to get real now.  Drills consume lots of power so.. lets leave this one at 500kW. To get a 500kW drill working through a 140km copper wire, this one would need to have a diameter of probably 2 square meters, so thats.. a lot... Also copper melts at 1000°C approx. so that would affect inmensely in how far we can go,  setting a maximum of probably 55km deep.   Now, if we add terrain difficulties it will get even worse since there could be a lot of inflamable gases or liquified materials that would accumulate throughout the work, restraining the drill and putting lots of pressure on it, but i wont go on details since honestly i don't know much about that.",5년 전(수정됨),37,

@oceansoflorewi,This is my CORE argument (No pun intended) as to why flat earth makes more sense to round earth. Lets say the middle of earth isn't lava and it's diggable; you are telling me if we keep digging downward with our feet - if we could theoretically hit China and break daylight then our feet would Appear out of the hole dug to China first - WHAT !? This makes zero sense! When the eff would our bodies revert to the gravity flip if we are digging from downward to upward on this so called ball. It's actually quite laughable- this alone debunks the round world indoctrination embedded in us. Again lets say this was actually possible if the core of the Earth wasn't allegedly hot lava - even that sounds ludacris to me how is that hot lava not melting the outer layers if its THAT hot?

@avoidisthebest,"100 Reasons why you shouldn't commit suicide. 1. We would miss you.  2. It's not worth the regret. Either by yourself, if you failed or just simply left scars or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you.  3. It does get better. Believe it or not, it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow.  4. There's so much you would miss out on doing.  5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there.  6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself.  7. You ARE worth it. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise.  8. You are amazing.  9. A time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better.  10. What about all the things you've always wanted to do? What about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? You can't do them when you're dead.  11. I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive.  12. You won't be able to listen to music if you die.  13. Killing yourself is never worth it. You'll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about.  14. There are so many people that would miss you, including me.  15. You're preventing a future generation, YOUR KIDS, from even being born.  16. How do you think your family would feel? Would it improve their lives if you died?  17. You're gorgeous, amazing, and to someone you are perfect.  18. Think about your favorite music artist, you'll never hear their voice again...  19. You'll never have the feeling of walking into a warm building on a cold day  20. Listening to incredibly loud music  21. Being alive is just really good.  22. Not being alive is really bad.  23. Finding your soulmate.  24. Red pandas  25. Going to diners at three in the morning.  26. Really soft pillows.  27. Eating pizza in New York City.  28. Proving people wrong with your success.  29. Watching the jerks that doubted you fail at life.  30. Seeing someone trip over a garbage can.  31. Being able to help other people.  32. Bonfires.  33. Sitting on rooftops.  34. Seeing every single country in the world.  35. Going on road trips.  36. You might win the lottery someday.  37. Listening to music on a record player.  38. Going to the top of the Eiffel Tower.  39. Taking really cool pictures.  40. Literally meeting thousands of new people.  41. Hearing crazy stories.  42. Telling crazy stories.  43. Eating ice cream on a hot day.  44. More Harry Potter books could come out, you never know.  45. Traveling to another planet someday.  46. Having an underwater house.  47. Randomly running into your hero on the street.  48. Having your own room at a fancy hotel.  49. Trampolines.  50. Think about your favorite movie, you'll never watch it again.  51. Think about the feeling of laughing out loud in a public place because your best friend has just sent you an inside joke,  52. Your survival will make the world better, even if it's for just one person or 20 or 100 or more.  53. People do care.  54. Treehouses  55. Hanging out with your soul mate in a treehouse  55. Snorting when you laugh and not caring who sees  56. I don't even know you and I love you.  57. I don't even know you and I care about you.  58. Nobody is going to be like you ever, so embrace your uniqueness!  59. You won't be here to experience the first cat world emperor.  60. WHAT ABOUT FOOD?! YOU'LL MISS CHOCOLATE  61. Starbucks.  62. Hugs.  63. Stargazing.  64. You have a purpose, and it's up to you to find out what it is.  65. You've changed somebody's life.  66. You could change the world.  67. You will meet the person that's perfect for you.  68. No matter how much or how little, you have your life ahead of you.  69. You have the chance to save somebody's life.  70. If you end your life, you're stopping yourself from achieving great things.  71. Making snow angels.  72. Making snowmen.  73. Snowball fights.  74. Life is what you make of it.  75.

@Daxyl,"A better title for this video might've been, ""How far down have we dug?"" You have only listed existing holes and tunnels. The title you chose implies that it attempts to answer ""In theory, how deep could we possibly get if with currently technology a government or large company dug down with intent to get as deep as possible?"" I imagine if the only goal was ""get as deep as possible"" and the only resource limitations were ""the technology must be known to exist."" then we could probably figure out how to get all the way through the crust. And if really ambitious we could build lava proof walls to extend a few dozen or maybe a hundred meters beneath the crust.  I suppose if we really REALLY wanted to go deeper we can keep on building heat resistant walls several kilometres thick and maybe after two or three centuries of all humanity focusing on the singular goal of ""we need to go DEEPER!"" we will finally reach a point where someone will say, ""Wait, are we digging up now?... Oh my god we did it!

@bearvillebear1468,"I've got a few words of encouragement in the midst of what's going on. It might sound wierd, it is for real and I thought it would be important to say it.  Its long because I've tried to and any faqs!  Hopefully this will answer some of those nagging questions -  Why can't evil be forgiven and let off, how is the whole ""Jesus dying"" thing really relevant to anything? To you?  if you still have any questions let me know x  Ever struggle? Ever doubt that God Loves You After what you've done? Ever wonder if He exists for that matter? Read this:  All of us have lied, stolen (even tiny things count), spoken badly to our parents and had embarrassing and detestable thoughts in our thought life. The Bible calls this ""sin"", the breaking of God's laws. You might think, so what? Everyone lies and thinks bad things about others! Its human!  You're right. That's exactly what the Bible says, we're ""born into sin"" and that ""all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"" - Romans 3:23  What is that ""glory"", morally speaking? Well, the opposite of human nature and desires. Not lying, not stealing, and having a perfect thought life is God's standard for us.   But if its God's standard and we were made in ""God's image"", Why don't we meet it?  Well, Remember Adam and Eve and when they sinned. Before sin they were perfect in thought word and DEED completely, but after the first sin occured due to Satan's tempting in the Garden, it destroyed that part of us that was morally perfect and in perfect harmony with God's morals, standard, and love. So while we kept certain things, the ability to be thinking individuals with unique personalities, the moral part (affecting how our thoughts, actions and personalities operate) was damaged. To the point where we are ""opposed"" to God, hence His nature and standards being the opposite of what we see as reasonable or possible. The Bible even makes it clear that ""apart from God you can do nothing"" - John 15:5. Without Him, it will 100% feel ""opposite"", unreasonable and alien to us. Only WITH Him can we gain victory in these things.  Why doesn't God just let sin off and leave it? The Bible describes God as a ""righteous judge"", many wonder why God doesn't just let sin off and leave it, but He can't. Why? That's like a if a judge let off a  murderer who broke the state law. Everyone would attack that judge and call Him corrupt, saying that he had not done right and should be fired for failing to punish the murderer for his evil. AND to completely love and be good as God is, means you need to, in turn, hate all forms of evil. You can't truly love good unless you hate the existence of evil.  This means that God needed, as a righteous judge to punish sin with the ultimate penalty of death - expressing His hatred of evil - and separation from His presence forever. Hence Hell.  ""The soul that sins shall die (in Hell and suffer damnation)"" - Ezekiel 18:20  But God, who is also love, did not want to see His creation tortured and cut off from Him. He cares so much for is that He couldn't bear to see us fall into Satans hands and suffer death, even though we broke the law and deserve to bear the guilt, pain and be cut off from perfection forever through damnation.  Because of justice, God could not leave sin and evil unpunished, BUT because of LOVE, God provided someone else to take that punishment on our behalf, satisfying both justice (by punishing the evil committed), and love (by sparing OUR lives) despite our sin.    God sent His own SON - think about that. His *Son*, the one whom He loved infinitely (the same way He loves us).  God allowed Him to take the pain we deserved, He took ALL of Gods wrath for every single sin you and I have committed. He was punished brutally and completely as if He was the picture of mankind's sin itself so that we do not have to be punished.   Back in the courtroom scenario: He paid the ""fine"" at His own expense (His life had to be morally perfect on this Earth, then He had to be killed as a sinless sacrifice on our behalf). So when He returns to remove all evil from the face of the Earth, we can be spared and free because Christ has already BEEN punished on our behalf. He then rose again on the third day, conquering not only life and sin and temptation, but DEATH.   ""I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live (immortality and eternally in Heaven when I return)"" - John 11:25-26  ALL we have to do is accept it by faith. Faith alone in Christ alone.  Religion = rules to be saved  The gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong it time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He knows you even better than that. He created you and knows you inside out.  ...WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?  What does it actually mean for us? It means we can be completely free from the penalty of damnation. Not only that but we can be restored to Him and recreated into His moral image AGAIN as long as we accept Jesus having paid the price for us and accept Him as our Lord, the one who is in the front seat of our lives. He has a plan for your life, He's created you for a purpose. Just remember that. A purpose that includes being recreated into His image, one you can only accomplish through Him and reliance on His power and by following HIS way of life.   What is this new way entail?  It entails love, true love and service and aid to others, to ""love God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength"" and ""love your neighbour as you love yourself"" Matthew 22:37, 39.   Sharing the message of Christ's death, resurrection and soon return on this Earth to give justice OR mercy depending on what the person chose.  Sound ""opposite"" again?  God knows it sounds opposite, which is why, as The Bible states, this is NOT something we can do alone. It's not in our nature.   We need a new nature in the front seat,  and the first step is to repent (turn from and reject our sin, pursuing the opposite direction and drawing close to God)  Christ will give us an actual DESIRE to do these things. Through the, Holy Spirit, sent by Him to us after the ascension. He speaks to us through thoughts, verses, ideas and prayers and guides us so that we gain a desire to follow God and be able to do these ""opposite"" things through Him. ... What is the way FOR though? Firstly its to save you from sin - the only way to gain victory over sin and not have it as your master is through having Christ as your master and following His aid to resist the devil's temptations.  Christ lived down here for 33 years suffering EVERY FORM of temptation that you have ever faced - ""who in every respect [has] been tempted as we are, yet without sin"" Hebrews 4:15.  Therefore He is able to help us through our struggles. When the devil knows people have left his camp, he always tries harder with more temptations and evil attacks. BUT - His way is also there to guard and teach you daily in the midst of this (and despite this) sinful, selfish world.  The path He wants you to walk is one of committment and love - its not about rules and regulations to save us - what Christ did GAVE us salvation. All we need is faith. The rest, the ""fruits of good works (the will to obey and follow Him)"", are what come through true, maturing faith. It's all about faith and the relationship God wants with you just like before sin arrived.   God preferred His own Son to be tortured And killed to give a chance to us (who broke His law of perfection) so that we can live as His children again. He wants us to love and trust and worship Him.  What if I still find myself sinning after I have accepted Christ?  That's why Christ died, For our sin. His death doesn't fix us in a snap like that, but it does protect us from the damnation that our past, present and future sins would bring without Jesus.  It's a process - a lifelong process - of God bringing you back to Him, away from the destructive pleasures of sin (greed, selfish temptations, trampling on people to gain). This takes a *lifetime*, as it does for all, but NEVER give up, when you fall, know Christ paid for that sin you committed already - just acknowledge your sin and ask for forgiveness - and you can get back up again because He already bore your guilt and shame.  Regardless of the darkness you are in or the extent or frequency of the sins you have committed or will commit, regardless of how doubtful you may feel, know that Jesus UNDERSTANDS completely and He is faithful.   ""those who come to Me, I will by no means cast out"" - John 6:37  ...HOW DO I LEARN MORE?  Don't know where to start? Note down the Gospel of ""John"", or ""Luke"" (if you want a more detailed account of it all).  Remember that He will ""NEVER - and that means never - leave you, NOR forsake you"" - Deuteronomy 31:6   Regardless of what goes on down here, God knows, Jesus has been down here and felt all the emotions you are feeling. You can go to Him with them and be assured that He loves you and is for you.  Even in the storm, God is still there, walking on the water alongside you.  Keep your heart open to Him and remember that if we pray for Christ to enter our lives, He will.   ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son, that whomever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life"". - John 3:16  Thanks for reading if you did. I just felt that I should tell you regardless. Let me know if you have any more or if you need clarification on anything x",5년 전,0,

@freemind..,"​ @Rose White  - ""GOD shattered Earth's crust to start the flood"" Your personal interpretation of scripture...  unless you can provide a biblical reference for God shattering the crust ..? ""great masses of TRexes, humans, fish, vegetation and general organic matter... creating THE STEAM AND METHANE that volcanoes give off."" Around 95% of what gets expelled from volcanoes is steam.  You think that the methane expelled from volcanoes today is the byproduct of organic waste from the Flood around 4400 years ago?  Not so.  It is from vast microbial populations inside the crust. ""You do realise the Russians found superhot water just a few miles down?"" I'm aware, but do YOU realize that they were drilling on a fault??  THAT is why the water was hot.  Do you know WHY they picked that spot to drill?  Because they were detecting a large magnetic anomaly there, and they were hoping to find the cause.  They believed that there must be a large mass (probably of iron) that was causing the anomaly.  Did they find it?  Nope.  There wasn't one.  The cause of the anomaly, and of the heat in the borehole, was that they were drilling directly on a fault..  because that is where both the heat and the piezoelectric field are generated.  ""if your IQ was as high as mine."" You mean, if it WERE as high as yours...  but I'm sure you were just dumbing it down for the rest of us.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@freemind..," @rosewhite---  - ""As drilling has only reached 6 miles with increasing temperature"" Drilling reached just over 8 miles.. not 6. ""...we can assume it gets hotter"" We can make no such assumption.  If we assume that the rate of temperature increase is consistent to the core, then the core must be over 350,000 degrees.  Assumptions and inferences like that are why Science is so far off the mark. ""unexpectedly high temperatures, caused the rock to behave somewhat like a plastic, making drilling nearly impossible"" If rock became ductile at less than 10 miles deep due to heat, how do you explain deep earthquakes that happen 600+ kilometres down?  At such depths and extrapolated temperatures, nothing should be brittle enough to fracture at all, and therefore deep earthquakes should be impossible...  yet they are detected globally, and no one disputes their existence.",5년 전,0,
@freemind..,"​ @rosewhite---  - ""if your IQ was as high as mine."" Let's give you a chance to showcase your critical thinking skills...  Are you aware of the other boreholes that have been drilled?  Do you know that the temperatures vary wildly from one to the next??  Why would that be?    How does the temperature rise so quickly at KOLA, but not rise at all with 3,000 feet of drilling at another drill site?  What is the difference?    Do you know why MINES tend to get hotter with depth, but deep cave systems get COLDER with depth?  How does that make sense if the heat in mines is just radiating up from below?  Why would that same heat not radiate up into the cave systems as well??    If heat radiating up from below is why boreholes and mines get hotter with depth, then why do oceans get colder with depth?  Are you not getting closer to the same heat source that radiates up through the continental crust?  In fact, the oceanic crust is about 1/5th as thick, so should that heat from below not radiate through even more efficiently than through the much thicker continental crust?    If you believe that the interior of the Earth is hot, WHAT do you believe is creating that heat??  How would shattering the crust cause the Global Flood?  What forced the water out from inside?

@billybanana9019,"The fall times are impressive, but they don't account for air resistance. Various internet sources place the terminal velocity of a quarter at 28 mph, or 12.5 m/s. So at terminal velocity, it'll take about 1,000 seconds for a quarter to hit the bottom of the Kola Borehole; the 50-second estimate comes from assuming that the quarter continues accelerating steadily at 9.8 m/s^2, impacting the bottom at 490 m/s, or about 1,100 mph. Moreover, the 1,000 seconds is still a low figure because 1) it doesn't account for the dead start at zero m/s; and 2) terminal velocity will decrease at greater depths as the air becomes ever-thicker. And of course that's to say nothing of the effects of falling in a tight space, or of deceleration from frictive impacts on the side walls.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@Hapotecario," sahebmails  ""What is the deepest hole we can possibly dig?"" You are missing a hole lot of options and the guy in the video did too and exploring these limits is in my opinion the actual aim of the question. So, here are my two cents. If you made the hole big enough you could put people and machines through it. Then you could make everything you want go through the tunnel and that would help you dig deeper and deeper. The earth inner core is solid and is about 7000ºC so we would have to find a way to go through that. Until 4000ºC we have carbon alloys that can withstand this temperature without melting. And this means we could at least go through the top part of the earths mantle which is solid - ish. Temperatures higher than this, the only way I can think of that is a possible way to hold things is through the use of an electromagnetic field. You would have to refrigerate everything and make a way for electrical current to go through until those depths. We would have to account for gravity change and for the movement of the fluid parts of the earth core. Earth's outer core is fluid and super hot, this is actually what creates earth's magnetic field, here would lie our biggest challenge. Another interesting thing to think about is how could we operate a machine at those depths. Because even even we could refrigerate the whole thing we would still have to set up the tunnel structure before installing the pipes to move the refrigeration liquid through them. Refrigeration would be a problem because of gravity. One would have to use pumps. Well. This exercise is endless and I am not any kind of expert. Space and mining engineers would certainly talk with much more knowledge about the possible challenges of such an endeavor.  Peace.",5년 전,4,

@kles44," @ROBYT047   I'd be glad to.  Actually,  if you have the proper equipment you can get down to 1 / 2000 of an inch.  in the past I actually worked in an industry where we measured labels precisely and had to be able to measure borders, columns etc down to 1/64 of an inch using a special ruler.  We used metric as well but we are talking about using mm which is not the easiest thing to do but finding 3 /32nd of an inch or 20/64 is slightly more manageable because of how great the lines on imperial rulers are divided. 8th,  16th, 32nd , 64 make it easier to find these.  The difference between the Two is merely a matter of preference nothing more.  It's only how we categorize things and the average comment I get from people who want the metric system is 'well the whole world uses it'... nothing about it being more practical, which is actually  a subjective opinion... It's merely a matter of the left having a europhillic mindset. .. that's all this is about.",5년 전,0,

So from the current deepest hole according to this video (12.4km), we only have 2.4km better to do, if we dig the hole in the right spot.  A question is how we handle the heat and the pressure of digging deeper.  But this video doesn't live up to its title.  It promises to talk about our current capabilities; but only talks about the past.",5년 전,0,
@Swaggaccino," @tsuchan  One interesting detail I notice about the Kola superdeep borehole is that it is now filled with water. I'm not sure if it happened during the drilling or filled up afterwards but I would imagine to combat the heat, we could always try water cooling the drill or drilling at small intervals. It should theoretically be possible with modern day tech especially in Iceland. But the mantle would def be the limit. Or would it? I know it's made up of iron and we have tech that could drill through iron today but it would be at an incredibly and painfully slow pace. Plus I would imagine the mantle's temp would melt the drill.",5년 전,0,

@centauria9122,"So, it gets really hot the deeper you go, but what if we widen the hole to a certain diameter and circumference, dig down, and if it gets hot, you're gonna need to wear a thermo suit that can resist high temperatures to a certain extent. However, if it does get really hot, you're gonna need to cool it down using water and then pumping it back into the tankers, dig down, water it, back into tanker, rinse and repeat until it is unbearably hot for your suit or cold water to cool down. The effort will take years to do, but I'd say using excavators, digging machines, dozers, earth mover dumps, and human diggers and miners will work. Oh and I think I should also add that pressure does increase the deeper into the planet you go. For a hole to be dug that deep, more air will fill up that hole and the air pressure at those depths will increase. Humans can only survive up to 3-4 atmospheres of pressure.",5년 전,1,

@anthonybutto1925,"I will share I dare say most people and maybe you will not believe. Yes, you're right, it's void. That's because very little, the Soviets, the Russian scientist have found out and do not wanna find out more of what's lurking down there because it's horrific. After digging for days on end they lowered down a microphone that is sensitive to sound. They heard a woman's voice in the earth wailing and screaming in excruciating pain and possibly hundreds, thousand or millions of background voices all wailing and screaming all at the same time. An expert who says he believes in heaven and hell has is own sound equipment and I picked him up on youtube. He wanted to prove people wrong by providing relevant examples to support his argument by telling everyone that it's just a hoax. He measured every single sound of it. In the end he sound like he doubted by simply telling everyone, ""there you have it guys,"" why! Simply because he could not at all provide any relevant examples to support his argument on his own sound equipment to prove it's fake; simply because he just did not wanna show in detail how his own sound equipment works because he did not wanna look like and sound like a fool on youtube, should we rely on him, I would't. Many people will not believe what they read here simply because many do not believe in the holy scriptures. No body can prove the bible wrong and never will for there is concrete evidence to support the argument for they are sacred in the book. Moment of truth! If that's not gonna shake your senses, I researched I think for long enough to know that there have been few people who share their story and as God is my witness, each person on each film footage on youtube share the same story saying, ""I was dead, I was travelling to earth like travelling towards a volcano and I saw the dead. I woke up and doctors and nurses declared it,"" ""you were dead,"" when I was discovered to be alive. It could also be a dark tunnel, people can share the same story on that and can also be true as well, it still leads to that same place. What a horrible way that after dying to suffer like these people do for eternity. I am not trying to sound like a control freak. The holy scriptures do not lie. Did not the Lord Jesus declare that just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the wale so to the son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. Your best friend is the Holy Bible- actually, John Wayne showed everyone by writing with his finger to the audience when he was interviewed that it was his favorite book after he was being asked what his favorite book is, he's dead now. But why did the Soviets do this? They did it to discover earths nature to see how the earth works in the event of an earth quake for scientist, teachers and students to know. There is probably lots to say and I tried to cut it short. If you wanna hear it, type in, ""sounds of Hell - best quality."" I just tested it and it scares me witless to hear it for a long 37 seconds, that's enough to almost send shivers down my spine, far out! Then, each and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, thank you for sharing.",5년 전,0,

@anthonybutto1925," @originalbmrd None of these actually relate to me. If you've been to Sunday school, looking back in history in there life time people thought the Lord Jesus the matchless king was a guru; cause he sound like one and in the end he proved some of them wrong. Well, in the final end he's gonna prove them all foolishly wrong what kind of a life they lived if what they did was acceptable to God or not. People need to beg the Lord Jesus for mercy and forgiveness to escape that horrible place and it's the only way out. If not, they won't have a tongue, not even a gender, they're gonna be wishing the day they were never born, that's how horrible it is. One thing I know about mankind: You've been doing naughty things everywhere and behind closed doors that if I had the power and I wanted to, if I wanted to post every single bit of detail about you on youtube what you did to your family and friends and what you did in secret in your life time, I would. Nah, I won't, I'm not that nasty. Actually, we don't even relate to begin with. And that's what it's gonna be like on judgement day when everyone will be judged and all of this we share is recorded and revealed. Even what you shared with me just now people are gonna be wishing it was all just a dream. This is truth, what is truth, or you can't handle the truth. If people never do nothing about it, it will be everlasting to late. Ho, what a sorry site they will be Bill. You think it's funny bill, really, go ahead, make my day. You have a right to make a mockery out of it if you wanna for they even made a mockery out of him also. You did it to me and you did it to him also the matchless king; cause we're made in his image and likeness, in the image and likeness of his son. It's not funny if it happens to you, well, you have been warned. Ignore it and it could be everlasting to late and if it is, these words will stick with you for all eternity. People may sound like a guru but that does not necessarily mean to say that they are one. I know I'm in a perfect state of mind and my conscious is clear. It's unimaginable and I don't even wanna share it. Do you love horror movies, yeah, maybe you do. Well, if you do, find out for yourself. Thus to say, If it happens to you, as God is my witness, you will freak out; for I had biblical visions of this myself. Who knows, you could be the next witness yourself for he is that merciful that if he wants to he could do it to you also. But not everyone for he only knows mankind to the core and I may be right in saying you would not believe me, thank you for your time.",5년 전,0,

Wikipedia said their reason for this was to get the record from USA, which was held by the Bertha Rogers hole, in Oklahoma, which is 9,583 m deep. I had to check that because it sounded crazy that they would have tried to drill through the crust with equipment that can only handle 180 Celsius.

Gagarin was the first man in space and the first to orbit the earth, but he did not get to the moon nor was the point of his mission to do so. After his first flight, he worked with the cosmonaut program but was eventually disallowed from piloting spacecraft because the USSR did not want to risk his life as he was a beloved public icon. His flight is well-documented and the USSR did not even try to act like he landed on the moon.

We understand much more about our planet than we did 100 years ago and we're learning more all the time.  We think the very center of the earth is iron because meteorites that have fallen on the earth are mostly iron.  Where the lava comes from in volcano eruption, isn't even close to the center of the earth but obviously is affected by the heat and magma below  it.

@kallestropp7447,"I understand that there are limitations to drilling down deeper than they have so far. It would be interesting to calculate the area / angle that would be required to make a hole in the form of a quarry down to the center of the earth. I did, and it will be a giant hole at the surface. Let's say that an angle of 60 degrees is required to be able to build roads for trucks, etc. The diameter of the hole at the soil surface would then need to be 22000 km😱😱😱. Fuck! It will be hard! The US is about 5,000 km from coast to coast. We need more land!!! Someone else can count how deep we can dig if we use the entire US, Mexico and Canada. Be careful before hiring a contractor though.

@thehungriestcannibal,mal'ak emeth Damn why you gotta come at us Americans like that. It’s also kinda idiotic to believe flat earthers are located only in America and no where else. There’s stupid people everywhere. Go to England and there’s crazy people spewing out information about how no one has freedom of thoughts. Go to France and you’ll find people who believe slavery should be legal. Go to Japan and you’ll find people who kidnap and start cults. That stuff isn’t isolated to the places I’m listing it’s just some examples. Idiot or uneducated crazy people aren’t specifically in one place and you don’t have to attack an entire country because of some idiots. That’s like hating all white people because a white person murdered someone. Just because some people do something doesn’t mean everyone does it or it’s like that everywhere.,5년 전(수정됨),0,

@Xeno_Bardock,"Why dig a hole to the center of earth? When there's literally a hole naturally formed by centrifugal force located at the rotation axis of earth 90 latitude leading to the center of earth. All you have to do is fly or sail straight to the rotation axis of earth. Experiments prove centrifugal force naturally form a large hole at the rotation axis of all planets, youtube search ""Rotating Water + Air Sphere"". For proof of polar hole, google ""New Hubble Portrait of Mars"" and ""Mars North Polar Opening Confirmed"". Polar hole in plain sight observed by Nasa hubble telescope, they forgot to censor it. It is no wonder it is prohibited for airplanes to fly directly over rotation axis of earth. For more evidence of polar holes on earth, google and read Chapters III-VIII in Marshall B.

If u dig a hole from Canada I would fall down but if u dig a hole in China and jump down it u would fall as well: would u just float in the middle? But of course u would just die but say u didn’t die. If u dig a hole from Canada all the way to China how would you fall to the moon or go in loop where u just go back and forth between Canada and China and die from wipe-lash.

@a.v.j.w.5544,"Maybe because when you fall, the gravity drops you at high speed. Digging down has nothing to do with gravity. When you dig a hole, you're holding the handle.

@johnd3089,What's wrong with this picture? Doesn't anyone use critical thinking skills anymore? 7.5 miles down the Kola bore hole reached an area where there was massive amounts of water. They supposedly stopped digging because the temperatures got way too hot. How do you explain how there could be massive amounts of water at those temperatures? There wasn't any steam pouring out of the hole. The true facts are the rock they encountered at that depth was so hard it was breaking their drill bits and they could not penetrate beyond that depth.,6년 전,0,

Thus standard resource limitations would not technically apply. So, knowing that, instead of a machine drill that will obviously break and overheat, it's time to think bigger. We've already seen the hole dig potential of penetrative arms- so take that potential and funnel it into a series of dedicated mining armaments, and use them over and over again to blast through the lower portions of the Earth. The only limitation would be however many nuclear weapons we have. There's your theoretical hole limit.",6년 전,0,

@lanceneidhardt4283, @jamescastelli  that idea is so nearly impossible and impractical that I think we can remove that from any conversation. The amount of time and resources that would require is essentially impossible for humanity to spend,6년 전,0,
@jamescastelli," @lanceneidhardt4283  Well, economic impracticality is a different reason than physical impossibility. If the current conical pit were simply scaled up, even if the current one were increased, then we could in theory at least go deeper than we HAVE. I don't think we magically hit a special depth in which anything deeper is impossible.  It would depend on the location of the earth it is drilled, what the rock and soil are like, how close to sea level it is, etc. Also, in addition to ""open air cooling"" of the conical pit, the ""open scar"" of the earth would likely cool a bit too in the process. A narrow hole going down miles does not permit the heat to escape properly.  If you are thinking this is so impossible, then you might as well scoff at other supposedly impossible scientific ideas like the Dyson Sphere or intergalactic craft, or even tackling something like global warming, which we might be behooved to do, but will cost way more money and require far more international cooperation than digging a hole. Plus, your thinking could have easily stopped the current deepest examples from being realized had you thought it prior to the effort being made.",6년 전,0,
@lanceneidhardt4283," @jamescastelli  that has got to be the most ignorant comment I've ever seen. You're completely leaving out the fact that all those other things you just listed actually present some sort of benefit to the world. Spending money to fight global warming helps humanity in the long run. Spending shit tons of money simply for the sake of digging a hole: a) presents no real benefits to society, b) is a complete waste of resources, c) would simply ruin a chunk of the earth, d)would take an insanely long time to complete. Theoretically, yes it could work.  BUT My statistics teacher told my class that when the probability of an event happening becomes low to a certain point, it essentially becomes statistically impossible to happen(yes there is the extremely tiny chance of it happening, but it'sso low that it is left out of the conversation/equation), and I think this is a somewhat example of that. The chances of anyone ever trying this is so low, that we can pretty much just throw it out of any conversation",6년 전,0,
@jamescastelli," @lanceneidhardt4283  I'm sorry you think my reply is ignorant. So thank you for definitively answering that, ""no"" digging deeper is impossible not because of any physical limitation, but because of money and priorities. Well, gee, that was enlightening. Hardly a SCIENTIFIC answer to a scientific question: ""how deep COULD we dig?"" I guess they should have added ""if money was no object and we weren't concerned if it provided some auxiliary benefit to all of humanity."" I guess I need lessons on reading into things.  ""...the fact that all those other things you just listed actually present some sort of benefit to the world. "" Well considering that ALL the other things I mentioned other than global warming amounted to building a Dyson Sphere and an Intergalactic Vessel, I'd say your notion of what THOSE would cost vs. the ""urgent benefit to mankind"" they would offer is quite a stretch. Perhaps tapping into the energy of the earth's core is a possible motivation, at least as it was once entertained in sci-fi realizations at least.  ""The chances of anyone ever trying this is so low, that we can pretty much just throw it out of any conversation.""  Again, I think this is the sort of short-sighted thinking that anyone at any point in history can make about seemingly impossible as-yet unrealized undertakings. You'd fit right in with a group of people just over a century ago who would try to convince all of us about the forever impossibility of human flight. I mean, just think of the cost! And to whose benefit?? The future and its endeavors are always an unexplored country, and it is mere hubris for any human to think that the point in time they exist happens to be the absolute apex of human ability, ingenuity, and scientific knowledge.  I imagine you'd do well for one of those ""how did they build the pyramids?"" shows, where incredulity makes us imagine it was so impossible that since WE can't figure it out... it must have been ALIENS! Besides, consider the COST and utter lack of benefit to mankind a structure would accomplish. So, yea, building an ancient Egyptian pyramid: impossible.",6년 전,0,
@lanceneidhardt4283," @jamescastelli  1. Nowhere did I ever say that those presented an URGENT benefit to mankind(as you outright said). They may not present an urgent benefit, but they present some sort of benefit. Intergalactic vessel could help us find other life forms in the universe, which people have long wondered, or we could know if there are any other inhabitable planets for us, as our population on earth is growing, and we could easily run out of room and resources on out own planet in the future.  2. Once again you're showing your ignorance. I'm saying the chances of someone doing this is incredibly low because of the known FACT that it would not present any use to humanity. All of these other examples such as human flight presented great use to humanity, which is why they were pursued. It was either practical for the furtherance of all of the human race to pursue success in these areas that you mention, or it proved to have uses for whoever used/created them. That's completely different than digging a hole just for the sake of digging a big hole.  3. In theory, if we throw all rules and common sense out the window(as you're clearly saying we should do for this question), we could drill through the entire earth. If we completely remove from the equation the fact that there are physical limitations(not even including resources and time and money) such as the immense heat that our drills would not be able to go though, then we could drill as far as we wanted. So there is the simple, impractical answer you're obviously looking for",6년 전,0,
@jamescastelli," @lanceneidhardt4283  1. Soooo...... you're saying all we need to do is IMAGINE the possible future (non-presently urgent) benefit any endeavor (including Dyson Sphere creation, an engineering feat that would require more raw materials than all the planets would provide) to entertain it future possibility. Which... I suppose for some reason is an exercise in imagination you cannot extend to the benefits of holes to a source of energy that has been present for the life of the planet. Mmkay. Imagination required, but SELECTIVE imagination. Got it.  2. It is NOT ""known fact"" that digging holes presents no benefit to society. Otherwise, how were all the existing holes ever dug? None of them were for use of energy, but to find water, find precious minerals and jewels, or to store radioactive material. We've always needed water but for thousands of years never needed to dig so deep, and mining for diamonds or requiring radioactive storage locations are relatively recent motivations to dig. You seem unable to imagine future possible motivations for digging where we'd ONCE AGAIN be confronted with having to answer the question: ""How deep can we dig?"" And lo, you won't be there with your party-pooping dismissive answer.  Also, you are suggesting that flight was not nor would have been a benefit to mankind UNTIL WE FIGURED IT OUT. If the industrial age would have happened a thousand years earlier, humans would have availed themselves of it. What was lacking was not money (well, some is always needed for any endeavor) but rather scientific understanding and engineering capabilities. your ""we don't have the money and it won't benefit anyone"" pat answer would not actually answer the question ""is it possible for humans to achieve flight or visit the moon?"" is you asked it during the Renaissance. You simply would have failed to have imagined and appreciated the possibility and potential of human ingenuity and achievement in the future.  3. There are undoubtedly physical limitations to digging, as in when you dig so deep that the temperature would melt any known substance and the pressure would crush it, as well as the fact that in a liquid environment the notion of a ""hole"" presents a problem such as digging a hole in the water in your bathtub. Unless you could somehow freeze/solidify the liquid, this would not be possible, unless simply ""diving deeper through the molten liquid"" was a sufficient substitute of the endeavor.  But LONG before we get to that point, there is simply extending deeper than we currently have. Is going down one millimeter more not possible? One meter? presumably there is some depth deeper than currently attempted that IS possible without bankrupting the entire planet to do so, so the question remains: HOW deep could we dig? Practicality doesn't enter into such questions of what is possible vs. impossible. There could be ""an answer"" that we don't have to actually then act upon.",6년 전,0,

@ArynMadden,"Well, the question to your video really isn't answered entirely... ""How far have we dug"" is different than ""how far can we dig"". Just because we have dug so far down doesn't mean that, if we really were possessed to dig further, it couldn't be done... So your video, while it had some fascinating facts, and I enjoyed your pictures and animations, does not answer the question. Perhaps someone should apply physics to solving the question... It would afford some scientific measure to the question, I think... I was not very good at high-level physics, so I'm afraid I'm not the one to do it. I wish you would have answered the question you asked yourself......

Of course, we don't know if we would end up at another mountain or flat land or a valley.

How about doing something for sustainable life within the planet for humanity like water treatment for our lakes and rivers. For every shift there will be a reaction or consequence.",6년 전,0,

@WildBillCox13,"Thought provoking.  Thanks for posting. Consider the result of boring through the crust.  You reach a region where the rock is so hot it would melt, except for the pressure.  Your bore hole provides a relief valve for all that pressure and you think you can stop it with a steel cork?  So melted rock, driven by the cumulative pressure of the thousands of kilometers of rock and stone overhead, shoots out the end like a rocket exhaust!  Instant volcano.   Instant catastrophic effect on weather and environment.  You think that can be stoppered up, once you set it free?  Try asking a reputable geophysicist to live onsite and broadcast during the operation.  You won't find one stupid enough to do it.",6년 전,0,

If the Wright brothers thought it was insignificant that they could only stay in flight for a few sec or mins we wouldn't have planes today. But instead that saw the grand picture. It's about progression not instant gratification. Sec turn to mins mins to hours. Just remember, for some day in the future when man reaches the core. That mere 7 mil will not even be visible. Instead you will see the entirety of the accomplishment. You have to start somewhere or you'll never get there if that makes any sense.",7년 전,0,

@Dunriteproducts," @beththomas3532  just as you were ""trained"" to believe in God.  However we did land on the moon. Not only that but several private company's are currently planning to go again soon as well as commercialize space travel so that anyone will be able to go to space in the relatively near future. Hears something to think about... You believe in God which means that assuming your god is Jesus then you also believe that you must be ""saved"" in order to go to heaven which also means that all the people on earth who are kind, caring, giving, loving, selfless, good hearted people yet do not accept Jesus as their Lord and savior are going to hell. And you also believe that any other religious person who believes in any other God but Jesus is also going to hell. Well if that's the only way to heaven then someone can have my seat and I'll go the other way. Funny thing about that kind of belief is that if you happen to be born in some very very remote region in a small tribe or village that still knows basicly nothing of the rest of the world then chances are that you would never even have an opportunity to know that Christianity exists at all!  Guess that kid just drew the short straw cause he will go to hell just for being born in the wrong place! Oh and as for the keyword in science being GUESS..., there is not one single solitary piece of 100% indisputable evidence that Jesus was anything more than a mortal man with a good line of b.s.",6년 전,3,

The entire southern plateau stretching across the northwestern part of Arizona is lower by 1200 feet!  There is nothing in modern geology that can explain the Grand Canyon other than the combined forces of an earthquake and receding floodwaters----both on a scale never before witnessed.    The lack of erosion on the canyon walls shows that it didn't happen over millions of years and was not caused by simply wind and water.  A dam break does not account for the drop of the southern plateau, nor does it account for the side-canyons which could not have formed from erosion.

@lunelilyonrunescape,"Dennis Bloodsworth Then I’m sorry to disappoint you 😅   I have enormous faith in science and philosophy to explain the world. (For example, I also tend to believe in a lack of free will due to hard determinism; given the universe runs on certain laws, if you knew all the universe’s laws, then you would know every cause and effect, and thereby be able to perfectly predict the future, including human actions—which means that all our actions are predetermined). I also have a lot of trouble believing that a loving and all-powerful god could create or allow a world with this much evil. (If such a god exists, it seems like they decided to take a really hands-off approach, and if they did that, how loving can they really be?)  But how did those laws of the universe that I believe in because of science—like gravity and inertia and all the rest—come to be? That question—like the question of how the first atom came to be—has always bugged me. Why is there not infinite nothing? How does anything at all exist? Even if we take evolution and chance and cause and effect all the way back to the beginning of the universe, to the infinitely small thing that exploded via the Big Bang into the known universe—how can we explain how/why it exploded? Or more importantly, how it even got there in the first place?  Part of me has scientific faith that someday we’ll find the answer. But another part of me would bet we never will, and there are just some unknowable things in our universe outside our comprehension.  That’s why I’m agnostic ☺️ I don’t believe in what most people call god, but I can’t rule out some unknowable higher power, either. So I stay open-minded, waiting ready for evidence which will almost certainly never come.",7년 전,2,

Out of curiosity is very different from If fate of the humanity depends on it. Surely people can do much much better. I would think you can dig crater style, like the do some open mines, with 45 degrees(?) slope and then the diameter of the hole will be DEPTHx2. The open air will cool down the immediate crust surrounding the dig. And it all becomes just a matter of math on giant scale. How long will it take to dig a 50km crater? That will get you to 25km down. 100km gets you 50km depth. The question is where to you put displaced earth? Will it cause some earth shift problems? etc etc... Nothing of which is answered here.

@01ZombieMoses10,"I don't feel like this is nit-picking, and other viewers have stated similar views; If you are going to pose a question as the title, maybe you should actually at least make a layman's attempt to answer it, which nowadays basically just requires the internet and sufficient curiosity. For example, in ten minutes, I discovered Project Mohole which was an attempt in the 1960's by the American Miscellaneous Society - that was their actual name, I'm not shitting you - to drill to the mantle via the ocean floor. Phase One was a proof of concept for undersea drilling - at the time, the entire concept was still fairly new - in which the team drilled a test hole of 601 feet starting at a depth of 11,700 feet, but they never got approval or funding to go ahead and actually drill to the mantle (Phase Two) and the organization dissolved. Long story short, drilling into the mantle was considered theoretically possible even with 1960's technology by drilling into the oceanic crust.",7년 전,0,

@Sefilenginar,"The durations of longer falls are very inaccurate. Most everyday objects reach terminal velocity (because of air resistance) within 5-6 seconds at most, which gives them a speed of 50-60m/s (180-216km/h) making the big falls much longer than your calculations. Also, those deep holes would have larger atmospheric pressure and higher density of air as you approach the bottom so the terminal velocity would gradually decrease as you fall down. The pressure at the bottom of a 12500 m hole would be about 3-4x that on the surface, or the equivalent of a 20-30 meter dive in water.",7년 전,10,

@kordulus,You are right. The video shows the deepest hole humans have dug. It explains we couldn't dig any further do to extreme temps. But that's past tense(the z44 broke the record for deepest drill way back in 2012). The question is what is the deepest hole we can currently dig. (present tense) with our current technology. Just because it hasn't been done yet doesn't mean we can't do it. So with that in mind the question remains. How far can we dig?,7년 전(수정됨),4,

@baloog8,"It is good constructive criticism, but in life, you always got to move towards your goal and see everything as an opportunity. We have a discussion going and potential scientists to join in. Let me take a stab at it. Ok, so the deepest hole was 7 miles. Several hundred degrees should be no problem for drilling materials these days. I believe we can easily drill down to 14 miles as long as we keep reinforcing the tunnel and pumping coolant. I would be concerned with the material torsion strength of the shaft at this point, but as long as we put it in high gear and shear a bit at a time, I think we can keep going. In addition, with unlimited funds, we should also be able to open the top of the shaft to open up into a sort of deeper ground level to get a deeper engine/shaft system in there. As we approach 20 miles, we will have to start thinking about space age materials - ie exotic ceramics, better pumps etc, because we are about to hit magma!  You would have to seal the magma off with the same technology as oil rigs I imagine but with a lot more coolants and/or ridiculously expensive materials/exotic technologies that may have yet to exist. Starlite, a covert military material comes to mind. It can withstand 10,000 C. Since magma is liquid, you would have to continue your reinforced tube down into the magma layers. At which point, pretty soon, you don't need to drill as much as you need to pump magma out and pushing the tube further down into the magma.   It hurts my brain to even think of the technologies you need at this point from 25 miles and beyond. You may need to start with a wider hole or build remote robots(maybe even micro/nanotech) to continue the tunnel down towards the center of the earth. Honestly, full effort from humanity, neverminding covert techs or resource limitations, I think we could do about 19 or so miles before we encounter the mantle. Thats all we can probably do right now with our current technology. Beyond that R&D can maybe take us to 30 to 2400 miles depending on the inspiration of creativity and motivation over a period of at least 5 to 100 years. There's a crapload of pressure down there. The tech would be unimaginable.",7년 전(수정됨),8,

@maelughran6981,"The deepest hole ever dug?  Easy. That would be the one currently being shovelled by the UK's Conservative Government. To put into a Churchillian context:  "" Never in the field of British political decision-making has so much been given by so many to so few"".  The Tories are dragging the country to the edge of a chasm so deep that the country will never recover.  Its called Brexit.  We stand to lose everything - our (European) friends, especially the Irish, our economic stability, our jobs, our welfare, our self-respect. Cameron and May between them have presided over, orchestrated and driven the country's greatest ever catastrophe, bigger even than the ultimate cost of engaging in two World Wars.  So, thanks for voting the Tories in those of you who are willing to confess.",7년 전,0,

@tylerlhotta7317,"Do you think if we drilled a hole to a depth where water would boil, for example the Russian one, we could use it to purify water by an ocean. In theory, letting ocean water flow into the hole, letting it boil from the heat of the earth, and then letting the water condensate and pumping it back to the surface. The problems I see are the energy to pump the water, and the build up of salt. Perhaps the energy could be sourced from a turbine from water flowing into the tunnel",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Hey, I used to believe what I was taught un school, but I decided to watch this flat earthers vídeo and I changed my mind. People have the right to believe.  There are great channels here that explains the theory of flat earth. I was looking for info of men actually going to the moon, and why we never went back, then it led me to the Van Allen Belts (radiation zone around earth that no man can go near, therefore we can't go pass earth's low orbit).  In the bible is called  firmament. Finally I got to the flat earth theory, which is pretty interesting.",7년 전,0,

You're telling me in order to become knowledgeable in that area you have to swear to never tell the truth about the earth? How would they control every single person who has studied the earth? People think it's like some Illuminati shit. There's so much proof of earth being round that it takes someone blind to reality, gullible to be brainwashed into thinking the earth is flat. Not even worth trying to convince someone. That person is lost as this point and I haveore important things in life to worry about than convincing someone who is basically dumb. I've seen those videos too and it's just hilarious.",7년 전,3,

@ffggddss,"I remember the Mohole Project of the 50's – they never did reach the Mohorovičić discontinuity (the ""Moho"") – the crust-mantle boundary – like they intended to, but they got pretty deep. (This was a brainchild of AMSoc – the American Miscellaneous Society.) Still, I think deeper holes have since been dug or drilled, no? I read that the USSR continued their version of such a project after the US abandonded ours, and they managed to reach a depth of almost 8 miles (12,260 m) before they, too, gave up (1989).  BTW, the depth of the Moho varies considerably, due to isostasy. It's shallowest right where it's hardest to conduct drilling operations, namely, in the deepest parts of the ocean, where it can be as little as 5 km deep. On land, it's between 20 km and 90 km down. As the video points out, it gets really, really HOT! when you get that deep. You're basically trying to reach the depth where lava begins. Reaching the Moho is probably beyond our current technological capability, but probably within reach of technology we could develop in an all-out, Apollo-style program.  Fred",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@RolandMitchell,"I Know it's almost Impossible to believe Where it said that if the 40 Meter Swimming Pool were drained of its water and someone fell into It or fell down it where it would take almost three seconds to hit the Bottom: Forgive Me for not been One for converting Feet to Meters it's one of those things I can never grasp: ""What I am about to tell you is the Absolute  Gospel truth ! Many Years ago I was a window Cleaner of which I was cleaning a three story House of which was over 16 Feet High: 40 Meters is Much more than 16 Feet where it in that case If I dropped from that height It would Only Take less than a second for me to drop onto a stone floor and most likely Fracture My ankles and Break My Legs in two or three places ! would you agree with that assumption ? Well in my Case it took me at least 12 to 15 seconds for me to Fall from only  16 Feet: !! You see My Extended Ladder was extended as far as it would extend, and in order to Put the Ladder right up at the window sill the Base of the Ladder was two feet away from the wall: I had to edge myself up the ladder as not to Unbalance the Ladder where it would topple over. When I reached the  top of the Ladder I actually was only three rungs from off the top of the Ladder, and even then I could not Reach the Very top corner of the Window . I suppose I was an idiot But I Jumped up from off the rung of which I was stood on to Get into the Far corner with my Damp Leather ; and Managed to get into the Corner: But as I dropped back onto the Ladder; the Ladder began to topple away from the wall where instinct told me that I should Kick with Both feet against the Ladder rungs ! The Ladder sprang Back onto the window sill but then my feet were now to come from off the Ladder I tried to Grab the Ladder but was out of reach: I began to fall: I'm telling you no lies: I was to Close My Eyes as I was dropping to the Pavement Below: I had a thought shoot through my mind of which said ""here Goes"" ? I envisaged that I was going to be in a bad state when I had hit the Ground . But something wonderful Happened it was a Miracle without a doubt. Still with my Eyes shut I was still dropping to the Ground But Now I began to Realize I Had been in the air for More than five seconds where I then Said out Loud """"When am I going to Hit the Ground? 12 to 15 seconds Later My trainer Bottoms touched the Pavement when I say touched the Pavement that is exactly what Happened it was as though I was jumping from off a Matchbox. no broken Bones: A Bus was going by where a Man saw the whole thing! The Bus Driver Slammed on his Brakes of which Black smoke squealed from the Tyre's the Man shot across the road thinking that I Might need help: He could not believe his Eyes when he  saw me Simply Climb back up the  Ladder to dry off the window: Strange as it seems I at that time had not thought  on how Lucky I was that Day: But the following Day as I went back to the same area to Clean more windows: I had my Ladder on my shoulder where suddenly I would feel a Sharp Jerk where I almost lost my Balance: I turned My head Both directions to see who the Hell was Playing the Fool ! There was no one there ! Two Seconds Later a Voice without an accent spoke quite Clearly within My ear "" He Said It's Only Me ?? I Now Knew that that some one who had said it's only Me was that same Person that was holding Me where I was Being Lowered as if I was a leaf floating gently onto the Ground: I want to believe that that someone was a Guardian angel Because Over the Past Years I have encountered Many things of which can only be described as a Miracle",7년 전,0,

@agonleed3841,"Helter Skelter I always thought that we were thinking in a 3d environment. And that we were talking about digging to the middle, and from there we have also theoretically dug in all directions in order to reach another area. And from the center EVERY other direction would be a new UP.  Now, if we're talking about just one tube. Going from one side formthe other, then still...it would be common sense for them to give a bigger area in the center to turn around. The reason is still the same as I stated. Because going to the other side...the gravity would be pulling you towards center. You'd be fighting against gravity. We fight against gravity when we jump. It brings us back down...toward the center of earth.all around the globe  So you'd be climbing a ladder, with gravity steadily trying to pull you down. Put your ladder against your house, then cljpimb it upside down. Then imagine trying to do that from the center of the earth to the other side. Because that's what will happen. You would be climbing up, but upside down.  So they WOULD give an areas large enough to turn around in center for that reason alone",7년 전,0,

@lezzman,"Presuming, of course, we had a specially shielded pipe to prevent you from being roasted (or more like incinerated) by the intense heat...because of atmospheric drag you would fall towards the centre no faster than terminal velocity.  At surface pressure, falling feet or head first with your arms at your side, terminal velocity would reach around 500 kilometres per hour but the deeper you fell the higher the air pressure would become and you would slow down.  The air pressure at the centre of our hypothetical pipe would be somewhere in the order of a couple of hundred billion atmospheres.  Needless to say it would compress you down to the size of a marble but it's unlikely you would get there in any case as the density of the atmosphere would be greater than your own body.  You would stop when the air density is the same as your body and you would not be able to sink any lower.  But, let us presume that the engineers who installed this remarkable pipe, sealed both ends and extracted all the air with an airlock at each end for you to enter wearing a pressure suit.  When you jump in your speed would increase continuously all the way to the centre.  When you pass the centre, your speed would start to decrease at the same rate that it increased on the way down as the effect of gravity would start to pull you back.  Your momentum would be so high that gravity's effect wouldn't stop you until you get to the exact end of the pipe on the other side of the world.  You could grab a handle bar at that end and step out...or you could do nothing and you would fall again back to where you started.  Theoretically you could keep going back and forth for as long as you wanted since there is no air pressure slowing you down.  This is probably a slightly longer answer than you were looking for but your question had me thinking as I typed and before I knew it, I had typed up a university thesis!  Cheers!",7년 전,32,

@andreagannon1383,"I feel compelled to point out a few issues with the statistics here. I know we were all taught in public schools about the earth, the crust, the core, etc., but let's look at this logically for a moment. If the furthest we have ever been able to drill/dig is 12,376 meters (7.7 miles) then question 1: How do we know how far into the earth's crust this actually is and question 2: Given that we really don't know, how can we then determine what lies beyond that. There is logic to figuring out about where the center of the earth lies, it's simple geometry, but we really have no idea what lies beneath the surface. We are just guessing. I honestly am extremely tired of people throwing out information as fact just because someone told them an opinion or hypothesis that still has yet to be proven true or false.  Just needed to point this out to those people who still like to question things and think for themselves.  P.S. This is the same type of ""scientific fact"" that came from scientists hundreds of years ago when people were told the earth was flat.",7년 전,0,

The answer is limited by the length of the drill pipe and that there is currently, nothing we can build that will go down farther than the gas  hole we made. There is NO tech that can process the slurry that comes from digging a hold deeper. At 15000m down, it would take too much energy to evacuate the material all the way to the surface.",7년 전,0,

But I'd say Punishing a child is slightly different than setting one on fire...  or is it?  maybe we should just stone them to death for being unruly, it is what the bible tells us so, an the bible is the word of god!  If your not stoning children for bad behavior you will surely go to hell for not obeying the law of god!!!  It is written.

@syntaxerror8955,"No, bedrock is simply the rock surface under the soil and various deposits, which can be very deep, but sometimes the bedrock goes above the surface. A bit rough math suggests that if it's 180 Celsius at 12,262 m down, then since at least some kinds of rock melts somwhere around 1,500 C, one would have to drill down some 100 km to encounter molten rock. However, I guess the pressure increases with depth, so that molten rock would be encontered far earlier (and after all, molten rock reaches all the way to the surface where volcanoes develop). In any case, drill deep enough, and you reach a soft, half-molten mass, and then you can't drill any deeper anymore than you can drill a hole in slime or sour cream.",8년 전,0,

@TonesNDrones,Your mass really won't have any effect on your falling speed. You'll accelerate at the same rate as any object. The only thing that would change would be the wind resistance you face vs a coin.,8년 전,4,
@kvarnerinfoTV,Terminal velocity for human is about 53 m/s if you fall in arched position. If you go head down you can go over 100 m/s easily up to 150 m/s,8년 전,0,
@kvarnerinfoTV,"Mass has effect on your falling speed. Its about 1 m/s higher for 10 kilos of weight for skydivers.  When you step out of the plane, your (vertical) speed is zero and for a moment you are right.At this point, friction is zero and mass plays no role.   1) Here the equation of motion is  (* means multiply )  M *g = M *a   which means (M cancels out)   a = g   (acceleration is equal to  9.81 m / s*s)  However, when you get up some speed,  the situation changes.    2)When you reach terminal velocity so that there is no further acceleration, then the equation of motion is  (* means multiply, constant depends on size and shape etc)                 M*g = constant * speed    You see here that your speed depends on mass M. It is proportional to mass.  http://hypertextbook.com/facts/JianHuang.shtml  3) In the intermediate regime, there are 3 effects: gravity, acceleration, and friction.  Therefore, the equation. of motion has three terms                M*g + M*a = constant * speed  and mass does not cancel. So speed will depend on mass.  The more experienced divers are right.  Solution of this third or general case,   the physics of 'free fall with friction' is provided by this applet  http://lectureonline.cl.msu.edu/~mmp/kap4/cd095a.htm    Use the control sliders to turn friction on and off.

@wetpossum,"FYI, the Sakhalin (Chayvo) wells are not vertical.  The 13000m depth you cite is ""measured depth"" which is measured along the length of the well.  Since the Sakhalin project is extended reach wells, they are drilled sideways.  The ""True Vertical Depth"" or TVD is the vertical depth measured from the surface or the rig floor.  Typically in this location the MD/TVD ratio is from 3.9-6.0, meaning that the TVD is more like 3000m (~10000ft) which is a TVD typical of oil wells in Texas and Canada.",8년 전,0,

@kualajdm,"Hey RLL, great video. The Kola Borehole ceased operation due to lack of funding in 2006. The drillbit did not stop functioning, although the rocks at 49,000ft changed characteristics completely, becoming more like rubber and malleable, compacting as the drillbit pushed down into the earth; making it near impossible to bore further.   The temperature was double they expected at 49,000ft, if the drillbit bored further it was the theoretical maximum temperature for the drillbit to handle. They ran a single pressurised coolant feed down to the drillbit, but it was only making the rock harder to bore, the drillbit was churning the rubber-like rock into the coolant, which was suspected to be watered down clay.",8년 전,0,

@denkoumasato,"For those that came here looking for the answer to the title of this video, only to be disappointed, I've typed out a lengthy answer below with a TL;DR at the very bottom (by no means is this a comprehensive/complete list but should give you a better idea):  Theoretically, there is no limit to how deep we can go provided we have the means to protect against a myriad of obstacles. The deeper into the planet one goes, the more dangerous and difficult it becomes due to the nature of compression, heat and plate tectonics, as well as explosion hazards.   As mentioned, things tend to get a bit ""tricky"" (and hazardous) when you drill down to certain depths. First thing to account for is the heat. As you drill down, once you start to reach a certain depth/high enough temperatures you're no longer drilling into solid material but rather liquid (mixture of melted minerals and metals). Liquid makes it difficult for the drill to ""bite"" into something to keep drilling. This is due to the heat from the earth's molten core and mantle as well as the pressure created from miles of rock and earth above (pressure creates heat after all, thus the core is liquid due to being compressed so much).  Also, the sheer amount of cable and drill bits you would need to extend that distance is not only costly, but would add tremendous weight to the drill which would take very powerful machines and a lot of energy just to operate and manage, lift and maintain or replace drill bits when they inevitably fail.  There's also the shifting tectonic plates that need to be considered, as these can not only cause a drill to go off course but may even snap the cables or drill if they shift it too far in the wrong direction.  And then there are also pockets of very flammable methane gas and crude oils, which can very easily be ignited should the drill strike something solid and create a spark. This would create a dangerous fire hazard not just for the drill itself, but for anyone operating close the drill as the force and energy of the explosion would have nowhere to go but up the shaft created by the drill  TL;DR: Technically we do have the technological means to dig as far down as we'd like, however, from a financial/practical standpoint it's extremely hazardous, costly, and time consuming and would require more of a commitment of resources than most countries are willing to spend right now without a very good reason.",8년 전(수정됨),103,

@philipp561,"Well, at the start of the video he says that his video is all about the question ""if humanity decided that the number 1 objective of our species was to dig a hole, how deep could we actually dig with modern day technology?"". And he does answer the question how deep we can dig with modern day technology, but the whole ""number 1 objective of our species"" thing was entirely unnecessary for the purpose of this video because it is never answered at all. And actually the question itself is kind of badly phrased, because if digging a hole was our number 1 objective, our technology for digging such holes would look very different I assume. Unless he really just meant to say ""how deep have we dug so far with the technology we have now?"".",8년 전,51,
@siililiik,"He did answer actually. The crust is 70,000m deep - so that is the depth where you can literally ""dig"". Earth's center is 6,371km - so if you call pushing something into molten rock ""dig"", then this is the theoretical maximum,  you can't go further down as you will start to go up on the other side. And so far humanity managed to reach 12,376m by the Z44-Chavyo. All of these are in the video. What do you miss then?",8년 전(수정됨),12,
@Elmonsoon,"He did not answer the question. The question is, how far could modern humanity dig if we put all our resources into it. He did not answer that. He just said how far we have dug already.  lizarrrrd you also didn't answer it.  Still a cool video tho",8년 전,30,

All he answered was how far we have dug (that oil well) but never said that was the upper  limit of our technology. It's very unlikely that the well is the upper bound of our capabilities because ultimately  oil extraction efforts (and cost) are based on what's economically viable rather than technologically viable.  So yeah, he didn't answer the question.",8년 전,14,
@Jesusnugget,"so.. what the video didn't mention is that the drill bit had to stop at 12km because the crust was so hot at that depth it was said to be at 180*C(356*F). the drill expectancy was 300*C at 15km, but that began 1970 and we've gone 200ft further since then... so.. the moral of this comment is research, aaaand how arguing what the video is and isn't, can be a waste of time :D   ps: my cat 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999",8년 전,1,
@messianen,"I suppose we could go far deeper than 12-13km with efficient cooling of the drill, probably would require a bigger diameter, lots of coolant and intermediate pumps. Z44-Chavyo was, I believe, easier than Kola because of the oil reservoir. That's an interesting question indeed, if we assume ourselves to be limited by currently known materials and tech, but unlimited financially and able to use the most advantageous (even if unprofitable) spot, what would be the limit? But this takes actual scientific-grade research. My guess is all the way to the mantle (sea) and 30km (land).",8년 전,2,

@Moonoom,"So, all we have to do is start from the Z44-Chavyo hole and then do some math and we would keep digging about 57,624 m (around 35.8 mi, 57.6 km and 758.2 jumbo jets) but to dig the rest of the way we would have dug around 6,429,007 m (around 3,994.8 mi, 6,429 km and 84,592 jumbo jets) total, and then the way back? That would be roughly 12,858,014 m (around 7,989.6 mi, 12,858 km and 169,184 jumbo jets), now that's a lot of jumbo jets.",8년 전,0,

@Salmontres,"To answer the question that this idiot didn't answer, once you start digging past about 10km into the earth (the Russians made it to 12km), the nearby dirt starts to fill up the hole as your digging. It's a strange problem that required stronger and more resilient drills, and people kind of lost interest once the Russians gave up.  So we don't know exactly how deep we can dig, but some geologists ran some numbers, and we think that past about 15km, the pressure of the nearby dirt would be way too much for our current technology. As I mentioned earlier, people kind of lost interest in actually dropping good money to go deeper. Unless we're trying to reach hell, there isn't really a point to digging past that anyway :/",8년 전,23,

@jvsnyc,"It is an extreme example of the ""passive voice"" which is preferred in some kinds of scientific and lab reports but is otherwise frowned upon in English.  The more common way to say it would be the ""active voice"", here: ""I will take a picture of you.""  Microsoft products now treat passive voice as a grammar error.  However,  in some contexts it is considered okay, like I mentioned before, in lab reports and the like.  Even in passive voice, ""A picture of you will be taken"" would come off as less clumsy for most English speakers.  They would want to keep the ""of you"" by the words ""a picture"" to be clearer.",8년 전,0,

@thegamesforreal1673,"I'm a physics student, I think can explain this pretty well. Let's assume humans can somehow build a metal pipe straight through the earth that pops out on the other side of the planet, and we were able to shield said pipe from the immense heat and pressure of the earth's core.  Now we jump down the pipe. Well, you fall down as if you're skydiving at first, until you reach terminal velocity, where the force air resistance cancels out the force of gravity, and your speed remains constant. But the farther you fall, the slower you'd start falling, because gravity isn't based at the earth's center of mass, but each particle individually exerts gravity on each other, and there would be more and more mass above you, and the air resistance also increases as you fall, because the air will get denser, much like water becoming denser and more pressurized the lower you go in the oceans. Therefore, the deeper you get, the lower your Terminal Velocity becomes.   You will keep slowing down like this until you reach the earth's exact center of mass. At that point, any speed you have remaining will make you overshoot the center, and you'd then fall back ""up"" to the center, overshooting it again, and you will start oscillating it like this until the air resistance grinds you to halt. You then hang there, floating still, with your body's center of mass exactly overlapping the earth's center of mass. You'd need something like an elevator to bring you back out of there.    Ofcourse, such a pipe would be nigh-impossible to create for many, many, many reasons. But it's an interesting thought experiment nonetheless.",8년 전(수정됨),71,

@sloslotho,Spaghettification. Yes it's a real word. Your body would be stretched out like a noodle from the gravity. The closer to the center of the earth you get the stronger the force of gravity is pulling you towards it and would literally rip you apart.  Of course there's many other things to consider like the heat and air pressure.,8년 전(수정됨),0,
@kynareth3605,"It would put you into a sort of orbit. Think of a pendulum swinging back and fourth due there being no air resistance or friction; it would infinitely swing back and fourth reaching the same point every time. If you were to fall through this hole through Earth, the forces would balance each other out, and you would be like that pendulum. You enter the hole and fall through to the centre of the Earth; the gravity pulling you down. Then when you pass the centre, the momentum will keep you moving as all the forces will be balanced. Once you reach the top of the hole in the other end of the world, you'll go back down at the exact same momentum as before, creating an infinite orbit through Earth until the forces are unbalanced. (I explained that terribly, and it's not probably not exactly correct, but hey, I tried)",8년 전,2,
@ShawnLH88,Your answer refers to the theoretical possibility of what happens when matter (usually referring to organic) is being absorbed into a black hole.  Nobody uses this term to describe what happens if you fell through the Earth (there's actual videos on YouTube explaining what would happen in an Earth hole).,8년 전,0,

Well, if that's a good reason to dig for most of you.  In conclusion he DID NOT answer the question that the title was suppose to be leading in. I believe this video is more of a trivia.   But here's an answer for you that should be obvious: If humanity could beat the heat that prevents us from digging down all the way to earth's core then, it could be possible to reach further down than what this video showed before IF we decide that the effort is needed to.",7년 전,2,

There's no reason to believe that the heat wasn't a problem simply for the equipment and finances that were available to the folks digging the hole.

@freemind.., @Apostolgutz  - No magma in the mantle.  Lava is generated by frictional heat caused by ground movement in the crust.  That is why you will never see lava come out of a volcano unless preceded by many earthquakes... usually over several days prior to the eruption.  The ground shifting makes the heat and creates the lava.  We were taught fallacious ideas as though they were fact.  The lead researcher at the KOLA Super-Deep borehole stated that the science coming from the hole showed that the geology textbooks would have to be rewritten.,5년 전(수정됨),0,

Our current drills begin to not function properly because of the heat at those depths, so we would need to invent some new tech to get past that. There's a reason the Kola Superdeep record has stood for multiple decades, it's really just not possible to get deeper than it, or at least not significantly deeper. As I stated elsewhere though, I would love to be corrected if somebody knows something I don't!""  He made a similar video recently about how high we can build which seems to answer the question better than here, but he mentions the X-Seed 4000, the highest fully planned structure, and Space Elevators, the tallest structure that we know is theoretically possible. Based on this and his statement, there doesn't seem to have been any set plans to make machinery that can dig any deeper, and his thoughts on the matter are that we cannot reach the mantle, so if we can dig through the crust, that'd put us at 47 miles down. If we somehow could dig to the center, then that would be 3,959 miles, but we just have no way of knowing if we can get any deeper than the crust right now.",8년 전,2,

You would probably reach terminal velocity.  I haven't tried to calculate whether you are going far enough down for the gravitational constant to change significantly, I presume you used 9.81 m/s/s, but actually air resistance seems complicated, the air pressure probably goes up enough that drag force increases significantly, you don't mention air pressure changes, only temperature.  Of course, it is so hot you'd die on the way down anyway for the deep ones, but it might be interesting to see some of these factors anyway.",8년 전,0,

@eragon78,"+Wade Wilson       The Kola Superdeep Borehole started being dug in 1970, and stopped being dug in 1989. That was 28 years ago, and technology has advanced quite a bit since then.  It is true that AT THE TIME, the heat was too much of a problem to continue digging, but today, we could get quite a bit further before the heat became a problem again.  How deep? Idk, but that was supposed to be the topic of the video.     You can prove that you can dig deeper than the Kola borehole because the Chavyo borehole is deeper, and it wasnt even MEANT for being as deep as possible. Its that deep because of the oil located at that depth, not because it was designed to be as deep as possible.  It is POSSIBLE to go deeper, but its not worth the money. But we want to know HOW deep is humanly possible?",8년 전,2,
@Silmerano,"The information is given to you to understand the answer. There is no cut and dry number. As technology evolves we get a little bit deeper, but as we go deeper it get's hotter and hotter. That is the only real answer. We could put a number on it and say today the deepest we could go is 15,000 meters or something like that, but that number wont last and at some locations it will get too hot to drill before you reach that depth.",8년 전,0,

The theoretical limit is all the way through if we just get rid of that pesky heat melting everything, like let's say we cool the earths core down completely, I mean, what has that hot core ever done for us except create the magnetic field around the earth protecting us from the suns radiation stripping away our atmosphere. Who needs an atmosphere when you have a spaceship! Get rid of it I say! Then finally we can have our hole all the way through an we can drive spaceships through the planet all day without any stupid dirt stopping us!  You could possibly build some sort of plasma container around your tunnel by instead of cooling the surrounding magma you super heat it into a plasma and then contain it with a super strong magnetic field, but that would require like... tons of energy, and magnetic fields stronger than anything we can make today.",8년 전,9,

@originaldahha,"actually he did answer the question... not that it needed answering. the core is the deepest point and it's distance is known. that's ""how far you can possibly dig"" ... but thankfully he talked about the rest and made it an interesting video >.>"" anything deeper than what we already have dug to would require new equipment to be invented / created (thought i'd add this for nitpickers) so that's how far we can dig right now.",8년 전,1,
@spookymunky1,"""im going to stop you right there... no one is asking the question of what future humans could do"".  lol, that is exactly what you are asking.  ""i guarantee you if we offered 10 billion dollars to anyone that digs a  deeper hole someone would dig a deeper hole pretty fucking fast.""  Yes, by coming up with new ways to overcome the hurdles that people in the past have come up against. Everything is theory until someone actually does it, and since no-one has already gone any deeper than what is stated in this video then you can either take that as fact for how deep humans are able to dig, or you can conjecture about what people might be able to do in the future.  You cannot separate the future element from these silly childish questions in any way whatsoever.",8년 전,0,
@spookymunky1,"The Russians thought (or hoped is probably a better word) that they might be able to get all the way through the crust if I remember right, and the Japanese team that are planning the next attempt probably hope the same.   There will no doubt be countless differing theories on how far they might actually get this time, so if you want a rough answer to how deep humans in the near future using current tech and ideas might possibly get, all you have to do is google that.   Until they actually do it though, it is all hypothetical... being in the future and all :P",8년 전(수정됨),0,
@KazeMunashii,"+DIVAD291, but you cant hit the core or even come relatively close with current technology, and that's all that matters. :) and btw, with the estimate he gave us with the map size of what we have and haven't drilled through yet, i hope there's a coolant, that can still be unchanged and viable by temperature on the way down, because by the time we get even close, it'll be in the 20's of thousands of degrees, with is ungodly, and that's if we ever even make decent distance to the core. hell, there's no substance known to man, that would probably not melt or be able to withstand those temperatures usable for a drill bit, so it's not possible beyond a certain point due to temperature, either way you look at it. It's just not possible....IMPOSSIBLE...to get to the center of a celestial body with a molten core using physical means of any kind............Unless we use a huge laser in the future or something and right now, that scale of mechanics is in it's infancy, AT BEST.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@spookymunky1,"I guess what I find hard to grasp about the mentality behind these comments is people are getting mad at the vid author for leaving out the answer to a question that is quite literally impossible to answer until it is attempted.  How can we know what is deeper than we have already gone when that is as far as we have gone ?  How do we even find the best place to dig without digging more holes ?  The Russians could simply have been unlucky, or they may have picked one of the easiest spots to mine and everyone else will be unlucky from here on.  How much money will they throw at it before giving up?  The amount of variables is simply enormous, to the point where the only real answer is how long is a piece of string ?",8년 전(수정됨),2,

Schiff, Paul M. Warburg, Abraham Kuhn, August Belmont, etc.  Current - David Rockefeller, Jacob Rothschild, David Rene de Rothschild, Lloyd Blankfein, Gary D. Cohn, Jacob A. Frenkel, etc.  Political Campaign Donors: Jewish individuals are the biggest U.S. political donors - Charles & David koch, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, and Sheldon Adelson.  Lobby Group: AIPAC Jewish lobby- Known as one of the most powerful lobby in Washington, which openly admits being the middle man by bringing Jewish donors and politicans together for the campain donations. (The New Yorker - Friends of Israel)  Open Border Immigration: Jews have been the leading advocates for open border immigration into white countries only since the 1960's.

Beneath the crust is an extraordinarily dense, hot, viscous layer of semi-liquid rock (the mantle).  This would expand to fill any holes we managed to bore that deep, effectively negating any attempt to go further unless we applied the sort of technology that only exists in science fiction.  Boring down to the actual core would be absurd: you'd have to deal with temperatures of thousands of degrees and pressures that would destroy any conceivable man-made equipment.  You probably wouldn't cause a planetary catastrophe, though.  If you could get that far to begin with, you'd already have had to deal with creating an artificial supervolcano.

So far the 2 deepest holes were done by one country for scientific purposes and the other was a group of oil companies drilling for oil (with the goal of  money - not necessarily depth).

@peteT269,"You don't answer the question in the video title!  But I will... so theoretically it would be possible to send a probe to the Earth's core. In fact, David Stevenson, a Geologist from Caltech, submitted a short proposal to do this to Science. Essentially what would be required is to detonate a nuclear-mangitude device at the thinnest part of the Earths oceanic crust. This would create a fracture which could then be propagated down by pouring in molten iron. You'd need a lot though... approximately the entire Iron smelting that the Earth produces in a week! Due to the density of molten iron, this fracuture could propagate down to the Earth's core (it would seal itself as it proceeded). Into this you would then drop a melon-sized probe made of a metal alloy with a melting point similar to the outer core. Signals could be sent back to the surface using sonar as the probe descended.  This was a genuine submission, and is technically feasible if the funding was on the same level as the race to land on the moon.",8년 전,0,
