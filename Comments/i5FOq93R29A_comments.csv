@MrServantRider,"How would a mode that takes no skill or thought to play, and wouldn't have a ranked que, cause the community to become worse? If anything this mode could be the stress relief needed for people who get worked up during ranked play. I feel like ARAM should already fill that spot but some people don't like playing random champs, and Dominion could have filled that spot but for some reason nobody likes playing it. Twisted Treeline CAN'T fill that spot because it actually has ranked ques.   This mode and One for All both need to come back, because it's a lot of fun to play modes like this that are just for fun. :3",11년 전,0,
@Baykko,"You said it and so did I, this mode needs to come back, but definitely not stay. How would this mode affect the rest of the league comunity? for the exact reasons you mentioned, it takes no skill or thought to play and its so different from the actual meta that when you go back to regular modes they just feel as if they are slower and more complicated than before, plus it dulls one's skills instead of help you improve in any way than maybe reflect (league is about a lot more than reflexes though).",11년 전,0,
@MrServantRider,"Steven Claver That's true, I suppose people would get tired of the mode eventually. But surely leaving the mode up and available for those who like it more wouldn't actually be a bad thing? People who play this mode a lot will end up being reduced to just people who never play ranked anyway, and again those who get too stressed out over ranked and need a break.  I still play dominion, btw, when I want to just stomp a bit or screw around. Dominion is a good mode for playing with friends. It's easy to stomp in dominion when you're a premade four. :v League could stand to have more ""for fun"" modes, and One for All and URF are really good additions for that.   (On a side note, them adding another ""For serious play"" map would be good too, but I guess it wasn't that long ago Twisted Treeline stopped being beta?

Want to try Alistar, Evelynn, Nocturne, Irelia, Annie, Yorick, Wukong, Jarvan, Mordekaiser or Vi? Forget it, you're not a poke champ, you're a dead man walking. Sure you'll get a lot of early kills and maybe even pick up the odd one late game, but all the enemy has to do is pick 5 poke champs, avoid splitting up and you'll be melted 100-0 before you even get within 500 units.  Further proof that winning at any PvP game is just a matter of finding the most OP strategy to exploit and to hell with the fun.",11년 전,0,

Let's just be honest and acknowledge that it's because this game mode completely negates the inherent advantages of playing certain champions. Let's see: 10% plus his passive cooldown aren't that great compared to 80% all around, and mana stacking becomes less fashionable when no one uses mana. Just one of many that kinda take relative nerf in this mode. It seems like a fun mode, but riot doesn't want to admit it throws everything wildly out of balance.",11년 전,0,
