@SearchHome1187,"I had a similar experience, earlier on in my time driving forklifts in warehouses. Older style reach trucks are oriented in a forward driving position, while newer style reach trucks have you turned sideways, so that you can safely look and operate in either forward or backwards directions. In between, there were adaptations meant to address the danger of having to drive forks trailing in a machine meant to be driven the other way, which was usually achieved by twisting your arm behind your back. One such adaptation required you to steer with your right hand instead of your left, which is how every reach truck is oriented. While it may seem like a small change, it was very difficult. Though apparently much easier for a lift driver that had less experience than I did.",3주 전,0,

@hijext8598,I wonder if people who ride motorcycles can learn this easier. At higher speeds you have to counter steer and push on the handle bar rather than turn it (turning right = push forward on the right handle bar). With the bicycle reversed I’m curious if the brain makes that connection faster if you’ve been on a motorcycle. Then again there’s more leaning involved with motorcycles.,1개월 전(수정됨),0,

@TheCurioverseTV,"The neuroplasticity demonstration here is incredible, but what’s even more fascinating is the speed difference between learning and unlearning. It took you months to learn the backwards bike, but only minutes to ‘forget’ how to ride normally afterward. This suggests our brains don’t actually overwrite old neural pathways - they create competing ones. The original skill is still there, just temporarily suppressed. It’s similar to how bilingual people can lose access to their first language but recover it quickly when re-exposed.",1개월 전,0,

But after he got frustrated and needed a break, I got on the bike and tried to pay conscious attention to what I had been doing because of muscle memory.  After a few minutes I realized that I had absorbed a very simple rule.  When I felt myself falling to one side I very slightly turned the wheel that way, which righted the bike, and then I straightened the wheel.  I watched another person at the park get started riding and they did the same thing.  When my son came back, I told him to do this and he was up and riding in about 15 minutes.  I note that the people trying to ride this bike are doing that too, but of course it has the opposite effect because they are turning away from the fall rather than into it.",1개월 전(수정됨),0,

@Randalmaker,"Question: Isnt a regular bike self-stabilizing? So even if you just roll it, without anyone steering, it stays upright, because of the counter-forces involved.

@norafleischhut6942,"The reverse bike is a perfect metaphor for transformation in organizations:  1. Change is counterintuitive In many transformations, systems are “reversed”: responsibility is distributed, leadership changes, and familiar processes no longer work as before. Like with the reverse bike, habitual behavior now leads to worse outcomes.  2. Knowing ≠ Doing In change processes, understanding often comes quickly: “Sure, we’re working agile now.” But actual behavior, like in meetings or decision-making, stays stuck in old patterns. Change means unlearning and learning new embodied behavior.  3. It takes time, tolerance for frustration, and repetition Organizations often hope for quick results. The reverse bike shows: there are no shortcuts when changing foundational patterns. Change needs practice, patience, room for failure - and support.  4. Visible irritation = healthy response When teams “feel dumb” during transformation (“Why can’t we get this right?”), it’s not a sign of failure, but actually proof that real change is happening. Good change facilitation helps navigate that frustration constructively.  5.

Determined to learn, one afternoon I grabbed the bike and walked it (not rode it) to my grandmas house who lived about half a mile away, I tried my best to use my hands and eyes to follow, with the front tire, a crack on the road that winded and meandered, I had to walk super slow and stay focused. I did that round trip twice, it took me a few hours. The next day, I had a strange feeling like I could do it, I hopped on the bike, and was riding it.

Change is the fear to the unknown, often reflected as resistance.  Unlearn what is embedded in our brains could be more challenging than what it was to learned the first time.  Unlearn to relearn sometimes is the only option, then maybe is through the crisis that we are force to adapt or become innovative.  Another aspect is the child ""understanding"" at quicker pace than the father who truly is an expert with a well of knowledge, yet the child has greater brain plasticity to understand the mechanics and functioning of these rare bike.  Another lesson is that organization crisis are to be manage as soon as possible if not at the earlies stages, so it becomes easier to implement the changes that are needed.

During this visit, my left-handed father took us around Cyprus in the car we rented. There were some minor tensions due to this problem, but we had traveled all over Cyprus and nothing unusual had happened. When my father came to Turkey, he immediately entered traffic according to the Turkish system and drove because that was his job at the time. I asked my father if there was a problem and he said my shoulder was just a little stiff. I wanted to write this in case it contributed to your experiment.

@brianthebrainguy,"I've used this video in many many group therapy/psychoeducation sessions ranging from addictions to mental health.  So thank you!!!  I have had a great response when using this regarding behavior changes and the discomfort with change. A couple questions...  - you say you spent about 5 minutes a day for 8 months.  What if you spent 15 minutes a day?  What do you think your learning time would have been?  Also, a thing to consider is how much time you spent ""getting back on the bicycle"" which I have talked with others about how long it takes to ""recover"" from a relapse, slip up, etc.  I then bring in a concept of a support system - sponsor, peer support, counselors, medication, etc.  If you had someone running behind you, holding the seat, or training wheels, would it still have taken 8 months to learn.  See what I mean?  - How long did your son spend per day during his 2 weeks?  I can imagine it wasn't 5 minutes as kids tend to be more curious, playful, and excited (especially with such a cool reward) when meeting a challenge.  They don't tend to give up like adults do.  So, I use this as an example about how we meet our challenge of behavior change.  Attitude does matter, but it's more about the curious and playful approach than it is about ""being positive"".  When you took on the challenge, you saw it as an experiment... doesn't that sound curious as well??  - are you able to more quickly swap between the bicycles now?

Ever notice how the direction you push the handlebars in reverses once you get up to a certain speed?  Gyros are hard to understand conceptually but feel intuitive so most people don't realize they're turning the wheel in the opposite direction to turn the way they want to go, they think they're just leaning. The bike basically forces that effect to occur at slow speeds, hence why they immediately topple over. It would likely work counter-counter intuitively at high speed, i.e. you turn the bars right to go right and left to go left (into the direction of lean).",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@KathyRobertsTidyTutor,"I saw you talk about this in Philidelphia last month (March 2024) at Ken McCarthur's Impact Factor meeting... and it really helped me. I think there is something you are missing. I don't believe it's the neuroplasticity I think it is that we HAVE to do something, think something or believe something long enough for it to stick and unless we give it the time the old way will remain. I don't think your son got it so quickly because of his age for the same reason you do. I think it was his age because he hadn't had as many years of one set of believing/understanding to undo.   This is the same with identity. We can say affirmations and imagine ourselves in a different light until it is actually who we are, a new person, accepting new things and behaving a different way but it has to be practiced long enough to 'work' and then has to be practiced all the time as the other behavior was practiced for it to stick. If we do something else on top of it or go back to the other we will then begin to learn another way and THAT way will be our new reality, habit, and practice.    Like getting out of our comfort zone is so hard, simply because we are unlearning a way to behave and be. Since it's not something physical like riding a bike the evidence you're not good at it doesn't come with falling and malfunctions it comes with emotion and blockages that we have to recognize as part of the process to unlearn and re-learn.

@samhack2123,"Obviously an old video, but isn't there a logical way you can learn to ride the bicycle? Basically imagine regardless of your age, you are a (small child) attempting to learn to walk? Basically relearn that (left is really right) and (right is really left) on bicycle. So I suspect if you made a gradual step of progressions this could be easier. Instead of thinking (I want to move quickly just attempt to walk with feet on ground) to assist you don't fall over. Some people might take years while others that have less cognitive bias might do this quicker. For example when Dustin had his (kid in video) rode the bicycle as a challenge to see a potential astronaut the kid put more focus on the task since the reward was (not to see if they could ride a bicycle), but see if they could overcome the obstacle. In video Dustin(name?) took perhaps 8 months to learn to ride bicycle, but the young kid was able to learn how to ride a similar bicycle in a few weeks.",1년 전,0,

@onehumanonearth6226,I finally made a backwards bike 8 years after watching this. 20min practice one day and 5 min the next was enough to learn.  My 19yo son took about the same time. Still takes a good amount of concentration and vigilance as to not revert to the normal algorithm. Improvement can by seen and felt minute by minute once you can stay on for more than a few seconds. Jumping back onto a normal bike took like 2 seconds to get used to. I'd think the average coordinated person would do about the same. In my mind I had built this up to being super difficult. Not nearly as hard as it's made out to be. Of course there are outliers.  Interesting experiment: Get 2 groups of people. Show one group this video and tell them it is super hard to learn to ride a backwards bike. Get average learning time to ride 50m. Tell the other group it's super easy to learn and record their times.,1년 전,0,

@billdale1,"It is a very similar but even more challenging experience to go from using the QWERTY keyboard layout that nearly all Americans use, and switching to the DVORAK keyboard layout, which is what every English-speaking typist should use, for several reasons, including the fact that you are far less likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome, which many people develop if they type with a QWERTY keyboard.  My brother and I switched from QWERTY to Dvorak many years ago, and it was truly difficult... it even gave me nausea for months.  I would like to learn to ride the ""backwards"" bike... I suspect I could learn much easier than others because of my learning to use the Kvorak keyboard, but also for another reason.  About 25 years ago, I decided to try to learn to write with my right hand, although I am by nature left-handed.  I succeeded, although I was still better using my left hand.  But then, 3 years ago, I had traumatic brain injury called a subdural hematoma.  Its effect is similar to having a stroke.  I could not speak, feed myself, write, walk or do lots of ordinary things.  I required intensive therapy to learn to do all those things again... it was frustrating and painful enough to being me to tears.  But I learned to regain all those abilities much faster than my therapists thought I could, and I attribute it to my prior decision to learn to write with my right hand.",2년 전,0,

@hubertcumberdale6404,"I video should almost be a must for any motorcycle safety class. This bike demonstrates exactly how you need to apply pressure to the handles at high speed on a highway or other scenario.   Ask anyone with little to no experience on a motorcycle how they would move the handles to make a turn at 80 mph. They will all show you to go left, you pull your left hand in and push your right hand out. Then you can confidently tell them they would have just induced wobbles into their entire bike and most likely lose control and go off the road.   It's counterintuitive, just like this bike, but at high speeds you push out out with the left hand if you want to go left. Why, it induces a lean onto you and the motorcycle. If you know that lean is coming and position yourself correctly, with the slightest pressure on the left handle bar, you will start to turn left.   There are a few videos on here that demonstrate this perfectly. One I recall a guy was cornering when a large fire truck came around the bend.  This made him want to turn sharper and he did the classic, I want more right so I'll pull my right hand in. This immediately shot him out of the turn and he speed wobbled straight into the fire truck at high speed. I believe he survived. Bike did not.",2년 전,0,

I challenged some kids at a skate park to ride it, and I'd give them a 50 metre headstart. if they could get away from me faster than I could catch up to them (walking), they could HAVE the Trikke (about AU$800). suffice it to say that they were stifled about how you ride it. it's worth a quick google, and you may even find vids from me about it.",2년 전,0,

In the absence of external visual reference, instrument-rated pilots can control an aircraft by a variety of methods, and two of which involve corrections toward and away from the instrument’s indication, respectively.  So the toward/away-from habit can be broken with training.",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@rsquitieri4057,"I have been riding Motorcycles for many many years. You may not know this but at speed you do turn left to go right.

It was shocking how hard this was.",2년 전,0,
@JonButcher_ca,"There's a fundamental flaw here that has nothing to do with learning: A conventional bike NATURALLY corrects itself. That is: when the centre of mass of rider shifts right of the wheels, the wheel also turns right to keep the wheels under the centre of mass. As the rider starts to ""fall"" right they naturally exert force on their right hand, turning the handlebars left both correcting the path of the bike and exerting a torque that brings their centre of mass back over the wheels. This is why  - with a little practice -  you can also ride a bike ""no hands"", and why you can push a bike down a hill even without a rider and it does not fall over. The geometry of bikes cause them to self-correct. Pretty obviously (just look at the video) on this bike when the centre of mass goes right, the rider's natural body motion (pushing on the right handle bar) does NOT exert a restoring torque, but instead magnifies the rotation towards the ground. Down we go. So - for this tricky bike - It is not simply a matter of re-learning how to ride a bike, but of learning how to ride a bike that is inherently much more difficult to ride. Ergo: the whole point of this video is moot.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@hawleygriffin1800,"This video is such a great window into how our minds automate tasks.  Behaviors that we use frequently, get the chemistry they need to fire the neurons in those circuits automatically.  They essentially become superhighways so that we know where to reach on our body to smack a mosquito, use language to communicate, walk, run, or ride a bike.  But it's also a window into why ingrained habits and behaviors are so hard to break.  The neural pathways that we use frequently, fire so rapidly that we don't even see the ""exit ramps"" to behaviors that would actually be more beneficial.  Like the backwards bike needs a different response, we've already responded with the turn or the handle bars and the lean, that our body expects to work because it always has.  Think about how this applies to a child who has grown up in a home without parental love and support.  The behaviors that work the best for them to survive their bereft home life,  essentially not expecting the world to not be supportive, to not be their for them, becomes their default behavior.  Those are the neural pathways that become their superhighways and they fire automatically just like the bike riding neural pathways.  So when they leave home, they don't expect love.  They don't expect to be supported and they can't help it.  As hard as it is to learn to ride the backwards bike after learning to ride a regular bike, it is equally hard to believe the world is a friendly place when your very survival as a child depended on you NOT believing it.  Daniel Kahneman was awarded the 2002 Nobel prize in economics for his work on behavioral psychology.  He has admitted multiple times that in spite of being the Nobel prize winner and the expert on changing behavior, that he himself had been unable to change his own behavior because of his learned/ingrained habits.

Maybe I'm just used to a vintage bike which takes a bit of pushing to turn compared to newer road bikes etc. And I always rode American bikes growing up (back brake on the right) and didn't realise until 2 years in that my English bike has the front brake on the right 😅 thankfully the brakes are so weak that it's never actually caused an accident and using the back ones is more dangerous on my specific bike since they barely work lol",3년 전,0,

""    So this doesn't seem correct to me.  As a rider starts to fall right, you need to get the bike back under you.  Steering left puts the bike farther away from where you need it to stay on top of it and steering left will make it more likely you fall off.  You need to steer the bike back under you.  Also, if it was the innate physics making it easy, we wouldn't have to learn to ride bikes as kids, we would just get on and go.  Also, reference the sequence in Amsterdam when he struggles for 20 minutes to ride a regular bike again and can't.  Eventually he's able to access the neural pathways that allows him operate a standard bicycle again.

You'll instinctively pull the wrong lever in the new vehicle at first, but over time your brain/motor memory will reset the ""natural"" lever to pull. Interestingly, for a while, when you are getting it mostly right, if you are distracted and in an emergency situation, if you haven't fully reset to the new lever, you will instinctively pull the wrong one again. All of this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, to free up resources the brain/body needs to ""automate"" responses to stimuli - if it were always having to be consciously engaged in tasks.. as it is when it is setting a new routine, it would be highly vulnerable and non-productive.",3년 전,0,

@LearnBeachVolleyballFast,"Soo for those who are interested in what this experiment has to do with motor learning and the mechanisms about how humans learn new skills: (this video has gotten used to ""prove"" all sorts of things that might or might not be true, like that it takes a long time for an adult to unlearn something they already learned)  One important detail before jumping into too many conclusions is, is riding this kind of bike inherently more difficult compared to a normal one? If we had 200 kids all 8 years old that never rode a bike before in their life, 100 of them attempted to learn to ride one of these and 100 attempted to ride a normal bike, would there be a difference in success in the two groups?  There is a part of me that says that when a human being starts falling to the side, our natural reflex is to put down the hand on that same side to dampen the fall. A normal bike uses that reflex in the right way, if you have this self preservation mechanism, you will automatically do the right thing to balance your bike up again. Riding this reversed bike basically makes you have to reverse that mechanism (in other words put your body in a more vulnerable position for a fall, as you start falling) that has probably gotten built into your body as soon as you were able to sit up and start falling to one side.",3년 전,0,
@vilo159,"Hey Destin! Wanted to chime in on  your neuroplasticity comment at 4:38. From my research and experience on learning languages, theories and experiments from linguists such as Stephen  Krashen are showing that a child is not necessarily better at learning a language due to neuroplasticity. It plays a role, but not as much as you'd think. What plays a much bigger role is the total time one immerses in a language - kids are purely immersed from day 1 with no option to switch to another language, so their brains have no choice but to soak in the new language. It seems anecdotally that that's the case for adults too - the les adult language learners use their native language and the more they force themselves to immerse in the target language without a crutch, the faster they learn. It also seems (again, just anecdotally, I can't site studies, just my own experience and other youtubers I've watched) that for a given number of hours put into learning a language, you see better results if you're doing more hours a day. It's less time for your brain to forget what it just  learned. h  I don't know if bikes and languages work the same, so not saying you're wrong attributing it to neuroplasticity, but you did mention that you were only spending 5 minutes or so a day. Over 8 months, that's 200 hours, with lots of time in between each session for your brain to ""forget"" the new link it was working on making. How many hours did your son put in in those two weeks? Was he spending more than 5 minutes a day? Assuming he was spending more like an hour a day on it, my hypothesis would be that it was the duration of each session that made more of a difference than the neuroplasticity.

However, his brain eventually sorted things out and he could function thus encumbered. Later you see him walk through a crowded downtown, ride a motorcycle, even fly a plane. The experiment having concluded, he was allowed to take the goggles off and go about his normal life.

I know there is a big difference since it wont tipp over immediately if you turn the wrong way. But i watched many times growing up and never saw him turn the wheel the wrong way. Tried it myself and for a few days you mostly turn the wrong way with every one of the controls until it just works and then if you disconnect a control for service and put it back in the wrong way i just cannot relearn it..",3년 전,0,

@blafoon93,I wonder if riding this bike without using your hands would give you the  understanding more quickly. People think you are using only the handlebar to steer a bike but in reality it is the whole body and a lot of that steering happens just from the natural leaning into or against a turn. If you focus on reversing your thinking only for the leaning at first you may be able to reach the point of understanding more quickly. Whether you would still be able to ride the bike when also using your hands would be an interesting second experiment.,4년 전,0,

@JonButcher_ca,"Yes!! Balance and handlebar movement are everything! There's a fundamental flaw in this video that has nothing to do with knowledge vs understanding: A conventional bike NATURALLY corrects itself. That is: when the centre of mass of rider shifts right of the wheels, the wheel also turns right to keep the wheels under the centre of mass. As the rider starts to ""fall"" right they naturally exert force on their right hand, turning the handlebars left both correcting the path of the bike and exerting a torque that brings their centre of mass back over the wheels. This is why  - with a little practice -  you can also ride a bike ""no hands"", and why you can push a bike down a hill even without a rider and it does not fall over. The geometry of bikes cause them to self-correct. Pretty obviously (just look at the video) on this bike when the centre of mass goes right, the rider's natural body motion (pushing on the right handle bar) does NOT exert a restoring torque, but instead magnifies the rotation towards the ground. Down we go. So - for this tricky bike - It is not simply a matter of re-learning how to ride a bike, but of learning how to ride a bike that is inherently much more difficult to ride. Ergo: the whole point of this video is moot.",2년 전,0,

@JP-hr7ch,"This can easily be explained by the necessary steering angle of all single track vehicles (bicycles, scooters, and even airplanes) going into any turn, and has nothing to do with ""backwards brain"", ""psychology"" or ""neural plasticity"".  On this 'backward steering' bike, the initial steer torque needs to be in the desired turn direction to create the necessary steering angle, and only then applying a sustained steer torque in the non desired (opposite) direction.  The combined center of mass of the bike and the rider needs to lean toward the inside of the turn at an angle appropriate for the velocity and the radius of the turn, before they actually turn their steering into the desired direction.  When an aircraft turns, it is always initiated by using their alerones first, to bank into the turn.  Wilbur Wright explained countersteering:  ""I have asked dozens of bicycle riders how they turn to the left. I have never found a single person who stated all the facts correctly when first asked. They almost invariably said that to turn to the left, they turned the handlebar to the left and as a result made a turn to the left. But on further questioning them, some would agree that they first turned the handlebar a little to the right, and then as the machine inclined to the left, they turned the handlebar to the left and as a result made the circle, inclining inward""",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Then I started to fly backward and upside downs (3D tricks). With 3D RC helicopters you train your brain to flip sides in real time. So here's my point. If you alternate practicing normal and reverse bike during the same sessions. Your brain will learn to switch rapidly. I bet at one point you could be able to flick it in ""real time"".

I had a class in university where a professor brought in a polygraph machine. people answered questions which everyone knew the answers to like ""are you wearing clothes?"". when answering truthfully, for some people the result was they were telling the truth, for some people the result was that they were lying, and for some people the result was inconclusive. when answering with a lie, for some people the result was they were telling the truth, for some people the result was that they were lying, and for some people the result was inconclusive.  it's accuracy was almost exactly 50%. it was wrong just as often as it was right. it's no wonder those things aren't admissible in court. fyi if you're ever in a situation where the police ask you take one and you're thinking ""why not? I have nothing to hide so this will prove to them I'm telling the truth"" for heaven sakes DO NOT agree under any circumstances. just a bit of anxiety will throw the machine off. if you're being accused of something you didn't do and you're being asked questions while connected to a machine that will determine the fate of your life, you think you might be a little nervous?",2년 전,2,

He could walk around with glasses that flipped his vision and his brain would eventually learn to interpret the image correctly then when he took the glasses off everything would seem flipped. The problem isn't intuitive so you can't feel your way through it. While neural plasticity is probably a part of why it's easier for his son, I imagine it's also just because the pathways in his mind are not as clearly defined and therefore they dont require as much effort to subvert. What would be interesting to see is whether his son can set two pathways for ridding a bike and if that allows him to switch between them more easily and if that has a broader effect (now that his son is already a guinea pig for this experiment😉)  ...while I'm aware that I couldn't easily ride the reversed bike it still feels like I should be able to.",4년 전,0,

@Castleheart,Many years ago I built one to win a contest. (which won me a motorcycle)  After much practice and ball busting I mastered it. I could ride circles and figure eights in a parking lot all day like a pro. I only had to ride 20 feet to win the contest.  But I will say that it messes with your mind.  Early on it was almost scary getting into a car and wanting to counter steer.  But after a while my brain found a nice little spot where it only tried to counter steer when I rode the bike.  I put it away and 10 years later pulled it out after a few beers to show some friends and to my surprise - though a bit wobbly - I could still ride it.,4년 전(수정됨),0,

@JonButcher_ca,"There's a fundamental flaw here that has nothing to do with knowledge vs understanding: A conventional bike NATURALLY corrects itself. That is: when the centre of mass of rider shifts right of the wheels, the wheel also turns right to keep the wheels under the centre of mass. As the rider starts to ""fall"" right they naturally exert force on their right hand, turning the handlebars left both correcting the path of the bike and exerting a torque that brings their centre of mass back over the wheels. This is why  - with a little practice -  you can also ride a bike ""no hands"", and why you can push a bike down a hill even without a rider and it does not fall over. The geometry of bikes cause them to self-correct. Pretty obviously (just look at the video) on this bike when the centre of mass goes right, the rider's natural body motion (pushing on the right handle bar) does NOT exert a restoring torque, but instead magnifies the rotation towards the ground. Down we go. So - for this tricky bike - It is not simply a matter of re-learning how to ride a bike, but of learning how to ride a bike that is inherently much more difficult to ride. So you have identified the issue: - a regular bike incorporates an ""instinctive"" or natural effect - putting out your right hand as you fall right - which this special bike deliberate reverses, making it MUCH harder to learn to ride in the first place.",2년 전,0,

@deborahantinori7080,"What a wonderful experiment about the brain! Thank you for doing this and sharing it! The only thing I would say is that it isn't cognitive bias - it is the phenomenon of procedural memory. You are not consciously, cognitively thinking how to ride a bike - certain steps like knowing you must have your feet on the pedals and hands on the handlebars may be cognitive, but the rest is proprioception, interception/neuroception. It is the subcortical brain's vestibular, cerebellar and motor cortex neural pathways that allow bike riding to become ""automatic"". These subcortical areas fire faster (50 ms) than the neocortex (500-600ms)  (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - executor of the left hemisphere - all conscious thought, planning, making goals, analyzing, etc.). Cognitive bias is when you have a judgement bias, a kind of prejudice. When someone rides the backwards bike, they don't ""think"" to put their foot down on the floor to keep from falling when they first get off balance, their subcortical brain and proprioceptive/motor systems are doing this -  survival systems. Other than that - this is brilliant!",4년 전,48,

I spent so much time, so many tries being frustrated about not knowing how to balance myself, and one day I just simply did it, my brain clicked, and I went from not knowing, to knowing!

Like, right now you suspect to have unlearned normal riding and are only able to overwrite it with backwards riding. Just as if there was only one ""riding a bike"" memory slot available.   But what if due to intense training on only one of them at a time, you have just made up a new memory of riding the backwards bike and now it took you very long to activate the old memory again? So, 2 slots but a very long time to disable one and enable one. Possibly due to no experience with exactly that situation, no clues or triggers.   What if you now train the switch in between? Surely, the next time you try the backwards bike it wont take you 8 months. And changing back to normal could take shorter than 20 minutes.   This would mean that, indeed, you have learned something already.   Now, will that interval just shorten every time? Or will there maybe a moment where you just need to remember what way to ride and then it clicks before you make the first mistake while steering?  I would be very happy if you were to keep using both and give us an update on how it goes.   But no hurry from my side.

@OsoASeks,"Hello Destin! Just stumbled upon this video. I'm super amazed and intrigued! I have a question tho: Not sure if you already approached this idea but, maybe this ""cognitive bias"" is related to spatial/movement awareness? I'm thinking about gaming with a controller. There are a lot of games that allow you to change the layout of the buttons. Attack, jump, dodge/evade, fire, aim, movement, camera... you name it. Thing is, when I change buttons that are not linked to camera movement or walking, it takes me like 30-60min to adjust (like jumping with A instead of B, or dodging with C instead of D, or melee with E instead of F). The times I've tried to change the direction of the camera (stick down to look up or turn left to look right for example) it end in complete chaos (Specially in fast paced FPS). Every other action (jumping, dodging, aiming, firing, punching) that is re-assigned, I can deal with it. I can ""bypass the muscle memory"" of some button combinations and, in the fly, adjust the ""new layout"". But spatial/moving actions (like turning the handle the other way in the bike or flying the helicopter or the infinadeck treadmill) ends up in a mindfudge.  Have you consider this? Maybe there is a neurological link there. Hope I can make my point somewhat clear, I lack the correct wording and concepts.

@V1br8tor,"Inverted vs regular steering is hardly a like for like comparison, since there's intuitive mechanical logic to how a bike steers as a function of tyre curvature and steering angle, and subverting that is providing your cerebellum with erroneous information, not just 'reversed'..  The fact is that we're using counter-steering most of the time when riding a bike - unless steering at an acute angle while moving slowly, the 'normal' mode of steering for a bike is already inverted - turning the bars to the left steers right, and vice versa.. your cerebellum already knows this even if your cortex doesn't.

@bigred8438,"I am not sure l agree about the rigidity of the brain idea. More and more we are finding out how plastic it can be for some people. There  are so many factors influencing whether a brain will change or not with practice. I suggest training wheels just like the ones you needed as a kid. Then see if the brain can add a new skill to the fixed skill present.  To support my argument about brain plasticity, l will mention that as a young man l was employed to drive a truck, but ended up having to drive  occasionally drive another also on an interchangeable basis perhaps one one day and the other the next. I aslo had to drive or operate a front end loader, but ovver several months had to learn how to drive two models. At the time l owned a motorcycle which l rode, and my boss asked me to do errands in his car. So l had to become proficient in all these vehicles over the same period of several months. This need to have a petitioned brain l think.  Later in life l learned Shiatsu therapy, which introduced me to right/left coordination. But now l can write left handed legibly. For example superkallafrajalisticexbeallidocious, and can write my name with both hands, at the same time one thevleft a mirror image of the right but written backwards.  So now l am over 60 and some of those skills came much later in life. The brain is plastic and rigid thinking can be challenged in the right circumstances, eg. Depending on how the following factors influence your brain function: What type of personality you have and what type if any, mental health or psychological issues you have to contend with. Brain function l have learned is more or less determined by psychology and other issues such as anxiety, success of your career or relationships etc. Genetics can have up to 50% influence on personlity so attitudes and outlooks could be stymied by genesvas could you upbringing. Incidentally, l had a learning disability all through my school years (on the autism spectrum l believe), but went on to study art at a prestigious university  and later in my 30's did a science degree with honors at another prestigious uni. So there has to be some degree of self belief in making changes l feel.  Get some trainer wheels and retrain your brain.",4년 전,0,

The algorithm you mention is complex, yes, but once it's 'programmed', it just runs like any compiled computer program.

It's not a bias, it's a change in the conditions that predicated the creation of the original algorithm.

One day I got it in my head that the analogs functions have been swaped and I couldn't play. So I changed it and when I got it right I figured I couldn't walk and jump because I would have to let go of the right analog to do so.

@richardcaldwell6159,"Hi! But few folks actually know how to ride a bike. You see, normal bikes steer backwards. Turn wheel left, the center of support moves left but the center of mass continues straight. This causes the bike to lean to the right  and the tires describe parts of big cones, so you arc right. Now turn wheel straight to continue the turn. When finished, turn wheel left, the center of support moves to the right and you're vertical and going straight again!  Next time you speed around a corner (only works this way at speed) watch yourself. See the little jog you do in the opposite direction just before you turn? You probably think you're just getting a better angle of attack for the turn. Nope, that's how you start turning.  Your guys actually built a non-backwards bike.",4년 전,1,

@dm2338,"This is impressive, but it's not actually what he thinks is going on. The gearing to reverse the steering input is in front of the wheel's axle. this is very important. With that placement, even if the input was normal the bike would be almost as unstable. I'm surprised nobody mentioned that yet. It's actually a physics problem. If it was a straight line inside the column, reversed with planetary gears it would be much easier than this. It's set up to be harder than the hypothesis assumes.",4년 전,0,

@raptorpilot8727,"This appears to be every bit the same as learning to fly an RC aircraft.  When going away from you, you push the aileron stick on the radio to the right to make the aircraft turn right, but when you turn around and fly the plane towards yourself, the controls ""appear"" to swap left and right.  Pushing the stick to the left still makes the plane go to the left, but from your point of view, the plane moves to the right.  You have to learn to switch the controls in your head seamlessly.  It's even worse with an RC helicopter... hovering nose-in is one of the most difficult things to master, but it just takes practice.  I would think that if you put training wheels on this bike, it would eventually come natural, much as it does with RC flight after flying for a few hours...  and the more you practice, the easier it becomes to switch back and forth.",4년 전,0,

This is exactly what that phrase is referring to. It's not saying that any random piece of knowledge will allow to you understand anything. Its just saying that you need knowledge to be able to have an understanding of anything. The same goes for the backwards bike. You have the knowledge and therefore the understanding of how to ride a bike to the point that it because intuitive and don't even think about all of the miner detains that are happening when you ride. You still needed the knowledge to be able to understand how to ride a bike, but that knowledge cannot be applied to every single mode of transportation, such as the backwards bike because the subconscious movements that you make to stay balanced on a regular bike are actually causing you to be off balanced in the backwards bike.

Also, the handle gear changes the force required to turn especially as turns partially rely on leaning.  Turning with a bike barely requires turning the wheel unless it is a super tight slow turn.  Now do this in a different vehicle that doesn't require more than turning a wheel to turn and u will get it fast, ie flight sticks.  This handle gear makes u need to lean one way while turning another but takes the support away that keeps the bike upright.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@ichooselife1916," @technicallydifficulties7094  That's cool! Jesus Christ is God. And He loved us so much that He wanted to make a way for us to be with Him every moment of everyday again for eternity. You see God hates sin because He is perfect. So rather than hating us for being sinful (when we wilfully walked away from His love) He still pressed forward and sent His son Jesus to take on our punishment for sinning. How you might ask? By Jesus coming down from heaven and living a perfect life that we should have been living, and being in perfect obedience to God. So since He was the only one who was perfect it took His blood to be shed as a sacrifice for us to pay for the debt of our sins. Because the wages of sin is death. So Jesus did just that! He was beaten, mocked, and ultimately killed because He loved us so much ( even Danny Davito!)that He wanted to get us back to being in relationship with Him. Even at the cost of His own life. So what does this mean? WE ARE FREE! By Jesus doing that it pleased God and so anyone who believes in Jesus and gives their life back to Jesus can now be free from every sinful thing and can be seen as guiltless in God's eyes again! We can now be back hand in hand with God and all is perfect again. May He guide you back to Him my friend! God be with you!",4년 전,0,

I've done this before with a skateboard.. back in the early 70's as  new teen around 13, I took a pair of clip on roller skates, the old kind with the metal wheels apart and bolted them reverse and backwards (I think) to the bottom of a 2x4 about skateboard length.. it was a long time ago.. lol.. but it would turn right if you tilted left and turn left if you tilted right.. I lived right at the top of a paved hill road with little to almost zero traffic.. first time not even a foot, after an hour, maybe 4 feet.. after a week, maybe 10 feet, after summer was over I could get down that hill about 50 feet but speed greatly increased the effects both physically and emotionally and that board eventually scared me off of it and I never road it again.. but I made a good 50 feet before it became threatening and I realized I could easily seriously hurt myself before mastering it.. it is one of the few things in life where I ""gave up"" and did not feel bad about it.. but the lesson is the same.. when I got on a regular skate board after that, it was an unlearned danger and my skateboard days were done in one short lived summer vacation from school experimenting with my own imagination..

The reason we believe children are better at learning a language compared to a adult is that an adult has many more responsibilities than a child.

I know people can wheelie a bike without a front wheel but when there is a wheel they do use its inertia to balance themselves. Naturally when the student pops the wheelie they would be turning the handlebars the wrong way and use the inertia to pull themselves down to the side.

People who go through therapy designed to change them, rarely experience long term change.  Groups like AA are no more effective at changing impulsive behavior than not going at all.

@HeartsofSound,"You need better thinking habits. You didn't lack understanding or knowledge when you were unable to ride the backwards bike. You lacked the muscle memory. As a musician I'm constantly having to break habits that are identical in nature to the one you've presented here. Also as both a pilot of fixed wing aircraft and a flyer of RC aircraft I've had to learn to switch back and forth in real time.   Maybe you were not aware of it but RC helicopters are notoriously hard to learn to fly. There are several reasons, like the fact that they are as hard to balance as a plate spinning on a pin. But the main reason they are difficult not to break is because when the helicopter is flying towards you the controls are the opposite of when it's flying away from you.   Not just when it's rolling but also the rudder -- but the controls to descend or ascend, as well as the throttle, don't change. You have to ride it one way coming towards you and switch when it's coming back at you. The brain is designed to make a complete instant switch and by flying RC aircraft you can learn that in far less than 8 months if you practice a few minutes a day.  The problem is you didn't have anyone to tell you that it was common in many types of situations to make those switches -- so you got overly psyched out about it. Also you said the guy that showed you the bike told you it could not be done. That had to have put a major obstacle in your brain that should not have been there. Also if you've ever had to make that switch -- like with surfing if you're used to a right hand wave and you move to where it's primarily left -- you'll may have to retrain yourself to surf with the opposite foot forward like Jeff Clark who surfed Mavericks big wave spot alone for 15 years before other surfers finally joined him.  The same is true driving in reverse. Stunt drivers can drive more safely at high speeds in reverse than many people driving forward can do. There are tons of examples where you have to learn tricky things going in opposite directions but unless you've been in a situation where you didn't have frames of reference as to how easy or hard it would be you over complicated things by having less confidence than your son.   It's not as much about brain plasticity than it is about habit -- which is not really as much about brain plasticity as it is about how you've been taught to solve problems, how to think when solving tricky problems that defy most people's sense of judgement. I've been into extreme sports also - the sort of thing where you must think completely differently from normal expectations.   It also has a lot to do with how much confidence you place in your own expectations. People that are highly creative because they have an aversion to the structured living that causes habits that are hard to change. Creative people need to completely redefine their existence several times in their life.   Whereas a more typical middle class white or blue collar worker with a very defined career path, even with advanced education, would tend to find switching motor-skill based activities much harder to retrain. However with someone like me who's into extreme sports and has made many changes in how I operate equipment - I already have a bunch of strategies that are transferable that allows me to retrain my reflexes and habits quickly. But even with that I doubt it would be possible for me to retrain in less than 48 hours much less ride one on the first day you were presented with the challenge.  For starters I would get on the bike facing backwards with a plan to peddle it forward so that nothing about its controls were familiar. But that would just be one thing I'd attempt in order to shortcut my retraining time. It may not be the solution but it would be easier not to default to the old habit because I've added a new twist that disrupts the old habit a lot faster than your more linear approach.   However having learned to instinctively switch controls on an RC heli, sometimes numerous times a minute I'd have an advantage because it took quite a few strategies combined to learn that. Fortunately they are transferable skills because, in the end, this is about your beliefs more than anything else.",4년 전,0,

@cornelisgoedegebuur1162,"Yes..I can ride that bicycle! No problem.   I build myself a bike like that some 25 years ago!   Not so sophisticated like yours with a set of gears but witha simple steel wire in a figure ""8"" loop. Works the same way. It took me only some summer evenings to master it. Perhaps  because were used to ride a bicycle with loose hands. (if that is the right way to say: without your hands on the handle bars)  And yes..I live in the Netherlands. The trick is: use your body balance to control the bike because that is how you do it! , Swith off your brain and simply let the bike lead you.  Balance is how you control a bike, Just try  a left or a right turn without leaning in to it..It simply won't work. I am 61 now and I still can do it, no problem. I allso never had difficulties riding a normal bike afterwards,  that sounded really strange to me. It's like walking, swimming or skiing, once you've learned it, you never forget  it.",4년 전,0,

The only problem I can see is the immediate start, where you have to steer a motorcycle like a normal bicycle until you reach the speed where centrifugal forces come into play. If you don't believe me ask a motorcyclist about counter steering, although not all motorcyclists are aware of this because, as I said, we do it naturally.  Carl, just journeying through.",4년 전,0,

@JL-qe5gl,"That’s why the Strider type bicycles are way better for learning to ride than trying to teach a child how to ride a bike after they have ridden tricycles and then you put them on a bike with training wheels. Due to gyroscopic precession, once you get moving enough for the wheels to generate gyroscopic force you actually steer right to go left, and steer left to go right. If you don’t believe this, try this experiment: While riding at about 10-15 MPH or 15-25 KPH, place only one finger tip behind both grips, now push forward with either finger and watch what happens. When you press on either grip it makes the bike lean in that direction and hence travel in that direction, which is the opposite of a trike or quad. So by pushing forward with your left finger you think this is steering to the right but it actually makes the gyro front wheel precess and cause the bike to lean left and travel left. This is counter-steering. At low speeds without enough gyro energy (where you need to put your feet down to keep from falling) you obviously steering the bike in the direction you want to go; left for left, right for right.",4년 전,0,

The thing about manufacturing that engineers dont get atleast the many many I've worked with is you want a process in manufacturing to be as simple and easily REPEATABLE as you can possibly make it. Engineers with create a ridiculously complicated and hard to repeat process to complete a very simple task like their trying to prove how smart they are and get frustrated when the employees cant get consistent results. It not the employees fault. The engineers themselves most time cant reliably get contestant results. The completely over think the simplest of task.

@FaiienWings,"The very first game I played with a controller had the x and y axis inverted (for the camera) by default, and in every modern game the first thing I do is invert both axis from the default un-inverted state.  There was one game I tried to play called ""Thief"" (2014, developed by Eidos-Montréal, published by Square-Enix) which only allowed you to invert the y axis, but *not the x axis*. I struggled so much to reprogram my movements and I was always running with the camera going to the wrong side, and it was so frustrating. I'd try to sneak away from a guard's line of sight but mess myself up particularly badly because I have a habit of just pressing forward to walk while adjusting my direction using the camera control. So I would end up going the exact opposite way I wanted, constantly, and made the game more difficult for myself.   Why on earth would a studio only make one axis able to be inverted???",4년 전,0,
@bankaltthree9139,"The thing is its not that simple, the reason it takes time to learn how to ride a bike is that you need to learn how to deal with counter steer, to go right on a normal bike, you push forward briefly with your right hand to make the wheel turn left, the bike starts falling to the right and you turn to the right and then just go with the lean of the bike.  So this bike is hard because even if you consciously know you need to turn the handlebars in reverse you do not have the muscle memory to ride it like that, I'm betting that any person who has ridden bikes before would be worse than someone who has never ridden a bike, as they wouldn't have to go against their ingrained learning.",4년 전,0,

You could repeat as many times you liked during these 2 weeks in private but you only got 1-3 attempts (depending on the challenge difficulty) to do it live. One time the participant got exactly this challenge on exactly the same kind of bike. And he did it. He made it after those 2 weeks at the first attempt live, rode an 8-shaped track around the scene 2 or 3 times. I remember him saying that this is only difficult at the very beginning and he got it right after about a week. It seems there is a great variation in how adaptive your brain can be in such case.

The subjects saw everything upside down, and were correspondingly spatially confused. But then suddenly, after a couple of weeks I think, they saw everything right side up. In other words, their brains eventually realized their vision needed correction, and inverted what they saw, resulting in normal vision through the inverting glasses. Later, they removed the glasses, and again, everything was now inverted, but self corrected after an extended period of time back to normal vision.",5년 전,0,

Found myself texting my friends in Italy where I grew up and was reminded of your video when you were in Holland struggling to relearn how to steer normally.    I am fluent (mother tongue) in both English and Italian. I can also speak Thai. I can jump back and forth between all 3 languages easily but... when I fully immerse myself in whichever country I am... there is usually a 2-3 day period for me to adjust fully. Grammar sentence structure and some words change drastically so I find my self creating new words (englishafied Thai or italian and viceversa) or placing an adjectival after a noun or before... a similar neuro pathway switch maybe... interesting,5년 전,0,

In children, the process of learning movement actually results in the body disposing of nerves that are not productive, so adults have fewer nerves in their bodies.

But I just have to say that the idea that kids can learn a foreign language better than adults is a myth. Yes, their accent can be developed better than adults. But the reason why kids learn languages better is because they are immersed in the language in simple terms. Imagine you spend all day in a kindergarten class of a foreign language compared to 12th grade. It doesn’t matter how old you are, the kindergarten setting will lead to learning the language much quicker because of the simplicity of the content, the visuals, the teacher speaks slowly, etc. Kids are also less embarrassed to speak and are more motivated to learn in order to make friends which benefits them as well.

@justsomeperson5110,"I think this speaks to ""muscle memory"" more than anything.  You practice a skill so frequently that you can perform it without thought.  It becomes ingrained in your motor nerves and becomes completely separate from your conscious thoughts.  It's why martial artists do katas.  You reach that point where the actions are so ingrained that the body does the ""thinking"" for you and your muscle responses become inconceivably quick and automatic.  So much so that people literally fall asleep behind the wheel of a car and don't crash.  (Well, for a ""light"" sleep state anyway.)  To then do something so drastic as to reverse the steering wheel, it doesn't matter that you consciously know it is reversed, because it is no longer your conscious thoughts that perform the action.  It's why becoming disabled requires so much effort and physical therapy to re-learn how to perform ""simple"" tasks like walking, because it's not the thinking brain that controls these actions.  (Imagine how hard it would be to walk if you had to think through conscious control of every part of walking.  No brain can process all of the input and output that quickly.)  It's just a fascinating part of how our nervous system functions and is so much less brain-dependent than we think.  Our whole body thinks!  (And is why you can cut the head off of a chicken and it can still run around quite well ... until it's body dies.  Not that I recommend cutting heads off of chickens for science, but for dinner?  Sure.)  Life is more complex than we give it credit for, and we forget that just because we can THINK, we're still animals with INSTINCTS.",5년 전,1,

@paulwalker4919,I feel like if you locked your arms in place (preventing the wheel turning) and pushed the bike so your momentum is carrying you forward it would be easier. Because the g force would be holding you up and you wouldn't have to correct your self to stay up right. You would also have more time to think about what input youre putting into the bike and what the output would be. Not saying I can do it but I feel starting from standing like the people in the video is actually impossible.,5년 전,0,

At some point when learning a second language (e.g. in school), you'll be able to switch to this language ""mentally"". You probably don't struggle that much afterwards and fall down, but switching languages can also happen either subconsciously or consciously. For example I don't need to translate this comment mentally. I just write it in a language that I learned mostly at school only. And I often stumble upon occurrences, where I can't find a proper and fitting term in my native language. It makes me feel kinda dumb since I often find out the word later (in my mother tongue!). EDIT: Would be really nice, if some multilingual person could try the bike and try to draw his/her own concluions. I would bet that there are similarities. EDIT2: This also reminds me of sking.

@snowwonder9814,"Interesting. I wonder if some people in unique situations might have an advantage and might be able to do it.  For example, people who sail small tiller operated boats. Small sail boats, like bicycles, you must control largely with your weight. And to turn a boat with a tiller right, you have to push the tiller left and lean into the boat (which means leaning left).  I enjoy both sailing and cycling immensely. I actually learned how to sail small tiller operated boats when I was very young (8), but didn’t learn to ride a bike until I was 13, and didn’t start regularly riding bikes until I was 19. I think the sailing experience, since it involved the same backwards steering, might give me an edge in learning to ride this bike, though I’m sure it would still be very difficult and take time.",5년 전,1,

Likewise, turning a backwards bike would seem to be just retraining our brains to turn the handlebars opposite of where we want to go.  Everyone who rides a bike, or even just looks at its structure knows this, right…? For all those riders like me, confident in your knowledge of how to steer a bike, try a simple experiment:   start riding your (normal) bike carefully in a straight line, then attempt to make a right hand turn by only turning the handlebars to the right…     Pay close attention and your knowledge may be left bobbing in the wake of understanding! Awesome episode Destin!   I'd love to see you follow up with another to delve deeper into the really cool and subtle physics of bike riding.  What we do in riding bikes is amazingly more complicated than we give ourselves credit for.    I noticed something this winter when riding in the snow-- something I didn’t at first understand. Because of the snow, I could see my tire-tracks, and when I started paying attention as I turned corners, my tire tracks didn’t follow the lines my intuition (my knowledge) suggested they should.  Reality’s refusal to comply with my knowledge spoke exactly to your point about knowledge and understanding being different things.

@corydeansmith,"I saw this video years ago and keep coming back to it. I'm grateful it exists. The first time I viewed it, I was just in awe of the value of the obvious technical knowledge gained. . Watching it today it brought out something else... the story arc of his son and seeing it through his eyes. Being motivated to learn with the reward of meeting an astronaut... and then the conclusion to the video is the boy and astronaut in the background with the boy speeding away on his backwards bike while the seasoned astronaut can't manage it at all. This is a moment that demonstrates the same epiphany about cognitive bias in human relationships as the backwards bike does about learning a skill. Our impressions of people are affected by how we perceive them, which involves cognitive bias. Under the right circumstances, the apprentice can have more skill than the journeyman. As youtube videos go, this one has all the ingredients just right... fun, educational and inspirational on multiple levels. . 6:27 - ""I felt like the only person on the planet who had ever unlearned how to ride a bike, and I couldn't articulate it to anyone because everyone just knew you can't forget how to ride a bike"".   That's a perfect demonstration of a large scale cognitive bias... when everyone else believes something that is not actually true.   :-) .",5년 전(수정됨),0,

Talking about pigs, we have also more of those than humans (27,3 million). Which is actually more than allowed... Our meat industry could definitely improve. Also we are the second biggest importer of soja from Brazil, which contribute to the burning down of the Amazon rainforest. Anyway... A lot of points on which we could improve. But the first important step is acknowledging that we can do our part to make the world better... So that, when we are talking about 'we', we are not only talking about a country but about the world (probably a utopia).

When youre straight up and down and turn the bars left (push on the right side of the bars) the top of the bike shifts to the right and the center of gravity falls to the right side of the center of traction. I don't know what force it would be but the bars shift back the correct way to keep you off the ground, and now you're turning. It's really hard to explain but if you ever ride a motorcycle or bike at speeds more than say, 10 mph, pay attention to how steering works on it.

@ModelLights," @nathankiley8206  ' counter steering. '   ' It's really hard to explain'   Realize, because it's easier to explain the other way, not from the top side. Riding a bike 100% vertically.  Turn the wheel very slightly left.  That makes the bottom of the wheels/tires move just slightly left of center, while inertia holds your mass/cg on the center line.  So you've leaned to the right slightly, ease off of the slight left pressure and you're established in a right turn.   IOW your steering moves the tire track slightly to the left or right of center, establishing a lean and turn to the opposite side..",5년 전,0,
@ManMang0," @nathankiley8206  yep, amazing discovery when you first learn this and try it out at higher speeds. Just a finger tip pushing the right hanebar forward will turn the bike right, it's a lot to do with traction and the tyre shape. Have a look into some slow Mo tyre videos and it might become clearer but too complex for me to articulate.  This is what Destin is struggling with in the bicycle, you get the same effect when above certain speeds then it's about lean+counter steering.

@AlvinYorkII,"It's like flipping your monitor screen 180 degrees and then trying to move the mouse to the left, it moves right. and when you try to move it up, the mouse goes down. Up left it moves down to the right. After trying for a few minutes you can eventually train your brain to move it the direction you want again. and then when you flip your screen back rightside up, you've gotta relearn how to move the mouse correctly again. Takes a LOT less time to relearn how to do it correctly, the way your brain was programmed for for the longest, but it still takes time. I 100% feel ya. And that moment it clicks is wild.

@movme,"There are actually three levels to this learning process. You can KNOW that the bike is different; that it and the rules have changed. You can also UNDERSTAND the mechanics of the changed bike, relative to a regular bike, and how and why the modified bike works differently. But then you still need to develop a REALIZATION of what this means in terms of operating the modified bike. Once you develop a REALIZATION of how to ride the modified bike, it becomes part of YOU – how YOU ride the modified bike. It becomes real rather than conceptual. And if you practice more than five minutes a day, it probably wouldn't take you eight months to attain the required level of realization. Knowledge ≠ understanding and understanding ≠ realization.   If the bike and the rules suddenly change again – back to the standard, unmodified bike – you can know that the bike has changed and how it has changed, and you can also understand that it now works the same way as the original bike that you had developed a realization of as a kid, but you then need to acquire a renewed realization in order to be able to ride the way you originally learned to ride.   There is actually more to this. The realization of how to ride a bicycle, whether standard or modified, does not happen only in the brain. The physical body, the physical intelligence, actually learns/realizes how to ride a bike and develops competent at doing it. This is why simply knowing and even understanding at the intellectual level is not sufficient for competency in bike riding. It is impossible to simply apply your intellectual intelligence to the task of learning to ride a bike (or do any physical task). The intellect is needed to begin the learning (or unlearning and relearning) process, but then the physical body, operating with its physical intelligence, needs to do the actual work of learning and becoming competent so that bike riding can happen ""automatically.""   And the riding only eventually begins to happen ""automatically"" (with competence) because the operating speed of one's physical intelligence is incredibly faster than the operating speed of one's intellectual intelligence. As long as one needs or tries to depend upon one's thinking, one's intellectual intelligence, for learning how to ride a bike, the slowness of the intellectual process literally gets in the way of attaining realization on the physical level. The sooner one's physical intelligence can take over the learning process, the more quickly one will attain realization and begin to develop competence. This is why actual physical practice is necessary to accomplish the task. Once competence is developed, riding only seems to one's intellectual intelligence to be happening automatically while, in fact, the riding is actually always happening under the control of one's incredibly fast physical intelligence.   @SmarterEveryDay, playing games to investigate the relative speeds of the physical center, the emotional center and the intellectually center would actually provide for lots of interesting opportunities to get @SmarterEveryDay about how we actually learn and operate in the world.",5년 전,0,
@uuuummm9,"One trick that i heard about this bike is that you need to look at the front wheel itself and think about the direction it should go, not the direction you should move it with your hands.

Eventually (like riding a bike) it became muscle memory and I didn’t have to think about flying the helicopter anymore. All I have to do now is think about where I want it to go. Sometimes different controllers are opposite. I had one and it was frustratingly hard to learn backwards, however, it’s not impossible, it’s just so difficult to the point that my tendency was to give up because the better I got learning the other way around, the more foreign it seemed to fly the normal way. That being said, I’m pretty sure that given enough time a person can become accustomed to flying ether way and switch back and forth. How do I know? Well because 3D helicopters can fly upside down (inverted). Those helicopters are constantly changing. Lift up to go up, unless you’re upside down at which point down makes it go up and up makes it go down, with enough practice, people can easily switch back and forth and pull off some impressive tricks. You just have to train your brain to deal with the consent changes and eventually it becomes second nature.",5년 전,0,

@wyatta6528,"So you mentioned how it’s best for children to learn language (specifically a second language) when they are young because they take in information better than adults (they’re constantly wanting to learn). So here a thing: why is it that when people try to learn a second language, they can switch back and forth between their main language and their secondary language, but you have trouble transitioning to ride a normal bike after riding a backwards bike. Sure, part of riding a backwards bike has to do with the brain, but I would argue that it also had to do with your muscle memory. You were taught your whole life that to ride a bike, you turn the bars to the left to go left, and to the right to go right. Your brain realizes that you are about to ride a bike, and prepares the muscle groups that normally deal with this activity (legs, arms, etc...) to perform the functions that need to happen in order for you to successfully ride the bike. Just thought I’d mention this aspect of the situation since I don’t think you touched on it to much and I believe it’s important as well. Very good experiment!",5년 전,0,
@6Twisted,I still think this is still one of the most interesting topics you've covered. It seems just like when you play a game with inverted controls. At first you're doing everything backwards until the moment it just clicks and you don't have to think about it anymore. Then when you try and go back to normal controls it's backwards and it takes a while to click back again. Once you've done it a few times though you can switch back and forwards instantly. I guess it's also a similar to how your brain flips your vision. You can wear upside down glasses for a while and your brain will eventually flip what you see and then if you take them off again you see upside down.,5년 전(수정됨),55,

@vp21ct,"I think your thinking about this just a bit wrong. This isnt just about having your thinking in a rut. There is a LOT of mechanics that also just do not work optimally with this bike.  1) Maneuvering the handles in the reverse direction from the way the wheel turns will offset the weight some, creating further instability.  2) even on a bike, a learned skill, much of our locamotion with it is instinctual. Leaning with the turn of the handlebars is one element of this. We lean, turn our torsos/hands, and so on in the direction we want the bike to go.  3) Bike handlebars, and bikes in general, are designed to take advanrage of 2). Not entirely by conscious design, but by iteration and reconstruction over the years. But they do take advantage of it. The modern bike has done a lot to mimic natural human instincts on direction and stability compared to earlier models.  In conclusion . . . if you, as an engineer, want a real achievement . . . design a bike to take 'reverse input' that ACCOUNTS for the above factors.",5년 전,0,

To perform a wheelie you need a sudden burst of power which throws all the weight backwards lifting the front end upwards as the forces pulling the rear of the bike backwards are greater then gravity trying to pull the front end back downwards. To wheelie a push bike all you need to do is position the pedal which your dominant leg is on at around 10 or 11 o’clock as you punch down hard on the pedal throw your weight backwards and the front wheel comes up.",5년 전,3,

A common motorcycle technice called ""countersteering"" has you turn the handlebars the opposite way you want the bike to lean. By doing so, you intentionally upset the balance of the bike to get it to ""fall over"" and lean the way you want to turn.

@MaximRecoil," @borkyborkborked  ""Actually if you ride a motorcycle this will probably be pretty easy""  No, it wouldn't.  ""since you already have to counter steer above 15 - 20 mph.""  You counter steer at any speed on both a pedal bicycle and a motorcycle (adding a motor changes nothing about how riding a 2-wheeler works, obviously), but it's only a brief counter steer to get the bike into a proper position relative to yourself in order to maintain balance before you steer in the direction that you want to turn. You obviously can't go around a right-hand turn by turning the handlebars left the whole way.  In any case, with a bike like in this video, the steering is the opposite of normal steering on a bicycle or motorcycle, so when you try to counter steer it would steer normally, and when you try to steer normally it would counter steer, and that's what makes it impossible to ride if you only know how to ride a conventional bicycle or motorcycle.",1년 전,0,
@borkyborkborked," @MaximRecoil  First, I ended up making one of these myself and was able to ride it consistently after 3 tries. either i learn ridiculously fast or there's some merit to what i was saying.  second, there must be a disconnect between what i mean and what you mean, when i say counter steer, i mean like when i ride my bicycle, if i lean into the left handle bar i turn right, on my motorcycle when traveling at sufficient speed, if I press into the left handle bar I turn left. its not a temporary thing, its throughout the entire turn for as long as i want to keep turning.   i'm not sure what you mean by ""we counter steer at every speed"", because i dont do what i just described at every speed, and have only ever needed to do that on a bicycle when rolling very quickly down a hill.",1년 전,0,

Your brain is still moving your hands backwards and forwards as normal on a bicycle. The trouble with trikes is that the trike can't lean over. So if you are making a left hand turn, the brain is confused by the bike not leaning left into the turn - so it thinks the bike is falling to the right. And the brain tries to turn the handle bar right to compensate, and you end up turning right instead of left. Until you are used to riding a trike, just cross your hands over so you go the way you want - until your brain reprograms itself.",5년 전,0,

@gregrogers303,The controls that your talking about are as you say they are. Yes we must relearn how to ride a bike and the same goes with a boat that has tiller steering. To go right you push the tiller away from you and pull towards you to go left. We have a tendency to steer in the direction we want to go and with tiller steering it's just the opposite.  Many sailing yachts have this steering arangment and it's a good idea to practice a lot before sailing solo. Having someone with you helps because you wouldn't want to hit anything or worse steer in the wrong direction and get hit by something bigger than you are like a cargo ship.,5년 전(수정됨),0,

@phillipmoore6295,"Did you ask any Operating Engineers to try this? We are often asked to run machines that have disparate controls. Because of the high pay we don't have all day to get used to the difference. There are Backhoes with 1, 2,, 3, and 4, bucket/boom controls, plus foot swing. A track loader steers with your feet and operates the bucket controls with your right hand, 1 or 2 stick. But a skid steer, steers with your hands and operates the bucket/boom with your feet. Unless it's a John Deere or Cat. Then you steer with your hands and operate the bucket /boom by moving the steering handles perpendicular to your steering motion. A road grader has 10-12 levers to control plus throttle, clutch and brake. Add to that dozers which have 3-4 different types of controls, plus hoisting machines the same. You get the idea. You have to train your brain to operate on visual, reactive feedback loop at first. Then through repetition, your mind adds the ""wiring"" to your repertoire. Like a musician who can play many different instruments. ""Good"" Operating Engineers don't have the same learning curve as regular people. They have to be up and running very quickly. Even if they never saw that piece of equipment before. If you have been in a ""piece"" before. Then it's automatic the moment your butt hits the seat. Also riding a motorcycle at speed.

Clearly shows us how iteration over patterns develops into understanding... but to balance the perceptrons - for the system to learn - after the architectural concerns are settled is always about exposing it to proper data and backproping the errors and correct guesses. The biological computation problem can be better served if you can provide a good ""feedback"" system. An higher level abstraction and mode to inform us how ""wrong"" we are and we what direction we should move towards..

@berlinblast5736,"Wrong, knowledge does mean understanding. Firstly, what comes next from knowledge is wisdom. Diminishing what knowledge is as a stepping stone does not do any one favours. In fact understanding is a very different kind of definition if you out it this way, like intuition or epiphany.   A world class pianist certainly has the knowledge, experience and understanding of how to play the piano. If you change the order of keys or ask him to play turned backwards, his brain might struggle with the physical interactions and has to relocate familiar intervals to play a piece correctly. But that is pure remapping of a changed interaction space and only specifically because of a changed layout. It has nothing to do with the musicians ear training, finger agility, music theory, music composition skills etc..   The brain is trying to reconfigure itself for a new layout without losing any existing understanding, rather it goes you a new one.  This also happened to me when learning how to do a Googly balling which is an off spin ball done with a leg spin motion in Cricket. I had trouble getting back to a regular leg spin.   A more interesting variation can be a guitar player changing tunings for his fretboard DADGAD or any of the myriad open tunings or custom bespoke ones. His regular EBGDAE layout has changed. However most guitarists figure out fast enough how to play familiar chords , play melodies and also figure out more interesting chord shapes and sounds in the process.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@jek__,"You don't actually have the knowledge to operate the bike. You have the knowledge to operate your body into operating your bike, that's not actually followable instructions to ride a bike though, you have to rely on your body to do work underneath your consciousness. What you had was a rough idea, not complete knowledge. I would posit that knowledge is still understanding, there are just many layers of precision to look at, and people commonly mistake the top layer of knowledge for ""all relevant knowledge""  If you had complete (or rather, sufficient) knowledge and understanding of the physics of bike parts and the driving mechanics of the bike, and the ability to exactly execute those functions through your own body (which as a human, you don't), then simple instructions would be sufficient to ride a bike. The trick here is that humans brains can't control human bodies that precisely, there's a back and fourth exchange, it's not just top down execution  I wonder how I would do on that bike. See, I can't ride a normal bike lol. I get so wrapped up in thought that I ignore large swaths of information coming from my body, and don't fall into what people call a ""rhythm"", I find myself actively thinking about every decision that must be made, relying on intuition does not make sense as a reliable method for me, and so I hesitate greatly to do it. That being said, I wonder if my lack of deep-coded ability to ride a bike, and my penchant for thinking instead of feeling my through situations, would render my ability to ride that bike roughly equivalent to riding a normal bike. Which would be hard to track, because again, I've never successfully ridden a bike very far lol  I think we overvalue the impact of cause and effect. Cause and effect is how things interact, given any lack of interaction record. Like water falling onto a dusty hillside, the first few splashes very obviously carve their own path, but the rest of the splashes never carve another. Is this because the first path carved was the most efficient path? I doubt it, its probably because its easier to stay on the current path than it is to create a path, so the first path is the easiest path even if other paths would be easier had they come first. The brain operates in the same way, but the mind isn't directly aware of this, the mind things it has more control over the brain than it does  Yes, you cannot remove a bias, you can only recalibrate it. You could train your brain to be equally comfortable with both invert and normal controls, but then you would have a bias for both, other types of controls would still be difficult. Politically, we tend to say bias is a bad thing. Bias IS learning, there is no distinction between the two. The trick is to learn a lot and still be able to learn more, but some people seem to cap out in how much they can learn in one lifetime, and thats alright, can't expect everyone to have the same skillset. We just need to assign rights according to skills, wealth and social status was the wrong way, and blindly handing out the same abilities to people with different skills doesn't work either. There are things in this world which have very little bias, they are invariably things which do not move at all. To move, to act at all, you must rely on your biases to be correct, and sometimes they aren't, sucks to be subjective, but there isn't a simple solution here, no matter how much politics thinks the solution is simple and obvious and ridiculous for not already being implemented  I think ""inverted"" would have been a more clear title than ""backwards"", less people might click the thumbnail assuming you were talking about a bike going backwards. Dunno if that would help at all or hurt popularity though",5년 전(수정됨),0,

I am thinking a bit in regards to machine learning, if you have too much of a reaction it will start to compound and oscillate, where if it is dampened and the processor has more time to understand, there is a faster curve and better transition.

@HuyLy94,"Turning handlebars left to go left and vice versa only works at low speeds, once you start moving faster you need to use countersteering to turn (aka turn left to go right). This is because at higher speeds when you turn left or right your bike briefly tips in the opposite direction and begins to travel on the sidewalls of the tyres, then have to turn the handlebars back to the regular way to complete the turn. Countersteering becomes the main way a rider changes directions when riding at speed.  As a kid you pick this up innately and most people don't even notice the effect as an adult, generally the only people that really know what's going on and how to use it consciously are motorcyclists because the time they spend at lower speeds where countersteering doesn't have a large enough effect is negligible but once you get going the effect is strong enough if you try to force a motorcycle to steer left to go left you can lose control. Newers motorcylists can find themselves in tricky situations because of this effect because when you panic your brain reverts to it's default pathways.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

If the backward bike had zero degrees of rake, this would not be possible and one would have to use the handle bar.

@j.macjordan9779,"1:50 - You shouldn't make Categorical Statements then; I could ride the bike. There are several situations where I've encountered this phenomenon.   Studies have even shown people can adapt to walking around with a headset that forces them to see everything flipped upside down. Up is down, down is up, left and right (like the bike) are reversed...& people could adapt to that! At first, walking is out of the question...after two weeks, people are up walking around, interacting with their environment with very high proficiency.  And there you go...riding the bike!  ....Now try adapting to living your life upside down.  I have faith you could do that too.  Most could.

@jceepf,"I get your analogy ..... many opinions are simply like bike riding : processed knowledge without thinking and thus are not real understanding. Certainly true.   But strictly speaking, I  think you got it backwards as far as the bike is concerned. I understand how a bird flies and I understand how an insect flies. I do because I am a human and I understand physics.We can write computer programs that would mimic either the bird or the fly. (regular plane vs fighter jets control programs)   However the actual reflexive algorithm is not in my brain. The brain, unlike a computer, cannot translate simple understanding into practical knowledge fast.... For example, if you could slow the motion of the bike say 100 times  your understanding would allow you to ride it immediately. On the other hand, a mentally retarded person would probably still fall at lower speed which you could handle as a smart person.",5년 전,0,

You and your actions aren't just brain-based, they are body-based. Movement isn't just regulated within the brain, it is wholly embodied. To simplify, you can ""know"" with your brain and not ""know"" with your body and vice versa. This algorithm of bike riding is largely unconscious, and therefore not easily and instantly augmented, because it is embodied - encoded not just within the brain, within your body, your muscles, the nervous system that is outside of the brain. This isn't a matter of biases or something clicking in your brain, it is a matter of teaching your body how to do a thing that is differently and deeply entrenched in its patterns.

@DSPNWtoCali,"I was thinking the same. The gearing make it even worst to steer. If they do something about that, any normal person could adjust to riding backward, inverted, etc. Thinking more gears or springs (for force), then again I ain't no engineer.",6년 전,0,
@earlzeller3015,"I think that is an illusion caused by the opposing motion.  The gearing they use is 1:1, so it is the same ratio as on a standard bike.  For every 1 degree of turn on the handlebars, you get 1 degree of turn on the wheel.  When riding a ""normal"" bike, a rider needs only a slight turn of the handlebars to negotiate most curves.  But when riding the backwards bike, as you do a slight motion and your brain does not perceive the expected result, then you overcompensate by turning the handlebars further, but still in the wrong direction (until you get it retrained, that is).",5년 전,6,

@saints360row," @earlzeller3015 , But wouldn't that create more torque, increasing the sensitivity due to less required force?",5년 전,0,
@earlzeller3015," @saints360row  I don't think so.  The only way you'd increase the torque would be to increase the width of the handlebars.  Torque is the amount of the applied force multiplied by the length of the lever arm.  None of that is changing here.  And again, since the gears that are introduced are a 1:1 ratio, the degree of turn on the handlebars creates the same degree of turn on the wheel as it would if the gears were not present.  It is just the direction of turn which has changed.  As I stated above, I am not an engineer, and it has been a few decades since my college Physics classes. but I'm pretty comfortable with my assessment.",5년 전,0,

I mostly lean to the side I want the bike to move and turn the handlebars ever so slightly.. Only kids(or adults that are late to the game i guess) that just started riding, over use the handlebars. For me it took a few years to really perfect that leaning in method as a kid.   This bike looks almost impossible to me, because the leaning does not corespondent with the steering .

The usual bike will have the wheel go to the same direction with where we move the handle and i think it helps us so much to be balanced on the bike. Because automatically our body will lean to the direction where the handle aimed and the force so the wheel which goes to the same side is helping to sustain the force from our leaned body.

@someother7568,"Not sure this is an appropriate analogy for bias. It is a great demonstration of muscle memory. Few are aware of the multitude of muscular contractions continually taking place while riding a bicycle. Once the newly initiated have embedded the patterns within the subconscious, this is when bicycle riding becomes ""second nature"". The rider no longer has to analyze and react to functions like balance nor pedaling, but is freed to focus on navigation, jumping, etc.  The difficulty experienced isn't due to bias, but rather due to established training which yields a successful result. With the reverse bicycle, the proven methods have been perverted and the rider struggles with a system which defies logic and observed evidence. When the rider turns the handlebars to the right, the wheel goes left instead of right which is the antithesis of the expected or natural behavior.   You then invested significant time to learn the unnatural way and program your subconscious to accept and process the illogical. Yet, even in so doing, the demonstration shows the extra effort and mental double processing - ""I want to go left, but this bike is backwards, so I must turn right to go left"" vs. ""I want to go left, turn left"". If you want to make a social comment on your experiment, the more accurate statement would be something along the lines of ""you can adapt and function in an illogical system through great effort and sacrifice.""  This applies very well to a number of today's issues...",6년 전(수정됨),0,

If you never wrote a bike in your life then learning this one would take the same time. So, in 8 months you were able to write on top of what your brain had recorded. That’s when you got used to it. So, when you tried the regular bike you forgot how to for a moment. On the other hand, one thing that I noticed was that turning the handlebar didn’t have the same resistance. Therefore, it turns easier than the regular ones. Which, makes it even harder to learn.",6년 전,0,

@Atom_X.,"Well he prob can, if riding a bike normally gives you neural connections to allow retrieval of memory and fine motor function to be employed with riding a bike, 70% of the memory will be muscle, then I'd imagine he's simply building a new conection with a different set of motor functions. The problem is your muscles will be predisposed to steering the normal way so while his brain might learn it quickly, which it probably did as in a few weeks to build the connection with repetition, it'll take much longer to rewire the muscle memory.  It's like with language, I'm learning  polish, I know what word is what, I associate it's sound and spelling with the meaning for the word but I keep wanting to say the word in English, see black in polish want to say black, but that's not from lack of knowledge just control over muscle memory.",6년 전,1,

@salia2897,"I don't really like the term ""understanding"" for that. Understanding is a rational thing, it is knowing the cause and effect chain that causes some effect. What these bikes demonstrate is that we store certain optimized movement patterns sub-consciously and use them all the time. Children can do that somewhat better and of course it also depends on genetics. Talented acrobats probably get the hang quicker. Also it probably matters how close things are to others we already have learned. I would assume that it is much harder to learn riding these bikes because it requires movements in the opposite direction of what one has to do. And also the better you are at riding a bike the harder it will be, because the brain has to learn to suppress the other reaction.

@jakke1975,"You should ask a biker to ride that bike ;-) Pushbikes don't have a lot of gyroscopic effect going on in the wheels, motorbikes do. Because of that, bikers always have to steer in the opposite way of a pushbike. It's not that difficult. When I ride my bike, I push on the right handlebar to turn right (or pull on the left), and to go left, it's the other way around. Only at very low speeds, this action is reversed because you won't have the gyroscopic effect from the wheels. I haven't seen many bikers struggle with that, so I was a bit amazed to see you have such a hard time getting to grips with it.",6년 전,0,

On a motorbike or even a bike you steer in the opposite direction to initiate leaning into a turn, but once you are leaning it it, your wheel is usually tilted slightly in the direction that you are turning into, of course the higher the speed the more you will do by leaning anyway.

@dxkhoi," @salia2897  I think you'll be really interested in counter-steering bikes, it's a mind boggling concept that comes naturally to seasoned riders. You literally turn right to go left and vice versa. Have a look around youtube for counter-steering techniques.",6년 전,6,
@billh8455,"Actually the problem with learning to ride a Bike is that you need to learn to turn the Wrong direction in the first place.  The novice Rider starts to fall to one side and then instinctively turns the handle bar to the direction opposite  of the fall.  You need to turn the Bar in the direction of the fall.  If you are falling to the Right, you need to turn to the Right because turning right makes the bike lean left and cancels the fall.   Try this, ride in a straight line.  Now with only one finger in front of each hand grip, remove your Left hand from the grip.  if you push backwards very gently with just your Right Finger causing the wheel to steer to the right, the bike will turn Left! A person with no experience riding a bike will instinctively turn Left when falling to the right. On this backwards bike, the Left turn input will turn the wheel correctly to the right and cancel the fall.",6년 전,9,

Second is the brain's over compensation for an unexpected result.   As the brain has an established baseline for riding a bicycle, it chooses that known pattern to execute when managing the situation. As the feedback loop is inverse of the expected results, the brain quickly attempts to correct for the lack of congruity between known pattern and actual result. If you watch some of the riders, they will push faster and harder in the wrong direction on the handle bars attempting to work out the perceived errors.   For experienced riders it is even worse as the muscle memory programming is extremely entrenched.   This happens in all areas of life.",6년 전,1,

@willscotmont,"The backwards bicycle reminded me of an educational film I saw in elementary school back in the 1960s. In those days the films were actual film viewed through a movie projector.  This would be a great experiment for you to duplicate for one of your videos.   In this film someone had built some glasses that turned the world upside down. The glasses were big bulky things that looked like the device optometrists use to prescribe lenses for eye glasses. When this guy wore them everything he saw was upside down. I know that he wore them for quite some time but don’t remember for how long. Eventually his brain corrected the image from his eyes so the world appeared right side up even with the glasses on. But when he finally took off the glasses, the world was upside down again. Without the glasses on, his brain eventually corrected the images again so the world was right side up.  I saw the film so long ago that I cannot remember the time periods it took for the mental corrections to occur. But I can assure you that this was an actual Audio Video educational film, and not some science fiction movie.  I think that it would be a great experiment for you to try.",6년 전,0,

@leo.1005,"I've had my chance on that bike. It is as tough as Destin says it is.  I was at a county fair in 2010 and there were these two young men, probably about 20 years old asking for five bucks for a chance to ride the ""crazy bike"" the length of a sheet of plywood; 8 feet.  The prize was $100.  I watched for like 30 minutes as a succession of these dudes had a go at it and wouldn't make it but 2 or 3 feet before putting a foot down.  During quiet times one of the two young men would get on the bike and ride it around the area to show that riding it wasn't an impossibility.  So I did other carnival things and took some time to close my eyes while imagining steering right while turning left, and vice versa.  When I felt I was ready I came back, put down my 5 dollars, mounted that bike, and rode about 2 feet and fell off.   Afterwards I chatted with the two young men.  They said that they were at another county fair a year ago when they first saw the crazy bike...and they rode it and won the $100!!  So the guy running the crazy bike hired those two to run the event for him.  The two guys said that they grew up as competitive BMX trick riders.

It's a long process and often kids go through all kinds of bikes with little wheels to learn on the sides etc. And then slowly your father let's you go until ""you know how to ride a bike"".

Years later I can still do easily do this, its just like learning to ride a bike. I'd take on your backwards bicycle.   Edit - I started off looking just as bad as Destin at the start, but like him after getting it I was fairly quick to progress from creeping backwards slowly to no feet freewheeling at jogging pace. The difference is I rode my bike forwards for the rest of the day so I never unlearnt it, I just picked up a separate skill. I have no problems going straight from backwards to forwards, sometimes without even putting my feet on the ground. I also use the skill to balance upright without moving - in reality I move backwards and forwards small distances riding the clutch to deal with any minor tilt, though it's difficult to stay upright properly for long because I sometimes tilt too far to recover reasonably.",6년 전(수정됨),2,

@LegoEddy," @Hassanov.a  Excuse the question, but what is counter steering? Does it mean, if you ride a motorbike at a highway and have a left turn, you have to lean your body weight left and steer slightly right in order to stay in lane?",6년 전,5,
@Hassanov.a," @LegoEddy  Counter steering is simply the process of moving the handle bars in the opposite direction to turning in order to tilt the bike into that direction. It's only used at the beginning of the turn to tip the bike in the direction of turn, and you only need a slight nudge. It's a subtle move.    It works because you're allowing the centre of gravity to shift into the direction you want to turn and your forward momentum stops you from falling over and instead makes you travel an arc.",6년 전,11,

@user-mz7xo6ez7m,"at a basic level our long term memory is split into three types. Bike riding falls under procedural memory. This is memory of how we do stuff, which is really hard for us to explain to others. It’s automatic, so we dont think about having to turn our body or leaning or pedalling. This explains why his son found it easier because he’s solidified that procedural memory less because he’d recalled it less than his dad has over his entire life. Your body also makes small adjustments for our balance while on a bike so even if you are thinking about the opposite direction to steer, your brain is automatically making the balance adjustments for a normal bike which will throw you off. It’s so hard to change this for anyone because it’s the same basic activity that we know, but because it’s procedural memory it is very hard to try and think about all aspects of balancing as we do when we first learn because it doesn’t get remembered. Again, a reason why it’s easier for kids and their learning experience is fresher in their heads.  It would be interesting to see how an adult with less brain plasticity of a child learn to ride a normal bike, then a reverse bike straight after one another, or at the same time to see if their brain can make those connections quickly. Particularly with identical bikes so there’s no visual cues and just the motor aspects triggers the neural pathways needed.",6년 전,0,

@whiskyweasal89,"So the way I understand that you switch the algorithm is kind of like looking at a visual illusion like the young lady and old woman picture. Whatever you see first is going to be difficult to let your brain switch to seeing the other image. Once you can see the other image, sometimes it’s difficult to go back to seeing the original image. Sometimes I would literally have to force my brain to go back to the original way of looking at it. Sometimes it felt impossible, sometimes it took what could be called flipping a switch in my brain almost physically, which I could literally feel as an almost uncomfortable wave of tension moving across my brain. Moving back and forth becomes easier with time but can be difficult at first. If you remember the magic eye books that were computer generated stereograms. It took people a lot of effort to understand how to see the picture. Sometimes once they got it, they could easily go from one picture to the next without difficulty. But after a few years have to relearn what to do if they haven’t been doing it for a while. Riding a bike is probably a very complicated algorithm, but switching between algorithms will become a matter of remembering the “feeling” of the algorithm you want and firing off the intended feeling first before you ride. Because if you fire the unintended algorithm first, then it becomes more difficult to switch back. It’s a phenomena that I hope people understand from experience rather than my articulation because I don’t know how to explain such a complicated thing, but I have experienced it. Actually, i learned how to type as an adult and usually I have to switch my brain into “proper” typing mode. Usually my instincts start me typing while looking at the keyboard and I can’t remember where the keys are without looking, but once I get in the right asdf jkl; position, curl my fingers, and stop looking at the keyboard my brain switches modes and suddenly I know where the keys are and I naturally start typing correctly and fast.",6년 전,0,

@bendeliduka,"challenge accepted.   keep in mind.  You spent hours and hours practicing and learning to ride a bike in the first place.  I agree, this is a complicated activity however, I submit that with sufficient practice (perhaps 1/3 as much as required to learn in the first place)  I was typing this while watching the the video and see that you did discover the methodology  to retrain.  one thing humans do is think poorly.  we learn a language, we learn to read out loud, then we sub-vocalize.  these are generally a bad idea....  by sub-vocalizing you slow your reading speed, by thinking in a language ( I don't have a solution to this ) we slow the thinking process... but worse still when we learn a new language or skill we do this by translating skills we have into the new skill.  crawling we learn to move around some, standing we learn to move around more efficiently and access new places.... then we learn to run... ( walking much faster, then translated into single foot jumps with the intent to catch ourselves on the other foot )  ok... if you've followed my ramble this far...  learning a language by ""translation"" leaves us thinking in english and trying to translate that into french....  this is easily seen with grammar issues in second, third etc languages...  I believe crawl, walk, run is the basis upon which 'ride bike' is based.   when on the bike.... as you start to fall to the left.... your brain... using 'walk' as a foundation triggers 'lean right' to counter the fall.....       i suspect someone could learn to ride that neat bike in a few hours (and skinned knees :) by walking the bike and turning the handles....  better still if you could sit on the seat and walk it so you could occasionally coast the process would be sped up substantially.   that said....  very cool 4 year old video....    I may have to get me one of them backwards bikes...  oh,   regarding engineers and welders ( trades )... engineers dream up what would be cool to make.....  trades people make cool things that they or others think up....

When you go to pedal you need to pull slightly on the right control for leverage to create the downstroke on your leg which kicks the wheel left and throws of the gyro of the bike.

@Donnybrook10,"Another good example of the neuroplasticity in kids vs. adults:  I'm a bagpiper and have been playing for over 20 years.  I started learning in my late 30s.  It is a particularly complex instrument and it's no easy task for anyone to learn. The estimation is that 90%+ of aspiring pipers give up in the first year due to the level of difficulty and frustration.   We also had a few young kids, ages 10-15, taking piping lessons.  The pace at which the young kids picked up the instrument was staggering.  They became proficient in a fraction of the time the adult students did.  And the kids were dealing with far more hurdles than the adults since their bodies were much smaller and the instruments are made for an adult body.  The kids not only conquered the fundamentals, they overcame the added problems of the instrument being oversized for their frames.  I suppose it's similar to their ability to learn a 2nd language at a much faster pace than adults.  Yes, we adults were a bid envious as well but kept it concealed for the most part.

It seems that through the extra gearing the steering got super sensitive - keeping the handlebar straight should at least make not much difference.... but it does. It looks so unstable that you have to counter balance any slight movement heavily all the time. 🤔 Like if the shifted gearing to an exaggerated ratio. Which would make it comparing apples to oranges.

@WarrenPostma,"Piano student here.  Also amateur student of neurobiology.    Ballistic (muscle memory) skills in the brain are deeply learned, and hard to unlearn. You are totally bang on about Neuroplasticity.  I don't think it's bias. It's ballistic.  Realtime. Unconscious.  It's not the same thing as Bias.  Or rather, our cognitive patterns are actually the only possible way that anything like cognition can exist.  The term ""bias"" here is itself, too biased. Too loaded with secondary meanings and perhaps even negative judgment.  It's amazing that we can learn things, replace them, rewire them, and maybe if you did this enough you'd be able to Code Switch, and switch your brain instantly to doing both things.  Think of a musician who plays different instruments, some of which are very similar,  and where muscle memory (ballistic skills) overlap.     Organists playing organs, for example,  mechanical (not electronic) air-driven pipe organs, have a long delay from when a note is pressed to when it is heard by the audience.  A pipe organist learns to basically queue up a song, and play it about 300 milliseconds ahead of where the congregation will be singing.  Put a pianist in there and get them to try it.   The ballistic skills are not biases, they are neuromuscular adaptations, where your brain processes things without your conscious choices being IN THE WAY. That is not a bias. It's just a brain.",6년 전(수정됨),114,

When people have more than one language they some times struggle with certain aspects until suddenly it all clicks into place, especially if they don't practice, but if they practice they can swap between languages very easily. So I would say probably if you regularly swapped between bikes daily you would soon get it instantly within the swap, however if you only did the swap as a demonstration periodically it would take time for your brain to regain the information needed to swap.  You have to remember with regard to a bicycle your body would need to relearn which way to lean twist and focus in order to ride the bike.

@kevinroberts9580,It's learned in your sub conscience. Your sense of balance takes over and knows just which way to move the handlebars to keep you upright and going. When you switch the steering to backwards steering you are trying to think through this but your subconscious is already steering the way it knows how to. And your subconscious will do what it's supposed to before you actually get the thought in your head to do the opposite. You can reorient your subconscious to a new way of doing something with a few weeks of practice. But then your brain wants to do it that way and the old way or the correct way is now wrong to your sub conscience,6년 전(수정됨),5,

@bliss252,"It's impressive to see how the brain suddenly clicks into the mode required to ride this bike. Other than that, the rest is quite logical: in order to balance on a bike, the brain has to learn to automatically make micro-adjustments left and right. If this is reversed, then what the brain does automatically will immediately result in imbalance. I'm not sure why that's such a revelation 🤷🏿‍♀️  Also, the expression ""it's like riding a bike"" does not imply 'easy'. It just implies that once you've learned something, you can go years without doing it and still not forget how to do it..",6년 전(수정됨),0,

A common way to remember is you turn the direction that you push.   Push your left hand you turn left, push your right hand you turn right.",6년 전,0,

@marcuswilliams6925,"This is not well thought out, just well documented. When u ride a normal bike the handle bars are straight above the wheel, even as u turn, which in turn keeps ur center constant. What they did by using the gears to get the handle bars to reverse the wheel-action during each turn causes the handle bars to extend over and out of the established center. Go back to the first minute of the video and u can clearly see what I mean and notice as well this design greatly increases the sensitivity of each turn making ur mind need to concentrate more on less movement with each adjustment. Also, he is having people try this on a stage and in very small areas that probably feel dangerous next to a significant ledge and only giving them a few tries while he practices extensively with plenty of space and fewer spectators making it look like he knows it well but in reality he hasn't actually given this much thought at all or he at least isn't sharing those thoughts with us in his video.

The reward portion may not be as obvious to tweak, as I don't have awesome Australian vacation tickets dangling from a stick, but the model is intriguing.

One thing is, you're way slower and have to balance out more on a bicycle, like there's a lot more movement going on with the handlebar. The other thing is that while your brain would technically know riding the backwards bike shouldn't be all too different from riding a motorcycle I think the problem would still be the muscle memory, because (for lack of all the fancy science terms) your muscles are so sure they KNOW how to ride a bike they'll just keep doing it the normal way until you practise a lot.

But, on day two, my brain had learned the new combination. Then I took the glasses off, and again all looked totally skewed without them. However, after a few back and forth changes, my brain figured out how to keep both programs running and know immediately which to use.

@edgargil8159,My conclusion is this. Maybe because we adults and we know what happen when you fall it hurt. Like you said when we first learn to ride on first bike. It was days and days falling down and getting up. We would just try to keep moving forward as hard as we could without moving left or right until we hit a stop sign to stop us. Maybe our brain know what pains feels and how much it hurt. Try riding the bike with some nice gears that let you fall and take no damage to your body. And just worried about moving the bike insted of trying not to fall. Just my opinion def would love to try one of this bikes.,6년 전,0,

@mannygee005,did I comment here years ago?  In computer gaming there is a setting called inverted mouse.  What it does different is when you move the mouse up your pointer moves down and vice versa when you mouse down it will move the pointer up.  One day I decided my aim in the game is limited in this inverted mouse controls so I decide to change the setting to normal mouse movement.  It is very similar to reverse bike steering.  So yes I've experienced something similar and it takes a long time to get used to a reversed way of moving something.  Even after I could control the mouse I still needed weeks if not months to improve my game play.  But ... as in the video it's possible to flip it back the other way and you can relearn quicker the 2nd time.  So I believe Dustin that I won't be able to ride that bike for a few weeks if not a few months and it would be very frustrating ... but not impossible.

@koralr33fer79,"I dont know if it is so much a mind bender as it just is an issue with physics. When you lean to far left, you tend to turn the handle bars to the left to catch yourself due to the weight of your body and the side you are leaning or falling towards, its not really a conscious or subconscious decision to turn the wheel that way but because of the imbalance on the bike the handle bars tend to turn in the direction you are falling. I dont think its even muscle memory, just you fall right, you put your right leg out to catch yourself and thus turn the wheel to the right. But with the opposite turning wheel when you start to tip and the handle bars follow it turns the opposite way putting even more force on the side of the bike that is already tipping over.",6년 전,0,

Add a visible flag to the post locking mechanism so you can see if the lock/alternating mechanisms is engaged or not  No docking stations needed because no one could ride a bike that constantly switched back and forth from backwards to forwards turning.",6년 전,2,

There's like a moment it just clicks and then I can fly around...but before the actual dream flying happens there are many attempts that almost seem like the mind is searching for the pathway to do it...and then it finds it and I'm able to then fly. Also it seems that from past experience or practice in my previous lifetime of dreaming( most of which I don't recall while awake) must have worked as a practice and each time it got easier without my knowledge...like I remember dreams where flying was so strange and awkward and  then more recently I'm flying without needing to focus on certain aspects, like painting lift or control of speed...it just happens, like riding a bike.

@AcceptGamingDKD, @eleo_b  but the wheel wouldnt be working in the opposite direction. Just rhe handlebars. Your thinking of it from the top down. But when riding no handed you need to think from the ground up. The handlebars mean nothing when riding no handed other then a basic reference for your turning angle. And it would be much easier to reverse this then the whole mechanical functions of steering.

@KevinChry,"I guess to add to this comment, think about counter steering on a motorcycle. After you reach a speed of 10 to 15 mph counter steering begins to take effect due to gyroscopic forces.  There is a transition as you’re accelerating from zero to counter-steer speed where moving the handle bars in the opposite direction causes the motorcycle to lean. Pushing forward on the right handlebar turns the handlebars left, while the motorcycle leans right, and begins to turn to the right. You do not push down on the handlebars to countersteer and you don’t lean your body.  As a matter fact if you take your hands off the handlebars at say 30 mph, then lean right, The handlebars will turn left slightly because your using lean to induce a turn on the handle bars. Obviously this works both right and left.   So my thought is, if you are consciously aware of counter steering, then can you apply that mental concept at slower speeds on the reverse bike to more quickly adapt?  I believe the most difficult part obviously is from 0 to 3 mph as there are no gyroscopic forces to stabilize and counter-steering is not in play yet, or at least not noticeable, so you need a good clean start due to the lack of sufficient gyroscopic stabilization.",6년 전,3,
@Mithadon," @clockwardkailleach  certainly, the more comfortable you get with using two languages, the easier it gets to switch between the two, and certainly that gets compounded with additional ones.

@martaleszkiewicz5115,"It doesn't seem very practical though. When you ride a normal bike and turn the handles left, your entire body goes left. Most of your mass is now on the left, whereas in this weird reversed bike the only way to not fall is to always keep your center of mass in the middle, which means you cannot develop faster speeds on it. This is also why he says you need to keep your focus sharp non-stop. He doesn't need that much focus to remember that left is right and vice versa, as to keep his center of mass perfectly in the middle and counter to the direction he's stretching his arms out at that. One of the reasons his son learned it faster is likely also because his bike was clearly more sturdy and stable in form (like children's bikes are supposed to be) than the dad's, his seat was lower and handles higher relatively to the rest of the body, meaning that it would have been much easier to make turns without altering the position of your center of mass in relation to the bike and the angle your torso is leaning in relatively to the ground.",6년 전,2,

I also think in English, and some of my memories seem to have translated themselves (when I try to quote someone from memory and realize that can't have been a literal quote because it's in the wrong language)..   When I talk to my family members in my native language (online, on the phone etc.) I understand them fine, but I have a very hard time finding my words for a bit. This pretty much happens every time..  Then when I speak to people in my living room (in English obviously) I also have a slightly harder time for a few minutes finding my words (and not accidentally answering in the wrong language but especially words that I want to use that I can't seem to remember the counterpart of.. that tip of the tongue feeling.. it is actually super frustrating..)  In both cases I understand what people are saying to me just fine, but it feels like the ""switch"" you are talking about.. it takes a minute before my fluency is back and I can answer with anything less monosyllabic than a ""yes"" or a ""no""..   The more I ""switch"" though, the easier it becomes to switch between the two..  Does anyone else recognize this?

When you normally steer to the left you turn the 12 o'clock position of the wheel to the left.  To steer this modified bike you simply have to picture the 6 o'clock position of the wheel as the reference position for the turn - if you want to turn left, you move the 6 o'clock position to the left and, voila, bob's your uncle!",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@dopeymark,"Destin, I watched this video two years ago, and I recently watched Mike's  video after you sent him a bike. I believe that I may have some insight that you are not aware of, on how to approach riding the backwards bicycle. It is simple physics, and most motorcycle racers who can ride really fast around the racetrack are aware of this concept. I think if you applied this concept to the backwards bicycle it would be considerably easier to ride at least once the bicycle was moving and generating some minor gyroscopic effect. I will figure out a way to get you a direct message and see if you agree.",6년 전(수정됨),2,

@arnastubuttwehak994,"Not sure that I see all of the conclusions that emerge from this - that this is an example of biases in thinking for example. This is all spinal/cerebellar wiring - nothing as sophisticated as ""biased thinking"" occurs. How long would it take to learn not to shield your face if something is thrown at it, not to pull your hand away from burning heat, or not to move the other foot back if your forward foot slips on ice? You're not controlling those things, no thought is involved, no 'bias', except the bias of frequently-repeated success. Learning to play a piano with bass and treble ends of the keyboard reversed would take time - all of the automatic/reflex assists would be exactly the opposite of useful, and trying to consciously inhibit the acquired reflexes would make it more difficult than just starting from scratch as a non-keyboard player. You wouldn't fall off anything so it wouldn't be as showy but it would take a long time to re-acquire all of the automaticity involved in playing, but in reverse.    You have a learned reflexes because there isn't time think - you have to act instantaneously, or you'll be hurt, so the input goes through a much more direct path to your muscles, skipping your brain entirely in some instances.   The neuroplasticity of children, while a real thing, is also not proven by this. In the adult those reflexes have been deeply reinforced. They're very important and they always, always work. Children have much fewer repetitions, and they're not as sure if a principle is universal or if this is just something that works well enough. The reflex is much less disciplined and automatic, which leaves children more prone to falling off their bikes, but also more able to re-wire the reflex.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

If you now continue to play you will see that you will initially throw the ball to the left of the basket, no surprise here.

@MrJdsenior,"I wrote the following early on in the vid.   It's not really understanding, it's just a sense issue.  Any servo designer understands this intuitively....ie.  if the properly designed and built servo goes hard over on the first start-up try reversing the sense leads first, then start measuring and thinking.   ;-) I can bear this out by saying that I bet when you finally learn how to ride that bike, you would have problems, at least initially, going directly from it to a normal steering bike, but you certainly ""understand"" both, at that point....just wiring.   Now I've watched the whole thing.  You should look up the guy that did this with vision. He built inverting glasses, and one day the image flipped upright through them.  Then he had to wait for it to uflip back WITHOUT them.  I think you should take this experiment farther.  It took 20 minutes to relearn a normal bike.  I suspect if you rode that for a while, then you tried the backward bike again, you would ""snap"" into it's mode much faster.   It would be interesting to see the time required on each cycle (see what I did there). I suspect it would reduce exponentially, on each iteration.  And as for welders being smarter than engineers....not really...not so much....not in my experience, though I did know one very sharp one, and I'm talking general knowledge here, not IQ, there are probably some welders with very high IQ's.  ;-)  The backward bike idea was done long before his attempt.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@TheMasturCheef,"Adults can learn stuff much, much faster than children, including languages. The reason why it seems that children can learn new languages fast is a) because they are often thrown into an environment where everybody speaks the new language so they simply practice for hours each day and even more importantly b) because they are not as afraid to fail as adults culturally learn to be and they have much more stamina for trying again and again.  b) is really essential and I think it's a sad thing how afraid most adolescents and adults are of failing.  When you compare for example how many new words a day a person can learn, an adult performs much better than a child. This has nothing to do with neuroplasticity. It's simply because an adult already has a much more profound understanding of the world and therefore a more complete semantic network as a frame of reference to attach new information to.",6년 전,5,

@KaityKat117,"For the sake of not repeating myself, I'll explain the Neuroscience at work, here.  While you are learning to use your muscles, when you're a baby, you start by consciously and deliberately moving them. Over time, your brain gets the idea that these motions always use the same signals, and it writes it into your subconscious so that you can do the motions without thinking about them. It's an important thing to be able to do because if you always had to think consciously about every motion, you wouldn't have much cognitive room left for anything else, and it would make doing things much more difficult.  The same thing happens when you learn to ride a bike. The calculations necessary to keep your balance are written into your subconscious. Since keeping balance is something done involuntarily, it's difficult to fight it. When they reversed the bike's response to the handle bars, it screwed with him because his subconscious was trying to make things easier for him by taking over on balance (an involuntary action). When it tried to compensate a little, his imbalance went further, so it tried to compensate more. Hence the exaggerated motions. It took a lot of deliberate practice to retrain his subconscious just like it took to learn it in the first place.  His brain thought, at this point ""well, it's different now guess we can start forgetting that other stuff"" until he showed his brain ""no that stuff is still relevant"". I'll bet if he went back and forth between bikes (after learning the backwards bike), he'd need much less time to reacclimate.   Also on the idea that the handle bars are somehow more sensitive. Not true. It's a 1:1 gear ratio. Your brain is misjudging it because of the relative motion between the handle bars and the wheel, but it's turning at the same rate.",6년 전,0,

@picklevoncrunchnmunch7946,"i cant believe this is a vid.  the mechanics of the bike is such that you apply pressure to the pedal with one foot, and use your opposing hand to apply pressure to the opposing handlebar. Therefore, you pull the wheel in the direction opposite to the direction the bike is tipping (due to the pressure on the pedal). If the bike is set up such that the wheel actually turns in the direction of tilt, the bike will fall over.   Its not a matter of ""learning how to ride a bike again"". Its an inferior machine to a bike. The mechanics of it don't work the same, or anywhere near as well.   The way that he eventually learned to ride it was to shift his torso while he applies pressure to the pedal, to keep the center of mass of the ""bicycle"" as close to the geometric center as possible, while simultaneously reverse maneuvering the handlebars to compensate for any shifts in the center of mass caused by applied pedal pressure.   This is like saying ""we made a car where the drivers seat and steering wheel is facing backwards, and there's a mirror that the driver can look through to drive. When people tried to drive it, boy oh boy, it took them a while to get the hang of it!  Obviously.. it's an inferior machine that's built in a way that obviously doesn't work best, given the situation",6년 전,0,

@e.m.1857,"It does the same to me with keyboard layouts. I'm used to azerty (french) layout, and one day i learned bépo (same concept as dvorak keyboard but for French). After a few weeks of practicing only that, I became pretty decent at the new layout. Then I realized I could go back to the old layout and switch quasi instantly. But I have a dedicated bépo keyboard, with a different shape and all. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to do this if I used the same keyboard for the two layouts. It's like my brain see the keyboard and realize which way it has to be ""wired"". It's kinda amazing how the brain works.

@Hi-hy1jr,"So.... in simpler words.... muscle memory doesn’t last forever when long periods of time has passed without practice. In the case of a bicycle, people have a habit of keeping balance which causes us to lose balance from our need to turn the only thing we can control. The handles, which loses the speed which only goes faster in a straight direction. To make it worse, we have a habit of fearing to go faster since the result of an accident to happen usually gets worse as the initial speed is exercised. A child being much smaller has an easier time to balance themselves while grownups on much larger bicycles have the trouble of keeping balance since the weight point is much higher. For example, a person is able to balance a square much easier than a rectangle (having it stand upright). I think. I might sound stupid. Edit: I’ll just like myself to feel less lonely.",6년 전(수정됨),2,

@jerryferguson5461,Enjoyed the video and the concept.  I learned to fly helicopters in the army. I watched and enjoyed your helicopter video. All U.S. army helicopters when I served required left pedal application when applying power to the single main rotor system (which turns clockwise as seen from the cockpit). I have always wondered if the single main rotor helicopters which turn the other way would foul the mind of an accomplished pilot accustomed to the norm for him or her. One school of thought has it that one's hands and feet automatically do whatever is required. The other school of thought is what I just watched.

@SinnerD2010," @a_diamond  I would say yes, the technique for no hands still involves the handle bars, just not utilizing your hands. I would imagine this is near impossible if not outright. offsetting balance of weight for no hands on a normal bike only works cause it has a self centering way about it once the lean is over, and you are leaning into the direction of turn, thus there is a balance. however offsetting to the opposite direct the turn would simply tip the bike as user weight would be way of CoM. probably easier to win the lottery.",6년 전,1,

Take alos driving a car on the wrong side of the road ( depending which country you are from) and a serial traveller I can swap from country to country (LH drive to RH drive) without a blink (although reversing sometimes ""gets me"") So what I saying is we learn by repetition, whether it is ABC's, a bike or a car.

People who know how to ride a bike have a lot of built up muscle memory in their brains that's all geared to riding a normal bike.  The problem with this odd bike is that it is 180* out of phase with your muscle memory.  And it can be VERY difficult to get your body to override muscle memory.  Your mind may want to do the right thing to ride this odd bike correctly, but it keeps fighting against your muscle memory, and from the narrator's example, it seems that muscle memory wins out almost all the time.",6년 전,0,

@vortexfreerunning1490," @Scawsome  Indeedy. I am also surprised that he relearned to use a normal bike so quickly. I feel like it would take me a lot longer.  I am curious if somebody who is a world champion in lets say bmxing, who is 20 years old. Would relearn to ride the normal bike again faster than somebody who has been casually riding bikes for lets say 50 years. Because he has built up more muscle memory around bikes learning different skills, and constantly being on one. Or if the older person would relearn how to normally ride a bike faster because he has it firmly in his head after many years of using that part of his brain. Maybe some tests with this bike using different factors would be interesting to see. It would be a case of what is stronger: Using that part of the brain lots for a little time Vs using it a little for a long time.  I also like how in the video he got his son to try it, and he got the hang of the inverted bike a lot faster. Its intriguing to see how factors like age affect it.",6년 전,1,

Then I decided that I had to breakdown exactly what my muscles were doing and just reverse that. So standing in front of a mirror practising the muscle contractions on the flip side allowed me to do so. However there was also a 'Click' moment, where I think my state of mind was in a more relaxed one where it was almost second nature. Of course upon realising that I had done so, my mind freaked out and I crashed. And since having experienced that first 'Click', I just kept trying to achieve it again and sustain it for longer.  This is also where I realised the muscles on my right body were actually noticeably smaller due to overusing the left. So that's also a factor.",6년 전,0,

@manudewi,"Some facts/effects to consider when thinking about this: 1.- To perform something, you need skill. If you want to express this in knowledge, riding a bike is considered procedural knowledge so it doesn't fit your statement of understanding. Understanding how to write a bike is not the same as riding the bike! 2.- Consider the ""stroop effect"". Which says that ""automated skills"" for example reading, can be activated ina a bottom-up manner. Bottom up means, that you can't just not do it, you have to inhibit the impulse of doing it. In your case, for learning to ride the backwards bike, you have to inhibit the impulse of letting your ""automated skill of riding a normal bike"". This effect you might realize it when you see a movie with english sound and english subtitels. As reading is an automated skill it is difficult do ignore the letters. 3.- The transfer paradox. It refers to combined vs massed practice. In your childhood you had massed practice for normal bikes. Then you had massed practice for the backwards bike. To be able of doing both you need to practice combined: sometimes one bike sometimes the other. That way you can integrate your skills to some extent!  I´d like to see a remake of this video with the above considerations! Even though, I enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing",6년 전,0,

@KaityKat117," @davidpyper82  It looks like it's turning faster because the handle bars and the wheel are turning in opposite directions, but in reality, it's turning the same. Your brain is being tricked by relative motion. Your brain sees how fast the wheel crosses by the handle bars and guesses how fast each are going.  The 1:1 gear ratio does in fact mean they turn at the exact same rate. This is not a factor.  The only factor here is that once you've learned how too use the handle bars on the bike, the instructions for turning are written in your subconscious, because consciously keeping your balance in the first few feet is too difficult for your frontal lobe, so it is outsourced to the more powerful part of your brain. The part that controls motor function.  When they reversed the action of the handle bars, it screwed with his brain's recorded calculations that told him how to use them.  I'll bet if you found a way to reverse the response of the muscles in your hands to the signals in your brain, you'd ""forget"" how to use your hands for quite a long while. Even if you could consciously figure it out, you'd need an inordinate amount of time and concentration to do the most simple tasks.",6년 전,8,
@tokshernandez4744," @KaityKat117  yep i agree its turning the same. Coz if not you would be turning left @ 45 degrees on your handle bar and the front wheel is already @ 60 degrees right, but in this video, i found no scene wherein the handle bar and wheels are on a different (opposite) turn angle.",6년 전,1,
@tokshernandez4744," @davidpyper82  it is not just counter steering, remember that when you will be Pushing on your left foot pedal, your weight and force will also be directed to the left, in which your body will naturally balance to maintain its center of gravity (thru steering, leaning, weight adjustment etc). Counter steering is just one thing. It is not like playing a video game with an inverted steering wheel.  When you walk, you naturally move your hands against the position of your feet. You dont step your left foot and move your left hand forward at the same time.",6년 전,1,

@ArcheWhatzitGonnaB3,"What does this have to do with with remembering how to ride a bike? Bikes are nothing more than muscle memory. The reason the reversed handles are difficult to control is not only because it's the opposite of what you're used to, it's also a very counterproductive way to turn. When you're turning right on a normal bike you lean to the right and turn the handle to the right. If you didn't turn the handle to the right you would just become unbalanced and fall. This reverse handlebar bike has you lean to the right, but have to stretch to the left to turn the wheel to the right in order to maintain balance. By stretching to the left you shift your balance and change the entire equilibrium of the bike to the point where it's nearly fallen.",6년 전,1,

@DualDesertEagle,"Watching this again a month later suddenly reminded me of something I had happen to me when I was younger.  I went to a friend's house with one of my RC planes and he took a closer look at the transmitter, trying to unterstand how to fly the plane with that. When I later went out to fly the plane I launched it and everything seemed fine until I tried to fly a right turn and had the plane bank left instead. At first I thought the plane had been hit by a strong wind gust and pushed the stick further to the right to try and correct, which instead made the plane roll over to the left and crash. When I inspected it the control surfaces seemed fine, except the rudder was going the wrong way (the plane was a 3 channel one with no ailerons, but built in a way that the rudder had an extreme impact on the roll axis). I remembered my friend fiddling with the transmitter and it turned out that he'd thrown the reverse switch for the rudder channel without having the slightest clue what he'd caused with that. When I confronted him with that he claimed that he'd never touched the thing, despite me seeing him play around with it.  So basically the same thing  as in this video applies to RC planes, albeit not quite as hard to get used to if u have the time to figure out what's wrong and what u need to do to solve the problem.",6년 전,0,

@sashachip,Im implying that either on a bicycle or a motorcycle you do not countersteer when starting from a complete stop- like in this video. You only use countersteer at higher speeds because centrifugal force keeps the bike upright. The reason for countersteer is to put the tire on its sidewall. At slow speeds you would just fall over. High speeds create centrifugal forces that keep the bike upright.,6년 전,0,

@rowlandstraylight,"An interesting related phenomenon is most people who ride bicycles and a significant proportion of motorcycle riders cannot describe how they do it, particularly the technique for setting up a turn.  Whilst this might seem ok if you can just ride, this explains target fixation type crashes. A naieve assumption it's as simple as turning the bars in the direction you want to go.   If you hold the bars firm on a bicycle and turn them to the right you fall off to the left. On a briskly moving motorcycle if you try the same the it feels like the bars won't turn. It's part of the steering geometry that the bars return to centre and this is more apparent the faster you go, hence riding slowly is inherently more wobbly.  Firstly you need a loose hold on the bars, bicycles are self balancing and to do this the bars need to move. A brief (and quite gentle on a bicycle) push of the bars anticlockwise (right bar away from you) initiates some lean to the right. You then need to stop pushing on the bars as they swing back clockwise and the bike finds a new equilibrium position at this lean angle. And you're turning.  You need to briefly push the bars in the opposite direction to the turn.  And at higher speeds just moving bodyweight doesn't have a huge effect on turning, as can be demonstrated by riding a bike with a second set of handlebars that are welded to the frame. Look up Keith Code's No BS bike for an example of this.  Of course balancing a slow moving bike is harder still as it's a series of corrections to both lean and direction, and if you're pedalling it's even harder as not only are you moving from side to side on the bike but likely pushing and pulling the bars.",7년 전,0,

@budchestnut9303,The secret is do not steer. 95% of bicycle handling is in the body posture and leaning. If you weld the steering wheel so that it cannot be turned you can still ride the bike by using body attitude in large areas. If you MUST steer this funky bike then you are a goner. I wish I could take the $200 challenge. Plus it appears they made the gear ratio VERY fast. That is stacking the deck. Very short distances are tuff too. A nice big parking lot and NOT steering works. Wheel weight and diameter also help in attitudinal steering. I owned several shops and can ride most any trick bike.

@poemontyperacer,"Anyone who loves both ice skating and roller skating like I do is familiar with this frustrating limit of human abilities! More details if you're interested:   I've been inline skating all my life, so I do it well enough. But when I discovered ice skating one summer vacation, I loved it so much (the drifting possibilities in particular) that I did it all summer everyday, until the point where I could do what I wanted on ice—it did take practice, for the sensation was different.  But here comes the realization. When I got home and hopped in my rollers, I started fast as usual in the street... Except I went 3 meters then involuntarily tried to drift like I did on ice—and crashed, almost twisting my unsuspecting ankle. To my dismay, it took me almost a full week to get comfortable on the road again.  I repeated the story several times (ice skating is a seasonal activity, so I re-learned it during winter), except I knew what to expect, and the re-learning process got faster every time (be it when I relearned on ice or on ground).  I never tried to force myself into mastering both at the same time. For instance, I could try to skate to the ice rink. But I'm afraid I'd mostly just get confused and lose performance for both activities.  I wonder if I could try to help my brain differentiate the two sports, using colors, or sounds, maybe even different soles on each skate? Could it be done?   If you have more to add about this situation (I guess either ground or ice skaters will be prompt to try their ice/ground counterpart if given a chance), I'd be happy to hear it! Cheers.",7년 전,0,

You lay on it, it moves in a circular pattern in all 3 axis, then the reverse.  All the while you look at a particular frequency of light (color) and listen to a specially embedded music.  This forces the brain to process in new pathways...  interesting affects and results.  A patient after being on it for the 5th day (therapy is every day for an hour, for 12 days), when asked if he noticed any difference, he said, ""I don't spend my day trying not to kill myself.""  He explained his depression was so bad that he spent the day trying not to follow through with his suicidal ideations.  He had learned a new way to process.     The biggest issue is the muscle memory programming, this is auto pilot subconscious processing and not active conscious processing.  As you have done it longer, it becomes more embedded and the nerve pathways for processing are sticky meaning this is how we react to this situation.

As well as you could ride the backwards bike it seemed there was more anticipation of steering inputs as opposed to corrections and that it would be difficult to lean into a turn and get the bike to an angle with the backwards setup  Side note: props to you for learning though - those welders must've been smiling on the other side of their face when you came back months later being able to ride it!",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@Joe_Blo,"Yep. The slop in the gears causes rider to quickly over- correct, which in turn upsets the riders balance. Basically, a high speed wobble occurs at very low speed. Watch some motorcycle crash videos. The same issue occurs at high speed when the suspension and steering are loose or become unbalanced. The rider will be often thrown from the bike while trying to regain control. I posit that his theory is wring, and the brain and muscle learn very fast.  A motorcycle is counter steered at speed. You push on bars to the right to turn left and vice versa. Same with a bicycle at speed. You do not turn by leaning.  This bike is like that unstable ladder climb at carnivals. It is extremely  unstable, and it simply takes a lot of practice to learn to balance it. https://youtu.be/y_A9VRtfzPI The kid's bike likely has tighter gears and steering bearings. Plus it has smaller wheeels and a lower center of gravity, thus making it easier to balance. The kid is not necessarily learning faster than an adult.",6년 전(수정됨),5,

Sensitivity is much higher on that bike than any other because of the gear system(it works as wheel on cars, gears shortens the turning circle, but in doing so, it also becomes more sensitive), and also, regular bike turn by leaning, where on this one, when you turn, you must lean in the different direction, and that's why you could never drive this bike for real, even if it is the first bike you ever drove, and had no previous knowledge of bike riding. So, it is not about the reverse steering, but about the completely wrong physics and mechanics of that bike.

@heyimamaker,"It looks to me that on top of the steering being reversed that there is a mechanical advantage causing the steering to accelerate in the wrong direction.   With the rake in the form, the wheel would want to speed up as you turn. Normally this would be stopped or controlled because the handlebars are attached to the stem and then attached to the steer tube of the form.  If you are attempting to turn right the wheel goes left and accelerates the right-hand turn with a pull rather than a push.   So I think it's not only counter-intuitive on what direction the bike is trying to move but also what muscles have control over the turn.",7년 전,0,

@budmartin8297,"Great video.  I experienced a similar situation that shows the brains capacity to switch systems when I was driving an automatic car and began talking with my passenger about learning to drive a stick shift.  After a few minutes of talking about the clutch etc, I was approaching a stop sign and involuntarily went to push in the clutch and we stopped real fast as I hit the brake.  Recalling this situation while driving once it happened again involuntarily.  My brain only needed the suggestion of driving a manual transmission to switch into clutch mode.  I have now learned to watch out for this if driving an automatic while discussing a manual.  Note: I had driven a manual car for many years before returning to automatic.  Quite a cool experiment though.",7년 전,0,

I didn't notice from going to ""shallow"" click to a deeper click but when i swapped the mouse years later, after that mouse broke down, I couldn't do a double click reliably and it made me extremely frustrated.   For the next few weeks I did weird triple clicks or something like that because there was just a tiny bit of extra delay between the first click and the second. My finger just wouldn't move even though I acknowledged what I did wrong and knew how to fix it. I've never experienced anything like that ever since.

That’s why kids can’t simply go from a tricycle to a bike without learning how to ride on two wheels. Your learned response to starting to topple is to make a steering input to correct that lean. With the reverse bike this only makes it worse and your instinctive response is to steer even more, making it even worse.

And besides you never really turn the handle bars that much whenever you go in for a turn... I have never turned more than about 1 inch of displacement from the exact center... I'm sure it could easily be ridden, as long as the steering is made more sturdy. Which is extremely hard to do because you are using cogs. Just rewatched the part where the kid is trying to ride forward on the stage. He is having troubles holding the front wheel still. He's not having to turn and therefore he is not moving his hands.

What if the offset were greater and there were a small gear lined up with a large gear so there would be a kind of reduction, a different ratio.  There still would be inverse turning.

@johnclifford1911,"An interesting video, but I think your conclusion is erroneous. You had a cognitive bias, because you had a conscious understanding of how to ride a bike along with muscle memory of how to successfully ride a bicycle (turn the wheel in the direction you're falling until you aren't falling). You had to learn to turn the wheel in the opposite direction, and then you had to do this enough to make it unconscious (muscle memory). When you went back to a regular bicycle, you had to restore the muscle memory for it, which took you about 20 minutes. I don't think this is knowledge versus understanding... it is unconscious knowledge versus conscious knowledge. It isn't that you aren't as 'smart' as you thought you were, it is that there are different mechanisms involved here and that understanding what to do is different from being able to do it without conscious thought.   I would wonder if a person who had never learned how to ride a normal bike would have been able to learn how to ride the backwards bike far more quickly... no muscle memory to unlearn.",7년 전,0,

@CGoody564,"I would argue that you simply did not have enough information to understand.  Yes, you had the knowledge of how the handlebar itself worked, and you seemingly know how to ride a regular bike; but are you consciously aware of what you are doing when riding a bike?  Counter steering for example; when you initiate a turn on a bicycle, you actually turn the handlebars the opposite way (very slightly) to get the bike to lean the in to a turn way.  (Hold a bike straight, and turn the handle bars; the bike will lean in the opposite direction).  However, it is very subtle and a lot of people don't realize that they are doing it when initiating a turn.  That being said, If you lean in to a turn as you are supposed to, that motion causes you to push forward on that sides handlebar, causing the tire to turn away from the turn and leaning the bike in to the turn.  At this point, the torque steer of the tire contacting the surface tends to be enough to bring the tire back the other way in order to sustain the turn. If you are not consciously aware of that mechanic, when the handlebars are reversed, you are literally not aware of how to properly turn the bike, as you arent even aware that you counter-steer to initiate a turn on a normal bike.  Despite physically being able to ride a bike, you don't actually know (or at least arent aware that you know) the mechanics of doing so; you do it without even knowing you are doing it.  Is that a lack of knowledge or understanding?  I think knowledge.  You know how to get a bike to turn; you don't necessarily know why the bike turns.    It seems you are under the impression that you turn the handlebar right to initiate a right hand turn on a bicycle, and that is simply a fundamental lack of knowledge regarding how a single track vehicle such as a bicycle, motorcycle, or scooter work, as many people don't know.  If you know the mechanics, then yes it is just a lack of understanding.  But many people don't know the mechanics, especially of turning a bike",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@bigmastaduke,"Hey Destin! Great and entertaining video.  I think it has also a lot to do how you drive your bike. Most people tear at the handlebars to initiate a bend and acctually overdrive their bike.  Let's forget about the transition phase from stand still to self stabilizing speed for now.  If you are driving around 10mph you dont need to hold the handlebars to steer/control your bike. You can do everyting needed with your feets, butt and your upper body. The only reason to hold the handlebars are potholes, stones and other surface changes. But you shouldn't do more than dampening harsh deflection of the front wheel with your arms. Hold the bike with your butt. Use your upper body for curve initation and counter the momentum from pedaling. Accelerate to get out of bends. If you do so you will also notice when you initiate a bend that your handlebars turn against the direction of the bend. On a bike you can overdrive this because the forces are low but this won't work on a motorcycle when you enter a corner at 100mph. Even something simple - that everybody can learn - can be done wrong :) Maybe it has something to do that we humans d'like to controll/do everything with our hands.  With a good trained sense of balance it's possible to get going free hands on a plain surface. Easiest way to train this is driving free hands (on a closed place). When you feel comfortable reduce your speed. Another trick to make it easier would be to increase the caster.  I would bet a racing motorbiker can learn this pretty quick.  Greetings!",7년 전(수정됨),0,

By turning your back to the wall mirror and holding up a small handle mirror in front of you to see the back of your head in the wall mirror.  So if you have experience cutting your hair in the back, then you know how 'almost impossible' it is to coordinate the movement of your hand and scissors as you attempt  cutting hair at the back.  iT's a lot like riding the bike in this video.

@sparkimoto,"I'm not gonna say I could ride that bike.  But I DO remember when I first worked a job where I had to drive a fork lift.

But because with the bike, this is done with the front wheel, then this would probably have such a different feel to it, that not even a fork lift driver could ride this bike without a similar learning curve as anyone else.

@aknopf8173,"I had a similar thing with gaming. In spme super hard platforming games there are certain features that are meant to be pulling at your brain, like sudden changes in gravity or in time. The first time you encounter any such feature it is quite difficult to wrap your head around it. But when you meat a very similar feature in a totally different game with other mechanics, it is way easier to adept to it, because your brain already learned to build that ""new path"". (I am no expert, I'm just using the same words the uploader used because they feel right). So it was very difficult to learn, that gravity does not always go downwards. Sometimes it goes sideways. Sometimes it goes in circles or other weird shapes. But once your brain learned this new ""layer of indirection"" it becomes easier to fill it in with new stuff (like shapes and triggers in my example). I will admit though, that looking at a computer screen and ""feeling"" the gravity on the screen is only very intelectual while feeling actual gravity, momentum etc. on a bike, while coordinitaing more than just your mouse- and keyboard hands is a much, much more complex task than the video game example I gave.",7년 전,0,

@panda4247,"1st: i like how your son has a tie in the end 2nd: regarding the bike - it's not just about steering the handle, it's about what your whole body is doing, how it is moving... For example - if you turn right on a normal bike, you extend your left arm and retract your right arm, your center of gravity shifts to the right and you turn right. If you do the same movement when trying to turn left on the backwards bike, you are screwed. Although you think you just ""steer left to go right"", it's completely different. Your hands need to move like you were steering the other direction, but your whole body needs to move differently. Now I am a great theoretical backwards bike rider, but I suppose even realizing this I would not be able to do it for a long time. Because well, old habits die hard and the movements are so automated in my head, that I would not be able to consciously forget it and switch. Nice experiment with your son that he could re-learn it faster. Can he now ride both bikes or does he need some time to adjust for each of them as well? Is it less than your 20 minutes?",7년 전,0,

@dhy5342,"We automatically think of the handlebars as spokes on a wheel.  If we want to turn left, we rotate the wheel left.  That is, we turn the top of the wheel to the left.  For the backwards bike the situation is similar, but backwards and instead of picturing the top of the wheel turning in the direction we want to go you have to picture turning the bottom of the wheel in the desired direction.  So, if you want to turn left, you move the bottom of the imaginary steering wheel to the left.    This is something that many of us do without thinking every day while driving a car.  If you drive your car one handed with your hand positioned at 12:00 and you want to turn right, you simply move your hand toward the right and the car turns right.  However, if you drive your car one handed with your hand at 6:00 and you want to turn right, you simply move your hand toward the left and the car turns to the right.  You could easily simulate this with the bike by repositioning the handlebars by 90 degrees, with one arm pointing forward and the other pointing backward.  In the normal way of riding you would hold the handlebar pointing forward and move it left or right to turn left or right.  In the backward mode you would hold the handlebar pointing backward and move it so that the other arm will point in the direction you want to go; move it left to go right, or move it right to go left.",7년 전,0,

I'd say this would be more like, in a console FPS, switching your left and right joysticks (using the left stick for aiming and the right stick for movement). I've gotten decent at that through playing on some older systems that only had one joystick. Most FPS games for Dreamcast or PSP had the option of using the joystick (on the left) for more precise aiming and using the face buttons for moving forward/back and strafing left/right. IIRC some N64 games did this as well, using the C buttons for moving (though with the joystick being in the center, nowadays it might make more sense to use the d-pad for movement and work the joystick and trigger with your right hand instead)...

From learning to ride a bicycle, we reflexively make minute changes in our weight distribution to maintain balance without thinking about the angle of the wheel.

Something comes to mind from a Jordan Peterson video i was watching a while back when he was talking about neural pathways and what he referred to as ballistic movements ie. Things that you learn to do and prewrite subroutines for that are then at a later time used more like a .exe file than a conscious set of decisions, something like swinging a hammer for example, the action occours faster than the fireing of synapses can relay the information from arm to brain and back, thus why deciding to not hit something mid swing does not really work, i would assume that riding a bicycle is quite similar in nature, you sit down and you click bike.exe and  you ride.  Without remapping neural subroutines, backwards steering lands you on the ground, because you change a parameter in the algorithm that affects how you shift your weight and countersteer to offset the pedaling forces. Truly fascinating... this experiment coupled with eeg would probably be valuable to neuroscience and may be a way to experiment with brain plasticity on a healthy brain.",7년 전,0,

@SlipperyTeeth,"Alexyum S.  Judging by 0:42, the wheels rotate about as much as the handle bars - just in the opposite direction, so I don't think it's a sensitivity issue.  I think the reason that people wobble so much when they start isn't a sensitivity thing.  It's just that when you start on a bike, you have to make a ton of micro adjustments to get your balance.  Most of those adjustments are small, unconscious, and quick, so someone trained in making adjustments on a normal bike will create twice the rotational instability, which will create a larger unbalance issue.  You really need to be in complete control to get it on your first try, otherwise only several weeks of training will suffice.",7년 전,34,

The problem is not only mentally steering the other way around... that's easy... but to at the same time move your body in the opposite direction of the steering which is quite challenging since you are so acostume to lean and steer at the same time... you don't even notice the leaning.

For what is happening here it would be a better example to try starting from a complete stop to get the bike moving with you hands touching your head the whole time. Of course it is ""possible"" someone who is skilled with a unicycle can probably figure it out pretty fast too. However possibility is not the point, the point is difficulty.

I understand the physics, the mechanics, the balance, the counter steering. I understand exactly what's going on here, but that doesn't mean that I could ride the bike.   The automation side of our brain - which includes many many things not just motor functions, is something we massively take for granted.  It does so many things without us consciously thinking about it that we don't even realise it's doing it most of the time.  This is one of them.

@VestigialHead,Interesting concept. I found something similar with the learning changes when i was skateboarding.  I was pretty good at Ollies and used to do hundreds of them a day.  I started trying to do 180 degree turns during the ollie.  This took some time and I was obsessed with it.  So every ollie I did for months was an attempt or success at a 180.  Once I was good at it I suddenly realised I could no longer do straight ollies  with any consistency.  I eventually did enough of both each day so I could consistently do either.

So to forget things they need to delete less memory than adults. So, it doesn't mean kids' brain is more plastic, it may mean that they need to dump less memory out.

@dukatiwho,Hello. I made myself my own backwards brain bicycle. It works great and I learned how to ride it smoothly in 4 days (practicing about 5 hours each day).

About five months ago something happened to my phone (Samsung S7 Edge) and there's a small strip down the right side where everything looks fine, but it doesn't actually work. You can't press or draw anything. This strip falls right where the ""o"" button on the digital keyboard is. Basically, when I click that button, it clicks ""i"" and ""p"" instead. Over the past 5 months, I've gotten used to typing on it and using ways to get around the problem, primarily by using autocorrect. This weird little problem with my phone has been something that I just got used to, to the point where I don't even think about it.   One interesting thing has happened because of it though. Whenever I use a digital keyboard on someone else's phone, I can't actually type anything ledgible. People don't believe me, much like you trying to relearn the bicycle, because they think I'm just playing up the problem.

@mathieuclement8011,"Not quite same thing, because balance is not involved and the bike really wants to go straight at speeds higher than 15 mph (25 kph), but note that motorcycles or bicycles going fast are subject to countersteering (turn left to go right and vice-versa) due to the gyroscopic effect.  Under 15 mph, motorcycles handle just like bicycles except they are going to the ground FAST if you don't compensate by turning the handlebars and/or shifting your weight on the opposite side.  Would be interesting to put one of those in the hands of a child (as their FIRST bike) and see what happens. I'm 80 % sure they would learn to ride them just as fast as regular bikes. You have a very good point about the ""plasticity of the brain"" at a young age.

Comparing it to cognitive biases is pretty much as silly as calling the ""archer's paradox"" a paradox ;) 2. Bicycle stability. The modification in question messes with the vital part of bicycle steering stability. A bicycle wheel is effectively a caster wheel. With all of the consequences.

@ClutchCarter_OnTikTok,It is not the fact that you switched the direction the tire goes that it is hard. It is hard because of how sensitive and how loose the system is at the gears and the bars. Because you barely touch the bars and the system wobbles. If it was a little tighter and not so loose it would not be near as hard.,7년 전,0,

@fuinharlz,"About your kid being able to learn how to ride the bike way faster than you, it's all about brain development. When we are growing up, our brain is like, matturing, so on the first YEARS of life, our brain is like a sponge that can learn everything as quick as possible. And as we get older, this learning capacity is substitued by a greater memory (so you can remember what you've learnt). The BEST age to learn more than 1 language, basic skills, write and read is before 6 yo. The WORST time to learn anything is after the 30s. This is where your brain is fully grown and your learning capacity is reduced to a minimum.  That's why it's a lot harder for a 60, 70 yo man to learn about computers and smartphones than a child... it's not because ""childs nowdays are born with technology on hands"", it's because they'r having acess  to that technology on a time period where their brains is on a learning spree, where a 60, 70 YO man is getting that same tech in a time where his brain is not more to proud on learning, but is the best thing to remember something. An interesting experiment is to test your childs long term memory. Go to a vacation trip, somewhere that you and you kid will have lots of fun, for something arround a week. 6 MONTHS later, ask him details about the trip. You'll see he can remember a lot LESS details than you can remember.",7년 전,0,

I wonder if when someone hopes on the inverted handle bar bike our brain has a shock to the program. Our brain is trying to find all new values for every variable - essentially creating a new program from scratch. Our brain ignores that we already know certain values and the only algebraic change is the inverted handlebars. If our brain understood that - perhaps it would be easier to learn? This would correlate to your  sons increased neuro-plasticity.   Another point - Could you try to ride the inverted bike with no hands? If the proposition in the previous paragraph has merit it could be demonstrated by eliminating that variable altogether. Please try to ride the bicycle with no hands.  Lastly; Great Video.

@siggyincr7447,"I liked the video, but I think you're overstretching a metaphor a bit. This has little to do with cognition, as in the cognitive bias you mention, and everything to do with messing with the non-cognitive control algorithm that you have for riding a bike. You had the knowledge AND the understanding , you just didn't have the ability. It's essentially introducing a runaway error into that algorithm by reversing the movement of the handle bars. Normally when you ride a bike you make minute adjustments that you don't even notice to keep stable, but the backwards bike makes your adjustment the exact opposite of what would stabilize you. So you adjust even more. And you get even less stable........  Before you know it you're falling over. Those minute adjustments are reflexive if you already know how to ride a bike, they need to be to fast enough to ride smoothly.  I'm guessing you could learn how to ride a backwards bike fairly quickly ( a few days maybe) if you severely limited the range of motion on the handle bars and added training wheels so the run away destabilization would be limited. That way your brain would get a few extra seconds to catch on on each attempt.",7년 전,0,

@CGoody564,"No one is taking counter steering in to mind.  When you turn a bike, you actually push the handlebars the opposite way.  Now, you probably think you don't, but I assure you that you do.  When you lean in to a turn, that motion ever so slightly pushes that sides handlebar forward, which causes the tire to turn away from the turn.  However, this is what causes the rest of the bike to lean in to the turn.  (Hold a bike straight, and turn the handle bar; the bike will lean opposite way). After initiating the turn through counter-steering, the torque steer from side of the tires on the road surface is usually enough to pull the front tire back towards the turn and thus enabling you to sustain the turn.  However, it is so subtle that people don't even realize it's happening; many people think that to turn a bike right, you turn the handlebars right initially, and that's simply false.  You have the ability to ride a bike, but you arent necessarily aware of the mechanics you are using to turn a bike or any single track vehicle.  If you arent aware of counter-steering and are under the impression that you turn handlebars right to turn right, on a reverse bike you are going to think that turning away is how you turn, when in reality THAT is when you would turn the handlebars towards a turn to initiate it, followed by the torque steer pulling the handlebars away from you and the tire towards the turn that you have already initiated  If you look at MotoGP; you can clearly see the tires turned the opposite way throughout a turn.  The tires in motogop are much wider and grippy than bike tires, which allows them to counter-steer to lean the bike, and hold the counter steer which allows the wide grippy tire to ride on it's side and pull in to the turn despite the tire facing the opposite way.  However, the initiation of a turn on any single-track vehicle is the same and it begins with counter-steering.  If you don't know this, you will never even know (let alone understand) how the bike with opposite handlebars works.",7년 전(수정됨),2,

If I lean right, the bike will turn right.

I write a lot of fiction and about 5 years ago I decided to switch from the standard QWERTY layout to Dvorak, because it was supposedly more efficient and better at preventing RSI. I'd already been typing for 15 years, and I went from 70wpm to something like eight and didn't regain my old typing speed for months. Now I can't switch back to QWERTY--put me in front of a standard keyboard and I look like someone who has never used a computer in my life.  (And over time it did actually drastically improve my speed, but then I learned that all the studies were fudged and the improvements are most likely not so much because I learned to type in Dvorak as they are because I learned to touch-type at all and I probably could have seen the same gains just sticking to QWERTY and doing regular drills.

@puncheex2,"Astronauts (perhaps all test pilots) seem to have the ability to acquire skills that many of us don't.  I was working on a NASA contract for the Teleoperator Retrieval System  - a steerable free rocket that could dock with Skylab and then take it to a higher orbit; unfortunately we didn't have enough time to get it completely working before the atmosphere declared our time up and took the lab to western Australia.  Anyway, Skylab, unmanned in its low Earth orbit, had what was called a coning motion where the spin vector was not through the docking port, so that port drew circles in the sky at an angle to the orbit vector.  We wondered whether anyone could dock to it.  We developed a 6 degree of freedom simulator and a mockup of the teleoperator's station on the shuttle mid-deck.  No one, not the engineers who designed it nor the programmers who developed the motion sim and the operator design, could dock it.  We tried all sorts of control algorithms - linear, non-linear, distance, velocity, used different devices other than the standard hand controllers, no one could do it.  They finally had to call NASA and get guidance.  The next week Jack Lousma, one of the original test pilots for the shuttle, flew out in his jet and drove out to our site.  Very quiet, softspoken, he sat down in the seat and we applied the ""basic"" setup, took out all the assists, and started the sim.  Long story short, Jack essentially set the controllers, started talking baseball, and six minutes later docked flawlessly.  That couldn't be right.  We tried every other control model we had, and Jack zorched every one, and claimed that they seemed to be all equally ""hard"".  When he was through he shook hands all around, drove back to his plane and flew away.  We still couldn't dock it after he left.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@GiggityGretsch,"Hey destin, im a drummer, (sort of). That ""feeling"" you say you get in your brain when everything sorta clicks , I've felt every time I learn a new drum rhythm.

But, once I actually hold the sticks and try to play it, I can't do it!. and I'll practice it veerrrry veeerrrrryyy slowly until I can play it up to a certain speed. But, if I get even a tiny bit distracted, It'll throw me off, and it can be very frustrating. I'll maybe try it a few more days, and then one day it'll just click, 'snap', like that. Seemingly overnight.  Then I can play the beat without thinking about it, to the point in which if I'd start to think about what I'm actually doing, THAT would then throw me off rhythm.                     I see many great drummers play these awesome beats and rhythms seemingly as if they aren't even thinking about it,  I have just a few of those rhythms I can play, and its always an awesome feeling when you learn that new rhythm (in my case) and it just clicks. As a musician, if I ever try to play a certain beat, and then quickly switch to a completely different beat, Its that same feeling you described at 6:05  Like a mental switch.

@dielaughing73,"There's a lot more going on than just turning the bars.  Any motorcyclist will tell you, turning doesn't even happen the way most people think (look at Twist of the Wrist). Counter-steering means that a slight lean in the direction you want to go tends to push the bars forward on that side, which initiates a turn opposite to the direction the front wheel starts to face.    Switching up the response of the wheel to this totally unconscious action (that many people refuse to even believe exists) is bound to mess with your head.  Suddenly you're overthinking where the front wheel is pointing, when you never really understood it anyway.  It's precisely why learning to ride is so hard in the first place.",7년 전,0,

@jsallerson,"Destin, I've noticed over the many times I've watched this video that when you are learning to ride the bike you tend to look (eyes) forward. Whereas when your son is learning to ride it, he's looking down at the wheel. In my understanding, he is more able to adapt to the change of the bicycle because he is constantly monitoring the wheel's movement and able to anticipate and respond to its change virtually instantly.   I will agree with you that children's minds are often more flexible, the way in which they approach learning something new is different than the way adults do so. Children don't know anything about the world and therefore approach every new situation with the mindset of not knowing and instead attempt to learn, whereas adults do exactly as you say in the beginning, ""they bet they can ride this bike"". Adults approach learning new situations in a mindset of conquering the challenge, which often leads to arrogance and unrealistic expectations, often causing failure.   If we could reprogram our minds to approach learning new situations and challenges the way children do, we may be more able to rapidly learn new things at a much faster rate.",7년 전,0,

@D2D2D2D,"My dad can ride both regular and backwards(btf) bikes just fine.  He has a real knack for riding a backwards bikes, always has, he never really had to learn.  He had a go on one in his teens/20s I guess because a mate of his made one, and could ride it, so recently (he's now in his 60s) had one made again.  He takes it to fetes and rides it round in tight circles one handed making it look so natural that you would guarantee it must be possible for anyone to pick it up within a couple of pedal strokes.  As you and I know its not.  What is avoided here is WHY is it so hard!  Did you take 8 months to ride a regular bike?  Did your son take 2 weeks to ride a regular bike a few feet?  My guess is no he did it a LOT faster.  Its because the bike is inherently unstable I think.  Some of the fete goers have the idea of trying to ride it no hands to eliminate the steering input error fail.  I seem to recall it doesn't work, but maybe I'm wrong, I feel it should,  I will get out the fete bike and try but I know its easier to ride no hands when going fast which as you know is dangerous and very hard.  I watched a TED talk about bikes and why they are generally self stabilising and its not any one reason, does anyone actually know at all?  About 4 years ago one summer I cycled over to my dads for a BBQ and he got the b2f bike out and I had a long go on and off over the evening, when I came to ride home I was exactly like you were!  I luckily recovered within seconds but i got that silly 'dizzy' feeling I'm sure you had.  One thing I would say is that you CAN conquer it with brains over practice much faster.  It involves forgetting how to ride a regular bike faster than you learn to ride the new one as one ruins the other.  My dad can seemingly switch brains on a whim, like some people can switch languages when speaking, however for many this is hard.  Also being able to understand the mechanics of riding the machine...whilst riding, most humans can't combine thinking about moving with moving very easily, far easier for movements to be as a result of a reaction to something.  For example when you were learning were you trying to go forward, thinking about trying to ride a bike I bet?  Bad!  The thing to do is focus on steering the front tyre under the bike, that's all, heck forget its even a bike, isolate by either leaning against a wall and playing with steering, paddling along and freewheeling to remove the pedalling.  You can ride it in a straight line in a few hours or less this way I found, turning though is a different story!  Some just can't be that disciplined though and their brains are too hardwired for regular balanced movement I reckon, me included!",7년 전,0,

@MIO9_sh,"It is not THAT IMPOSSIBLE to ride the inverted bike at all. All you need to handle that bike is just a simple understanding on how the steering control helps you on balancing, and thus riding the bike properly. If you know the reason why you need the steering, you need the steering, YOU CAN handle that bike in fact. Actually i learned how to ride a bicycle not just by constantly trying aimlessly, I have my own algorithm: 1. Get on the bike 2. Start paneling 3. When you feel yourself start to be unbalanced to the left, turn the steering wheel to the left. And the same, when you feel yourself start to be unbalanced to the right turn the steering wheel to the right.  (The degree of turning is depend on how unbalance you are currently) 4. Done.  Don't believe? Tell those who don't know how to ride a bike about this, and I'm pretty sure they will know how to ride it within a couple of minutes  So, get to the topic....If i have this algorithm in my mind, and when i ride on that specially designed bike, all I have to do would be flipping the direction in step 3 (That means turn left when unbalanced to the right), IT COULD BE POSSIBLE !!

@greggeshelman,"How I learned to ride a bike was by pushing it to a nearby subdivision that had a meandering, dead end road with a bit of slope. My problem was I could not coordinate balancing sideways with pedaling. I pushed the bike to the top of the hill, got on the seat and pushed off *without pedaling*. Made it to the end of the road without falling over. Just like that I had the balance and was able to pedal back to the top, back down then back home.  Cicare helicopters in Argentina have a training device with one of their helicopters mounted it. Each motion can be independently locked or unlocked. A student practices using each control individually and in various combinations. For example the student can  learn exactly how the pedals affect rotation, without any cross-interference from anything else. The student can learn how the collective control moves the helicopter up and down, without being confused by the torque changes twisting it around - which in free flight must be countered by tail rotor and/or throttle changes. Next step would be practicing collective control with free rotation to learn how to coordinate using the pedals with collective to maintain the flight direction. Another step would be locking the movable base to only allow fore/aft movement to learn how to use the cyclic control to move that way. The company says they can train helicopter pilots in half the time because with conventional training a student pilot must master ALL the controls simultaneously and coordinate them. Augusto Ulderico Cicaré built his first engine at the age of 11. At 12 he quit school. He continued building and designing engines, completing his first helicopter in 1958 when he was 21.

@MichaelRWolf,"Inverted control inputs or visual inputs - a body hack to master the backwards bicycle  I'm wondering if you can master the backwards kinematics of the backward bike by throwing another inversion in the sense/control loop.  Two examples:  * Give INVERTED CONTROL INPUT to the bicycle by crossing your arms  * Give INVERTED VISUAL INPUT to your eyes by using mirrors or VR goggles  INVERTED CONTROL INPUT (by crossing arms)  In an exercise to experience the cranial confusion generated by input inversion on a backwards bicycle, I recently crossed my arms while riding my bike.  It definitely felt weird.  It was weird, in the sense that it was inverted.  I've experienced this on a sailboat that uses a tiller (instead of a wheel) to manipulate the rudder.  On these boats, you must move the tiller to the left to make the boat turn to the right.  Most people get this backwards because they are used to thinking about moving (the top of) the steering wheel in the same direction as the intended course correction.  Some folks can overcome this tiller control inversion problem by imagining that they're moving the BOTTOM of a steering wheel.  Aside - Slack lines remind me of the backwards bike problem.  Your brain/body know how to balance on a stationary rail (like a balance beam or fallen tree), but a slack line effectively inverts that by moving counter to the righting force you apply.  Let's look at another steering inversion, this time by steering with the back wheels instead of the front wheels.  Fork lifts do this.  Cars driving backwards do this. Fork lifts overcome the tiller-steering effect by making sure that leftward motion of the wheel directs a rightward movement of the steering wheels.  Car drivers often have trouble driving backwards when they look in the rear-view mirror, but their skills improve when they turn around, and invert their head (and its correlation to their hands).  This leads me to the second inversion in the sense/control loop.  INVERTED VISUAL INPUT (by using mirrors or VR goggles)  Not much more to say here.  If you've ever looked into the video output from a closed-circuit camera, you'll see the inverse of what you're used to in a mirror.  It's as difficult to comb your hair or apply makeup here as it is to ride the backwards bicycle.  Use this visual inversion effect to cancel out the inversion of the backwards bicycle's control inputs.",8년 전,0,

@RadishAcceptable,"sigh  It's not ""just"" the reverse controls dude.  Bikes are designed such that you can roll them downhill without a rider, and it will stay upright untill it veers off in either direction.  The reverse bike won't work that way.  You're going to have to manually compensate for what physics normally do on their own.  You probably noticed that switching to a normal bike didn't take nearly as long to learn.  The reason is because it's simply easier to ride a normal bike, from point zero.",8년 전,0,
@raulsaavedra709,"Knowledge <> understanding is probably not the best analogy. Rather, high-level rules/operational knowledge <> neuro-motor skills. This would apply just as well to playing video games. You can relatively quickly learn the rules so as to ace any tricky set of questions about how to play a video game with a specific control. Yet you might be terrible at effectively playing it in real-time until you practice enough to learn the low-level motor skills and be able to use them reflexively, without having to think about those rules consciously. In the bicycle case the neuro-motor control is made much more difficult because of your own body balance, a hugely difficult thing to control in the first place (ask robotics experts,) plus the conflict with normal-bicycle riding previously learned and made second nature within our balance and movement skills.  The body-balance component is in general not part of what you need to learn or unlearn to play video games at all though. But still, if you ask a professional gamer to play their video game with controls misplaced (in fact, precisely reversed, orientation-wise) it might be quite a challenge for them to become equally competent under the new arrangement. In fact likely that would be much more difficult than learning the game for the first time with no present conflict at the neuro-motor skill level.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

(skip damaged knees from basketball since i was 14)  i can maybe still learn in a snap (maybe much faster even) and get stronger in a snap, but my whole life and self education is somewhat made to support such an outcome.  i do not live as the average person. i do not have a family to care about.  but when thoughts or establishments get in the way, all this ultra learning ability is lost.  for me culture is the barrier. culture is what makes our brain inflexible, more than age. culture is actually a cunning enemy.  if you greatly skip culture, seek new thrills and promote yesterday's thrills to knowledge, as kids do, you can remain, as much as possible, a kid.",8년 전,0,

But, speed readers take groups of words that they ""see"" and their comprehension level goes up. Basically, the program helps widen your peripheral vision and you really don't read at all! You are simply seeing the whole page at a time and feeding the image to your subconscious mind flipping page after page at high rates of speed. Then your recall and comprehension blows through the roof while maintaining reading speeds of 18,000 to 20,000 wpm. It's pretty wild but fascinating. So, I think your son hasn't reached the level where he's feeding all his thought process to his conscious mind. He's not hardwiring rules completely to the conscious level. His brain's plasticity hasn't become rigid yet.  So maybe when you ""click"" back to being able to ride again, you're clicking back and forth between your conscious mind and your subconscious mind. It's kind of like the whole rubbing-your-stomach-in-a-circle-while-patting your-head-with-the-other-hand thing or vice versa. Or, the synchronization of our brain doing Super Brain Yoga (crossing our arms while touching our earlobes). I theorize that we are tapping the subconscious mind when we trick our body to do or feel something that goes against our personal hard-wired natural law. The whole bike thing reminds me of learning how to back up a trailer attached to a vehicle. Initially, the reaction is to turn the wheels like normal driving. But, once you understand the mechanism, it becomes easier. So, I wonder if you concentrate on the gear mechanism and its operative function, if you would bypass the conscious rule that turning right makes the bike go right and left, left. Food for thought!

@DJRD555,"2 years too late,but I feel like this statement shouldn't be definitive. I believe that this bike is so hard to ride because of the number of  inputs that are changing, when you change ""just"" the handle bars you arent changing just the handlebars. You're changing the way you lean to correct, the you have to start peddling and the steering. You're not giving peoples brains enough time to adjust before they over correct and exacerbate their instability their and fail. Their brains aren't stuck they just can't handle the volume of change occurring all at the same time. I bet that if you changed a gamers/pilots/musicians controls for a game they have learnt thoroughly the time it takes for their brains to adjust will be less than 5 tries. E.g. any gamer who played BFBC1 knows they swapped the"" fire"" and aim controls, but it wouldn't take 8 months to adjust, just because its only one input. another would be asking a guitarist to play a lefty flipped guitar, with their strong hand vs asking a guitarist to play their instrument left handed AND lefty flipped.",8년 전,0,

@TReXcuRRy,"The gear ratio is 1:1. You can see it during the close-up. It ""looks"" like the gearing is off because their brain has learned that the moment the bike slightly turns one way, you steer the opposite way to keep it straight. But because it's backwards, the moment it falls one way they instantly steer it the WRONG way some more. And the process repeats itself. So they are stuck in a very quick loop where they accelerate their falling into the first direction the bike fell. It is THEM, actually jamming the handles way too fast. They can't do it slowly because their brain has no time to process that they are doing it the wrong way. Each time the bike falls slightly one way, they are forcing it to fall even faster than way. The gear ratio has nothing to do with this.",8년 전,32,

@Verklunkenzwiebel,"Part of riding a bicycle is something you do unconsciously: counter steering.   You would think that on a normal bike you turn the handlebars to the left if you want to take a left turn, yes? No you don't. For a left turn you actually nudge the handlebars to the right which forces the whole system ( = you and the bicycle) to lean to the left.  Then, when you feel the lean-angle is as it should be, you ease up on the handlebars and let the front wheel choose its path (which is steering slightly to the left, much like a caster wheel on a shopping trolly)  But in the experiment your cognitive mind tries to take over, and instruct your hands to turn the handlebar such and such, because in your reasoning it should be so. But the result is un-balance. Aggravated by the fact that you are looking at the front wheel which increases the complexity of the exercise for its contra-dictionary visual feedback.  I expect that if you start by looking some 100 feet in front of yourself, the transition between normal and backwards would be a lot smoother. The ""click' that enabled you to ride it, might just have been that.  Having said that, I would probably fail to ride this bike myself as well. But in real life riding a 350Kilograms motorcycle I consciously use counter steering all the time. AND I look out in front of me instead of at the frontwheel.

I think a more accurate statement would be ""knowledge ≠ skill"".  Take singing for example.  Everyone knows how to sing, but everyone cannot sing well.  The skill to singing takes years to hone, but the understanding is there as toddlers.  The same concept can be applied to many things, playing piano, drawing, playing videos, etc.  Take Mortal Kombat, everyone wants to do a fatality, but it's often not executed at the first try.  Most people need to do it several times so that they develop the skill,  Anyway, that's just my two cents.  Great video as always.",8년 전,0,

The method of steering is different between them, two wheels means you countersteer, push the left bar to go left and push the right bar to go right. On the sidecar, you don't countersteer, you push the left to go right and right to go left. Switch back and forth a few times between the two and it becomes automatic. Your backwards steering bike is a much bigger adjustment, but I bet if you switch back and forth between the two bikes enough, it would become automatic.",8년 전,0,

@user-tu3it5ct1z,Joe Cooley I dont use the handle bars either at all ( I use to text on my phone when im riding the bike ) but i have tried one of these and went 5 meters before i fell. my trick was to steer it i  the direction it was leaning to go straight.,8년 전,1,
@DJRD555,"the bikes handlebars would turn the opposite way when you lean instead of self correcting like normal. Good idea though, lessens the number of things you need to learn AND means if you make a mistake your hands don't turn it into a bigger mistake",8년 전,1,

If I've never tried the food, my brain will try to imagine what it would taste like so I'll at least get an understanding of it.   Well, I imagined riding your bike, and it worked. Now it didn't just automatically work either. I first imagined riding the bike normally. Normal riding was easy, so I tried to imagine it like yours and I did, I imagined turning the handle left and it would go right. I then did the other way. I tried to ""understand"" what riding this bike would be like, but since i was never good at riding a normal bike either, it seemed a little easier.  Now after getting a feel for what I was supposed to do, I imagined myself going to ride on that bike. I sat on the seat, put my leg on the petal and started riding. I'm going to be honest! That was harder than it sounds. Even in my imagination it took me about 12 tries before I finally got it to work, but I barely moved across the road. You are right this is hard. I tried it a few more times, and like you said, it clicks once, but then I went back to normal bike riding and fell. I'm going to keep trying and if I can imagine it, I can accomplish it!

@SentientDrone,"This is interesting because you may be able to recreate the experience on a smaller scale by playing with a inverted/un-inverted mouse in a PC game. (Joy stick on a console). For my whole life I've played with look up and down inverted. I even have vague memories of being a kid and making the choice. These days, generally speaking, I can use either. But there is a small period of transition where my brain resists which ever is the 'new' direction. Eventually you get this odd sensation, as you say a 'click' and it just starts working as normal. It's remarkably binary.  I've found sometimes focusing on a specific movement can help speed up the swap, really focusing on the fact that moving the mouse down is making my character look down can help light up the appropriate pathway faster.  The over-compensation that is happening in his steering happens too, and I suspect that's why when some people pick up a video game when they're not big gamers, they'll find them self staring at the floor or roof. The inversion is probably wrong for what they expected, and often swapping it will right their ability to control.",8년 전,1,

@buzzmetainformationonomato3880,"This is the best video youve ever done!  Awsome thorough investigation of the subject!  I agree with the comments, at first I believed the backward bike had a more sensitive steering(due to the gear ratios possibly involved).  I dont think thats the case.  When u steer normal it balances the inertial forces and marshals them in the desired direction.  When you reverse the steering, u unbalance those gyroscopic (from the wheels) and inertial components.  You twist your body mass(torque) in an opposite direction than you intend to move.  The entire equation has been set equal to the opposite of your intentions, not just the steering.  Flipping an xbox controller upside down is still learnable because its ratio is fixed and only reversed about the x and y axis'.  As far as the moment that understanding the normal bike ""clicked"", Scientific American a magazine of Nature published an article about the pre-frontal cortex in mice and its role in habit forming.  You do have stored algorithyms for successfull habits.  Scientists can interrupt these pathways and you will fall back to the old, previously held habit.  If unblocked, the mice again remembered the new habit again.",8년 전,73,

That is both true and false at the same time.  True, the handled bars move away from the wheel at 2x the rotational speed of the handle bars, so their relative motion is significant, but in the normal case, there is zero relative motion.  That being said, the rotational velocity relative to the frame is the same in each case.

In the book, he talks about how it takes time for your neurons to physically grow and take paths to learn how to control your muscles. When you switched back to a normal bike, it took some time, but they rewired down a path that they had taken a fork at previously and thus your electric signals were able to flow through your nervous system again with some retraining. I wouldn't say it is that the algorithm is extremely complex for neuro firing moreso that the brain can only load a specific set of training data at one time and that our context switching is very slow.

@gavinmay6949,"It's because your brain uses triggers to tap into an algorithm. For instance, the same thing happens when you try to learn a different keyboard layout (like Dvorak) your hands are in the same position as a normal keyboard so the same triggers of memory are used. Making it virtually impossible to touch type in 2 different keyboard layouts on the same keyboard. However, if you instead used a ergonomic keyboard or a specifically shaped keyboard, your brain would be able to use the different shape to trigger which algorithm to use. Hence it's easier to learn 2 different keyboard layouts on 2 differently shaped keyboards.",8년 전,0,

You've only learned one set of response inputs. You try to ride a backwards bicycle using the same muscle memory and fail until you re-train your brain. What if you go into riding it actively telling your brain, and thinking about the opposite way you would need to respond to correct for the imbalance.  Also, if you wanted to be able to ride both bicycles you would need to actively ride both bikes with some sort of signal to yourself or your brain to switch modes, such as one bike being one colour and another bike being another.

@JustForComments666,"I think the other big problem with the backwards bike is that when you do force to the pedal you are actually applying force to tilt the bike to that particular side. In a normal bike you counter that movement by pulling on the handle on the contrary side, but when you do this on this bike both forces end up going to the same direction, making you loose the balance and fall.  I bet that if you pay more attention when you ride the bikes you'll experience that you do more force with your torso than your hands.  That is probably why it was hard to go back to the normal bike. You were trying to drive it without applying pressure on the handle with the opposite hand of the foor that was pushing, and thus you didn't cancel out the forces and lost balance.  That is also why when people fall with the backwards bike they fall to the opposite direction of the foot that is pushing. On the other hands all the fails you had when you went back to the normal bike where to the same direction of the foot that is pushing.  I mean, sounds like a realistic explanation.",8년 전,1,

I had to learn to go left foot forward (else I would never be able to get back) and at first I would crash a lot and feel like I was starting all over again. One day everything 'clicked' into place and I could then go both ways very easily. I would like to try and learn the backwards bike just for fun.  This video was very enjoyable- thank you.,8년 전,0,

@quadpit,"I am 52, male,  and still remember that ""clicking moment"" when I learned to ride a bike when I was about 4-5 years old. We didn't have a small kids bike, or even training wheels but using an adult girls bike allowed me to learn how to propel and balance the bike. One day after kindergarten I was with my best friend, who already knew how to ride, and I was struggling to keep my balance but determined to learn. After many tumbles I remember that moment when it clicked and I was finally controlling the bike. My friend even remembered because it was like a switch being thrown and I went from crashing to controlling instantly. Your experiment in Amsterdam was probably exactly what happened in my brain but mine was learning the first time. Cool stuff and keep the videos coming.  :-)",8년 전,0,

@tiagotiagot,"Maybe I'm wrong; but I have the feeling I would manage to do it in about 3 days or so...

Because of that I got the feeling I'm good at working out big mechanical motions like this; but everyone else that has tried the backwards bike also thought they would be good at it, so maybe I'm just gonna crash as well.   edit: Though, if it doesn't got a low gear, that might make things a little harder; even in conventional bikes starting at a low gears makes a lot of difference for me.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@SirSnez,"That looks like a lot of fun to try and yes its easy to believe you once its been experienced.  We did something similar that anyone at home who plays FPS games can easily experience the feeling you did, especially when you describe that 'Clicks' back in sensation which is tricky to describe in words.   If you've spent 5, 10 ,20+ years playing with your mouse inverted (or in normal mode) try swapping it around...You'll be lucky to hit anything with close to the same accuracy for interesting enough about the same time period as described above (8 months).   This is based off a Clan pool of Twenty Five,  20 - 40 year old TF2 gamers. Some of us did pickup the new config slightly faster, within 6 months for general game-play but none that did believed we where close to being better or more accurate for competition matches, especially after such a short period of time.   Also when changing back to your normal config, there in a distinctive recovery period felt on the journey to return to your original accuracy and skill level, especially if you leave it changed for a long enough period.   Like experienced in the video you have to unlock the pathway/trigger it to 'click' again and you can actually feel the exact moment it does and almost makes you giggle to yourself as to why was that so hard to unlock when it seems to blatantly easy and obvious.  Granted the 're-learning'/Getting it to 'Click' back is a lot of easier and quicker then first learning a different method; but there is still noticeable effort and skill level impediment involved to return to your unblemished original state.   So unless your doing it for laughs (its pretty funny to watch a team of Pro completely turn Noob with a single click of a config option)....it will seriously hinder your skill level for a period time when you do decide play time is over.",8년 전,0,

@Myst3ry714,"lmao... completely not the same thing dude... you are changing your actual physical orientation, so youre brain automatically knows how to adjust, but instead this changes something compoletely out of your ""feel"" and control... also when riding a bike, your body makes SO many small adjustments to keep balance (shifting weight, turning handle bars, pressure, lean, pedaling, etc.) and all that is habit and happens naturally, but then it gets reversed and you have no idea what these movements that you have always known well, do something different now....",8년 전,0,

When I was in high-school, something called the ""Rip Stick"" came out. Basically it was a two wheel skateboard in two parts. To turn, right for example, you tilt your front foot forward and your back foot backwards. Vice versa for turning left. I rode the Rip Stick for about a year before I tried to ride my skate board again. And when I tried my skateboard again, I couldn't ride it. I kept falling off. It felt extremely stiff. It took a while again before I could ride it good enough to ollie for example. Just recently, I tried riding the Rip Stick again, and I can't ride it, no where near as good as during that year.

@ArcherWarhound,"What you described about ""switching"" between algorithms, or neural pathways, made me think of the linguistic/sociology term ""code switching."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching)  My wife and in-laws all grew up overseas and are therefore multi-lingual; when conversing they often jump between shared languages to use either the simplest and most efficient expression or the one that's denotations and connotations most fully communicate their thoughts and feelings at the moment.      The reason your bike experiment made me think of this was that my sister-in-law once experienced a situation similar to you being stuck with the wrong algorithm in Amsterdam.  When she was very small she and her older sister were at Sunday school or a Mother's Day Out thing or etc during a short term stay here in the US, and she slowly became disturbed and then terrified when none of the other children or the teachers who came to find out what was the matter could understand her: she was at a complete loss to understand why no one could understand her because she could understand them perfectly, and was answering their questions in what she thought was perfectly understandable speech.  Terrified and bewildered she bolted away from everyone around her to go find her sister because her sister could always understand her even when others couldn't.  Her sister did understand her and told why one one else could: she was speaking Spanish.     Her brain had interpreted something about the situation as a cue that she needed to speak Spanish, but because it was a completely unconscious switch she was stuck, unable to understand why no one could understand her.  Her subconscious told her that Spanish was correct in this setting and not being understood created cognitive dissonance she didn't know what to do with.  Finding her sister and speaking to her (they both spoke all the same languages) allowed her brain to get unstuck and begin using English again.",8년 전,0,

@steamsteam6607,I think you tried to oversell your idea here. Certainly there are patterns your mind likes to follow but you can learn different things and apply the correct one for different situations. Your brain isn't as rigid as you imply I really think you just suck at coordination exercises or faked it to sell your idea.,8년 전(수정됨),1,
@steamsteam6607,Knowledge doesn't mean ABILITY. Just because I understand a complicated drum solo doesn't mean I can play it. You can't really know anything if you don't understand it. If you don't know how the bike operates differently from another bike and what change you'd have to do to compensate you don't have the KNOWLEDGE. You have your semantics all wrong. You try to imply some difference between knowledge and understanding here which isn't relevant. Of course there's a difference between knowing that electricity is dangerous and understanding why. I don't see how such an equation applies here.,8년 전(수정됨),0,

@TonecrafteLuthiery,"Interesting that his kid could ride the bike relatively quickly. I wonder if the 'algorithm' in an adult bike riders brain as so deeply rooted and reinforced, that they simply prevent new neural pathways from being able to overwrite the orignal algorithm. In the form of a question, why do you think the brain doesn't simply ignore the old algorithm, as it would when learning the mechanics of say, operating a forklift, or learning the controls to a video game? Your brain doesn't prevent you from learning the controls of Grand Theft Auto because you've been learning the controls for Call of Duty. I find it interesting that the brain recognizes that you already know how to ride a bike as an adult, and makes it more difficult to learn the same task in a different way. Maybe it is a mechanism utilized to save 'storage space' in your brain. It could feasibly see the new information as unnecessary, and disregard it to save space for more important motor skills. That would be strange, because it would seem to mean that your brain can distinguish between useful, and irrelevent or redundant information despite your conscious efforts to root those motor skills. I'm not a neuroscientist, so my speculation is as useless as any other, but it's interesting to ponder the science behind a child's neuroplasticity, or in or in this case, the rigidity of an adult brain.",8년 전,1,

@moiquiregardevideo,"Somebody wrote: How is this difficult when riding in a straight line if only the turning is different?  My answer: Because any bicycle is almost ""impossible"" to get stable. The demonstration with inverted pendulum show how chaotic this kind of system is.  Chaos here mean that any microscopic change, way to small to be measured, can have dramatic impact on the behavior of a system.  How I learned: You just forgot how difficult it was to ride your first bicycle. I remember my first bicycle with the tiny wheels added to the back making learning even harder. I finally understood by trying an abandoned bike, no tire, way to big for me. The trick was to exceed a minimum speed, where the bike appear to want to remain rolling in straight line.  The ""opposite day"" - right == left and vice versa: For motorcycle, the speed of self stabilizing is about 30 mph. From 30 mph to 65 mph, the handle work in reverse direction : you push one the right handle (or pull the left one), exactly like you would to turn left, and the motorcycle lean slowly toward your right side and both you and the motorcycle start moving toward right lane.  I don't know what happen past 65 mph because it is illegal to exceed that speed! I would never break (brake) the law!",8년 전,1,

So we run that on autopilot (if u will), and the steering is calculated and a new algorithm can be added and performed!

We're are then gonna compare how fast and good, those BMX riders learn bicycling on a backwards bicycle (which the blacksmith at our university build), compared to the novice riders.  Our hypothesis is that we expect the experts BMX riders to learn the reversed bike faster than the novice riders, since the expert riders have a better balance ability in general (we are confirming this via some other testing aswell)  But, it's very all interesting since theres some theory called ""Negative transfer learning"" which may conflict with our hypothesis.  Anyway we did some pilot testing, and i can tell that after 1 hour roughly i (im 23 years, and used to bicycle from my home to school, since i learnt how to ride a normal bike) learnt how to ride the reversed bike. It wouldn't be as straight, but i could more or less bicycle for as long as i wanted straight ahead given i had the space. I could also turn around in a somewhat small circle..

@sixten7920,"When I was in high school I learned to ride a bike backwards, in that I can sit on the handlebars facing the back of the bicycle and ride it the direction the bike was supposed to go. It only took me a few days to get it down. You have to pedal backwards from what you're used to, but that wasn't the most difficult part. The difficult part was learning to steer the bicycle by leaning and turning your entire body, because you're actually sitting on the handlebars. To this day I can jump on any bicycle and ride it backwards, turning in circles, and riding it for however long I please, then turn around and ride the same bike forward and normal with no issues.  I know that's different still from this, but I think it's plenty similar enough. I think riding a unicycle would be more difficult than this backwards steering bicycle. I think if you had put training wheels on this bike for a short while, you'd have learned a ton quicker.

I would place my feet on the front axle and it felt an entirely natural way to steer as I free-wheeled downhill. Imagine my horror, a few years later, when attempting my first take off in an airplane, to find the inputs 'reversed' from my 'logical' expectations - I think I nearly touched both sides of the 45 metre wide runway! A decade on, and by then a light airplane instructor myself, I'd probably gotten the hang of it when, to my further horror, I was given a front-seat ride in a weight shift microlight. Here the 'simple' nosewheel steering was exactly as per the go-kart of my youth! In fairness, the  weight shift's pedals performed no function in flight. I guess the reason a conventional airplane's pedals work in the 'sense' that they do is twofold: i) It negates the need to cross the rudder cables over from side to side and ii) It is logical in the sense that any side-slip sensation automatically provokes a self-centering (in the seat) by 'propping' oneself up with the appropriate leg!",9년 전,0,

@DatuDieter,"It is not about knowledge or understanding. It is about automatization.Riding a bike is a complex thing and when it is automatized, it is controlled in a diffent part of the brain, the cerebellum, than the thinking and contious controlling, which is done in the cortex. The cortex is very smart and can do almost anything, but it is slow while the cerebellum is fast and automatized.This is why you can do complex things very smooth, because they are saved as an autonomous program, that functions without thinking, like walking, running, swimming etc. programmed by thousands of repetitions. When these programs run, and then the slow cortex wants to interfere, the system collapses, because the signals from the cortex come much too late. This is what happened to you on the backwards bike. The system collapses and he falls.Through many repitions (around 5000, depending on the complexity), you must create a new program, that then runs autonomous from the cerebellum again. That took you 8 months, his son 2 weeks.If you want to change an autonomous program, let us say to refine or change your technique, his has to be done in slow motion, so that the cortex can controll the movement until it is then stored in the cerebellum again. If you execute it too fast, the cerebellum will take over again and you will do the old techniques, because the cortex then is too slow to give the correct signals at the right time. The problem here is that you can not really ride the backwards bike slow. This is why it took so long. Then it took you 20 minutes to reactivate the ""old"" program of riding a bike. If you would now continue to ride the normal and the reverse bike every day, the time for the switching of those two programs will get shorter, until he has both programs paralell, so he can ride either of the bikes randomly. The programs will run at demand. Then you  have established a second program, that did not overwrite the first but is paralell available.I teach Modern Arnis, a martial art with complex movements, of which some are autonomous ""programs"". Some very similar to the other, but still different. So I deal with and teach the above problematic every day.",9년 전,7,

@PreVaylMusic,"Dieter Knüttel i agree. i also want to add to what your saying by stating the physical aspect of turning the handle bars the opposite direction when your body is leaning to the right for a right turn (for example), does not allow for you to control your body weight and balance easier since the right handle bar would be further from the core of your body, which would make it harder to balance. Your stabilizer muscle must work harder to compensate. When you are in a normal bike and you take a right turn the right handle bar comes closer to your body, and your weight is more on the right side and therefore gives you more leverage even for those micro small moments of balancing because your right hand is now closer to the core for balance and doesnt require such strong stabilizer muscles . i hope what im saying makes sense.",8년 전,0,
@PreVaylMusic,Dieter Knüttel another thing. for him to learn quickly he would need training wheels first and or someone hold the back of the bike seat like a parent does when you first learn the regular bike. that would slow down the process​ to allow him to remap the automation.,8년 전,0,

@xicledragon,"Hello Destin, I Have some personal anecdote to add to this. I'm 31yrs old and have been driving since I was 14. I got a job a couple years ago at a glass factory and we drive modified fork trucks backwards while facing backwards. The steering is opposite of a car. Learning to understand the directional aspects of it and make it a no thought process only took a few weeks. During this time I drove to work everyday and home. Now, while at work on these trucks I drive and have had to make emergency reactions correctly and I've succeeded. Other coworkers have mentioned they have had issues at times while in their cars almost turning the wrong way after leaving work. I've never experienced this. So, I think while doing both actions in conjunction with each other will allow you to drop the mental bias or at least allow co-occupancy.",9년 전,0,

The only thing close to this in recent years happened with 2 cars I owned, both manual. One had a light clutch and heavy steering, the other a heavy clutch with light steering. It only took a minute or 2 to adjust between the 2 cars, but that short time was scary. If I got in at different times it wasn't the same as bad as going from one car directly to the other.

@All10Directions,"I found this very recognizable. I intensely play certain technical videogames that allow players to do tricks that consist of multiple actions, that can combine with other tricks consisting of multiple actions, creating new tricks, that again can also be combined with tricks consisting of multiple tricks. It's something that requires tons of practice and repetition to get the muscle memory going and when practicing new tricks it often happens that I accidentally do an old one by default. After teaching myself a new pattern it becomes normal and I start the process of switching between the 2 patterns. Eventually it stops feeling like just a thing I do with muscle memory, the feeling of replaying a pattern I learned, and I'm able to make slight adjustments on the fly, turning it into a skill. It opens up a feeling of control and a heightened form of perception, allowing for more adjustments. It has taught me a lot about how I learn and makes me wonder how far I can go given enough time and attention goes into it. It has even affected my perception when playing the piano, because I noticed that in terms of thinking I was used to going faster and could use that to push myself forward in that regard as well. I want to see how far I can go, and how inhuman I can get when doing certain things because I started to believe that there are no limits, only plateau's.",9년 전,0,

Iv found people that cant even walk the bike, and resort to just picking it up to move it!  There are for sure some strange dynamics going on, because the second your butt leaves the seat, the bike is uncontrollable, and there is also some stability issues at speed (very little backlash in mine).  It is completely ridable with practice, but it will never be right as it fools with normal balance and riding techniques.

@ajkelly451,"This is really awesome.  But I do want to add something that it made me think about.  I think the backwards bicycle is by nature more difficult to ride.  Think about it, when you are riding a normal bicycle, to turn left, your left elbow goes out further and your right arm extends straight.  This has a net effect of leaning the center of gravity left compared to the bike axis.  Even if this is only a slight effect, this helps you turn, both left and right, in a more stable fashion.  Now flip to the ""Backwards"" bike.  When you go to turn left, your right elbow has to go out and your left arm extends, giving you a slight lean to the right, but you are trying to turn left.   My point is that, even if this is a subtle effect, this could have a dramatic effect on the stability of riding the bike.  However, thinking about it further, there may be a destabilizing factor in trying to ride the bike forward.  Every time your balance gets a little bit off, you have to correct it, but since your elbow is slightly off in the direction of your balance, you have to overcorrect more than you would have to previously.   So is it easier to ride straight being fully trained on the backwards bike and easier to turn being fully trained on a normal bike?  This is all so weird..  Lol",9년 전,0,

When i play first person games is the oposite, the forward mouse movement make the camera move up. At first it feel wrong but i learn to switch instantly between the two, of course is much easy that learn to control the bike and i was a kid.

In my shop, no prints are ""correct because us Welders have come up with better, more efficient ways of completing the job.

My dad taught me to drive on his old Mazda pickup truck, with a manual transmission, and I drove his truck for probably about 2 years before I bought a car with an automatic transmission. It took me nearly a week before I stopped stomping around with my left foot to find the clutch (occasionally hitting the brake pedal 😁), even though I knew there was no clutch, and I kept telling myself that, it still took me a week of driving until my brain finally changed that hard-wired ""truth"" that I had to hit the clutch in order to drive. Driving a stick shift is not nearly as involved of an algorithm as riding a bike, so it didn't take me nearly as long to ""unlearn,"" but it was still frustrating at times, feeling the need to explain to people at an intersection that ""I really can drive, I promise!

I read as many different voices and styles of literature as I could, learned about humor and comedy, played thousands of flash games, absorbed hundreds of different ways to make crafts and art. however, I was lazy and never got good at major motor movement coordination. and also learning how to be sorta good at thousands of things makes you really bad and being good at any one thing. but it still makes it easier to pick up new things.  you thought crochet was a worthless endeavor? well turns out you can use those 'thing goes in hole, thing goes in next hole' pathways to make yourself really fast at restocking shelves. and you can feel it happening, too. especially with arts and crafts. i can feel my brain falling back on it's old artist's-problem-solving-skills to try and tackle every day problems. When those don't work, i falls back on everything I learned from neopet's impressive array of re-skinned flash games.   also, they had those reverse-bikes at the state fair once and it's good to know it's a total rip off.",9년 전,0,

Science is the same no matter what culture, region, or gender you are. We all come to the same conclusion of a scientific truth.

I mean, I know adults who've lived and worked in Germany for decades, having long, complex conversations in German every day. And they still make grammatical errors regularly. And almost all of them have a noticeable accent when they speak. Also, the kinds of errors that children and adult learners make are different, which shows that they are thinking about the language in different ways as they learn it.

@gnamp,"It's always going to be laborious if you rely on mere practice and muscle memory development. I learned to ride one of these in 20 minutes- no joke. There is a trick to it though. The secret to picking up this skill super quickly is to treat it like a new type of vehicle altogether. Think of the handlebars as 'pointers' rather than 'turners' ie push your right hand forward to go to the right and left hand forward to go left. Make it truly logical. The old bike stuff will spring out if you lose concentration while you're still getting used to it. It's like inverting the y axis on a game controller. It seems counterintuitive to pull a joystick back to make an aeroplane climb when back often means 'down' in so many other games. Keep the control ideas distinct and you'll nail it quickly. My grandfather was pulled from the crowd and asked to try a bicycle with a semi-rubber frame when the circus came to town. He knew it was possible as he'd seen the clown do it seconds before. He quickly realised that if you just push forward so it won't collapse, you can treat it like a normal bike. Sure it's unnatural and not remotely straightforward but you'll take to things like these more quickly if you come up with things that help the unusual make sense.",9년 전,1,

@rickmaida4027,"My guess is that the reason it's so hard to learn to ride this bicycle has more to do with the inversion of the body's rotational momentum on the vertical axis through the center of gravity and direction of displacement of the center of gravity than the inversion of the steering itself. And this is why it is so hard also to make the ride stable. I don't think it's only a problem or function of brain plasticity. It's probably part of the reason why it is easier for a child to learn to ride this bike as well.  When you ride a bicycle, part of what keeps the bicycle straight up is the body's contortions about the vertical axis. This how riders can remain straight up at zero speed (at a red light - I got to be pretty good at this), balancing by turning the front wheel left and right without moving forward or backward. This is also why you have to be careful when turning your head back to check for cars before making a turn, it throws you off balance half the time, especially if you are going slow.",9년 전,0,

There are things I have the knowledge about how to do them but my brain lacks the basic understanding to put them in practice. Because we can't do the things we used to do automatically, we must retrain the brain which could take the rest of our lives. This becomes the frustrating part of having a CNS issue. It is difficult to understand how we can understand something that we had mastered long ago but not be able to execute on it.

@DoveWrestler,"+Coleman Adamson Free expansion is a gas flowing from one container to another without any input energy (free). It is significant scientifically in in these conditions, the temperature of the gas does not increase or decrease. This supports the laws of thermodynamics, and poses no problem to space travel.   The SR-71 had problems with jet fuel leaking not because a suitable gasket material could not be made, but because of the design of the vehicle (no sealed vessel for fuel) and the significant expansion of the titanium skin and frame once up to supersonic speeds in atmosphere. This heat was caused by aerodynamic friction. The ISS experiences none of this. The leaking fuel was an issue because the SR-71 on each mission had to transition from low heating to high heating and back to low heating on every mission. The ISS has and will flown only a single mission. It has spent 100% of its operational life in a predictable near static environment (less radiation while in the shadow of the sun). The SR-71 in fact could have been designed to not leak fuel, but it would have cost performance (flight time between re-fuelling) given the added weight.  There are airlocks between the modules. They were required to build the station, and can be used in emergency, or any restructuring of the station. The American of the ISS will last until 2020 before needing extensive work to extend their use. This may or may not happen.   A small puncture of a seal, or the outer skin of the station would not lead to immediate catastrophe. a 1"" diameter hole would leak air at 409 litres per minute, and it would take 37 hours to empty the station assuming no drop in pressure and that no air is added from tanks. The difference in pressure inside to outside the station is approximately 14 PSI. A 2L PET beverage bottle is designed to contain a difference of 55 PSI, and will usually go until over 100 PSI before failing. The energy transferred to the ISS from a re-supply vessel docking rounds up to zero.   I have seen a ISS shaped object travel across the sky in the location and at the speed predicted by orbital mechanics based on the data given by the various space agencies responsible for maintaining the ISS. The size in the sky is also consistent with an ISS sized object. The altitude of the object can be calculated using only the time it takes to go around the earth (approximately).  I can not tell you with certainty that what I have seen is the ISS, but I have seen an ISS shaped ISS sized object in the location of the ISS travelling at the speed of the ISS.  Thanks for this by the way. I don't often get to think about science day to day.",9년 전,1,
@DoveWrestler,"***** The SR-71 was designed to fly higher and faster. It was optimised for high altitude, high speed flight. It operated poorly at low altitude and low speed. Taking off from a runway unfortunately involves both low altitude and low speed. The design team sacrificed this capability to maximise its performance at altitude. Because of the long flight times involving multiple re-fuelings (at speed) during a single mission, an increase in range between in-flight re-fuelings provided an increased capacity for reconnaissance farther into ""enemy"" territory. It was a cold war spy toy, of course it wasn't the most practical aircraft.  I'm glad to help you figure this stuff out. ",9년 전,0,
@colemanadamson5943,"Michael Frederiksen Wow you are arrogant. Tell me, are rockets ""optimized"" (spelling corrected) for high altitude and speed?   Because the propellant tanks have to be sealed ON THE GROUND (different from the Blackbird) AND in space -- which is a MUCH more difficult thing being the speed and temperatures are MUCH greater and cover a MUCH larger spectrum.   What unknown material that came from fantasyland is sealing those tanks that they didn't use for the Blackbird? Or retrofit them with? And why not use them in the SR71?   Aha!  Gotcha.  ",9년 전,0,
@DoveWrestler,"Rockets stages are optimised for ambient air pressure. The first stage for takeoff usually uses a fuel like kerosene as the tanks are small and the engines are powerful helping to lift the entire fully fueled vehicle off the ground. Upper stages have less mass to accelerate and require less thrust and often use liquid hydrogen for its excellent efficiency though the tanks are much bigger as hydrogen, even in liquid form is not very dense. Once the vehicle reaches orbit, further stages often use very low thrust engines (to save weight) and often use hypergolic fuels for their shelf life and the simplicity of restarting the engine. Optimisation would involve using the least fuel for a specific payload, but it is often cheaper to use proven designs in current production even if they have more capacity than necessary.   The tanks for the SR-71were built into the structure of the fuselage and wings. The complicated shape combined with the expansion and contraction of sustained high speed atmospheric flight made leak-proof fuel tanks difficult. Rockets are designed around the size and shape of the fuel tanks. Some designs have tbe engines and the interstage attached directly to the tanks, others have tanks fit inside a cylinder. Expansion of the metal elongates and widens the stage. This ks expected and calculated for.   As I said before, the difference in ambient pressure from florida to the ISS is about 14 PSI.",9년 전,0,
@DoveWrestler,"The cryogenic fuels on rockets actually do leak on the pad, and through out the flight. This is known as boil off. On most rockets, insulation keeps this to a minimum (like the orange tank on the space shuttle), but some un-insulated tanks (like the Satun V) lose significant amounts of fuel. Hydrogen is not a viable fuel type for long duration missions (such as mars) for this reason. Fuel tanks are welded together on rockets. Plumbing is either welded on, or threaded on. The material gaskets are made of (when required) depends mainly on the content of the tank, specifically the temperature. Liquid oxygen and hydrogen are rather cold.",9년 전,0,

@DoveWrestler,"+Coleman Adamson Sorry, wrote the last comments waiting in line at Ikea. You want to know what material the gaskets on various rockets are made of? I think there are a few things you aren't understanding. Lets take the SSME for example. It reacts liquid hydrogen with liquid oxygen in a combustion chamber. You might think any gasket would have to deal with the heat of combustion, or the heat of travelling at 1500 ft/s (at max q), but all the plumbing is cooled to the temperatures of the fuel or oxidizer contained, which are −297.33 °F and −423.17°F. The difficulty in designing a gasket for cryogenic fuel systems is finding a material that operates at these low temperatures. I don't know the exact gaskets they used, but you can order a gasket online that is rated for these temperatures. I found one made of ePTFE which is related to Gore-Tex. Non-cryogenic fuel plumbing is easier as the fuel is usually 70°F.  The difficulty of sealing the tanks on the SR-71 was not primarily the range in temperatures of the gasket material, but rather the warping of the shape of the tanks. This is because portions of the cavity formed by the shape of the airplane were sealed in and filled with fuel rather than installing sealed tanks within the cavity. This is a common design in aircraft, but because of the high performance nature of the vehicle, it lead to fuel leaking before the skin of the aircraft got to operational temperature. As I said before, The SR-71 could have been designed with sealed fuel tanks, but the extra weight would have deceased the the length of missions.   The reason the SR-71 was fuelled in flight right after takeoff was because its engines operate poorly at low speed and the plane was launched without full fuel tanks. With a long enough runway, it could have launched with full fuel tanks.",9년 전,0,

@GuyMonochrome,"This is just a theory, but I think it's related to how you see things. It's believed that when you're a baby, the world you see is upside-down, but as you grow, you become more coordinated and your vision suddenly ""flips."" Kind of like when you take a magnifying glass and move it farther away from you, the vision flips.  There was a study that showed a man who wore upside-down goggles for months. He was uncoordinated, and tried to do everyday tasks without taking his goggles off. Suddenly, there was a click, and he could suddenly see upside-down. When he stopped wearing the goggles some time later, his vision was upside-down, so just like Destin and the regular bike, boom, he ""forgot"" how to see. Some time later, of course, he got his regular vision back (I don't recommend doing the experiment though).  I theorize that our sense of coordination can also be flipped the same way with our sight, and how we can forget how to do something normally. I never learned how to ride a bike, so I think if I were to learn how to ride the flipped over bike, it would be the same as riding a normal bike (I'd have a hard time learning the regular one, though).

@SalahEddineH,"+ben andmesser I think it's because bikes ALWAYS turn, even if you don't move the handlebar at all, because the bike isn't perfectly vertical at any point. When you're riding a regular bike, you unconsciously do tiny corrections to the steering to put it back on track, but since the steering is inverted, trying to correct it makes it immediately worse, so it looks like they're turning on purpose. It's very hard to stop yourself from correcting the direction in the way you think is right. And the more you're experienced with a bike, the stronger these reflexes are, which makes it harder to stop them. I think if he's been betting people for so long, someone would've thought of ""not turning"", otherwise. Cheers!",9년 전,0,

When other guitarists come round and go ""oh can I play on your guitar"" it's very much the same effect - they know in theory how to play one but their coordination is completely backwards and they get quite frustrated even trying to make basic chord shapes and strumming them. I can play a right handed guitar ""hendrix style"" (left handed position with the strings upside down) because that only requires transposing the notes, but just like my right handed friends I can not for the life of me coordinate my hands on a right handed guitar. On drums however I find it much easier to flip between left/right handed, but I think this is because your limbs are still doing the same basic actions - once again you're ""transposing"" movements rather than completely changing the way you're coordinated. It would be more like a bike where the handlebars were behind you, but you still turned them the same way to steer.",9년 전,1,

@jasonebeling6347,"I liked it. it was good, but what you said about a childs brain having more plasticity, is not necessarily true.      studies show that adults are capable of learning just as quick as children are,  and that ""physical age"" (meaning the brain is 80 years old,  NOT,  he thinks like an 80 year old) has little to do with how fast ""adults learn something"".    You said your child learned in 2 weeks what it took you 8 months to learn.  Your child is 3 years old He doesn't have a life time of life experiences to draw from.  School, work, training, and just living, are constantly pummeling your brain every time you got on that bike. He's only been around 3 years and a good year of that depending on what studies you read he don't even remember,  He doesn't know that if we wrecks he could break his neck, bleed out, be off a year from work, not have income, maybe be homeless, or the thousands of other possibilities that you know and have to deal with on top of trying to learn something new. He knows if he wrecks it might hurt, but he'll get up and try again.  theres a lot less risk he has to take than you. when you think about that on top of learning a new language, going back to college,  getting your GED at age 40 and so on, Adults fair pretty well in the learning game!!!  but  it is a good piece on brain pathways and conditioning and such.   i really enjoyed it!!

If my memory still serves me correctly I remember a psych experiment from my college days, circa early 1970's that shows the learning and unlearning process.  The image on our retina is upside down as is in cameras, so our brain somehow knows to turn it right side up.  Experimenters fitted subjects with glass that turned the subjects view upside down.  After a period, not sure how long, the brain 'righted' the upside down image.

@mantisnomore9091,"To balance while coasting (but not pedaling), can't you just get on the bike facing backwards, close your eyes, and pretend like you are going forward?      Which brings us to my related question:  If you turned the rear wheel around (left end of axle on right side of bike, and right end of axle on left side of bike), then did the same for the pedal crank, you would have a bike that you could pedal backwards.  And it would move backward when you pedaled.  This shouldn't be too hard to learn to ride, because to maintain balance, you would still turn the handlebars in the same direction that the bike leans.  But you would be backing up on the bike (which is what I thought the title of this vid meant in the first place.)      Now, if you were to do this ""mirror-imaging"" of the rear axle and pedal crank on your inverted-steering bike, you would have a bike which, when you mount it facing backwards, all appendages move in the same directions as you would move them when riding a normal bicycle in the normal direction.  How difficult do you think it would be to learn to ride such a bicycle while facing backward?  (Thanks.)

Since our eyes are used to seeing bikes where the wheel and handle bars in unison, our brain watches the wheel and handle bars move in opposite directions, causing the illusion of the wheel turning way too fast in the opposite direction.

@guy3fire,"It is not backward brain, but rather engineering issues of which this man is not aware.   //  Huge Engineering Misunderstanding. These engineers didn't realize that bicycles have an ""invisible"" technology that is overlooked. The forward angle of the front wheel mounting fork and the additional bend forward of the fork, both are essential elements in a bicycle's stability. Additionally, the tilting of the bicycle as it corners adds to the bicycle's stability.  So, on a normal bicycle, as the bicycle is weighted down with a rider and moving forward, there is a natural tendency as the bicycle starts leaning in one direction as the start to fall over, the front tire will automatically tilt a little tilt toward the tilt and turn toward the tilt, pushing the front tire and with it the rear tire in alignment back under the center of center of gravity, which once again causes the bicycle to be stable, albeit, in a slightly different direction.  Thus, when riding a bicycle at a few miles an hour or more, the only thing needed to steer the bicycle is shifting your weight slightly to either side, while no hands are needed on the handlebars.  On a normal bicycle, because of that forward angle on the steering mechanisms, the pulling of the steering mechanism causes the rider’s weight to automatically be moved slightly into the turn and away from the other side of the bicycle.  This automatic reweighting and balancing of the bicycle inhibits the weight from falling to the outside of the turn, which causes it to fall over.  On the other hand, if your muscles pull in to one side, naturally shifting your weight to that side, but it is the opposite side to which your weight should be shifting to give stability, there is always a natural tendency to loose stability and loose balance and tumble over.",9년 전,0,

@squeegie-beckenheim,"I think it was very astute to compare this to language learning. I'm a linguist, so obviously I want to compare everything to language, but... I can't help but see some uncanny differences. I often feel like my brain has two modes: English (my native language), and Non-English. And the weird and frustrating part is that Non-English seems like it naturally only has one ""slot."" There only seems to be room for one language at a time.  I began learning Spanish at 15. A bit late for language acquisition, not to mention I didn't take it super seriously. However, the further I went, the more dedicated I became, and eventually I reached my B2 level of Spanish: high level intermediate, confident and comfortable in a variety of situations, if a bit shy, slow, and with a wonky accent. Then I stopped speaking it for a couple years. Obviously, that will cause a decline in language ability, but I could still understand the majority of Spanish, and muddle along in basic conversations.  However, the point where my Spanish-speaking ability rapidly declined was when I started learning German. At first, learning German was gnarly because every time I went to say something, it came out in Spanish. Try to say the word ""warum?"" Invariably it came out of my mouth as ""por qué."" In fact, I would try to speak German, and accidentally say Spanish words that, up until that instant, I had totally forgotten. But I knuckled down, kept studying, and... Now I can't speak Spanish. I tried to respond to someone speaking to me in Spanish yesterday, and I said ""ja"" instead of ""sí."" If I try, really hard, I can get my thoughts across in Spanish, but whenever I get to a conjunction like ""and"" or ""but,"" I drop out of Spanish and into German. It feels like what I imagine Destin felt when he was unable to ride the regular bike again.  My only solution so far is to study both at once and force my brain to let them coexist. I've stopped using English-German flashcards and I'm trying to use Spanish-German ones. I study, read, and listen to Spanish and German back-to-back.

And also look at the construction of those two different types of bikes, the first one presented has wide steering and the child's bike has it narrow and high, the balance of weight changes much in those two cases.

What you don't understand is that you don't need higher order functions to execute higher function problem solving, or deep understanding of a problem. The difference between Destin and his son, is that Destin had to brute force a new reflex even though he understood the basic mechanics. Just like a child has to do when first learning to ride a bike.  Knowing how the bike works, and grasping how it works is not necessary to understand how to ride it. A prime example of this is everyone on a bike, how many of them know that it is Torque keeping them from not falling over, how many of them have a deep understanding of how their center of mass on a bicycle affects said torque, and how it affects the bike in general. Less than 1%  That said, you don't need to understand how something works to be able to use it. It's like a computer, most people don't know how a computer works, most people don't even know what electricity is. Yet they use it to their advantage, how many people know how a Monitor works, and how many knows the difference between a CRT Monitor and a LCD Monitor.

@ExcelutionNero,"+bighoov1  Um, the reason why people can't ride the bike is because people were trained to ride the bike properly...     When you ride a bike, you use your sense of balance and adjust accordingly. These people when riding a bike, react to their loss of balance by steering the handle, and because they were taught without reverse handling, they reacted in the same way they do with a normal bike, thus they can't ride the bike. Reflex isn't quite right, but it's something like a rote reaction.  Correct me if I'm wrong, that's just my proposition.",9년 전,0,

@sammyfromsydney,"Destin I hope you read this. Your experiment is fascinating but your findings are SO badly flawed. First of all, all you proved is that it took YOU 8 months to get it. You didn't prove young vs old plasticity. I suspect you're correct that adults would have a harder time learning but that it's not as pronounced with other adults. Some people are just more gifted with co-ordination. Secondly I suspect that counter-intuitively it may have been easier if you'd switched back and forth between normal and reverse bikes while learning to ride the reverse one. I fly remote control aircraft and I fly ""mode 2"", which means rudder is left/right on the left stick, throttle up/down on the left stick, aileron left/right on the right stick and elevator up/down on the right stick (which most closely mimicks an aircraft's controls)...but most people in Australia (and therefore at my flying club) fly ""mode 1"" which means the throttle and elevator are swapped compared to mode 2. HOWEVER I do know people who can fly both modes and can move between the two pretty much flawlessly and are therefore able to instruct others by passing the radio. These days you can do it with separate radios so that each can be a different mode but that use to be the only way to teach someone to fly r/c. This doesn't involve balance but it does require the same real time coordination that is involved in riding a bike. Flying r/c aircraft is usually learnt in adulthood. I'm not flying as often as I use to but I'd bet you could find someone like that at one of your local r/c clubs - there are more of them in America than Australia.",9년 전,0,
@BANG1681,"Right, so I take it you didn't account for weight transfer on a device that requires balance...

After about 50ft i can take my hands off the fork and continue riding while peddling and not have to bother touching the handle bar,...... now yeah there's a few limitations like not being able to make sudden/abrupt maneuvers but that wasn't the question :)",9년 전,0,

But I would like to suggest that riding a bike is a great example of automatized knowledge and it's not really about understanding.  The brain has different parts, and our conscious mind - which is probably in the cortex - can think flexibly, but slowly. Whereas the part of the brain that steers bikes - the ""motor system"" - is a lot lower in the brain and it is not nearly as flexible.  The motor system works automatically and is hard-wired.  That hard-wiring can be modified with lots of practice, as any unicyclist can tell you.  So to ride the backwards bike Destin had to create new hard-wiring in his motor system. Neurons probably had to reconnect which takes time.  He had to make his reflexes automatic. This is a very different kind of understanding than a conscious understanding of scientific or social knowledge.",9년 전,0,

Maybe the part where you have to controll your body could be a bit tricky for me, because I am only used to use my brain and fingers. But to fully relearn old routines in a new way is the art of staying in progress if you want to be good in gaming. You always have to adapt either a different input or a different situation. I played for almost five years with the same key configurations (for one game). I completely changed it. So that not even the keys I used at least 10 times a minute werent on their old position. It took me 5 hours to relearn the new keys and almost 2 weeks till I was perfectly confident.   But what I want to say is. If you cant reimagine things while you are gaming. You cant be sucessfull, because you will fall into routines that my harm you on others skill levels. May you practice things you need to know if you are playing against a bad/ decent player, you must not play against good players. Or if you are good and you want to be very good. You need to fully unlearn everything you know to relearn it in such a different way that all good players will be suprised of what you are doing.   It's kinda natural to us. But I would love to see a way of living with it. So our parents teach us this stuff and it becomes really natural. I think the progress humanity would do, would accelerate in an insane way.",9년 전,0,

@alik713,"Dear Destin. This was the first video I saw on your channel, and I was mesmerized by it. (Btw, kudos on truly entertaining format!)  However, after a few days of on and off thinking about your ""bicycle"" experiment, I just had an epiphany.  Your approach was flawed.  The first thing anyone does (or should, at least) when they learn to ride a bike is balancing. That is how I taught my step-daughter (inside of an hour). But in your experiment, instead of learning how to balance the ""backward"" bicycle, you instead tried to RIDE the silly thing. Of course, that was met with predictable results. Along the same lines, when you tried to jump back upon a regular bike after having cemented ""this is how riding a bicycle works"", you were met with failure once more, simply because the balancing of the two is truly truly different.  Here's my challenge to you. Let's meet, and we'll put my theory in practice. I bet I can master the ""backward"" bike (let me be conservative here) within a day.  Sincerely,  Al  P.S.

@6Twisted,"Another good example is using inverted controls in games. After some practice you get good at switching between the two. A weird point is that my brain instantly switches to inverted controls for planes (down to pitch up) and then back again when I get out of the vehicle. But, if I tried to use inverted controls while not in a plane my brain takes a while to adjust. My brain has registered flight controls as something separate. So if I want to use inverted controls in a shooter I can just think of it as a plane and my brain will switch instantly. And vice versa, I find it hard to fly using down for pitch down.",9년 전,79,

@sigmaprojects,"+6Twisted I feel like this is the first time I'm seeing a thread that is actually good, lol. Agree with both the gaming and breathing analogies.  I'll add one more, from a fighter's perspective. Southpaw vs orthodox, the standing position between left foot out in front or right foot out in front, much like the difference between those who ride snowboards. I'm right handed, but I didn't know I had a southpaw stance until someone said ""we're going to practice southpaw so you know what it feels like"" and I was confused at the moment because that's what I mostly do, for a while I thought the instructor meant southpaw was a high guard, lol. I've switched between the two stances for about 15 years, but have a bias with southpaw and you can tell also your opponent gets confused just by you switching to southpaw, since it's most common for everyone to have an orthodox stance (left foot forward).  However, even though I'm good at switching between stances, if I get on a board with the my left foot forward, omg, I just can't even and have to go back to having my right foot forward.",9년 전,0,
@wesleywhaley2368,"+Ali Ahadi In ninjutsu, most of the elements (stances) are pretty universal, fire is the only true fighting stance and you switch out pretty regularly. We actually wernt taught a left or right handed stance it was pretty situational. Though I'm ambidextrous anyway, I do lean more twords left foot forward for power and right forword for control. Switching that up would be pretty odd for me so I somewhat understand that perspective. I think the better analogy that even works with ambidextrous people. Pitching a ball with your off hand. I can't pitch with my right hand, its so awkward. Similar with writing with my left though I do a better job! Lol",9년 전,0,

Ninjutsu isn't a striking art though, more grappling, disarming and take downs.

@prephasfallen5168,Notice with how the cogs make any tiny movement of the handlebars move the wheel 10 fold. That's why nobody can ride it. If you had that level of sensitivity with the traditional steering chances are people wouldn't be able to ride a traditional bike either. The cog system they put on the bike isn't 1:1 like traditional bike steering. It has nothing to do with brains and everything to do with the fact that it's hypersensitive.,9년 전,0,
@sleepyjessie,"This is really interesting, as when you ride a motorcycle at low speed you still turn the same as on a normal bicycle, but over about 20-30 mph you have to steer the opposite way, as in the backwards bicycle. At first it's quite weird but I had no problem getting used to it. I think it may be much easier (mentally) as turning the bars at higher speeds just makes the bike lean in the opposite direction, which makes it easier in your head to figure out which way you're going. I'm a physics student, but this does confuse me. Why does a motorcycle lean and then turn in the opposite direction to which way you turn the front wheel?

@devilskullBEL,"AMAZING video, this got me very curious but noticed 1 thing immediately when I saw the teeth on the gears to convert the steering. What if you started with rougher teeth first, just to let you have a feel of how it feel to go straight while letting you have a bigger margin for error?  It's like trying to convert from AZERTY keyboards (I'm from Belgium) to a German QWERTZ keyboard and now I'm on a Swedish QWERTY keyboard. if you do both long enough, your brain learns both and you swap from one to another without a problem. I still work with AZERTY at work why I currently have the Swedish QWERTY one at home. It takes its time to learn the normal letters (few days) and even more to learn the signs (few weeks of daily hours) but in the end, you type as fast as you used to.  The bike is too expensive for me to buy,certainly even more to adjust with different gears as I proceed, but I'm curious about this, because as the bikes are sold with those teeth, you fail within 4-5ft (1,5m) (another perfect example of how I got the basics of imperial and metric systems in my head and switch from one to another)  More common for people (specially in Europe) to compare with this is the knowledge of more than 1 language.

In a reverse bike, the centrifugal force has no place to go except to turn the bike more, adding more centrifugal force.  That means that on a reverse bike any miscalculation is amplified where a normal bike miscalculations are dampened.  In aviation it's referred to as horizontal stability.  I found it interesting that you couldn't instantly get back to a normal bike.  This summer a guy made one of these and practiced for about a month and was able to ride it pretty well.

They are literally the total opposite.  If you would have bet that someone that hadn't used a snowboard before could not ride 10 meters people would not be as supprised.  The trick is to not mixing up the algorithms, the first one is a bike and the other one is ekib.  Sidenote: A similar simpler experiment is reversing the directions of your mouse. Its pretty hard until you think of it as controlling a aircraft then you get a feeling for it. in a game like battlefield where you have both planes and first person people switch between this two ways control seamlessly .

@shinichioiyx8442,"I only learned how to ride a bike at 14 years old... And before that, I was fully convinced that I won't know how to ride a bike for the rest of my life. So then my father told me a simple rule to follow when riding a bike. At first when I attempted to ride a bike, I turned the handle bar to the opposite direction of where I was going to fall. Like, if I'm about to fall to the right, I turned the handle bar to the left and vice versa. I always ended up falling off the bike. So then he told me to turn the handle bar towards the direction of where I'm about to fall. Like, if I'm about to fall to the right, I should turn the handle bar to the right and vice versa. At first I was skeptical but after a few tries, I could ride a bike. So, yeah. Riding a bike was not instinctual for me. I had to learn and know about the method before I could ride a bike. Well, the normal one anyway. If I was given a chance to ride the backwards bike, I'd probably have to revert back to how I originally tried to ride a bike.

Instinctively, you would turn the handlebars and thus the wheel left, but with this bike that would you to fall even faster off the bike. It also doesn't help that you would use more force in turning the handle bars than normal because you are trying to correct your balance as fast as possible.",9년 전,0,
@Eric14492,"+Helen Eschenbacher There are several reasons that is different.  You can make a small error in steering a boat, and it doesn't ""run away"" from you.

There are exceptions, e.g. a Moth hydrofoil. :)  The mechanics of using a tiller are different than using a steering wheel. It's not the same thing, just backwards, it is something different.

@davidcaneso,"I really want to try this. I know its part of the gag but if people started by walking the bike up to speed instead of just full on pedaling from a stop, I think they might have an easier time learning to ride it. Its the nature of your opposite hand counterbalancing the foot pushing down on the petal. Just like when you are walking, the arm opposite the extended leg swings the opposite direction. So its something that engrained to a skill outside of just riding a bike. If you were to walk the bike up to speed you would get a feel for countering the weight distribution as your feet move. This is why kids who use kick bikes first can usually forgo training wheels on regular bikes because they have taken one part ( the pedaling ) out of the equation. Its still simulated with the feet motion and the weight distribution is there but at a much weaker presence than when pedaling.",9년 전,0,

I tried and tried (as much as was safe), but I couldn't do it. At the same time, I started experiencing motion sickness at the slightest things (watching my brother play Descent, riding in the car, etc.).  Previously, I could ride any ride at the fair without a hint of motion sickness. I hoped it was just a pregnancy thing, but 20 years later I still can't ride a bike, and I still have tons of motion sickness. So it is possible to lose one's ability to ride a bike.",9년 전,1,

@NickReeck,"Yes!  Exactly!  My senior design project at Michigan was a bicycle that, for controls reasons, is unrideable.  Here's what we did - we rigged the bike so the handlebars were in the front, but the rear wheel had the steering pivot and was attached to the handlebars with cables.  So the wheel ""behind"" you steers.  Basically, even though ""left"" and ""right"" are correct, the bike kind of falls out from under you as you ride.  We had the same bravado from ""riders"" (including U of M professors) - but no one could go more than about 5 feet without falling over.  You had to lean opposite the direction that was intuitive.  Wonder if I could have learned it if I had stuck with it.  Thanks for bringing back those memories!

If it locks by default, your bike is essentially broke, until you can get someone with heavy duty tools to come and break it off. If it unlocks by default, well you're bike is left  with no lock.

@mikereddish6811,"I quickly learned how to ride a reverse steering bicycle at a motorcycle rally a couple of years ago following these steps. 1. Sit as strait up as possible which has more affect on steering than handlebars. Body position is everything on two wheels. 2. Push and don't pedal the bike while learning how to take off to get things rolling which should be about 3-4 mph. Crank arms should also be horizontal 3. Big lessons learned from operating different equipment controls and backing up trailers in almost impossible spaces. Force yourself to learn that to turn right, push the bars right. To turn left, push left. Shortly after 1 hour of practice, I could pedal the reverse steering bicycle not much more than 10 feet but using these techniques you can have a much shorter learning curve. Be careful not to get onto your motorcycle after you learn this, what a shock it was when I tried to take off and realize how difficult it was to do something that came so natural before trying this.

It is pretty funny to test on your own and everybody uses this technique everytime they ride a bike but noone knows about it.

@Radeo,"I disagree about the applicability of this to language.   Firstly, when people learn a second language it is often through the same textbook means that they learned the language as a child. But an adult possesses a conceptual ability that children do not have, so this method does not take advantage of that. The methods are generally not suitable for adults.   Secondly, adults tend to be more self-conscious than children so their ability to learn through daily conversation can be stalled by degrees by their attitude toward making mistakes, self-correction, and willingness to tolerate embarrassment: You mentioned all the people watching you ride the bike, you can feel their gazes as external pressure, but when I was a kid learning to ride, my mind was not focused on other people at all, it was task-oriented. Similarly, all of those who rode the bike were in front of their peers, so their risk aversion is going to be different from if they we learning in the front yard in front only their father. So neither of these orientations are inevitable as adults.  Thirdly, not having knowledge is not as frustrating when you already know how to communicate and think. So never mind the plasticity of the mind, the situational incentives are totally different. That is, even if I don't learn how to read in this second language I am studying yet, I can still get on with the basic business of my life via the knowledge and communicative abilities I already possess. But an infant HAS TO learn how to focus his eyes, and child HAS TO learn how to shape ideas and then form sentences in order to be understood. The emotional imperatives are different.   However, adults have the capacity to change their own emotional incentives by changing both their beliefs about what level of progress is acceptable and by the strictness of the rules and boundaries they set about their learning. If they define their second language with an emotional imperative equivalent to the first, while maintaining a growth mentality unphased by the gazes of others, while learning with a method that is congruent with their adult conceptual faculties, a similar rate of growth should follow.  This outlook may even extend to learning how to ride a bike. I would argue that there is no limiting factor in the brains of adults to master this skill at about the same speed of a child --- there is instead social conditioning and an attitude towards mastery that is lacking in adults who already know how to ""get by"".",10년 전,0,

@banjon2012,"+Grim Reaper (Death) I don´t think children learn faster, they just have more free time, usually. For example, while adults learn a foreign language using a few minutes a day (because they have work and other obligations), kids are all day speaking that language, going to a school taught in that language, etc.   In fact, the guy from the video mentioned that he practiced with the reversed bike only 5 minutes a day for 8 months. Making some calculations, that gives as 5*30 = 150 minutes a month, which is 1200 minutes in 8 months, which is a total of 20 hours.   Now, his son was at an advanced stage in 2 weeks, and he jumped to the conclusion that kids learn faster, even though the kid still couldn't really ride it, and also without mentioning how many hours he had spent (what if the child spent 3 hours a day, which is 45 hours in 2 weeks?).   And furthermore, how can he jump to a conclusion from only one observation: ""it took me 8 months to do this, and this kid took only 2 weeks, that proves that kids learn much faster"".

@Azgoth2,"Here's another thought on the reverse bike (also, pure speculation, but it sounds plausible enough for me to entertain): the difference between conscious and unconscious actions when riding are, perhaps, just as important as anything else.  When riding, you constantly make small, unconscious corrections to stay upright; after a while, these are purely in muscle memory, and no longer something you're even aware of.  So, when you ride a backwards bike, you might be perfectly capable of picking up things like turning quickly, but the smaller corrections are so automatic that you don't even know you're making them.  Thus, you try to make them for the old, non-reversed bike, which pushes your balance off further, which causes the correction to kick in, and you get basically a resonance-like phenomenon.  The error in your balance/position increases, so you try to unconsciously correct, but the correction increases the error, etc, until you reach the catastrophic failure of the system (falling over).  Watching some of the videos, people seem to jerk the handlebar, which seems to follow from this--I find many of the small corrections I make to be pretty quick, and the resonance-like effect might amplify this, or make you keep going until the problem is corrected (or you fall down).  Of course, again, this is all speculation from someone who never thought about such a bike existing before just now, so take it all with a lot of salt.  A very cool video either way, though.  Very thought-provoking.  Makes me wonder what else you could do this with to get a similar effect--if you remapped, say, someone's spacebar and backspace key, would that have a similar effect?  Or does the time-sensitive nature of a bike correction significantly amplify the effect?  After all, if you fail once, you don't exactly get to slow down next time.  You have to go at the same speed when learning sometihng that's very sensitive to the temporal qualities of your own actions.  Not so with typing--you can do that at any pace, so maybe it would be different.  Lots of food for thought.",10년 전,0,

Also there is the issue regarding what else you are doing. For example some ballet students were taught some martial arts and some martial artists ballet. They spent half the time learning one and half the time learning the other.

That means, not only have your new associations been learnt on a very fundamental level, but the way a normal bike is designed is possibly an analog to innate organization in this system, i.e that balancing a ""normal"" bike is similar to how you balance a human body (just like swiping a smartphone is similar to moving things in real life), and this modded bike is probably not as analogous.

I don't have the necessary means to build a bike like that but i'll tell how almost anyone can ride it very fast. Just cross your arms, left goes to the right handle and vice versa. Wanting to go left will trigger your left arm and pull on the right handle bar making the bike to actually go left since it's backwards. That way the biker only needs to fine tune his arm movements for more precise maneuvers. You're welcome.

I think if you switched back and forth between the bikes, as a practice, every day, for as long as it took you to learn to ride this one bike, you would actually be able to ride both bikes interchangeably with an ever decreasing amount (the more you do it) of shift time in-between the bikes.

@peachmelba1000,"Its no surprise that you eventually learned how to ride the bike, but I will say that your initial attempts may not have only been hindered by the new steering contraption. Consider the possibility that the mechanical linkage the welders made was too....""slick"" (best word I could come up with), meaning it was/is far more touch sensitive than a regular bicycle's would be. For example, when you first tried to ride the bike in the shop, the steering immediately when either left or right. Now I can surmise that in that confined space your intention was merely to go in a straight line and not immediately turn. Why would you, right?  Most bicyles have a bit of backlash in their steering mechanisms, which is enough that not every miniscule touch is transmitted into motion with the mechanism. Looking at the geared linkage on the backwards bike it seems unfairly rigid, mechanically; this means that, just like a brand new machine tool for instance, every minute input yields a corresponding output (or in other words the motion is transmitted with nearly 100% efficiency). Such is not the case on a regular, off the shelf bicycle.  Fun vid and good on ya though. Cheers!",10년 전,1,

The fun increase when you fly upside down where up is down and down is up. All this perception is only lived by the pilot who need to move the finger on the remote the opposite from the direction of the object. Now for the total disorientation put on FPV goggle and fly the quad stationary in front of you. You are now looking at yourself flying the object as the camera in the quad is pointing at you and your brain get the best trick.

Starting off was easy because it did not change the handling (as demonstrated in your video), instead the problems occurred when I had to change gears, brake suddenly etc. I found myself stepping on the brake or the gears by mistake ( which btw can be dangerous in traffic). In a couple of days I got 'used' to riding the old bike, and when I got back to riding my own bike, I learned I did not have much difficulty going back to my usual gear setup, I believe the brain has the ability to master new co-ordinations, the key is - Practice!",10년 전,1,

This is just one thing and this is how Nationalism, Racisim, Sexism and much more things work in our brain too. How much ever we see the logic that all humans are the same (same skeleton and same blood) when we are not paying enough attention the nationalism and sexism comes into play.

@JustDiploid,"I'm very big into radio control helicopters. When one first learns to hover (it takes a couple of weeks' practice) it's always with the heli tail-in toward you. So right and left on the control stick corresponds to what you see. After a few months of this, you will eventually want to advance and learn to hover nose-in where the controls are reversed. It's analog to your bike. VERY hard to learn nose-in while the weeks of tail-in muscle-memory tries to interfere. And you must learn nose-in while retaining tail-in, practicing both for months in parallel. You gain nothing if you forget one orientation in favor of the other. To fly, you need them all.  Once you have that down, start working on hovering up-side-down where the controls are not only reversed but mirror image as well. You should try it if you like a challenge. :)",10년 전,0,

In the backwards bike video most people tried to start with a pedal.  It made me wonder whether they -- and originally, the author -- would have made faster progress by first getting gliding working with the backwards steering.  Knowing what I do about bike handling, I doubt it... still, a worthy question.  /John Ciccarelli, Bicycle Solutions, San Francisco",10년 전,0,

@xylophoniac,"+Martin Jenkins yes, I came here to post the same analogy. It's the same thing - completely conflicting ways of operating that you find you can switch between surprisingly easily, albeit with occasional lapses, depending on how much you practise.. Personally I never found I 'unlearnt' qwerty when I learnt Dvorak, probably because I was continuing to type qwerty whilst learning dvorak, but another thing I found was that after a long period of not typing Dvorak, I could mostly still type in it, but occasionally would 'lose' letters and forget where a particular letter was during typing - the best way I found of refinding the 'lost' letter was not a brute force search, but simply to type a common word that contained the letter, as my muscle memory would lead me to the right key at the right time, even though I couldn't consciously place it.  I get the distinction between 'knowing' and 'understanding' in the video but I think it uses the wrong terminology - I would instead distinguish between 'conscious knowledge' and 'muscle memory' - technically obviously this involves the brain not just the muscles, but a lower-level brainstem muscle-control part of the brain, rather than a higher level cognitive one.  This is what needs to be retrained for these kind of tasks, and it takes so much longer to retrain as it can only be done by continued practice / habit. It's interesting that retraining for riding a bike takes so much longer than retraining to type in a different layout, but I suppose not too surprising as typing only involves the finger muscles whereas cycling involves the whole body and more senses as input - vision, touch plus the proprioceptive sense of balance.",9년 전,0,
@Lamarth1,"+Anita Woodruff good commentary.

@Kotfluegel,"The only beef I have with your little study is, that you seem to be equating the process of learning how to ride a bicycle to reasoning out or actively, consciously learning and understanding how to ride a bike. But the thing is.: the process of learning how to ride a bike is just training your body to just react in a certain way to certain impulses. When you're riding a bike it's not like you have to continuously be aware of every single step in that process. Just like a martial artist just reacts to an attacker, without thinking about it, or like me, writing this little text without even being aware of where the individual keys are on the keyboard and not having to think about how to move every single finger on my hands, your body is shifting its weight and slightly steering the handle of your bike to keep balance almost automatically. It's more like our senses are directly linked to our muscles through some neural networks, bypassing our consciousness entirely. Learning how to write with ten fingers, mastering martial arts, learning how to ride a bike or juggling balls is just the tedious process of training those neural networks. It's not an obstacle that is overcome by pure willpower or intense concentration and thinking.",10년 전,0,

Given the other wacky unicycles that I've seen ridden, this has probably already been done. Then of course there could also be a permutation with one pedal reversed and one normal. Since unicycles are easily turned around, it would only take seconds to go from right-pedal-reversed to left-pedal-reversed...

@projekcja,"I believe there's an important aspect about these bicycles that wasn't mentioned: It has positive feedback. If you try riding a normal bicycle with no hands on the handles, a small deviation of the handlebar from straight ahead would naturally correct itself due to negative feedback. On these bicycles, a small deviation would be amplified instead. The reason for this difference is that the the handlebar is more forward that it would be on a normal bike, and so the projection of the handlebar is more forward than the front wheel's axis. Without reversing the handlebar it's possible to build a similar 'positive feedback unridable bicycle' . In April of 1970, David E. H. Jones published an article about it: see www.phys.lsu.edu/faculty/gonzalez/Teaching/Phys7221/vol59no9p51_56.pdf",10년 전,0,

(Fortunately steering was much less sensitive compared to bicycle in the video.)  I think most of that was attributed to glider having one wheel directly under pilot's bottom and second one in front right beneath the feet, and rudder pedals being mechanically very similar to bicycle steering, only backwards.

The problem is once you develop solid muscle memory it becomes very difficult if not impossible to  untrain your muscle's    Once again that's why airplane pilots make very poor helicopter pilots and vice versa.

@wbpearce,"I'm not at all convinced that this proves anything about the relationship between knowledge and understanding. Rather, what the phenomenon we're seeing in this video demonstrates is that neither knowledge nor understanding (both being cognitive activities) is actively involved in a fully-developed ability to ride a bike (though cognition is involved--most of the time--in choosing in what direction to ride). Instead, we're witnessing the properties of automaticity at work (see the Wikipedia article on that topic for details). In this regard, cognition is bypassed in the chain of neurological events in favor of a direct connection between sensory input (the sense of balance and visual cues) and motor outputs (i.e., commands to the muscles). In automaticity situations such as this, the connection may be viewed as ""hardwired."" (OK, it's more complicated than that, but it's close enough for this discussion.)  The reversal of the steering mechanism contradicts that hardwiring; re-training forms new connections. The difficulty in going back to a standard bicycle isn't at all surprising--it' not that Destin forgot how to ride a standard bike, it's that he hadn't yet learned how to switch back and forth between his two automaticity modes.

Once again, that still has nothing to do with perfecting the skill of riding it.   I have knowledge and an understanding of how to play a piano.   It's still gonna take hundreds of hours to get good at playing that piano.    And that involves muscle memory, and neural pathways, and lots of practice, not understanding.   And, biases, like you said have to do more with pre-conceived notions and ideas and concepts.    Saying ""no one could ever learn to ride a bike like that"" is a Bias based on one's pre-conceived notion of what humans can and cannot do and learn.    Taking 8 months to learn to ride the bike is not based on your bias, it's based on your ingrained neural pathways and motor coordination based on riding a bicycle a certain way for decades.    This experiment has more to do with learning and muscle memory and coordination than with knowledge, understanding, and bias, in my opinion.",10년 전,1,

@st.clairbij9208,"I don't know whether it is necessarily neural plasticity which makes the kid ride the bike quicker. I know that children do not learn language quicker. No one expects a kid to have a huge vocabulary and speak grammatically flawless when they are 7. Nevertheless they already spent 7 years practicing the language. If an adult would be practicing a language all day for 7 years and he would speak not speak the language proficiently he would be considered failing. I think that that idea must get out of people's mind. Kids can learn languages because they are allowed to fail, so should adult and more people would learn other languages and become better at them.  When you just learn to throw a baseball your motor skills are not trained yet. If you train with both your left and your right hand you can more easily throw the ball with both. Therefore acquiring a new skill and doing it in multiple ways may take more time, but it will also allow you to master the different ways quicker than if you would try to master them completely separately.",10년 전,0,

I picked it up again at 23 with a bike I never intended to own in an instance where I didn't think I would have to ride a bike I proved to myself that we don't forget. I had never ridden on busy roads but the first day I got back on a bike it was time to learn because I had to get to work FAST! Much faster than I could walk.   I started out awkward, didn't understand much about gears, wasn't great at balance, had to use my feet to start by kicking off, pretty bad at turns, etc. Now, a year later, I've gotten really good at it, I can ride tiny paths with lots of turns now, start without kicking off just about anywhere, and not only do I not fall but I'm learning new things like riding without hands, standing and peddling, and learned I can jump off a moving bike with no problem and the motion converts easily into walking motion. Before I would have just fallen and gotten injured. I've had to spend lots and lots of time on this bike over the last year, not even sure how many tires I've gone through.  When I first started, I couldn't ride with bags on my handlebars or ams and could only do 1 bag, I can now carry bags, trashcans, shovels, etc   My point is, I never expected to be good at riding a bike and I ended up being good enough to impress myself. I have a strong feeling that since my bike is literally starting to feel like an extension of my body, I could probably ride a backwards bike.

@Pendaboot,"I think that bicycle riders might be confused on this test far more than motorcycle riders. I suspect that motorcycle riders might have an easier time adjusting to reverse steering gear, since on a motorcycle the need to countersteer is far more obvious and part of the skill. Bicycle riders move according to (learned) instinct, while at much higher speed it is far more deliberate to steer against the turn, so that the bike can fall into the direction needed to complete the turn. . . You never lean when riding a motorcycle - you make the bike fall into the turn with countersteer. A champagne glass on the tank will never fall over on a motorcycle, since the bike is always balanced side to side. Quite a different skill, but of course not covered here since it might have a far different outcome, thus a far less interesting outcome.",10년 전,0,

I'm very good at lateral thinking.  I'm also a coder who also writes songs - so left brain AND right-brain.  -I'm a U.S. citizen, who lives in Australia.  Within a few hours of swapping countries, I've adjusted to driving on the ""wrong"" side of the road, sitting in the wrong seat, and shifting gears with the ""wrong"" hand.  About a year ago I changed martial arts.  My old style *only* did ""outside blocks"", whereas my new style did ""inside blocks"" against straight punches.  The class met once a week, and within about two months I'd adjusted.  (This is against spontaneous punches - so it has to be an unconscious reaction.)  *Somewhere* - I don't remember where -- I drove some sort of bulldozer-like device where the steering was essentially backwards:  you had to conceptualize it as rotating your seat rather than rotating the vehicle.  I picked it up pretty quickly.

So our operator above learned on one or the other.  He has basically learned to ""ride the bike."" Now the moment you give him the OTHER controls, from ex to bh or from bh to ex, the operator looks retarded all over again.  Here is a neat thing - some operators are able to interchangeably go back and forth from ex to bh controls.  I can't do it.  I am suspecting these same people could ride both bikes.",10년 전,0,
@Sybaris_Rex,"I had an experience similar to this playing a videogame called Clusterball. One of the weapons you could fire at other ships would temporarily cause that ship's controls to be inverted. In order to practice handling being hit with this weapon I spent several hours flying around using the mouse upside down. When I finally flipped the mouse rightside up again, the muscles in my forearm would compete with each other in which should be contracting and which should be expanding ending up with a very similar sensation (and frustration) as I see here with people trying to ride the reverse bike.  It took quite a lot of practice to be able to switch back and forth between the two flight controls and ultimately I had to consciously decide to think of the two in vastly different terms. An idea came to me that I picked up when using a photo-manipulation program on someone else's computer that had inverted y-axis settings. In mine I thought of it as moving the image around the screen and on the other I thought of it as moving the ""table"" under the image around. Applying this separation of thinking styles to the game I was eventually able to switch from regular controls to inverted controls quickly enough that it nullified the effect of the weapon.",10년 전,0,

@lease2coach170,"Okay, this is misleading (1:19): ""I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike, but I did not have the understanding."" It's more accurate to say that you had the knowledge but not the motor skill. And that's not a new lesson: We ""know"" (which here exactly equals ""understand"") how to bat a baseball (""Hit the ball with the stick in your hands, kid!""); but if we don't have the motor skills to do it, we're going to strike out.  And if the motor path for one skill is deeply ingrained, we're going to have difficulty adjusting to a somewhat-similar-but-not-the-same task. This is how a top softball pitcher is able to strike out major league baseball players: they've ingrained a certain movement pattern based on how a baseball flies, and a well-pitched softball flies differently. To say ""knowledge does not equal understanding"" (6:44), then, is an unwarranted misuse of standard English. And to the extent that that was misuse-with-a-purpose, it was a lie. So why, why, why was I not surprised to see that the video ended with a biblical message? Sure, it was partly because I caught an evangelical ""vibe"" right from the beginning; but it was also because this strange misuse of language, within the first 90 seconds of the vid, made me wary. And, of course, the message we're supposed to take away: ""You don't understand God, so you'll just have to accept that your puny mind can't process the concept, and trust that I'm right when I say there is one. And you'll have to trust me when I say how that 'deity' wants people to behave. You just don't understand [and, by implication: I do]."" But, as you say, truth is indeed truth; and people do look at the world with a bias. We're all prone to that. So what's a good approach to take? How about ""I could be wrong""? That takes the possibility of bias into consideration. Oh, except that's not an acceptable approach when it comes to god-belief, is it? No, that you can't be wrong about...right? Cool bike, though.

First of all there si an excentricity between cogwheel that makes a small torque. Thats the reason why the bike is so unstable, because we are not use to this torque. Second reason part of my opinion is that the undirect conectin make not feel the direct vybration from a wheel. This is a really important too.   I would say if you would make a same bike but with 3 cogwheel (makes your bike normal but with excentricity and undirect connection) the bike would be untable for u as well. Not as mutch as this one but I would say it will be pretty same.  PS: Your son´s bike has a lower center of gravity, that coud make him useto the torque and direc absence of vibration faster  PS2: I can linken this to a car simulator PC game with plastical pedals u know how to use them but the absense of car vibration and pedal resistant make them totally different ;)",10년 전,0,

The handle bars seem to sensitive to me (of course I could be wrong...I have not ridden this bike(thats a given). If indeed the handlebars are that sensitive you are trying to rewire the brain at too alarmingly of a rate I would think...Why not make the handle bars a little more rigid so that the front tire is not so sensitive. Essentially you are trying to rewire the brain without training wheels....not a smart idea. You would eventually be able to make the handlebars a little more free with time but to just bombard the brain with such a complicated task seems silly to me...Try to swing a bat left handed when you are naturally right handed...same principle. The brain works in patterns does it not? I would think the brain would only recognize patterns as truth if they are consistent. How does this have anything to do with the bike? ...not sure but I feel it does. Don't quote me on anything I am saying here as I have not validated any of this and it is simply my thoughts as they are coming to me(aka stream of conscious). I never think in a linear pattern unfortunately. Anyhow, neural firing patterns aren't that easy to manipulate so no one should think they are that intelligent to override essentially a hard code that has been planted into your brain without failure. The length at which you must fail until you have acquired whatever task you have set out to do is up to you I would assume( brain flexibility...willingness to suck at it...amount of time put into said task etc etc).

@RexSikesMovieBeat,"this guy is great and perhaps missed the greatest point about what he has accomplished. He provided proof you can learn new habits & unlearn old ones  This is: A must watch video! I find this fascinating, inspiring and disappointing. He demonstrates that their is bias with his biased conclusions. His conclusions, alone should help us understand that we do see through our own filters. What he demonstrated was he could learn (the original way) and then learn another way, which took some time because it was close to or paralleled another skill he had previously learned. Though difficult, he still demonstrated this IS learning in action.  The brain had to create the new pathways during the new learning process. He never forgot. He rewired and utilized different pathways. There is no truth in anything as he states at the end. He claims there is. I disagree. I believe that is his filter and a disappointing conclusion.  I do find this an incredible example of the ability to learn no matter what or how difficult. I do not agree with the limiting conclusions he draws. Again, that is due to different filters or bias we each have applied to the same event.  This is an amazing example of what people suffering from brain injuries and physical injuries have to do to learn to utilize their brain in new ways to relearn skills. They have to learn to be able to redirect their brain from previously well traveled neural pathways.  He demonstrates this can be done in a healthy brain at the very least. He demonstrates that we can, at various any ages, over come habits and learn new ways of doing things. He may have shown the very reason why stroke, brain and spinal injuries prove so difficult to resolve, but at the same time showed that they may very well be resolved with enough time and commitment.   If someone's ability to do anything is interrupted that neural wiring (all of the skills associated with having learned to do it that work in concert) has one or more pieces that may have changed. Just like the handle bars. The brain hasn't yet figured out how to compensate for the change. So perhaps, speech impairment, certain motor skills etc and others issues can and will be resolved given enough time and encouragement.   I think the component his misses completely is attitude and faith. To have the attitude it is possible and I can do it and to believe on will accomplish what one sets out to do may be a huge  factor in recovery or in learning any skill. (My comments about how is child's mindset and his may be an important variable).  Sadly, he only has himself and his son to draw from and he concludes it is easier for his son because he is younger. YES, this may be accurate but a test of two people doesn't prove it. I wouldn't draw the same conclusion necessarily, while it could be the case.  Both learned regardless of the amount of time it took. No one can assess from the video the amount of dedication, the supportive or unsupportive self-talk, thoughts, criticism or encouragement of the either rider. The kid may have thought cool while he was frustrated.  The kid may have spent the entire day trying while he spent it when back from work. Numerous factors we don't know about - yet he draws conclusions which I think are limiting even though positive.  I think he is enjoyable to watch but creates more limiting conclusions than he realizes and it could be otherwise completely inspiring. We CAN learn to do anything, even though it at first seems impossible would be one conclusion I would draw to begin with. We can make changes even though it may seem very difficult. The brain eventually 'gets it' through persistent repetition.  Had he given up at any point along the way - he most likely would have concluded (as many do) that it is impossible, or too hard, or he just isn't skilled enough or he is a bad puppy and can't do things right.  Having succeeded he could conclude learning is possible though difficult, others may have an easier time of it due to any number of factors but if you stick with it you can do it. That he is able to learn well when persistent and that he is a good puppy who deserves a treat.  http://www.dailyliked.net/backwards-brain-bicycle/ ‪#‎positivethinking‬   ‪#‎attitude‬ ‪#‎learning‬ ‪#‎habitformation‬ ‪#‎tsu‬ ‪#‎tsufriends‬ ‪#‎tsufamily‬ ‪#‎tsuskills‬ ‪#‎talent‬ ‪#‎neuralplasticity‬",10년 전,0,

@LEXMEN74,"Hello there, nice video and realy nice way to re-think some pre-concepts, I'd just like to say that there are more things to be analyzed: I may be wrong or I notice a small gap on the bike handlebars? if so, only that already makes a cyclist fall ... on a normal bike when you turn the handlebars to one side, your whole body's center of gravity changes in a possitive way facilitating cornering, with your bike this happens in other way which makes it difficult to turn ,so is not just merely a re-learning, but a diferent and more dificult learning.  It is unquestionable the fact that children learn and re-learn faster, but the bike your child have a more friendly model for balancing factor, cross bikes are made to maneuver and has lower center of gravity that helps positively to the children learn to pedal more easily, and your child own center of gravity is lower due to proportionally shorter arms and legs.    Can I suggest a different approach? How it would be for a equilibrist, those who pedal back sitting on the handlebars, to learn your bike?  I just read this coment, and it has the same thinking of me:  ""writerconsidered 1 dia atrás  +SmarterEveryDay I think you've over complicated the thought process here. It's not a question of what your brain learns. It's a question of direct balance verses indirect opposite balance. This is not thinking this is the brains automatic reaction process. Our intuitive senses tell us to do a direct balance, the bike itself is counter- intuitive therefor learning to ride it is counter-intuitive.   The best way to test this is to teach a kid who has never learned to ride a bike at all and see how long it takes him to learn this new bike. I bet it will take longer. When he masters the new bike teach him the traditional bike. I bet he learns the old bike faster then the new bike. That's a hypotheses worth testing.""  Sheers, keep the good work!",10년 전,0,

@12369874186,"I rode a bike like that in Sweden, I thought it would be easy, I couldn't really manage to move in the first place. Its not just about steering direction, its initially more about balance, because as the wheel turns at a low speed it changes the center of gravity, so don't just think about simple steering, but what direction your weight is falling. I also wonder if the steering ratio has changed, does the wheel turn faster than before? Another issue may be steering feedback, when you go over a bump or uneven surface it pushes the wheel to the side, and thus turning your handle bars, and now that bump is going to make the handle bars go in a way that might be unexpected.

Learning to find new pathways coming out of addiction is one of the biggest jobs someone in recovery has, and it can so very daunting and frustrating, and I think this example will be an excellent way of demonstrating how that happens in a biological kind of way. Second, we all have bias, and most of us are not usually aware that that bias even exists.

It took a long time, but eventually his brain learned not to make the 180 degree rotation before processing info from the eyes. When he eventually removed the glasses he said he spent four months of excruciating pain and headaches readjusting. He said he did not recommend that anyone duplicate his painful experimental experience.   While, neurologically, old habit pathways are not unlearned and never go away, the growth of directly conflicting - habit breaking - pathways can become stronger than the old (but never naturally weakened) pathways.  Scientifically speaking, only a miracle can shrink those enlarged nodes in the neural pathways. Personally I do believe that God through Christ will make that happen for those who accept His power and Lordship over their heart and mind (emotions, intellect, inclinations, and habits).  Therefore, theoretically, this side of Heaven, there should come a point of balance in which riding a bike with backwards geared steering and one with normal steering should be able to be switched back and forth between rather effortlessly. However, in theory, this might require a bit of deliberate self-imposed schizophrenia in which each personality could ride the bike in only one of the two ways. But this psychologically based conclusion currently is merely a conjecture.  When it comes to moral choices, such a non-schizophrenic state wherein either value's option seems acceptable to the person, is called amoral or a form of Asperger's. Thus, it is never safe to deliberately mess with developing social, moral, value, or spiritual perspectives which are out of harmony with the greater good and the bottom line of pure and unselfish love; or as 1 Corinthians puts it, ""faith, hope, and love"" of which ""the greatest of these is love."" If we do, we run the risk of either overriding the good or of becoming unable to distinguish between the two.  Sometimes Christians and others with clear moral values are forced to walk along the edge of just such steep ethical cliffs. When possible, it is usually best to avoid such moral tightrope balancing acts even if you have the safety net of the Gospel, lest one falls beyond the edges of the net into the pit of I thought I knew Him, but He never knew me.  A backwardly geared bicycle steering system holds no direct moral implications, but it does open our minds to simultaneously question everything we know as reality and truth while at the same time being warned to hold fast to what we cannot afford to question or lose in order to adopt an alternate worldview that could be worse, with no easy or possible way to return to what might have been best all along. Joshua may have said it best, “Choose you this day whom you will serve . . . but as for me and my family, we will serve [follow the righteous ways of] the Lord.”",10년 전,0,
@Apoxolypse,It seems to me the the issue isn't so much in the fact that your brain has a hard time processing the reverse mechanics of the steering but more about how loose the steering seems to be. it looks to me like even when your brain starts to realize whats going on and you make what your brain knows to be the correct adjustments in the steering the tire just seems to turn wildly. A Larger gear would make for an easier transition to reversed controls but thats just my opinion from what I've observed in the Video.,10년 전,0,

You need to understand that a bike is not steering only because of the change of the wheel angle.  That isn't what makes a bike ""steer"".  Turning of the handle bars in one direction simply sets the bike into a lean.  And the handle bars actually recover back into an angle at almost the oposit direction.  Try to take notice next time you ride your bike around a corner at a higher speed.  You push the left handle bar forward to turn left... push right to go right... you won't notice that at slower speeds. It's funny because you automatically learn  do that and not realize it.... more noticeable on a motorcycle.",10년 전,1,

I watched the video and the gears on the handlebar and for were both the same size at 20 teeth each. And at 0:46 you can see that if the handlebars were turned 45 degrees to the left the wheel will turn 45 degrees to the right which gives a total wheel to handlebar discrepancy of 90 degrees. It's effectively doubled the difference by just being reversed.  That said the reason for my query in the first place is that with that sort of gearing there should never be a point where the wheel would fall out of sync with the handlebar and point somewhere else other than dead center if the handlebars themselves were dead center.",10년 전,0,

@kwade1957,"Hello, and thanks for this. I found this experiment fascinating, and I have a couple of questions about different ways of approaching it.   From the difficulties you had initially switching back to a regular bicycle, I assume that during the time you rode the backwards bicycle you did NOT intersperse riding a normal bicycle into that 8 month period. If so, I have an idea about what was happening, and a possible alternative way to learn to ride the backwards bicycle.   First, I believe that when you learned to ride the reversed bicycle you did not develop a new set of pathways in your brain to do that, but instead retasked your existing ""bicycle riding"" pathways to the modified task of riding the new bike. Second, I believe that it is possible to deliberately develop new pathways instead of retasking old ones by the conscious process of mentally framing the process of riding the new bike in a totally different way from ""riding a bike"".   In other words, you went from ""riding a bike"" to ""riding a different bike"". I'm thinking that learning will be easier and quicker if you go from ""riding a bike"" to ""swimming a machine"" or ""flying on 2 wheels"" - that is, thinking of (and treating) the process as something new instead of as a modification of something old. If you don't relate the process of riding the modified bike to the process of riding a normal bike, my theory is that the transitions back and forth should be much easier and smoother.   Has anyone tried this that you know of, and I'm curious about what you think of this approach.  Thanks.

@awo1fman,"The thing that sets bicycles (motorcycles, any vehicle that leans to turn) apart from other vehicles is the need to initiate the turn by ""counter-steering"" in the opposite direction in order to get the bike leaning into the turn. It's what keeps it from falling over in the turn, and exactly why learners do at first fall over every time they try to turn. If you know how to ride a bike, you counter-steer intuitively without even realizing you're doing it. It's that added little tweek, that most riders probably never even realize or perceive that they are doing, that makes reversing bicycle steering so nefarious and insidious. Your body knows, even if you don't, that if you fail to make that imperceptible feint in the opposite direction first, you WILL crash. Self-preservation is the hardest instinct to overcome, and trying to consciously reprogram a subconscious behavior is particularly difficult. Especially if you're totally unaware of it.",10년 전,0,
@awo1fman,"I think I could ride that bike, but only by not using the handlebars at all... You might want to revise the wording to make it clear that's cheating. 😉  I also think another one of your fundamental assertions is incorrect. This isn't just about bicycles. Every move we make, be it walking, skiing, anything with wheels, any form of locomotion at all, is based on certain rules, which are in turn based on physics. We learn that no matter how we're travelling, to change direction we point - or steer - toward the direction we want to go. Reversing the steering doesn't just apply to bicycles, it applies to cars and everything else. You would also crash a car if the steering were reversed. I suspect that someone trying to learn to ride a bike for the first time would have a much harder time with a reversed one than with a normal one.  However, this is an issue that model aircraft pilots have to overcome completely in order to become proficient because the model's actions are reversed when coming toward you and normal when going away. Flying inverted adds further wrinkles. I would like to see several really good model aircraft pilots try the reverse-steering bike. I predict their reprogramming would take less time.

@fmmjqtft1,"***** You wrote: ""...most of that work you put in when you learned how to ride a bicycle translates into subconscious action which your brain defaults back to when you do the same task over and over.""  I think what you mean is something like: ""most of that work you put in when you learned how to ride a bicycle translates into subconscious action which your brain defaults back to when you try to ride a backwards bike (because riding a backwards bike is superficially similar to riding a normal bike)""  Sure. So the answer is basically that the backwards bike is superficially very similar to a normal bike, so when trying to balance it, the reflexes required to balance a normal bike are triggered, and this is what needs unlearning.  But that doesn't mean the person needs to actually unlearn (as in ""forgetting"", as he does in the video) how to ride a normal bike; all they need to do is learn to detach these reflexes from the task of a riding a backwards bike.  I am proposing that if someone approaches the problem of riding a backwards bike as a completely new skill, unrelated to riding a normal bike, then they might be more successful. But the person in the video doesn't do this. He approaches the problem as a slight variation of riding a normal bike, and seems to try to learn how to ride it without thinking at all, as if he thinks he already knows how to ride it. That is just as stupid as hopping on a unicycle and trying to ride it as a normal bike. Or a skateboarder hopping on a ripstick and expecting to be able to just ""learn"" how to do it just by pretending it is a normal skateboard, and thinking that eventually he will just stop crashing and be able to ride it. Not every skill can be learnt without thinking.  Just one more example to support my claim (but there are many more) is that when playing a first person shooter game, you can invert the up/down direction so that when the mouse moves up, the player looks down. I guarantee that many people can easily control the game in both modes, without having to unlearn either. If someone cannot do that, then they won't be able to play a game like star wars battlefront 2 where you control spaceships with ""inverted"" up/down controls, but control clone troopers with normal controls.",10년 전,0,

@nutnfan1,"I'm 95% sure I could do this. I can do a track stand, my balance is very good (so handlebar use to balance would be minimal), and countersteering at speed is somewhat unnatural to do but is a very effective way to steer. Just do not balance with the handlebars here, keep it straight and shift your body. I do that on my mountain bike when you can not steer on a balance beam. If you steer at all you will fall off, so you are forced to balance by shifting the weight of your body only.",10년 전,0,
@christophertelford,I CAN ride that bicycle. At least i could. I was manning a stall at a fair where we had one at high school.

@PhilosophicalBassMan,"It is actually the addition of the gear in the steering system that makes this bike hard to ride. If you set up the gear system for input to match direction it would also be extremely hard to ride. Watch the front wheel and the handle bar. They are not exactly opposite actions from each other, although they are very close. The introduction of a gear, no matter what the ratio is, means that output does not equal input. On a normal bike the steering system is solid state, and therefore output and input are equal. It is the same principle as when a  truck and trailer back up. Only the hitch on the truck is a fulcrum rather than a gear.",10년 전,0,

I learned to ride bike without guide wheel trust me it's not easy.  I agree, this bike is not tough but fundamental physics is missing.",10년 전,0,
@irou95,at high speeds you turn anyways the wrong direction and at small speeds you use the handlebar to turn to the direction you want so basically with this at high speeds you would have to turn it to the direction needed and it would bend you over to that direction,10년 전,0,
@RyanCranage,"I think having above average bike skills would speed the learning process up.. I get your point and I understand it confuses people, they can't wrap there head around the idea of turning right to go left and leaning left on a left turn even though you are turning the bars to the right. The brain can't think quick enough to correct the mistakes there making so the rider falls off.  I raced bmx in my younger years and I've rode freestyle bmx for over 10 years now and I have gained skills on a bike an average person just doesn't have from riding to the shops. People can crossover to motorbikes or downhill mountain biking very easily. They can get good at the new sport overnight just from starting on a bmx and using skills they already had.  My point is I am not trying to say I can do it first go but someone with good bike skills surely has a better chance at learning faster then your average person who has average bike skills. It would definitely be interesting to see how a professional mountain biker / bmxer would go learning how to ride it compared to yourself.",10년 전,0,

@stephenfiore1030,"This is a fun video to watch. In the video, we hear mention of neural control systems and algorithms in the brain. But that is a very traditional information processing view of cognition to try to explain what is going on. The problem is that this can't be explained using that theory of cognition because this is about the automatization of motor skills or what others would call ""muscle memory"" and how such skills are being automatically activated and producing the imbalance. What is going on is, rather, a demonstration of ""embodied cognition"" and a very complex form of perceptual-motor activity. Embodied cognition takes into account the integration of all forms of sensory input and this is particularly relevant to something like riding a bike. Learning how to ride a bike requires not just information/knowledge, but bodily experience. The memories do not reside 'in the brain' but, rather, are a dynamic relationship between body and brain. Riding a bike is a form of bodily engagement involving memory and action - in the case of the 'backwards bike', the body is automatically recalling the wrong set of muscle movements. Any 'algorithm' that might exist, is one that utilizes the entire nervous system and how the body maintains balance given some set of sensory-motor inputs. So, in this case, the body is recalling an incorrect set of muscle movements and that is compromising balance.  Anyway, this is a great example of embodied cognition and how the brain and body learn to coordinate and what happens when that system is disrupted. I'll be using it in my classes so thanks for putting it together.",10년 전,1,

@ParhelionMedia,"Very interesting, yes, but I'm surprised that Dustin and all of the comments I've seen fail to mention that this design actually alters the physics and and balance of the bicycle itself. I'm a bike aficionado and marvel at the beauty and simplicity of the bicycle as a machine. The backwards bike throws some of this out the window.   Here's a simple test - I'd like to see him try ""ghost riding"" it...On a normal bicycle the handlebars and their weight always remain perpendicular, at a constant angle to the wheel, keeping it balanced on the axis of the steering column. On this design the handlebar angle, and the balance of the handlebar weight relative to the wheel changes as the bars are turned.  Completely separate from our brain having to relearning the reversed steering direction, balance, and physics I believe this design is inherently, objectively less stable. Turning the handlebars causes the rider's weight and the weight of the handlebars to shift in the opposite direction of that which is necessary to balance the bike as a result of that turn. Especially starting from a standstill this makes it very hard to balance. Watching the video, even Dustin and his son are much more wobbly on the backwards bike than on a normal one. I could be wrong, but I think that this is one reason why the expert ""riding with no hands"" people would still have lots of trouble on this bike. Sure someone could learn to ride this bike, even with no hands, but overall I think this is objectively more difficult. It's also counterintuitive to the way that way that we know and understand operating many devices that require directional balance. It's as much ""unlearning"" how we know how to ride a bicycle as it is learning to ride a totally different, new vehicle.  This doesn't disprove anything about neuroplasticity or the points of this video. But It should be acknowledged that even for someone who has NEVER ridden a bike before, this one may be objectively harder to learn how to ride because of its design.",10년 전,0,

@jackbandit2114,"Okay from watching the video I guess the main problem is trying to balance it on take off. I imagine once you get going it would be much easier to drive because you don't have to turn the handle bars much, if at all. I don't think the issue is you ""forget"" how to ride a bike. It just looks like balance issues and when you begin to lose balance on a bike you instinctively jerk the handles to orient yourself. It's like walking on a ledge and using your arms to balance yourself. If you somehow reversed the effects, you didn't forget how to talk, you just can't balance properly. I wonder if it would be as difficult to drive a car after reversing the steering wheel, with no balance to account for? I'm doing a lot of speculating, I really want to try your bike!!!

@robertwinermd,"IMO, this video while highlighting some important misinformation that the public holds, ultimately does a disservice to that same public by perpetuating the use of the same sloppy language that the public accepts as normal.  Please re-listen closely to the words he uses in the video’s early parts:   “no understanding”  “you didn’t understand”  you cannot change “your understanding” of it your head has a “rigid way of thinking”  Later after the Amsterdam “experiment” (not really an experiment in the scientific sense):  “freed the brain from a ""cognitive bias""  While rightly appealing to neuroscience, he sloppily phrases the situation using words that any reputable neuroscientist would abhor. This guy either doesn’t know or doesn’t care about what the word “cognitive” means to a neuroscientist. The whole paradigm of his “experiment” is not a “cognitive” one, but an experiment in an adult “learning” a novel somato-sensory task on top of an old one. Also to use the word “bias” here is a gross “misnomer” paired with the emotive subjective statements after the Amsterdam segment I “tried to explain” but “couldn’t get anyone to believe me.” People though I was “lying”. In my opinion he harms the public more than helps them by perpetuating rather than qualifying the use of emotive words, like “lying” even if it could be proved his claim that they believed he was “lying"" were true. I find it hard to believe that anyone would say that he was “lying” once they fully understood the “experiment.” So was he the one who “lying” by omitting an explanation to the people prior to “telling them” I can’t ride this normal bike.  His correct statements like: it took me, as an adult about eight months to learn how to ride the “reverse-steering bike” while it took his 3-4 year-old son about two weeks as evidence for the greater neuro-plasticity of youth, while true, didn’t or couldn’t re-test his son in a novel situation reverse his bike after a a new habit session. I hope that this kind of experiment has been done, but don’t know of it.  Lastly, his three final statements of what he learned are, IMO perpetuated indiscriminate and misleading thinking. At 6:40, he verbally list them as:  1 Welders are often smarter than engineers 2 Knowledge does not equal understanding 3 Truth is truth no matter what I think about it.   Wow.

@DanielSantaCruz,"This is pretty cool! I have experienced this in a different domain, and some some friends who seem to be pretty good at it. I, as most other people in the western world, learned to type at a very young age using a QWERTY keyboard. One day, a few years ago, I learned that there are other keyboard layouts out there, and took the time to learn to type in Dvorak.  Now, this was a very painful process. I would assume that it was somewhat akin to you learning to ride the backwards bike. Only that I'm a software developer, and my livelihood depends on me typing! Anyway, I avoided QWERTY keyboards for a very long time, trying to make sure that I would learn the new layout well.  Well, it turns out that I can't seem to go back now. It is hilarious! I KNOW where the keys are in a QWERTY keyboard, as witnessed by the fact that I don't have to hunt for them around when I'm tying on a smartphone, for instance, but I can't for the life of me touch-type in QWERTY anymore. It is very painful to try! Yes, almost as painful as it was to learn Dvorak in the first place -- the whole not being able to fly on a keyboard is very frustrating.  What I find amazing is that I have a friend who seems to be able to switch back and forth quite easily.  Maybe I just have to try for a bit and see!  Enjoyed you video, as always!",10년 전,0,

@silkogelman,"Awesome experiment and great insights Destin!  This reminds me of the time when I learned DVORAK, an alternative keyboard layout.   # (Un) Learning how to type At that time I was able to type in QWERTY pretty fast, but with 4 - 6 fingers, (a bad practice that I auto-learned while gaming and programming when I was young) and I knew I needed to learn how to type with 10 fingers to prevent repetitive strain injury in the future.  # Phase 1: QWERTY 10 finger mode I practiced typing QWERTY layout with 10 fingers for 30 to 60 minutes a day. The rest of the day I had to use my old 4 to 6 finger way of typing because I needed to be productive (I work behind a computer).  Man that was frustrating! I tried every day for a couple of weeks, but I just was not able to gain speed in ’10-finger mode’ in QWERTY layout, because when I tried to pick up speed my brain snapped into ‘4-6-finger mode’.   I decided this way of learning wouldn’t work. I found an alternative. It basically meant putting all the letters on the keyboard under different keys: using the DVORAK layout. (its easy to do by changing a setting on a PC / Mac).   # Phase 2: learning 10-finger typing in DVORAK Learning DVORAK in 10-finger mode was basically as easy as learning how to type a keyboard when you’ve never done so. You have to force yourself to practice every day, focus, and be very aware of to what position you want a specific finger to move.  Sometimes however I clicked back into in '4-6 finger QWERTY mode’. That often happened when I sat down behind the computer after a lunch break. Because now my keyboard layout was in DVORAK I could quickly detect the ‘error’, or the ‘mode’ I was in and I could force myself to switch by placing my fingers on the home row, slowly breathing in and out, feel the mode-switch and start typing in DVORAK layout with 10 fingers.  # Switching modes between QWERTY and DVORAK The thing is, I can still type in 4-6 finger mode on QWERTY layout when I sit down behing someone else's computer.  And I type in 10 finger mode in DVORAK on my own computer.  BTW I have a preference for DVORAK typing. To me typing in DVORAK feels relaxing, more free compared to QWERTY.  However I cannot type in 10 finger mode in QWERTY, and not in 4-6 finger mode in DVORAK. I could probably go one layer deeper and learn DVORAK in 4-6 finger mode and QWERTY in 10 finger mode, but I don’t see the point.  Another example about knowledge is not understanding: knowing where each letter is located on the keyboard doesn’t make one a great typist.",10년 전,0,

I get the impression that if you accelerated quickly and kept your hands off the handlebars, you could ride it without worrying about needing to apply reverse steering input from the handlebars.  Just utilize ""steer to the fall"" dynamics of bicycle design (not gyroscopic effect, which is negligible). I met a UC Berkeley professor who designed a reverse-trail designed bike which steered left if you leaned right (also negating the gyro effect theory of bicycle stability) and the reverse.  I rode it in just a few minutes; the prof. said he hadn't had anyone figure it out so quickly.  So what I'm saying is I think I could get it no hands.  Again, that assumes I'd be able to get the bike up to stable speed quickly enough - debatable for sure.  But steering ""normally"" on that bike would be impossible!    WONDERFUL video and experiment; and thank you so much for sharing!",10년 전,0,

So, when you turn ever so slightly to the right, you reflexively compensate to the left.  Except on this bike, you go more and more right, falling over before your conscious can even step in there and do anything about it.

@InsideGraphicsro,Actually the only thing that the brain had to reprogramme was your reaction when you fall out of balance. That was why it took you so long to master it and that is why it took so less to snap back to the normal one. Cause your reaction when you felt that you are going out balanced was to normally pull into the oposite direction but the bike does the exact opposite and it takes your brain some time to reverse the reactions.,10년 전,0,

Quick thoughts: - I'm sure I'm overestimating my ability to learn this thing - I think the seat should be higher/normal height to minimize over correction needed from the handlebars - I think an exercise to practice for this bike would be to associating the proper lean & handlebar turn combinations, e.g. turn left/lean right and turn right/lean left. A big thing that's learned, I believe, on a trad. bike is how leaning to a side is synonymous with turning to that side for most turns. Extremely tight turns actually force you do a bit of the opposite.  - After I fail miserably at riding this I want to see Danny MacAskill ride it.",10년 전,0,

Here's a basic behavioural interpretation of some of the facts you presented: first, you ride your normal bike in a certain way because that way of riding the bike (i.e. your behaviour) is the one that gives you the favourable consequences of moving forward without falls (i.e. reinforcer). Then, the situation changes with the altered bike (new ""environment"") and the old way of riding a bike (your old behaviour) no longer pays off (you fall and can hardly move). You try new ways of riding, and gradually, the ways of riding your new bike (i.e. your new behaviour) that subsist are the ones that allow you to move successfully (reinforcer).   This is not a demonstration of how knowledge differs from understanding, but a clear example of selection by consequences.",10년 전,0,

@ebn7722,"I actually believe the reason so many adults like to say that youg children learn better than them is only because they think themselves as ""trained"", mentally superior, What I mean is that since we've already learned in the past things that are standardized, going against the grain is like deprogramming our perception of learning. It's like learning a new language: many claim that they can't learn a new language, but they forget the native speaker learned it the same way the others did.   Another point is that when we acquire a certain mastery in something, modifying that mastery is modifying every single part of it from the bottom up. A child, which is still in the progress of learning, can ""easier"" (for an adult) learn other things because he didn't steadily keep the same habit for as long as the adult: it's completly normal if the ""different"" bike makes you fall, since you have to practice it.  For instance, you have been in the habit of riding the bike for such a long time that it became a complete reflex: if you ride a bike, you will have the sames muscular response for any bike. But for someone who is still relatively new to biking, or that is still learning, will be closer to the starting point than the mastery point.  Last, think about it a moment: a newborn has much more, for us, possibilities and paths of thinking than someone who has been introduced to the world. By teaching the newborn, you show it a particular path that he will start on. But he's still far from being as far as you, he can faster program himself ;-)",10년 전,0,

@Wavuvi_Speedruns,"This happens to me with a video game controller. I learned how to play first person shooters first on PC where I aimed with a mouse. Pushing the mouse forward looks down while pulling it away looks up. This was intuitive because my whole body wanted to lean that way: forward to look down and back to look up.  When my friend first handed me a controller to play Halo with him. This was my backwards bike. Up on the stick made me look up and down made me look down. This was counter intuitive to how I was use to doing this. I struggled to relearn the controls until I finally made some progress. But everyone once and while, my brain would slip back into the old method and I'd find myself staring at my feet instead of aiming upwards like I wanted to.  Just like the learning, un-learning, learning, I later found out that aiming had an option to inverse the Y-axes for a controller. As in, pushing up made you look down and down made you look up just like I was comfortable from on PC. Because I had already attempted to reteach myself to use the default method I could actually handle normal and inverse Y-axis controls.  Every once and a while the signals get mixed up and I'll use the wrong algorithm. I'll try to use normal Y-axis on a controller I have set to inverse and vise versa. At that point I have to take a minute to consciously remind myself which one I should be doing.   Now that's just my right hand. If I'm ever in a position to use a control stick to aim with my left hand I have absolutely no problem with the default up to look up and down to look down. My left hand had been trained completely the opposite from my right, and it actually confuses me greatly to have an inverted Y-axes for my left hand. This is because the left hand learned on a controller the default way first and never had practice to learn an inverted option like my right hand did.

It's because in my brain I'm not actually looking through the eyes of the character I'm controlling, in my brain I'm standing ever so slightly behind that character.  So when I want to look up, I do not move my mouse upward, I move my mouse down. This might seem weird, but since I'm 'behind' my character, in my mind I;m pulling he head backwards, thus the view goes up. Like someone pulling your hair. Your view goes up.   Friends of mine come over, try to play the game but always forget I play inverted. So they grab the mouse, and their first reaction is: AAARRGG. HOW CAN YOU PLAY LIKE THAT !! They HAVE to change the mouse back to non-inverted or else they can't hit a thing.  When they go home and I forget to revert the settings back to inverted, the first reaction I have when grabbing the mouse is: AARRRGGG !!!!!! HOW CAN THEY PLAY LIKE THIS !!  Some games on Playstation don't have an option to invert. It takes me like 10 minutes to adjust. Inverted I'm a really good player (if I might say so myself), after 10 minutes adjusting to non-inverted I'm far below average but I manage to walk, shoot and hit stuff.   I imagine this riding a bike works the same way. Would be nice to try it out some day as I ride a bike for 20km every school/workday for the past 20 years. Whats that... 80.000 km in total? Either I manage to adjust in a week or I will never ever be able to ride that thing :)",10년 전,0,

@BrettDanney,This is fascinating. I am going to throw you a curve ball. In order to turn a bike travelling above a certain speed you need to counter steer it. So if you want to go left you turn the handlebars right. Now this happens without you even realizing it. Test it out. The point I am trying to make is that I am sure anyone could ride the backward bike provided they did not have to start from standstill when counter steering is not in effect. Would be interesting to see if this is the case. Of course the wipe outs are going to be glorious so get the camera rolling.,10년 전,0,

Bacteria become things other than bacteria.

It is only in the first moments after starting you steer left to go left, etc. When you have a little speed, steering is by leaning- a very slight right steering impulse more quickly puts the machine into a left lean. The rake/trail geometry instantly puts the wheel back into alignment. It's not as though you actually go around the corner with your wheel turned the wrong way. Somehow the brain learns the transition point. Don't try steering your motorcycle that way at a walking pace.

@SapientPearwood,"Best line: ""I'm two levels deep into this"".  I don't think the dominant effect is the cognitive bias of this leaned skill. While I appreciate the bias on display wrt ""riding a bike"" having to be unlearned, there is another effect that seems to be dominant: proprioception and our instinctive understanding of rotation and torque.   In nearly all rotational systems, the angular direction of applied torque is in the same direction as the resultant angular motion, but here it's the opposite. This is akin to pushing on an object and having it move towards you. It is completely opposite to all previous experience, not just in the narrow context of riding a bike, but in a broader context of all previous interaction with rotational systems. So it's not fair to say that riding a normal bike precludes you from riding this bike, but instead interaction with any rotational system makes it so difficult.   This is not so much a cognitive bias as it is an instinctive, innate, and even proprioceptive understanding of torque and angular rotation. So riding this bike should have an effect on the order of wearing those inversion glasses. It is not a system governed by cognitive heuristics, instead it is governed by sensory heuristics.",10년 전,0,
@Criticalmindfulness,"I could ride it and explain why.   Also you are confusing movement, controlled by one portion of your brain with other portions that perform cognitive reasoning. You do not control movement with your conscious...that is all refined by your cerebellum and spine (spine for short) aka part of your subconscious.  Let's start with the fact that compared to your son, or pretty much any child, you are a blind man when it comes to awareness of your body aka proprioception.  Hint - I can tell by your posture.    Your son, on the other hand, uses all of his receptors to map his body giving his spine all the information it can to help process the movement needed.    You on the other hand, use less of your sensors (your balance sucks) and because of that you are using less muscles and lack coordination between muscles too.  If you raise your body awareness, which allows you to better map your body and coordinate muscles and insure all the muscles needed are used you could of learned at a faster rate and be even better at it.  Also, your not riding a bicycle, your riding a backward bicycle, which means, like any new task you have to learn it. Any comparison to the two is like comparing apples to bananas.  As for your bias theory. You lacking awareness of how your body works doesn't mean individuals can't change or be aware of their conscious biases.   On a side note, if you were more body aware, it would be even more easy to recognize and change consciously your biases and work on changing any subconscious biases.    Raise your awareness aka data/input and it is amazing how easy is to do things aka reason things out properly.  Compared to using limited data and trying to figure it out only to get it wrong...

@mistawankas,I would love to sit here and say it is not possible because it is reversed. But that isn't the case. The local bike shop has one of these.

But I seemed to have far more trouble than anyone else.  Eventually, I had a good day only messing up a few times.  But then one day after that, I made the key mistake of practicing again on the training facility wheel.  The next time I did roulette on the job, it was like I was starting all over again.  Ball out!  Ball out!  What was the deal?  Finally, a great supervisor looked at my spin and instantly spotted what I was doing wrong.  The track on the wheel where the ball is supposed to run is much higher than the one in the wheel in the training facility.  This explained why every time I tried to practice on one wheel made me worse at the wheels in the casino.  Now when I spin at the casino, I consciously override my natural instinct of holding the ball low in the wheel, as I had previously trained myself to do.  I'm not great yet, but at least when something goes awry, I finally know why.",10년 전,0,

@DelusionalLogic,"This seems highly pseudo-scientific to me.  You use neither the knowledge nor the understanding of how to ride a bike. And even if you did it wouldn't help you one bit. Riding a bike is a hugely complicated thing, like language or touch typing. It's something we can't possibly think about while doing it (it would simple be to slow). The brain is fascinating, because it can clear a pathway making that thinking automatic. Just like i don't have to think about how to breath (which muscles to contract), i also don't have to think about how ride my bike.  This is not knowledge or understanding. This is memory and neuroplasticity. I know how to type on a keyboard, and i understand. It's just immensely faster to offload that task to the lower levels of my brain, freeing the higher levels (where what is me lives) to thinking about the higher level things.  The ""experiment"" with your son is also obviously flawed (i know it wasn't that serious). It doesn't necessarily mean he has greater neuroplasticity, it just means he might not have the knowledge of how to ride a bike as deeply ingrained in him as adults do.  That is after all how the brain works. The more you think one way, the more you are inclined to think that way in the future. That goes for everyone.

People on bikes don't even notice this as the centre of gravity is so high it's easy to make you lean over. This is y so many people have a hard time learning to ride a motorcycle. Centre of gravity is much lover making you have to steer left a lot more to lean the bike to the right to make a right turn. If you watch a moto gp race you can see the riders do this out of corners.

When a bike tilts, the front wheel turns into the fall and it starts to turn This stabilizes the bike by generating a centrifugal force that pushes the bike upright. This modified bike does just the opposite. That is, it is unstable. This is easy to prove. Put this bike on your left and a regular bike on your right.  Jog forward pushing them both in the same way, without a rider. Then release them. This new bike will fall over sooner. So, you have just made a bike that is very hard to ride. It's a bit like a Segway in its stability properties...Of course after being on a very-hard-to-ride bike for months, its going to take a few minutes to switch back.",10년 전,0,

From seeing a number of people learn to ride this my take is that a backwards steering bike is not a bicycle, despite looking like one.

@MelindaGreen,"I bet I could ride it without all the unlearning. I know, good luck, right? Well here's how I'd do it: I wouldn't touch the handlebars! I can ride a bike no-hands pretty well. I might hold onto the crossbar or nothing at all. I'd suck at riding slowly but I think I could ride around just fine.  The funny thing about bicycles is how awkward they are to learn. That's because the bike does not do what you think it does. We initially think that if we want to turn right, then we need to first turn the wheel to point in that direction. That's the first thing we try as kids and we always fall. The reason for that is pretty simple: If all you do is turn the wheel to face right, the bike will go in that direction but you will not. You'll therefore fall to the left. What really happens when we learn to ride is that we set up our turn to the right by turning the wheel slightly left. That makes us start leaning (falling) to the right, and if we don't hold the handlebars firmly, the bike will turn itself to the right.  Try this: Ride a bike and get it coasting on a straight line. Then ride hands-off. Finally, take your right index finger and lightly push the right handlebar forward (to the left) and watch what happens. The handlebars will push back and you'll make a nice gentle turn to the right. To stop turning, you'll need to push the left handlebar forward.  Because of this counter-intuitive nature of bicycles, I also bet that it would be easier for kids to learn to ride a backwards bike, though that's probably not a good idea. I don't think it has to do with the plasticity of the young brain, it just requires a brain not already trained to ride a normal bike. All brains are quite plastic. You couldn't learn anything otherwise.",10년 전,0,

Would it make the (re)learning process much faster? ie easier to reprogram the brain with lesser variables? The scenario will be, to ride blind-folded. [Safety Watch - very dangerous in my opinion]. By concentrating on the balance and co-ordination of the peddling and handlebar motion, we remove a very strong biased input which is Sight. [Human are very much a visual animal].

@michaelmeissner3876,"The parallel I can draw here is to video games. Although not my career, I am, in my free time, a quite avid gamer. When it comes to video game control schemes; the basic platform/racing/shooter schemes, specific variants, and even switching between mouse-keyboard and joystick controller; I can reprogram my bias, to use the same terminology as Destin, quite quickly. I'll play Halo, for example, in which the reload button is RB (always for Halo, even in the recent ones in which that's not the default layout; yes, I'm that guy), and then switch to Call of Duty or basically any other shooter in which the reload button is X and RB is the grenade throw, and I'll throw grenades a few times when trying to reload then seamlessly transition into hitting X for the reload. When I first started gaming, that switch would takes sometimes an hour to finally click. Heck, I recently did that when I did an Army of Two marathon with my brother, and between games the control scheme changes entirely.  With switching control systems (i.e. mouse-keyboard and joystick controller), it can take much longer to get back in my groove, despite there not being any controls to confuse. Unlike with control schemes and even the handlebar direction as demonstrated by Destin, there's no familiarity between control systems, it's totally unfamiliar for a while. Although for movement, joysticks have any advantage to keyboards, when it comes to looking and aiming, the mouse trumps the joystick easily (in my experience). Even so, when I played Borderlands 2 with a wired Xbox 360 controller for a while because my mouse died, switching back to the mouse-keyboard system was really awkward for about a day.  I'm not sure if this should be surprising or unsurprising, but in my experience, regardless of what control system you're using or switching between or not, going back and forth between games and control schemes of totally different play styles, say a racing game and a shooter, is almost always immediate and flawless. I could play Halo on my Xbox for a while, switch to some Need For Speed: Underground on my computer (I know, keyboard for racing games sucks) for a month, and hop right back on Halo and it would be like nothing ever changed.

@paulgracey4697,"A somewhat similar re-learning experience happened to me when I bought my recumbent bicycle, a Lightning P-38. Unlike many popular recumbent bikes the P-38 is less a cruiser than it is a land speed racer built originally to have an aerodynamic fairing for the record attempt, so it is rather twitchy without the enclosure.  I learned that  the upright bikes I had been riding since childhood were steered with a combination of balanced unequal pedal pressure and the delicate adjustments to handlebar steering that compensates for the alternating lean that pedaling produces. I had to learn bike handling done completely by steering motions alone by coasting at first before gingerly applying very even pedaling pressures. The trick is to steer the front wheel to get it underneath the the slight bias to one side or the other, i.e. steer under the fall that will occur if the bike continues to lean further. Eventually the motions will get smaller and the death grip on the bars will get minimized. Ten years after I bought the bike, and had  equipped it with a fairing which smoothed out its twitchy steering for my commutes to work, I retired early and rode solo across the USA on that bike, only falling once in the whole 4000 mile trip due to soft sand at the edge of the road.",10년 전,0,

However,  I somehow feel this is not the complete story. To me it looks like riding a ""normal"" bike is inherently more stable than a backwards bicycle. This may have something to do with weight shift etc. For example. Can you ride the backwards bicycle without holding the steering wheel with your hands? This is easy to do with a normal bike (for a Dutch person :). A scientific test for this ""inherently unstable"" bike theory would be this: Measure the steering input that you give to a normal bike, versus the input that you give on a backwards bike on the same track. If the backwards bike is indeed more unstable, I would expect to see more steering corrections (both in frequency and amplitude).",10년 전,1,
@BYMYSYD,"The problem is when you learn how to ride a bike, your brain builds shortcut pathways to adjust your steering when you go off balance.  When you ride the ""backwards bike"" your brain still has those learned pathways so as soon as you deviate just a little off balance, your brain will send the fast signals to adjust (the wrong way)...and you become more unbalance.",10년 전,0,

Adults, in a language class try to learn 100% of the words and don't use the part of the brain that guesses.

However, at regular/high speeds even with handlebars that wouldn't be possible though  A bike with reversed handles would work the same as a normal bike if the handles weren't being used. That said, it might still be a bit difficult to get up to proper speed.

Go at above 20kph and the bike will track on it's own, and from my experience at around 30 small bumps and potholes don't matter even when riding with no hands.  I can easily take off my jacket and put it in my rucksack all while driving and following a curved road.

@paradigmstorytime,"superdau  IF you have suspension 30kph will absorb bumps. I don't have suspension on my huffy beach cruiser.

Which is what happened with my mountain bike that had supsension, hit a bad patch of sand going 47kph, got speed wobble and was thrown from the bike. ***** As stated previously I tend to cruise at 40-50Kph, at those speeds the handlebars can get speed wobble if you aren't careful.

You should make that a long term test and show us the results in - let's say one year.  To me, as a drummer, this seems like it would be similar to learning to play beats with inverted hands or on ceiling-mounted drums where you hit them on the upstroke while the feet still perform their tasks the exact same way.

@elektro3000,"Fascinating subject. About fourteen years ago I taught myself to type on a DVORAK layout keyboard by switching my PC from QWERTY to DVORAK, taping a printout of the layout to my monitor, and typing on it every day. In a few weeks I had regained my old typing speed and then surpassed it. I assumed that I had lost the ability to type on a QWERTY keyboard, so I tried it...and after a few seconds, slipped back into typing smoothly on the QWERTY layout. To this day I can switch between the two layouts in a second or so. It almost feels like I'm flipping a switch...probably that same feeling you got when you rediscovered the ability to ride a normal bike.

@pauloneil1969,"This is not quite the same, but driving a 911GT3 (rear engine) on a racetrack and a BWM (front engine) has similar things that happen and you just have to accept them - and if you tried them in the other car you will most definitely spin out at each corner.  I first learned track driving in a 911gt3 and spent years doing it without driving any other car on a track - and everything the really fast 911GT3 people teach you, you just accepted as absolute truths - you have to do it or else it ends very, very badly. So as you get faster and faster it becomes completely natural and you have no other skill set or believe there is a different technique that would be necessary in a front engine car. Then came the day that I rented a BMW 320 race car for a weekend at VIR (Virginia International Raceway). In preparation for the event I watched video of 2 top racers driving that actual car that I rented on the track that I was going to be on - and I just could not accept the positions that the car were placed in, where the throttle was applied, where the brakes were applied - but the biggest disbelief was the car's angle during the turns compared to how a 911GT3 would take the corner - it was outside my belief zone - it was impossible because if you did that in a GT3 you would crash every single corner. It was a 3 day track event and it took me until the 3rd day, in the afternoon, to make the mental leap, I actually decided just to force my brain to do something in a corner that I knew was impossible in a GT3 and I expected to crash - but I didn't - the car stuck and I made the corner. Because I had race insurance on the car, I was ready to pay the deductible, and I expected to, because I wanted to go home saying I tried it - and when I made it, my brain was at first floored that it worked and by the very next lap my brain embraced it and then took it further.

@nevyn,"I love love love the plasticity of the brain! I'm certain that most of the things we learn we don't learn as 'knowledge' (information to retrieve from the brain as a harddrive), but as 'understanding' (a skill that you have extended your brain with, making it a natural part of it, just as throwing a ball is a natural part of it). Certainly true for physical skills but likely also true for mental tasks (empathy, programming, writing, speaking).  The best way to show this to me is the monkey that learns to control a robot arm as if it was his own. I don't think most people realize the gravity of that change: the robot arm was wired up to mirror his own physical arm. It took some time to learn, but then he could control it, and it mirrored his arm. After a while, his nerves and brain realized that they were hooked up to two different things, and separated the signals!! He could now control his arms and the robot arm separately! Talk about plasticity!  The same process is happening when you're learning to bike, riding a car, using a keyboard, playing an FPS game... At first, you are using knowledge, transporting information through long chains of command in your brain to control it. Then, after using it for long enough, your brain internalizes the knowledge and the bike or game controller is a part of your body.  I'm also pretty certain that Destin could learn both kinds of bikes, and learn to switch between these neural paths at will, with enough practice. For example, if you commonly use two completely different keyboard layouts you will at first be very confused and type wrong all the time. After a while, your mind will pick up cues as to which model it should use, and it starts always using the correct one.",10년 전,0,

Since I got used to the US keyboard layout for programming, I always get thoroughly annoyed when using the Swedish keyboard layout and '(' and ')' aren't where they're supposed to be. This cognitive dissonance is the reason I haven't put in the effort to learn Colemak or Dvorak, even though I've been interested in trying them, as I imagine occasionally switching back to standard QWERTY would be many times worse.",10년 전,0,

@orygunner3827,"All two wheel vehicles steer and balance by what's called ""countersteering."" What this basically means is that to turn, the bike must lean, and to lean, you actually steer the handlebars in the opposite direction. To turn the bike left, you have to apply a certain amount of steering to the right, which makes the bike lean left, then the bike turns left. Same thing for keeping the bike balanced. If the bike is starting to fall to the right, you steer into it to the right, which brings the bike back into balance.  On a bicycle, where the person outweighs the bike by quite a bit, it's not as obvious because shifts in weight also help balance. But on a motorcycle that outweighs the rider, shifting weight does almost nothing, and countersteering (input on the bars) is what steers the motorcycle and balance at low speeds.",10년 전,0,

@RyanGribble,"Destin, it's all about muscle memory. That's why in Amsterdam your brain clicked back. I am a concrete pump operator. We have wireless remote controls for our booms. It is something that you get used to and can operate without even looking at the controls. Now usually my remote box that I use has the main section on the left hand stick. My back up remote is backwards as main is on the right hand. After running a left hand main box for years, I had to run my back up right hand main box. It took me about a week of every day telling myself that it's backwards before my brain clicked and it became natural to me. I ran this for about a month till my main box was fixed. This time it was shorter to get used to the way things had been for years, about 3 days before my brain clicked back. This only lasted a month before the main box broke again and I had to switch back to my back up box. However the transition time was even shorter, about a day and a half. I have found that every time I switch boxes the transition time is shorter until it finally had evened out. Now when I switch remote boxes, it only takes about a half day before my brain clicks. I bet if you continuously transitioned back and forth between a normal and backwards bike you'd find the same thing.",10년 전,0,

@RayDrouillard,"Your next assignment is to learn to switch back and forth at will.  By the way, I'm not at all surprised.  A number of years ago, I tried to ride one of those tri-cycles that the old folks ride.  I couldn't do it.  I would keep steering back and forth -- reacting to the fact that the trike wasn't leaning.  The physics involved is that, to turn right, you first turn left in order to make yourself tilt to the right.  Then, you turn to the right just enough to maintain the desired angle.  That is, your center of mass is directly above the wheels in your laterally accelerating frame of reference.  Once you are pointed in the right direction, you turn harder, which lifts your center of mass and puts it over the wheels according to gravity.  It's actually the same set of reflexes that you use to back up a trailer.  So when I tried to turn the trike, it wasn't leaning like it should and I was actually feeling the lateral acceleration -- something that I wouldn't be feeling on a real bicycle.",10년 전,0,

@mdog999,"I think a motorcycle rider (such as myself) would have an easier time learning to ride this bike than those who do not ride motorcycle. While riding a motorcycle, to turn with speeds under 12-15 mph, you turn the handlebars like a bicycle (turn left to go left). However, going faster than 12-15 mph, the motorcycle behaves in a different way, and you have to counter-steer. This is when you turn the handlebars left and will actually veer right. Motorcycle riders do this all the time, and constantly switch between normal steering and counter-steering due to speed. I think this process of constantly switching back and forth would make motorcycle riders have an edge in regards to riding this bicycle. Also I have not ridden this bicycle, so I do not know for sure. This is my personal opinion and I could be wrong. Any thoughts of this idea?",10년 전,0,

The few very clumsy seconds in which the kid and the talker show riding the bike gave me a strong impression that it cannot be ridden like a normal bike because of some inherent mechanical instability. Normal bicycles tend to stabilise while rolling, even without a rider (because of torque)? This one seems to suffer from torque acting on the opposite direction, making it fall naturally. Two simple experiments could clarify on this: i) letting the bike go in a straight line without anyone riding, then with someone not steering; ii) actually showing someone who learnt to ride this bike without having to fight against it every second.  Maybe others who know more about mechanics and bikes than me would have something to add?",10년 전,0,

@SteveJones172pilot,"I had a similar experience when I first learned to ride a motorcycle..  I started off on a little side road, just riding very slowly, which worked fine, because I was used to riding a bike, but every time I got to a certain speed, the gyroscopic forces came into play, and the way you steer HAS TO change.  If you want to go right, you must lean right, which makes your steering actually turn slightly to the left..  or, you can push the handlebars slightly LEFT which will force you to lean right because of the gyroscopic forces, and actually turn to the right.  This ONLY happens over a certain speed, and it took me DAYS to figure this out.  Now, it's completely intuitive ""just like riding a bike"", but for the first few days, every time I went over a certain speed, I would automatically drive off the road because the motorcycle began turning opposite of how I thought it should work.  I have always theorized that there must be one certain speed (at least specific to that bike) at which the gyro forces exactly counteract the ""normal"" turning forces of the bike, and it would be impossible to turn, but I never could figure out exactly what speed the switchover happens..  If you have a motorcycle, try it..  Driving down a small road with no traffic at about 10 mph, notice that you steer ""like a bike"" in the manner you're accustomed to, but then by the time you're going 30 or so, you will see that if you're steering (and staying in control) that the handlebars go the wrong way.  You WILL go out of control if you try to force the handlebars in the direction you want to turn.  I never heard anyone else really describe this phenomena before or since but I've always found it fascinating.",10년 전,0,

@treschlet,"I had an awesome conversation with a nice black lady at the rental counter at Home Depot in Baltimore this weekend (for reference, I'm white). We got talking about all the protests, and race stuff in general, and how much of it is race, and how much of it is class, and how it's all mixed together because of the last several hundred years of history in this country. One of my points when talking about this stuff to people who don't think racism really still exists that much is that I, a nice white Iowan boy who grew up in the suburbs, had very open minded parents, and has never been threatened by a black person in any way, still notice myself reacting differently to a black person walking up the street than a white person. I have some in-built racism. It's not conscious, I don't like it, I actively fight back against it, but it's there. I didn't put it there. Other people put it there, and not even people close to me.  I think that a big problem is that this is pretty normal for a large portion of  our population, but people are ashamed to admit it. That's why they don't want to talk about it, because deep down they know they're racist. They have bias. They probably HATE that they have bias, but it's there. Stop being ashamed of it, it's not your fault, accept it and do what you can to counter that bias in yourself, and more importantly, do what you can so the next generation has less of it programmed into them from the start!  Thanks, Destin! I'm going to share this video with people when I'm trying to make this point. Because I mean, almost everyone can relate to riding a bicycle! It's such an innocent topic. A little easier to approach than saying to someone ""you're a racist and you don't even know it!""  For the record, the lady really appreciated that I recognized my privilege, whether I liked it or not, and that I recognized my bias, whether I liked it or not. She looked like she just had 100 lbs. lifted off her shoulders. Don't be afraid to talk about it, people! You have bias, whether you like it, or know it, or not.

@mrc109,"Destin, this was a fantastic experiment! I am glad you made your own demonstrator unit. I was wondering if you slowed down the rate of turn by changing the ""gear ratios"" if it might be easier to learn how to ride? You have what looked like a 1:1 ratio. Do you think a 2:1 (Handlebar to front fork turning ratio) might be easier??? One last thing. As a lifelong motorcycle rider (45+ years if you include mini-bikes). I have noticed a somewhat strange steering effect that takes place whenever one rides a two wheeled vehicle over 10 to 15 miles per hour.  I think the correct term  for this effect is called ""countersteering"".   In order to turn a motorcycle or bicycle around any type of turn, or make circles in a parking lot, one must instinctively learn to countersteer. This looks a lot like what you are doing on your bike.  Countersteering effects will become functionally, operationally mandatory I will guess at speeds greater than 5 mph. At speeds less than 5 mph, turning left will produce in effect a ""left turn"". However at speeds greater than 5 mph, making a left turn handlebar input to the front forks will likely throw you off your bike face first. In order to turn left at >5 mph speed one must learn to countersteer slightly by turning the handlebar to the right, while simultaneously changing your effective center of gravity (CG) so that it is slightly ""left"" of an imaginary center line axis drawn from the center of the fork tube headset, to the middle of the rear axle.   The higher the forward speed, the greater the shift of the body's CG away from the imaginary centerline. For normal highway geometry, while traveling at the indicated maximum speed limit, the turn radius built into the roadway surface will require only a slight shift in the operators CG combined with only a slight amount of countersteer input towards the ""right"". Sometimes this countersteer effect can be so small that you don't even notice that you are doing it. However (from personal experience) if one greatly exceeds the maximum speed limit for what appears to be a slow turn or a slight ""bend"" in the road,  one quickly finds out the hard way how important it is to ""set up"" for a turn well in advance of what one would do for that same turn taken at normal traffic speeds. 100 mph is excessive speed on virtually any public road, even on most highways which are designed for normal traffic speeds greater than 60 mph.  Rural roads are a completely different matter, an indicated 45 mph maximum speed limit should indicate to anyone with half a brain that speeds of 100 mph or so can and likely will, exceed the typical forces necessary to negotiate even a mild bend in the road. It only took one incident of the above situation for the working part of the right side of my brain to learn the importance of proper lane position, my now greatly offset center of gravity, and the mandatory countersteering effects, applied early and steadily throughout the turn.  Countersteering is not a mind, cognitive awareness input kind of thing. The more you look at it while you are in the middle of doing it, the more strange it appears to be.  Centripetal forces, gyroscopic forces, vehicular speed, wind direction and speed, road configuration and which side of the road you are on, all factor into the equation for how to negotiate any turn, on any bike, at speeds above 5 mph. You can probably explain the physics of turning a two wheeled vehicle much better than I can. Get a helmet cam and find someone with more than half a brain who also races motorcycles, and ask them to record what all goes into the making of a high speed turn, on a closed racetrack somewhere. I think you might be a little surprised at what you will see. I can't explain it, I just do it without thinking about it (it's easier that way).  mrc109",10년 전,0,

@NoceboX,"I do know, to some extent the feeling of that 'click' you mentioned. When learning to fly my rc drone, I could fly it away from me just fine because pushing left on the control stick moves the drone left and right goes right. The moment the drone turns to face me pushing left moves the drone right - so the controls are reversed. It took me a few months to learn to do the 'switch' when I turn my rc drone to face me, and as you said, the slightest distraction would cause me to revert to my original left = left, right = right train of thought. One thing that helped me is the continual thinking of relativity. The drone always goes left when I push left, but relative to me, it goes right only when it faces me.

I say this, because, I too learned how to ride a bicycle whilst very young. I also learnt how to ride a horse. Similarly to how the directions are reversed on your backwards bike, when you ride a horse, to get the horse to turn, you pull the reigns on the side opposite to that you wish to go in.  Thus:  Riding a Bike: Turning Left + Forward Motion = Going Left. Turning Right + Forward Motion = Going Right.  Riding a Horse: Turning Left + Forward Motion = Going Right. Turning Right + Forward Motion = Going Left.  It would be really interesting to see what the result was if you found somebody who knows how to ride both a horse & a bike to see if they can ride the backwards bike straight away if told to ride the bike like riding a horse. :)",10년 전,0,

Years ago (about 8) I hoped on one of see and could ride it in about 5 minutes, same with all of the other employees.  This is where I need to intreject. I think what he is discussing may back a phenomenon more so conceded to you typical day to day cyclist or rider. Not an avid cycling enthusiast. Also, what I think was a HUGE help, is that for us mountainbikers, it was easier to adapt due to our comfort with oversteering, or counter steering when the rearwheel brakes loose (think skid).",10년 전,0,

@LeNapo111,"SmarterEveryDay  Being a physics major, I know it's there's a danger to oversimply things when it involves the phrase ""It boils down to.."" but I'm going to do it anyway. My thinking is that it seems like it boils down to the moment when the bike starts to fall off sideways but since the controls are inverted, instead of countering the fall by steering to the opposite direction, they help the fall by steering to the same direction as the fall, e.g. if the rider feels the bike falling to the left, the rider's instinct based on previous experiences with the traditional bikes is to go right, but since the controls are inverted, the bike is directed to the left, and thus, the rider immediately falls.  I have two propositions for an experiment: a.) The cognitive bias, as you refer to it, seems to stem from our previous experience with handling the bike. My question is, can you teach a child who hasn't learned how to ride the proper bikes to ride this with ease?  b.) I'm curious to see how gamers who use inverted controls when playing a video game. They've got the right orientation. I have tried inverted but I just cannot wrap my brain around how to do it.  If you could set any of these up, that would be amazing!",10년 전,0,

@AlexPope1668,"It reminds me about what pro athletes say about their sports. NHL goalies and MLB batters have said if they think about making the save or hitting the ball, they're far less likely to do it. The puck and the ball get to a point where they move too fast for the eye-to-brain-to-muscles-to-correct position response to occur, so It has to come down to creating a reflex (or muscle memory) response to take place - which basically just takes a certain amount of practice to achieve.  So I think the ""backwards"" bike is a lot like a good knuckleball*. I think it goes against the programming of the muscle memory so much that it locks the brain up and they're unable to adjust quick enough to make the save or hit the ball.  this is also a term used in hockey when the puck was shot in such a way that makes it spin end over end, and travel significantly slower than it would have were it to remain flat, not spinning*.  **funny how the knuckleball, in baseball, is effective because it doesn't spin (much), whereas the knuckleball, in hockey, is effective because it does spin.",10년 전,0,

When you are on a motorcycle you know that you have to lean in the direction that you are turning but put pressure opposite to that direction on the handle bars.  The more pressure the sharper the turn.  You don't try to move the front wheel in the direction you are turning.    While riding a bicycle  if you are going fast enough you don't have to turn the handlebars at all, just lean in the direction you want to go.    If you note the early parts where your son is riding his small bike he's not moving the handle bars very much.  But when he gets on the backwards bike he is.  Why?",10년 전,0,

You also keep mentioning ""way of thinking"" and ""bias"", when technically it is, but, for example, learning how to make a perfect shot in basketball has nothing to do with ""way of thinking"" and ""bias"".

I've also gone without riding a bike for several years more than once in my life. It's not quite as they say.  I honestly think gamers are probably more familiar with this than most. Switching between normal and inverted? Switching between gamepads on competing platforms? Changing control schemes on a favorite franchise? Heck, some games even switch control schemes depending on the level! These are all regular happenings in video game land. Not only can you adapt, but you can also learn to jump between different controls easily.  I've felt that snap before as well, when your mind switches back to the old grooves that seem forgotten. You can do so much when you know your mind and body well enough.  Have you ever learned to balance something on your finger? How about your chin? How about your foot? You can feel how long it takes to send an impulse to move a limb.  Have you ever learned to play an instrument? How about drums, with each limb acting simultaneously and independently, keeping separate rhythms? Once you get it, it feels so good. I imagine it's like driving a manual vehicle.  How about doing something that requires some hand-eye coordination while your tired? Have you ever consciously switched on that short reserve of focus and energy to pull it off anyway?

@test18258,"Lt. Mogar i've tried playing video games with both inverted and regular controls, and its similar to what destin had with the bike I cant do it immideately, but I can switch very quickly (within a few minutes) for me with video games its just a matter of how I think of it, If I think of it as if im either flying a plane(the only place where inverted controls should be allowed) or in a third person perspective its a really fast transition.

@Shiralkian,"Lt. Mogar I don't think gamers would have an easier time because when you're playing a game with inverted controls you don't have to deal with your sense of balance. But for the bike, your reflexes are going to move the bike's handle to keep it steady before you can even notice you were losing balance in the first place, and those reflexes didn't get the memo that the controls are inverted so they're only going to make it worse.

You feel mentally handicapped for a few weeks when trying to type, since you have to unlearn all of the ""muscle memory"" you've built up over years of typing. Eventually you get comfortable enough to type, and then it's hard to go back. The difference is that it's much more incremental than the bike riding thing.  If you're crazy enough to do the experiment, I recommend getting a keyboard with native support or reprogram-ability.

@masterimbecile,"I think what may have happened to you when you first learned to ride that bike is that riding a bicycle also involves shifting your center of gravity (e.g. leaning left for left turn; you wouldn't lean right, or you'll fall). This involves constant, though minimal, activation of your core and back muscles (the so called ""muscle tone""). We do this unconsciously when standing, walking, lying down, etc. You probably tensed up a lot in the beginning, no? Before your brain gets used to the new bike, the core muscles are probably not activated in the optimal way.  To help maintain posture, these muscles must constantly contract, and the opposing muscle will contract later to correct the first contraction (muscles don't ever extend; they're just pulled by another piece on the other side of it). Doing so too much/little results in poor muscle tone and, in your case, loss of balance.  Anyways, keep up the good work! :oD",10년 전,0,

What I think this shows is that most of your actions while riding a bicycle are handled by your cerebellum in other words, they never reach your conscious brain – you don't think about balancing while riding your bike.  By reversing the steering, you have to use your higher brain functions to overrule your reflex-like handling of a bicycle. This is hard, because those reflexes operate at a lower level. Once you've done that though, you've rewired your cerebellum to handle the reversed steer. As you showed, unlearning that requires some time, although thankfully not as much as learning the reversed steering once took.",10년 전,0,

@G33RTJEH,"Hey Destin, There is a faster way to learn such a thing: If you can drive a bike without using your hands, try to steer with one hand on the pivot point. Since you're not used to do this, it will take a few hours, but you will succeed. Next, keep both hands next to each other, and you'll see your hands/arms won't co-operate at first, but in a short amount of time you'll succeed again. From then on, it's just about separating your hands. It's the same deal with driving a four wheeled vehicle, with the added difficulty of keeping your balance. This is an often used Practical Joke in Forklift-maintenance shops",10년 전,0,

As long as you're going straight, you can just use your hips and tighs to hold the bike in the upright position and keep the front wheel as straight as you can, then it's ""just"" matter of turning the pedal without leaning too much, which is acheived by switching to a very high gear. Emphasis on ""just"". I've blown about 35$ on that thing, made everyone else in the line both hate me and laugh at me, but the 10$ prize and infinite satisfaction was worth it. Though, neither of these tricks would apply to this video, since cruiser has no upper tube in its frame to hold onto, and you can't put any weight on the steering wheel to keep it straight.

One day, i found another one of these arcade games elsewhere where for some reason, somebody turned the joystick 180 degrees around and for me it was completely backwards. I vowed to learn the new way to play and kept crashing at moments that i would have automatically or reflexively turned. I did finally learn how to use the joystick either way. then from that point on...but i also kept going back to the old one, so i was able to do both. thereafter, whenever i had the chance to, i learned certain things ""two (or more) ways."" and i found that if you start learning controls to a game for example, or some other activity that becomes automatic, but you do so in the different ways from the start, it's easy to switch back and forth between the two ways and you get good at both. so for the bike, i would say often ride both kinds and they both will become easier at the same time.",10년 전,0,

@ruolbu,"It is a bit like handling an airplane in a videogame or moving a 3rd person camera. Games have different approaches to this. When I push the stick for the camera to the right, does that mean I want the perspective to move right or do I want the camera to move right - which would move the perspective to the left. When pushing the stick up, do I want the plane to move up or do I want to push the nose down? In videogames especially in flying scenarios these things are so common that an ""inverse y-axis"" option is nearly always given. Some people learn it one way and others another way, and most don't want to go through the relearning process.  But I've experienced that it is possible to be fluent in switching between two settings. Usually I control planes by pushing the nose down when the stick is pushed up. Push up = plane moves down. One time I was using not a stick but a D-Pad (basically four directional buttons for you non console players ;) ) The thought concept of pushing the nose down when pressing up felt very wrong, rather it was intuitive to think of the direction I want to go: Push up = planes moves up. Once I had that down I could switch between Stick and Buttons on the fly. My body basically did the same movements with my thumb to cause opposing effects. It was the feeling of a stick or a button under my thumb that triggered the concept I would use. The amazing thing, once I realised that, I did some playing around, trying to apply the button-concept to the stick control. And after lots of training it worked. I could use the stick for both. I just had to get in the right mind set for how I thought about what I wanted to do. To I want to indicate the direction I want to go or do I want to push the nose in a certain direction? When I really tried I could switch the control settings and keep using the stick without much trouble.  Of course videogames and riding a bike are two different levels of complexity. I don't think the word ""unlearning"" really fits here. You've shown that you could still ride a bike like you did a year ago. What tripped you up, was that you did not yet learn to handle both settings and switch on the fly. I have no idea how long that would take in this case. It probably involves a mind trick to focus on one aspect of handling that feels completely different to trigger your body into using the right control-concept for the control-scheme of the current bike.",10년 전,0,

@jamesgrimwood1285,"So... after 20 or so minutes of ""re-calibration"" can you switch between the two bikes?  And if so, after enough practise, do you think you'd be able to switch between them without thinking?  You see, the process of learning is what I went through when learning to roller skate last year so I could play roller derby. At every training session there would be a frantic 10 minutes of me simply trying to stay balanced, never mind moving. Then suddenly something would switch on in my head and all the previous week's skills would suddenly come back. Six months on I just strap skates to my feet and off I go, no thinking required.",10년 전,1,

However when you can't rely on your body to work all that out, then the brain has to take over while your muscle memory starts to learn again (takes longer the older you get).

@elainemarie9470,"Not just welders are smarter than an engineer.  LOL. Sorry, but it's true.  Problem is, many engineers believe they are smarter than anyone else.  This is a misbelief, and encouraged by well-meaning, but misguided, schoolteachers.  Plus, a mild form of Asperger's syndrome, adds to the mix. I was very blessed to be the first born of two gifted scientists, in the 1950s.  My father was a genius, and I inherited this IQ, as well, but barely Mensa level.  He had a higher quotient than I. He was a military code breaker, and an inventor for Hewlett-Packard.  One of his inventions was fiber optic systems for gas chromatograph analyzers and other qualitative & quantitative instrumentation, that, ironically, I ended up operating as a teenager, in my work. My mother was an environmental scientist, and earned an MS degree in the field. I was gifted in math & science, and in middle school, I was psychologically tested, because I was considered such an outlier, statistically.  At the time of puberty, females drop their excellence in math & science.  Whereas, at all-girl schools, this phenomena did not occur. It appeared that ""dumbing down"" was expected for girls, in order to garner dates with boys.  Oh my.  I was actually told, on numerous occasions, to do this.  I needed to fulfill myself as a woman, to become a wife, and bear children, as my mother often told me.  And that I was too picky about my dates. My mother actually had to obtain permission from her husband, to work outside of the home (!!!).  Additionally, by the end of elementary school, I'd pretty much read every book in my city's public library.  So I'd developed a vocabulary that none of my peers could understand.  Nor adults. I learned to ""act like a bimbo"" to be more popular.   Well, my social experiment worked.  Like this video demonstrates, I lost my neurological plasticity, and could not reverse the process.  Sometimes an advanced word would slip out, and I grew weary of trying to explain what these words meant.  Also, I was perceived as being arrogant :(.  Which, I did/do have the attribute.  Learned behavioral traits, from both parents.  Wasn't avoidable. I had a rather ""va-voom"" way about me, I was passionate about fashion, and men would be quite shocked to discover I was very intelligent. By age 17, I'd taught chemistry, algebra, and mathematics.  I also worked in a laboratory.  I had already studied engineering at Stanford University, and was awarded a full scholarship. I wasn't able to attend college, as planned.  I had to live independently, and at various times, become the guardian for some of my younger siblings.  Tragic circumstances.  I was working in municipal Public Works, after high school, at a job that required a Chemistry degree.  It was easy for me.  Besides being the only female at a water quality treatment plant, in an industrial region, I had to share the men's room for four years, and endure being harrassed.  But, I still loved my job. What drove me to distraction, was trying to make engineering plans and infrastructure to actually work in real life.  Thank goodness I'd learned ""tinkering"" skills from my father.  I even earned certifications as a plant operator. I often worked in tandem with engineers, who made it very clear to me that they were superior to a mere chemist, like myself. If a group of people lacked common sense, I'd have to nominate engineers.  I did earn a BS in Chemistry, and worked for ten years in totality, but I found it way too boring.  I found psychology, marketing, PR, entrepreneurship, and people fascinating & challenging.  I earned two university degrees in the field, and wish to complete my PhD. I LOVE helping the less fortunate, as a clinical social worker.  My skill set and aptitudes for problem-solving, were so helpful in case management, psychotherapy, and developing/implementing training curriculum.  I love to be entertaining, and learning about cultural competency.  I was usually tapped to provide in-service seminars, for licensing requirements (I'm very diverse ethnically and had a minority-look phenotype).  I had always believed that one could never forget riding a bicycle.  From ages 5 to 11, my family of origin lived in a flat region.  I had a large two wheel bicycle, mastered in kindergarten.  I used to ride without using the handlebars, and could stand up on the seat, while riding.  I used to be a gymnast, so this physical flexibility I incorporated into cycling. Several years ago, I wanted to take up cycling.  For some reason, I struggled with balancing.  What I didn't know, was that I was about to go into an acute phase of pain & paralysis, from a long standing autoimmune epigenetic disease that affected my CNS (central nervous system) and brain functioning.    For a quick self-demo about ingrained neuronal pathways, try clasping your hands together, but laced the opposite of your normal fashion.  I.e., if your right thumb is usually on top, now re-do to have your left thumb dominant.  At first, it almost feels painful.  However, after a few tries, the switch kicks in, and you now find both patterns feel natural.  TYFS, very funny vid.  Your son is adorbs!",10년 전,0,

@sapp5826,"While the brain will surely take a while to get used to a new ""control scheme"", I think the problem is also mechanical. The handlebar of bicycles is designed to stabilise the bike as you drive, if your center of mass is shifted to the right, the - for this very reason angled - front wheel will move to the right relative to the center of mass. To illustrate, try riding a bicycle with a perfectly upright handlebar (some foldable bicycles let you do that). It's almost impossible, and only works with a lot of counterbalancing. (You can ride a normal bicycle hands-free without problems, as long as the front wheel is not upright and the steering is not inverted.)",10년 전,0,

@GeneBurnett,"Leaning has nothing to do with the ability to turn a bike. The weird thing about riding a regular bike is that when you turn right you are actually pushing the handlebars to the left. If you turn the handlebars to the left you will turn towards the right. Practice this in a parking lot please. It will blow your mind. You've been doing this ever since you started riding. It feels like you turn the handlebars to the right to go right but it's not so. Ride slowly across a parking lot and forcefully turn the handlebars to the right and feel the bike go left. In order to ride this backwards bike you have to turn right to go right, instead of left which you've done all along. I know this seems crazy but it's true. The problem of neuro-plasticity is another issue. You do have to learn a new way but it's not the new way you think it is. Seriously though, do not practice this on the road, it is dangerous and once you get it, it will blow your frickin' mind. Once you do get it...really...just forget about it or it will drive you crazy. Just go back to thinking you turn right to go right. ;~)",10년 전,0,

I learnt to ride Motorcycles at the age of 5 and my dad said I was a natural.  I didnt get my first pushbike until I was 11, a 11 year old with training wheels and I seriously couldnt ride the thing, I had the balance and control right because of 6 years racing dirt bikes but the movement my legs tried to peddle I would completely throw myself off and I would instantly lose both balance and control instantly.    Took forever, lots of weekends, to learn how to peddle without stopping the balance and steering and yeah and it was like you describe... click, and I instantly had it, but anything surprised me (like dad screaming ""You got it"") while riding a push bike and instant stack!  I got my motorcycle road licence when I was 16, and I was set for life... goodbye pushbike.  Then one day at around 25, the motorbike was in the shop getting serviced and I had to borrow my dads pushbike, I got on had a wobbly start and thought I had this... went 20 metres down the road, neighbours dog barked, my brain broke and I went 90 degrees crashed into a telegraph pole.",10년 전,0,

@rzeznicc,"""Krendel and McRuer identified three modes of tracking behaviour: error nulling, input reconstruction and precognitive behaviour. In the error nulling mode, subjects rely primarily on visual, exteroceptive information to minimise tracking error. In input reconstruction mode, subjects utilise additional proprioceptive information to form control actions. In precognitive mode, subjects depend on open-loop tracking patterns reproduced from memory, while exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback become less important. With practice, in other words, subjects’ behaviour progresses from the error nulling mode to the input reconstruction mode to the precognitive mode, while the source of information used shifts respectively from the visual exteroceptive to the proprioceptive and then to internal memory.""",10년 전,0,

Knowledge is what you learn in school by teachers and books, and what one learns by doing things, Building model kits, welding, mowing the lawn, talking and walking are things you learn by doing. When you can combine knowledge from theory with practice and understand the connection, That is wisdom. That is why an old man with many years of experience in his profession is the best teacher. He understands how the two skills work together, something that one coming directly from school does not have, he has extensive knowledge in theory, but not in practical terms, something you have to learn from mistakes by doing things. My own experience is the practical way. I did not understand math practical Practices, my teacher was not able to show me what I needed to understand because my teacher had learned everything from books, she knew the answers but not why.

That was the only way it clicked.   In the end, riding a motorcycle further expanded the ability because I had to adapt to MAJOR changes in the ride style. Each of those factors you mentioned changes slightly due to weight, height, momentum... Gyroscopic stability. While it was not an exact similarity, it feeds into your closing statement.   We look at the world with a bias, and our routines (subconscious) make things easier until a change is thrown in their way.

It's also weird that your brain thinks of it as the same function as riding a bike although your Brian is aware of the change.

@fuddrucker74,"An interesting corollary to this would be in certain heavy equipment (most readily verifiable are excavators). The joystick controls are completely antithetical to one another (such as Komatsu and John Deere style controls). Some operators can seamlessly switch between the two styles (after MUCH exposure and experience to both styles of control). Many can only utilize one type. This is such a prevailing phenomenon that most new machines have a feature that will allow the operator to easily switch the control valves inputs to the style of controls they are most comfortable with. An experienced operator can use the full potential of an excavator quickly, efficiently, and above all smoothly, with a minimum of clanging and banging. A poor operator will continually have to think about every input of the controls and be jerky. This makes loud clanging and banging sounds. There is inefficiency of of movement, poor production, and a waste of resources (ie fuel and damage). Contact a large construction firm and you can see the different types of machines, and study the application of a learned skill that has to be constantly modified, with a more observable pool of subjects.

I'm sure I could have picked it up in no time but I didn't have a chance to. Anyway, I've already effectively ""unlearned"" the general method; this makes me wonder if I could now learn a backwards bike almost as quickly as a normal one. I feel like I could (maybe in a day), but who knows.

@goodandchew10,"Destin, have you ""tested"" a person on the backwards bicycle that has ADHD? The reason I ask is because they and I am one the these people, have the mental capacity to put all of their focus and mentality in to only one thing and most likely will be able to master it before anyone else. But, your right kids have the same ability to pick up things quickly. Another question I think it's a very good question. If you were to test a kid like your boy to an adult that has ADHD. Who do you think would grasp the objective first? I ask this for scientific reason. Not to degrade people that have ADHD. I just like to know how my and others brains that have ADHD work. If it's like a kid when you only put your mind to one task at hand.   When I was little I'm pretty sure we all tried to ride our bikes with our hands behind our backs on the handlebars and our bodies faced towards the rear tire.

@techdaemn,"When you first learn to ride a bicycle, you're already two levels deep, because riding a bike is all about teaching your brain how to counter steer.    You first have to unlearn the idea that to go right, you turn right (as you might have learned on a tricycle or a bike with ""training"" wheels), when in fact, to go right, you must turn a little bit left first, to make the bike start to tip over to the right, and then combination of steering geometry (rake and trail) and a little gyroscopic precession help stabilize the bike to keep you from continuing to tip over by bringing the steering back under the CG of the bike+rider.    Gyroscopic precession alone does not hold a bike up, in any direct sense. The reason you see kids, soon after learning to ride a bike, sometimes get locked on some far away obstacle (light pole, mailbox, etc) and wobble their way directly toward it  from 50 feet away and crash into it, is because they're fighting an internal battle between their brain telling them to ""turn right to go right"", and their newly formed muscle memory which has learned to turn left first to go right.   Resolving that conflict in favor of the latter is ""learning how to ride a bike"".   The more you think about riding a bike, the harder it usually is.   At least until you learn to ride a motorcycle at high speeds, then you're often taught how to counter steer very directly.    Push on the right bar to initiate a hard right turn.   Oddly people who learn to counter steer on a motorcycle, often will still swear up and down that they are not doing the same on a bicycle, but it's quite easy to prove by simply looking at tire tracks in the dirt, that it is true at all speeds, on all balancing vehicles.   This all finally clicked with me, when I learned to ride a snowboard, and realized it must be countersteered as well.",10년 전,0,

@allyourcode,"This definitely illustrates something profound about the brain, but I wouldn't call this bias; bias is about decision making, or at least assessments. When you're trying to stabilize yourself on a bike, you're not really ""making decisions"". What you are doing is much more automatic than that. You're not even really ""thinking"". That's why they say it's ""like riding a bike"": when you've mastered it, you're no longer ""thinking"" about it. It just happens automatically and fluidly.  (The same goes for lots of other physical skills. Another great example is skiing. At first, you are really awkward, precisely BECAUSE you are thinking about it. As you get better at it, you think about it LESS AND LESS.)  A really great book about bias (as I tried to define it above) is the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Laureate. I hope people read it (it's pretty popular), because its insights into human thought and behavior are truly profound, and backed by science.",10년 전,0,

@technobabble_,"Hey Destin. When I was a kid, me and a couple friends had a bike and no front tire and a scooter. The forks of the bike were slightly wider than the rear forks of the scooter.  We loosened the rear bolt of the scooter and slid the front fork of the bike down over and tightened everything up.  It took us AGES but we could eventually ride the bike with an entire scooter out the front of it.  The issue was that even a very slight turn of the bike's handle-bars made the scooter's handle-bars move quite a bit  more.  It was a ton of fun to watch new people try it.  Seems as though it would be easier than your bike, but since we were kids, I'm not sure.  Could you give that a shot for us as well?  Compare and contrast and all that?  Thanks.  Love the channel.",10년 전,0,

@vacri54,"Destin, it's not knowledge/understanding. It's about learning complex movements. No-one, no matter how smart, can ride a bike first time. It takes practise, and that practise is training your brain how to incorporate the various information it's feeding. When you ride a backward bike, you're almost starting from scratch. It's like taking a normal bike and asking a community who has never used one before to try it out.  It's like when you start driving a car, you think about every tiny thing, what your foot is doing, what the hands are doing, what's around you. You're actually consciously thinking about it, and lots of brain activity is seen in the prefrontal cortex. Fast forward 10 years, and it's all been trained - you get home from your commute without remembering a thing about it and never giving conscious attention to your drive. The trained physical movement shows up more in the cerebellum now, which is where you tend to find these sorts of things (driving, cycling, walking etc). You are right though that having trained a different way would make it harder to learn, but I wouldn't couch it as 'the way you think' so much as 'the way you've trained'.  My own experience with 'never forget how to ride'. When I was 17, I was hit by a car and flew over it, landing on my hip and being unable to walk properly for a few weeks. I didn't ride again until I was about 27, when I thought it was time to get a bike again. On my very first test ride out of the shop, about 50m down the street, I was riding hands-free again. I decided not to push my luck and put my hands back on the bar when I approached the speed bump, though...",10년 전,0,

@Taliesinson,"I'm a trumpet player.  After playing a Bb trumpet for 10 years, I started playing C trumpet. Pitched one step higher, but the same basic fingerings.  The weird thing is, all my muscle memory AND pitch memory were programmed so that when I pushed this valve, tightened my lips this much, and blew this hard, then a particular note would come out. When I did the same thing on the C trumpet, a note a step higher would come out. I would instantly try to bring the pitch down by habit.  It was VERY weird.  On top of that, I ended up reading Bb music on the C trumpet, so I would look at, for example, the first line on a treble clef staff, which would normally be 1st and 2nd valves pushed down, but to the get the correct pitch (E), I'd have to play a D on the C trumpet, which required pushing 1st and 3rd valves down.  Quite a mind bender.

It would be harder for a child to learn to ride a bike steering left to go right and right to go left then a bike designed with right going right and left go left due to ergonomics.  Granted most could learn to ride the reverse bike in time but would learn it slower and it would be less efficient than a ""normal"" bike setup.  In other words, from scratch a child would learn to ride the ""normal"" bike faster.

@venisontron,"The ""knowledge versus understanding"" distinction in the video is sort of beside the point. The more important point is that once you learn how to ride a bike, the balance adjustments you make become entirely unconscious, so you don't have to understand anything. The movements required are eventually transferred into your procedural and postural memory, working at the level of your lower brain and spinal cord. When riding a bike, your body automatically starts to lean in before you even turn the handlebars, all through postural responses that once were learned, but now are unconscious.

@95mushroom,"Ben Dover I think you were on the right track. Watch at like 1:24. The front wheel just kinda flops around, while he's holding the handlebars (someone) steady. There is clearly something naturally unstable about this layout. What I think should be been done, was to have the where the handlebars and wheel attach, reversed. So that the handlebars are in the original head-tube on the bike, and the wheel now mounts to the added on tube on the very front. This would have provided a more natural riding layout. It looks like most of the riders are putting too much force on the handlebars because they are reaching for them.",10년 전,0,
@deadsparky1,"MultiBaynes by not touching the steering the force that moves the bike is that your center of mass changes forcing the front wheel to follow so it could be that because the handlebars would want to go left as you lent left, which will force the wheel to go right. your now unstable. so leaning into the corner becomes useless.  think of a motorbike at speed turning, 90% of the force that turns you is done by changing the center of mass NOT by steering. in fact you can counter-steer on a motor bike",10년 전,0,

@justinhabit,"Tom Nally the field already exists, but I don't think that it has looked at this before.  People have been studying the ability of the human motor system to adapt to novel dynamic environments for a while now. http://www.jneurosci.org/content/14/5/3208.short At this point it is pretty clear that the human motor system uses a combination of feedforward, feedback, and impedance control to solve most motor tasks. Humans are predictors. We rely primarily on feedforward control because the slow conduction rates of neurons introduce  delays that make feedback control untenable. We can't use just feed forward control though because it can't handle unpredictable disturbances. To deal with the unpredictable we rely on feedback control via short reflexes and impedance control (which is kind of a physical, squishy version of feedback control if you think about it).  The closest thing to Destin's experiment that I can think of if this experiment by Etienne Burdet http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6862/abs/414446a0.html In his experiment he studied peoples ability to adapt to an unstable environment. He told people to reach from one point to another along a straight path, and then  used a robot to push his subjects arms in the same direction as their deviations from the path. You can kind of think of this as a negative spring. This probably  wouldn't be too different from trying to ride Destin's bike in a straight line if you were able to instantly start at full speed. In Burdet's experiment people were able to adapt to the environment, but not by creating an inverse model of the environment. Instead, they used impedance control. Basically, they made their arms  so stiff that the positive feedback forces from the robot never got large enough to push them very far off centre.  The crazy thing is that Destin did clearly create a feedforward model of the bike. You can tell that this is true because he had a ""mirror"" after-effect. The fact that he continued his learned behaviours beyond the point where they at which no longer useful shows that he was not acting on feedback, but was rather relying on a slow-changing predictive model. What this means is that Destin and some welders just one-upped a highly revered nature paper. ... I give up.  The thing with his kid was interesting too. Kids typically adapt to novel dynamic environments at rates that are comparable to those of adults. http://jn.physiology.org/content/90/2/703.short However, they actually tend to be a bit more clutztastic than adults. This is partially because their nervous systems are not fully baked and they are more prone to the random effects of neuromuscular noise. However, I doubt that childhood motor learning has been tested for a problem as complicated as the backwards bike. Maybe children do learn complex tasks faster. Maybe the added noise actually  accelerates the learning process. Sometimes noise can cause learning systems to explore regions of the solution space that they would not explore otherwise. I'm  not sure that I accept ""kids are just more plastic"" as a sufficient answer tough since they generally learn tasks at the same rate as adults.",10년 전,11,

@PwnySlaystation01,"Just posted this to your twitter as well, but I've definitely experienced this type of thing before, albeit probably on a smaller scale. Anyone who plays a lot of video games knows how impossible it is to play with an inverted Y axis control (or the reverse if you like it inverted). You can get used to it, and it's like a flipped switch in my head that happens instantly. I've experienced it with other things too, but this is the best example I can think of:  I never invert my Y axis controls unless I'm playing a flight game. When I'm playing a flight game, my brain automatically treats the Y axis as inverted. When I'm playing any other game, it treats it normally. This is all absolutely automatic. If I'm playing a type of hybrid game, maybe where you're driving a mech or something that could be considered both a plane and NOT a plane, I almost have to ""trick"" my brain into thinking it's one or the other.   This phenomenon is really difficult to explain I think, but I bet any other long-time gamers will know what I'm getting at.

I thought a bit more about other times this has happened, and I think I've come up with a strategy that at least SORT OF works for me. You almost have to think of it as a separate activity. Like flying a plane or controlling a first person shooter like in my previous example. I think if you make an effort to consciously think about each type of bike as being a separate thing entirely (maybe one is riding a bike, the other is riding some other vehicle) your subconscious and muscle memory will be able to ""segregate"" the activities more effectively.  Almost like driving a forklift vs driving a car. Anyone who has driven both knows they operate very differently (backing up a semi-truck with a trailer is another example) but once you learn both, your brain treats them as separate vehicles.

@ruolbu,"SmarterEveryDay  It is a bit like handling an airplane in a videogame or moving a 3rd person camera. Games have different approaches to this. When I push the stick for the camera to the right, does that mean I want the perspective to move right or do I want the camera to move right - which would move the perspective to the left. When pushing the stick up, do I want the plane to move up or do I want to push the nose down? In videogames especially in flying scenarios these things are so common that an ""inverse y-axis"" option is nearly always given. Some people learn it one way and others another way, and most don't want to go through the relearning process.  But I've experienced that it is possible to be fluent in switching between two settings. Usually I control planes by pushing the nose down when the stick is pushed up. Push up = plane moves down. One time I was using not a stick but a D-Pad (basically four directional buttons for you non console players ;) ) The thought concept of pushing the nose down when pressing up felt very wrong, rather it was intuitive to think of the direction I want to go: Push up = planes moves up. Once I had that down I could switch between Stick and Buttons on the fly. My body basically did the same movements with my thumb to cause opposing effects. It was the feeling of a stick or a button under my thumb that triggered the concept I would use. The amazing thing, once I realised that, I did some playing around, trying to apply the button-concept to the stick control. And after lots of training it worked. I could use the stick for both. I just had to get in the right mind set for how I thought about what I wanted to do. To I want to indicate the direction I want to go or do I want to push the nose in a certain direction? When I really tried I could switch the control settings and keep using the stick without much trouble.  Of course videogames and riding a bike are two different levels of complexity. I don't think the word ""unlearning"" really fits here. You've shown that you could still ride a bike like you did a year ago. What tripped you up, was that you did not yet learn to handle both settings and switch on the fly. I have no idea how long that would take in this case. It probably involves a mind trick to focus on one aspect of handling that feels completely different to trigger your body into using the right control-concept for the control-scheme of the current bike.",10년 전,1,

@kindarilwraja,"SmarterEveryDay This issue isn't so much that knowledge <> understanding, though I suppose you could define it this way. The issue is that the brain encodes multiple kinds of knowledge and handles them differently. You started with explicit, declarative knowledge of the bicycle's mechanism. This kind of knowledge is easily written and relatively easily rewritten (and therefore forgotten). It's encoded largely in higher-level neural pathways in the cerebral cortex through exposure. The act of actually riding the bicycle, however, requires implicit, procedural knowledge. This kind of knowledge can be completely unrelated to declarative knowledge, meaning you can know how to do something without being able to explain it (which is why trying to explain how to do math to people, for example, can sometimes make you feel like a complete fool = ). Procedural knowledge is encoded in lower-level neural pathways through repeated experience, which takes time. More time = more precision (practice makes perfect!). Lower-level neural pathways are generally permanent (hence why you never forget how to ride a bike in the normal way) but mid-to-higher-level neural pathways can to some extent determine which lower-level pathways are activated (this being why something in your brain clicked and you were suddenly able to ride the bicycle normally).

@DrYak,"Actually handle is the keyword. biking is actually a very complex task. there ate ton of very small and very fast motions to do just to keep it in balance, including small quick motions on the handle bar. the correction one need to do are to fast to be done consciously. luckily, you got a cerrebellum, learned reflxes, etc.. (= 'muscle' memory) abstracting it for you. you just think that you want to bike forward and hand 'know automatically' to do the quick micro corrections. the backward bike plays exactly on that: the hands correct the wrong way, and because they go reverse to what they should (the wrong correction  makes the problem even worse, and then the hands correct  even more wrongly), there is a runaway problem until catastrophic  failure. all the while the brain issued 1 single simple highlevel instruction: go forward.  there is a way actually to win quickly at this (but would be considered cheating as much as feet touching ground, for the same reason): some riders can balance a bike hands free just by using body motions for them the handle won't matter: they wont be using it.   regarding the son: it's not the age as much as the fact that he hasn't been biking for a long time - he doesn't need to 'unlearn' 20 years of biking. for an adult, this bike is a nightmare because it doesn't  look like anything they know. for a child it's a piece of cake because they know nothing yet. it's the lack of reference that help.  i observe the same when teaching ski (my  hobby: ski teacher at the university where i do research): there is something  deeply unintuitive with ski as you don't actually keep balance, but throw your weight around. some adults will learn faster than others. it all depends  on their background. people used only to regular sports have big difficulties: they are used to keep their balance at all cost and are completely thrown  back by 'disbalance to steer around'. kids learn faster because they don't have such a habit. other adult who are used to ice skating/roller/etc learn fast too because they are used to sliding sports: they don't have a bad habit about balance that they need to kick out. again it's about reference and lack of.  note: being a slightly bit drunk can actually help in some of these situations as it tends to shut down the pathways assisting such motions (that's why drunks are clumsy: their cerebellum is shut down). but it won't  work with the reverse bike it requires too much fast motions. once tipsy you'll start falling on your face even with a normal bike.",10년 전,1,

@DrYak,"***** Situation is slightly different. Yup, it goes against habits.   But the 'failure mode' doesn't have the catastrophic cascade that the backward handle bar has. With the handle bar, the micro/fast motions that the hand do by habit to correct the balance will actually exactly have the reverse effect - making the balance worse - and you'll want to correct you balance more, thus your hands will correct even more in the wrong direction disbalancing even more,etc. You get a runaway bad feedback loop until you fall on the ground.  There is no such runaway bad feedback when pedalling backwards. By instinct, you go forward and your feet start pedalling the wrong way and... best case (with a classical bike) nothing happens you just don't transmit any power to the back wheel. worst case (single speed bikes and foot brake bike) you put the pressure ""wrong"" and the bicycle starts to slow down. Both case (slow down and nothing) aren't cases where you start to fall down and your ""muscle"" memory wants you to make something that make you fall down more.  And also, as I've said before, keeping balance on a bike is a very complex task that happens very fast. There's no way to do it consciously. By the time you analytically and consciously think ""i need to put my hand this way to correct the steering/balancing that way"" you're already on the ground. The only way to keep balance is using your ""muscle memory"". (Again that's way it's very difficult to keep your balance while drunk. Your cerebellum is shut down, you're on your own with your conscious analitical brain which is crazily smart, but to slow for this specific task). (People who are use to bike while completely wasted steer in a completely different manner. Above a certain speed threshold combined with gyroscopic effect, the bike has some self balancing properties. That's also how people doing it hands free start to learn it). Whereas, moving forward happens much more slowly, doesn't require crazy-fast reflexes (unlike correcting balance) and once you start doing things wrong you have plenty of time to correct it back while the bike is still motion. Everything happens within a time scale which is still doable for your conscious higher brain functions.  (Last but not least, there's a small peculiarity with pedalling, walking and running: inate reflexes. In your brain stem, you have a rythm/patern generator that can automatically put one feet in front or behind the other. (well actually a couple of generators. Walking and running are two separate gaits and thus different rythms) No brain activity required - that's why chicken keep running even with their heads cut off. I haven't tried, but I strongly suspect that pedalling backwards is just about starting the rythm in reverse and then letting it on auto. - just like ""walking on a rolling object"". But that's a small specific hack due to how vertebrate generate their gait).  So overall, reverse pedals would be offsetting, but not devilishly awful like the backward handlebar.  (Other similar situation: Steering in vehicles that don't require balance. e.g.: cars vs. dinghy.  Cars have steering wheels. Dinghy, unlike bigger boats don't have a wheel, but one directly manipulates the rudder bar. In a car, you need to turn the wheel toward where you want to go. On a dinghy, you need to push the rudder bar away. Dinghys too are  ""backward handle bar bikes"" in a way. And people who are only used to cars/bikes/etc. and have never been on dinghy have trouble steering it because the rudder bar works the exact opposite from everything they are used to.  But unlike bicycle, dinghy don't require complex keeping of balance, and people not used to them won't suddenly fall down on a runaway bad feedback loop. They'll have time to adjust and after a while even an adult can get used to steer).  (Crazy idea: take a drunken sailor, put him on a backward bike with trainer wheels, and see how fast you can move from this starting point to removing the wheels.)",10년 전,0,
@DrYak,"Ravaxr A reverse unicycle would be as devilish (or even more) than the backward handle bar for the exact same reason: requires tons of very fast and very precise motions to keep balance. by reversing the pedals, you break the mechanism on which your cerebellum relies to keep you balanced on it. And you can't do it consciously, it's to fast. Give it to some one used to regular unicycles, and they'll be on the ground constantly.  Now, give it to me, and it probably make no difference: I've never done unicycles or any other sports where I need to keep precise balance on the forward/backward axis (I do ski, and ski is all about NOT keeping your balance), and I suck at this. I'll very probably suck equally bad at forward and backward unicycles and will take probably same (although long) time to learn either.  Hypothesis: people you know to blance on a rolling object (you need to walk in reverse to keep the balance), will probably learn much faster.

@Spartaton,"SmarterEveryDay I don't think it's hard to learn because the bike is different, I feel like it's hard to learn due to the way people approach the problem. Say you started on top of a hill when learning instead of a flatter surface. Then what you do is just walk into position on top of the hill, get on and hold the brakes. Then you just let go of the brakes and roll down.   Doing this would make it incredibly easier due to the fact that you can keep the bike a lot straighter since you don't have to peddle. Think about it, the problem I see with the flat surface is when you start peddling forward you need to turn the the wheel a lot to keep yourself upright (especially when you try to get going while sitting down). This is what I believe causes the main problem here since you wouldn't be capable of making the decision to turn the handles the opposite way fast enough to keep up with the demand to stay balance.   So, if you were to start on top of a hill and just roll down instead of peddling, it would most likely make the process of learning faster. Then, of course, you would move on to making slight, long turns to work on your control.    I would test this but I don't have a bike like this, nor the means to get one.",10년 전,0,

What I'm talking about is just eliminating some of the things you need to deal with to learn how to ride the bike. You can test it yourself, go outside on a bike, and see how much you need to move the handles to stay balanced when you start sitting down on a flat surface.

@Al.ri7,gaining speed in the beginning  without handle  activation can initiate balance  and lots of space (long slow turns in to start) may help  i think that combination is how  i learned  to ride a normal  bike.

I do believe we have to beat our instincts but the ones that either prevent fall by sensing balance loss (leg on the ground) or the one trying to gain balance by using the handle(to control the moment) since that is flawed.  longshot alert !!!either we copy/learn these insticts or maybe ( longshot)has  something  to do with our (ape like or not ape like ) ancestry.,8년 전,1,
