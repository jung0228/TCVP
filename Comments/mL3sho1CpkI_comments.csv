@bogdanyanovich829,"Тут выход сознания из сказки✓✓! Насколько вы, доверяете системе? Насколько хорошо вы изучили своё тело на протяжении своей жизни, если вам конечно интересно это всё?✓ Прививки и Радиоимпланты! Пока вы тут тратите время, на просмотры всякой всячины, вот, что происходит вокруг! ✓ Если вы не знаете этой информации, то на вас распространяется поговорка✓Век живи, век учись и дураком помрёшь✓Внутренний голос (Подставные чувства, подставные  мысли, ведёшся или не ведёшся!) Оказывается это не естественно для человека.Внутренний голос это радио импланты в теле! Работают, спецслужбы! Привет, из роддома! Конченые, Роддомы, насилуют детей! Я рождён ещё при союзе, в 1987 -м году и как я понимаю, радио имплантанты ставились в роддоме всем и об этом, родителей, в известность не ставили+прививки, (в сведетельстве о рождении, этого, не написано), (прививание в тело человека, посторонних одноклеточных организмов, а потом начинаются желтухи, краснухи, пяточные шпоры, киста, ветрянки, полипы, раки, бородавки и прочий геморой)! Нет ни какого, бога! Раздупляйтесь! Если вы, видите сновидения, это значит, в теле, есть радио-устройства! Человек, без имплантантов, сновидения не видит, сон является просто спокойным ночным отдыхом! И утром, проснувшись, нету заморочек, что за сновидение и что бы это могло значить! Программка всячески отвлекает и от медитаций (на уроках, в школе меня тоже отвлекала и при домашних заданиях, когда надо было думать) и морочит голову! Масоны, это спецслужбы! Они по одному работают в роддомах и воинских частях, они на отдельных правах, почему-то, сидят в отдельных кабинетах и контролируют через програмку, по месту, тех кого нужно, пользуются тем, что общество не знает про эти технологии, подписывая контракт о нерозглашении! А ещё, в помощь вам металло искатель, желательно мощный, так как детальки маленькие. Garrett 400 на личном опыте срабатывает на эти импланты! Населению частных секторов вообще нет ни минуты покоя! Есть ещё в интернете такая тема как, Менталитет Краба - Crab Bucket Theory, и тема эта работает через эти же имплантанты и подставные мысли, если вы ведётесь на эти мысли и необдуманно сразу действуете, вы сбиваете или отвлекаете человека, который не сидит в этом ведре. Вот вам и жизнь с богом в душе!)А на деле занозы в теле! Поэтому в жизни всё как то не так как хотелось бы! И многие не понимают почему! Всё же вроде делаю нормально и стараюсь.)Не было на этой планете эволюции! Прилетели сюда! Но почему-то, не всё сразу дано знать потомству! Рассказ про Адама и Еву, на самом деле, это интересная Загадка! Змей искуситель это внутренний голос (радиоимплантанты) в теле! О том, что имплантанты в теле (кстати и у Адама тоже) они не знали. Повелась, Ева, на якобы запретный плод, потому, что в википедии написано Слушай подсказки внутреннего голоса! Изгнана за это из рая (лишена прав хранительницы домашнего очага, спокойной личной и стабильной семейной жизни, саморазвития) загнана на работы, на церковные сказочные богослужения, неестественная самооценка! Спецслужбам, что бы управлять кем-то, нужно сначала сделать его,её виноватым (грешником). Программа эта, работает по всем одинаково, по сей день.... Если тебе изначально назвать биологические часы, по другому, постепенное окисление и до старости не доживают а доводят себя сами! (Тут еще работает понятие, утро вечера мудренее! За ноч чуть восстановился!)Что ты будешь делать? И еще, любая кислотность, витамины в том числе, повышают давление! На этой планете нет ни одного святого человека, как бы вы не молились на картинки! Представьте себе, муравейник✓ или улей✓.... Созданные и настроенные создателем организмы успешно функционируют на благо семьи! Семья растёт и остаётся на месте! И представьте улей или муравейник в котором все организмы с радиоимплантами возле мозга и по ним работает программа! При этом им дали сигареты, алкоголь, наркотики, телевизоры, навязали праздники, ввели понятие, что нужно уходить из дома и заводить отдельную семью, территория близимеющаяся попшикана концентратами! В этом случае, получается итог сказки о рыбаке и рыбке.) Курить людей научили, а ингаляцию, хотя бы один раз в день делать не научили!  Горяченькая ингаляция под плотным полотенцем, чистая вода, 2-3 чайных ложек соды, на плите под крышкой до кипения, снимаем, усаживаемся, дышим пока не остынет, дальше сами настроитесь. Эта действие равносильно мытью рук с мылом! Для некурящих тоже полезно, воздух пыльный! Созвездия это искусственные источники света, это как разоблачить в детском садике в Деде Морозе переодетого воспитателя Общество догадывается, что дед мороз не настоящий и т.д. но по накатаной наше время личной жизни настолько занято  замороченым бытом, так как нет обеспечения государственного, что у всего общества не хватает свободного времени, что бы разобраться в этом всём, и роздуплиться в этой сказке! Мы стали сильней, живём дальше, думаем..",4년 전,0,

@fireflyfireworks668," @werearethedreamteam3724  It's been four months, let's see if you are still so stubbornly ignorant :)  There is an important difference between ""clean"" and ""clear"" water.  Boiling water kills bacteria and other germs, which are the main source of concern regarding illnesses inflicted by ""dirty"" water. Anything ""living"" can cause diarrhoea or vomiting, or other sickness which usually result in death by dehydration. In modern processing plants the water is sterilised by UV light, in some cases where that is not sufficient, chlorine can be added.   Toxic metals and chemicals are either filtered or chemically removed, but that is mostly only necessary due to human influence, whether it is nitrate from exessive use of fertilisers or chemicals from wastewater. Contaminated ground water is found rarely in nature e.g. in areas with geological activities or natural ore deposits.  If you don't consume your water from such sources, dirt like soil or leaves ore none of your concern after it is boiled.   If you want clear water, sure, go ahead and filter it, but I'd prefer murky but well boiled water to crystal clear and potentially contaminated water.",5년 전(수정됨),27,

Heavy metal poisoning can be accumulative.  I'm sure you've thought of this, but for safety I feel compelled to mention it for the comments: using a smooth stone of granite or other maffic igneous rock to boil water would be assuredly free of heavy metal leaching and soot residue (if it can be attained in the locale).  I've no doubt you've done your soil testing.  I'm guessing it's probably fine to have a handful of heavy metal exposures, but keep in mind, those metal toxins can become imbedded in neural tissue and wreck mary-hobb with your brains pathways over the decades.   I love these videos.  They remind me of when I was kid in Southern Illinois digging and building in a holler.  I wish I had your videos back then.

@butterflygroundhog,"hello Primitive technology. for a while now i have watched your videos (some more than once already) and i had some questions in mind: 1) Why is the boiling water pot black? Is it because of the smoke or did you use a different process of firing? 2) When starting a fire, how do you manage not to inhale the smoke as you blow on it? It seems like that has been the cause of many failed attempts at fire making. 3) Have you ever hurt yourself while doing your stuffs? If so, what is the easiest injury  to avoid? 4) How do you endure mosquito and insects while working? 5) Given your actual setup, is it possible to achieve self sufficiency? 6) What type of stones are the best for tools? I personally have a hard time finding a piece of limestone that will hold for more than 2 or 3 uses. 7) Since you generously try not to disturb too much of the environment and work in a renewable environment, what are the things one can do to preserve local environment while doing primitive tech work?  It would be a pleasure to learn from someone skillful as you and be guided in a certain way, thanks for any replies you may give and I wish you happy continuation!",8년 전,276,

@ragnkja,"The breathing technique he uses isn't quite what I'd call circular breathing (in wind instrument terms, circular breathing maintains a steady flow of air out the mouth, usually by filling the cheeks with air and letting that air out while inhaling through the nose), but the general path that the air takes is similar. It serves two purposes: 1. It is harder to hyperventilate when inhaling through the nose, and 2. He doesn't need to remember to remove the blow-pipe before inhaling, significantly reducing the risk of inhaling smoke and embers.",8년 전,5,

@CuddlyJon,"What he does is, first he gathers some clay from a river bank, squeezes whatever excess water is in it out, grounds up some previous tiles he made (made from hardened clay), mixes this with the new clay he has (this forms grog, a material that is better for forming ceramics because it keeps the clay together and helps prevent cracking), forms the clay pots, lets it dry, and then finally he fires it up in his kiln, making hardened clay/ceramic pots. Note that dirt (in this case it would be mud) could possibly make a pot but it would be difficult to harden it in a kiln. Mud is a mixture of clay, soil, sand and other things. Also note, his pots aren't 100% clay but, they are enough so to make pots. This may be one of the reasons why he reports in the description that one of his pots cracked while it was fired up in the kiln.",8년 전(수정됨),2,

@kabukimono2762,"ed stafford is a real survivor and i found something about bear grylls Grylls apologises for 'fake' show Bear Grylls Grylls was parachuted into difficult terrain and supposedly left to cope British adventurer Bear Grylls has apologised for misleading viewers of his Channel 4 show, Born Survivor. The show saw Grylls supposedly abandoned in the wild, but a programme consultant claimed the star stayed in a motel and scenes were set up for him.  ""If people felt misled on how the first series was represented, I'm really sorry for that,"" Grylls told the BBC.  The show's producers have promised the next series of the programme ""will be 100% transparent"". 'Truth'  ""I'm the person that takes the rap for these things, even though I'm not always involved in the editing side of it,"" Grylls said, ""but ultimately it is me on screen  ""The truth is much less exciting - we film these things over six days and, after filming the night stuff, we're back with a crew in a base camp lodge - whether it's a tented camp in the Saraha or in Sumatra poncho'd up in the jungle.  ""The hotel [can be] four walls but not a roof, or a roof with no walls.  ""Yes, we had a lot of those but when we're filming the live night stuff, we're out,"" he added.  The inconsistencies in the show, which is produced by the Discovery Channel and known as Man vs Wild elsewhere in the world, were raised by US survival consultant, Mark Weinert.  He told the Sunday Times newspaper that Grylls spent nights in a motel in Hawaii when he was claimed to be stranded on a desert island.  The Discovery Channel admitted ""isolated elements"" were not ""natural to the environment"", and promised greater clarity for the next series which will be screened in April on Channel 4.  A feature-length documentary following the explorer as he prepares to fly a powered paraglider over the summit of Mount Everest, will also be shown later this month on the channel.",8년 전,3,

More education please. Bear Grylls has a program, which he shows techniques to how to survive and how to find civilization if you get in a plane accident for example, and survive... he doesn't show how to create pots or craft different kinds of things and basically the whole point of this channel, as you said, Primitive Technology's owner makes this as his hobbie not as a trained ""soldier"" who shows techniques of how to survive.

@salvatoreshiggerino6810,"I went and dug up some clay in the garden to try this out. I fired mine in a normal wood stove, some sintering definitely happened, it did get a ring to it. But it won't hold water well, it will eventually weep it over the course of a few hours. Not sure how much was due to the low temperature firing, lack of glaze or even a decent burnish, or impurities in the clay gassing off and causing more porosity. The technique would certainly work for an evaporative cooling pot, come summer I'll see if I can make one that will fit a beer can and see how cold it gets.  It was fun, I'll definitely do more, and experiment with better ways of firing. For instance I wonder if I can reduce more iron(III) to iron(II) by restricting air flow to get black pots. Of course, the pros with their electric ovens and refined clays will make much better pottery, but that's really not the point.",8년 전,2,

@TheKhopesh,"5:30 I'm sure you could easily make a more heat-optimized system out of fired clay like the pots.  For a staple like boiling water to drink, it would be worth the time to make a clay piece to cut down on ash and other contaminants (even though hot ash and charcoal bits are sterile, they don't taste too good, so the less of that junk that gets into your drinking water, the better). You'd definitely want one, were you actually planning to use this stuff regularly.  Just some connected (like you connected the fan blades for your bow-string powered forge blower) clay plates that are shaped to easily fit in and out of the water pot (about 1-2 cm thick laid out in a grid) so you can put the clay ""heating element"" into the water pot and bring it to a boil in one swift go to and from the fire. That, and you can make some holes to fit a pole through for easy removal from the coals, and another hole or two for easy lowering into the water itself.",9년 전,0,
@zzzzzzzzzz098,"Thanks for the video.   Since water is the most important water, please consider doing another one with how to distill salt water in case there isn't any streams available. I've seen a bunch of distillation methods but most of them require a plastic sheet or such and I am curious to see how you would do it since you start from scratch.   If it's too much trouble to make a video solely on water, what do you think is the best way to distill and collect water?   Some conundrums:  1) I know the ""survival still distillation system"" product offered by Glenn, but that's near impossible to replicate with primitive technology. So probably can't do this one.   2) Perhaps doing the plastic sheet trick with a variation. Have a pot of salt water, put a cup inside and boil the water. Use a cover that is slanted towards the cup so the condensation will drip into the cup. No plastic sheet is required. The problem with this is what is stopping the water in the cup from evaporating too?   3) Have a cover, make a hole, make a chimney like thing except it runs horizontal instead of vertical just like your ""forge blower"" so the steam will run to another place and get collected. Probably the best method, but we still have to find a way to cool the water so it actually collects.    What are your thoughts?",9년 전,1,

I would like to clarify the term ice age: The term means a period during which there are extensive ice sheets in the hemispheres, so by definition, we are in an ice age right now. The last glacial period started 110,000 years ago and ended 15,000 years ago, so civilization could not have been set back by multiple ice ages.

@Metrion77,"From the description: ""Clay was dug from the creek bank, mixed with broken crushed tiles as grog and formed into a cooking pot and 4 large water pots.""  For those not familiar with ceramic grog: ""Grog is used in pottery and sculpture to add a gritty, rustic texture called ""tooth""; it also reduces shrinkage and aids even drying. This prevents defects such as cracking, crow feet patterning, and lamination. The coarse particles open the green clay body to allow gases to escape. It also adds structural strength to hand-built and thrown pottery during shaping although it can diminish fired strength. The finer the grog particles are, the closer the clay bond, and the denser and stronger the resulting fired product."" Wikipedia",8년 전,0,

I love the stuff you are doing :) I am studying archaeology so I am quite familiar with the techniques you use in your videos (though some stuff seems to be improvised - which is pretty great to see :) ). At university we also made some pottery from different ages, it really helps to understand the old technologies better. For burnishing we used pebble. We had no kiln so we just fired the pots in pits. For testing we used both burning techniques (Oxidizing and reducing flames).  Btw.: I read the description of the video. The reason why one out of five pots breaks could be the (missing ?) tempering or because the clay is still too wet.  Sorry for my bad English + keep up the good work ! Cheers :)",9년 전,0,

@TheComputec,+knell  He places very hot rocks in the pot containing river water which brings the water up to boiling point which sterilizes  the water to make it safe to drink. He could have boiled the water in the pot over the flames but it is safer to leave the pot on the floor   I have always followed the basic rule that Anything that can survive boiling water deserves to live  My other basic rules are:  Don't eat yellow snow Never put anything smaller than your fist inside your ear Don't open beer bottles with your scrotum,9년 전,2,

@roberthorne3606,"SDD525 Actually he could make a magnet with a battery. All he has to do is send a current through some iron (which he has already collected some) to magnetize it. Then the magnet should be able to repel currents weaker than what was used. using multiple magnets and semiconductors, (if he every figures out how to smelt some) he could make a simple computer. The battery could also be used for cleansing and therapy. In one of the Arabic nations, there was an ancient battery found under centuries of soil. It was just some sort of wooden container filled with electrolytes and whatever else that's only capable to produce a few volts but still makes wonder about how new the battery really is.",9년 전,0,
@roberthorne3606,SDD525 It could also make for an easy fire starter.(should he have enough knowledge of alchemy to produce such a current),9년 전,0,
@roberthorne3606,"SDD525 It still produces an electric current by chemicals in chambers; probably not stable, however. In that case what would technically be considered a battery? Also, I know not everything is true so it's smart to just take it as information and keep reliability in mind. (whether the info comes via communication or or is witnessed in person)",9년 전,0,
@mrchordstriker,"SDD525 I don't mean to argue, but yes there were ""batteries"" in Egypt.  We have recreated them and they have discovered potential uses the past ancestors may have had.  In analyzing recreated cells,  they have found the voltages and currents to be spiky and a little unstable.  Egyptian hieroglyphs potentially depict light filaments encased in glass.  Apparently this is gaining acceptance, due in part to long stony hallways (with no air current), lacking results of torch use to light their way.  I feel there is evidence of electricity yah I do.  All of us are merely speculating potential activity of the distant past, yes?  Personally,  I prefer a dirt cell igniting a fire over blisters. This dude just did an amazing feat of making stuff from nothing.  As a hobby no less.  Lol cheers.",9년 전,0,

Putin actually likes Trump enough to warn Trump that he might be assassinated by the globalists for going against their agenda (look it up). Trump is the anti-establishment candidate. He actually called out George Soros.  On the other hand Hillary Clinton is a globalist puppet, and that will not sit well with Russia.

@killkreethlockjaw8146,the pots would be fine if he just placed it into a fire. he had to heat treat them so them being filled with water would cause no harm. also the rocks take less time to heat up and can store more heat so when he places them into the water it instantly boils the water. it can shave a good 10 mins off of boiling water.,9년 전,0,

@demeides,"I am amazed of the work you are doing, and my only complain about the channel is it's not big enough yet...though considering the amount of time invested into your projects, it's understandable.  On a side note, I have some experience with pottery myself, and my teacher always told us that cracks (or complete ruptures in pots as they are cooked in the kiln) are caused 95% of the time by air trapped between layers of clay that will expand while being heated. Since clay loses humidity as it's cooking (therefore it contracts, up to a 20% in size) and air expands while hot, the presure gets to a point where the estructure collapses and the pot breaks (sometimes as violently as to break other pots in the kiln that are close to the one breaking).  The issue can be fixed to a certain extent by using a solution of clarified clay mixed with water (so it's not as solid as the one used for the pot itself, rather runny, or glue-like) and use it between layers of ""churros"" of clay (we called then like that in here). That way the gaps between layers are filled with material, and air gaps disappear almost entirely.  As for boiling water, do it using pottery as you showed, never in contact with the soil (as in directly of a tiny poodle). Bacteria live in the soil, and will re-infest the water given time, as it cools down. Your stone-into-the-pot method is the way to go.   Thanks for this piece of fine content!",9년 전,0,

@tixeright9120,"+hadys gaming In the woods, it needs to be near a lake, creak or pond bed, the reason for this is water is vital to working with clay, and two, the heavy saturations of water keep some types of plants and roots from growing in it, so the subsoil will be shallower and easer to get to, and the clay will be in its moist to mud form, and won't be hard requiring you to bust it up. Beyond that, in dense woods with little water, just keep digging down until there's no more top soil, no sand, no loams, and no roots, where the soil becomes hard and clumpy.  But, if you live in an area like Florida, hitting clay, is like finding gold. You're much more likely to find pitch, natural gas, or quick-sand, if you dig too deep. Clays will vary in color a lot, based on metal and mineral deposits in it. But, you've probably found clay if you can get it a little moist-malleable and can clump together and hold its shape well. I don't even have to dig past two feet to hit good clay where I live. If you don't own the woods you're exploring, you probably should ask the owner before you start digging up his parcels of dirt. (They may or may not care.) Also, national parks don't want you doing anything like this without permission either. (And they are not likely to give it.) Once you think you've got a good source, make several test bricks and bowls to see how well the material responds to air-drying and firing. If all of them hold together through air-drying, and they don't all crack when you fire them (some of them still might) than you've got a pretty good source of clay. If all that sounds like too much work, or hassle, you can buy pottery clay pretty cheap from Amazon.com.",9년 전,1,

And if so, what is the best primitive way to do it? I've been sifting mine by mixing it with water and pouring the clay ""milk"" through a screen, letting it settle, then pouring the remaining water off the top. This works but it's very time consuming and the clay doesn't break apart in the water very well. Any help is greatly appreciated!",9년 전,0,

@John-iv2oz,I have a question for you with some preface first.  I live in California and years ago many people used clay pots from Mexico for cooking and different foods and that has almost completely stopped because the clay from the pots were leaching lead into the food and water and causing lead poisoning.  The lead was in the clay naturally and was not from a man made source.  I was wondering if you are aware of any lead content in the clay you have been using?  All clay and soil has some lead content(usually very low) but different regions have different levels.,9년 전,0,

@jerryojerry4127,"I had a question on the clay pots, I tried making a very small pot like you did in another video, I wanted to see where I went wrong. I dug up some clay that was practically on the surface and got it damp and proceeded to shape it. I let it harden naturally a few hours then when it was somewhat hard, but still could be molded, I put it in my fire pit for probably 20-30 minutes. When I took it out it was hard, but after tapping at it for a few seconds, it crumbled. Note that when just field testing the soil it wasn't the finest clay by any means, and that I put it in an actual fire, not hot coals like a frequently see you do.

@benioneill8812,"+ineedmorenaruto That can happen when there are water pockets or moisture inside the rocks. When heated rapidly the water expands and the pressure causes the rock to explode. As such it is best to avoid rocks that may look layered/fragile or very smooth rocks (indication that it might have been rolling in a creek at some point, which is an opportunity for water trapping). Another extra way of prevention is to heat them slowly to allow slow evaporation of the water.

@krisztianszirtes5414,"5:21 This part is bugging me for a reason. Those stones seem to be limestone. When you heat limestone, it will become caustic lime (or quicklime) which reacts with the water. It will become strongly alkaline and it would need to be let on air, near fire to absorb CO2 and neutralize again. the white cloudiness you see at 6:07 is actually the lime that did not dissolve due to its crappy solubility.

@slitor,"+brother3inarms man that sucks, its sad to see how small minded Man can be.  Do you think it could be a landowner or some such, Norway have a long tradition with farms and the areal can be several square miles covering an entire valley or half an Island sometimes.   They're not allowed to hinder travel and hiking(except for motor vehicles of course but they can charge a toll to use a private road) and their economic rights is limited especially around rivers and on the mountains(which is almost always protected reserves).  Still I have seen many examples of land holders(often not farmers) with Napoleon complex that threat their un-taxed land as their own kingdom.  Often in the cases I've seen they've broken the law, what was done to you however seems like a gray area but I think a landowner would be in his right to demolish the building (as petty and small minded such action would be).  You have to remember you are making a structure here, there is a distinction between temporary and permanent structures and its sorta tricky to pin point what yours and Primitivs project is. Worst case scenario even the local Goverment might want a word in.   My advice to you is if you find a perfect spot, find out who owns the land and ask permission first.  If its publicly(even on private ground zoning laws might apply) owned you might have step over some red tape, but its not impossible (Call it an Art project and it might improve your chances :) )  But they are going to have two questions in mind, when removed how long will it take for the scars to grow (negligible in this case) and what happens if someone walks inside and it collapses.    It bears saying that I'm Not A Lawyer, but at any rate talk to the landowner first.  Its not an impossible feat to get permission, I've myself been in a primitive stone hut that was the destination of a hiking trail on top of a mountain.",10년 전,0,

Second, did you learn all these skills alone ? i know you have quite some diplomas in sciences & stuff, but all the survival stuff ? Did you learn all by yourself how to make pots, wall out of mud, what can be eaten ? Or maybe did you learn on the internet ?  Talking about eating, have you ever been sick because of the fact that you eat wilderness food ?  If you consider the next question too intrusive, just ignore it. What about family ? are you in couple ? kids ? what do your relative think about this hobby ? Did anyone ever join you in this adventure ?  What's your job ? How often do you go to your wild life ? every week ? months ? do you do it on a regular basis or do you just go whenever you feel like going ?  ever hunted and eaten an animal from the wild that you butchered by hand ? would you do that ?  Do you always come roughly to th same place ? How far from you home/civilization did you build your home-in-the-wild ? if you get hurt of poisoned, would you reach it in time ?  How did you start doing that ? did you just wake up on morning, jumped in your car, went to the mountain and created your first hut ? Is it some sort of scouts camp that introduced you to wilderness life ?  How far is your ""wall-materials&pots-mud-providing-source"" from your wild-house ?

@AverageFlamethrower,"+Brian Sanchez Only people who are interested in this watch it. This is more educational than entertaining. Unless this intrigues you, it's quite boring. That's the problem with most 'survival' shows. The network says, ""This is too boring, do something exciting.' When in reality, surviving alone in the woods IS boring, unless someone enjoys watching it.    I enjoy this, because it's interesting to learn about new stuff. But in shows like dual survival, it's generally all the same. First day, look for shelter, look for food, make fire, sleep. Second day make better shelter, kill some animal, travel a bit, sleep. Third day, travel more, get 'rescued' In reality, they don't even have to eat. It's always 3 days. They don't have to kill anything, but the show makes it seem like it's the most important part.",9년 전,25,

@EnglishMasterMRH,"Yeah, but dead pathogens in your system are almost just as bad.  For instance, the rise in the use of hand sanitizing stations in hospitals (instead of sinks/hand-washing stations like before) has lead to a drastic rise in nosocomial infections.  If cleaner water is REALLY what he's going for, perhaps the next thing he should fire in the kiln should be an alembic.  ^_^",10년 전,0,

@deanwalsh1319,"+Lu Bu Dead pathogens in your system is exactly what vaccinations are based around, but lets not open that can of worms here. Hospital acquired infection is due to pathogen resistance to antibiotics and other cleaning chemicals, they are to strong to kill. Hand washing does not remove all germs, thats why they use alcohol based hand rubs to kill whatever is missed by a hand wash. Back onto the water, boiling water is still the standard method for killing a large amount of pathogens, bacteria, viruses etc, but it is not the best. As pointed out below, it is best to employ a pre filter, a sterilisation (boiling, chemical or by UV light) and even a final filter. Taste and color is not always an indicator of clear water or even contaminated water, given that it was not running water (stagnant) that makes it more risky as bacteria is not washed away and has a chance to grow. Lu Bu, I hope this helps, although often the comments section of youtube is not the place to come seeking answers, my own little helpful tip is to do a question pre filter through google before seeking to ask anyone here for help, lest we feed the troll. Peace out",10년 전,4,
@nomnomnomymous,"+Lu Bu This initial post is actually correct, assuming that he was trying to clean the water and not just sterilize it.  But he was just sterilizing it, otherwise he would have used a different method, because, come on, that's painfully obvious.  You are right though, boiling and distilling are two different things and distilling is a much better process to use to properly clean and purify water. However, it's not always the most practical option available and unless you have stuff that you can use for that, boiling is your next best option.  There are how-tos online to make filtration systems with sand, pebbles, and rocks, and how to seed them with predatory bacteria that will feed on the harmful stuff. That would actually make a good video on here, now that I think of it.",10년 전,3,
@diverdown81,"+Lu Bu Dead pathogens that would cause GI issues, such as Giardia and E. Coli, are no real concern. They have to be ""alive"" to cause any problems. At 100 C/ 212 F essentially all organisms are dead. Bacteria may release an exotoxin once destroyed, but boiling for 10 minutes at 100/212 will even destroy the Botulinum toxin. The one concern left would be environmental toxins. Those are NOT destroyed by boiling.",10년 전,0,

Apparently, GPS miss calculated her inputs and took her across 3 different country before she came to her senses and realize she is not anywhere near any super market let alone her country. Or how about a guy who drove his car into the ocean just because his GPS told him to... Or how about a guy who hid in his attic while his house was being burglarized by thieves. What does he do instead of calling the authorities and emergency personel for help? He goes on Facebook on his smartphone and posts messages for help ...

How long does it take you to make this pot - is it half and hour, is it 3 hours?  I don't now if you can put it on the screen in a corner as trext. Or maybe in the description.

I kind of guessed you just had the fire going and then as soon as it dried you put on the next few layers.  I mean of course it's not 1 week of work, but drying etc does need to happen.  Concerning the water: which of the two methods of heat-sterilisation do you prefer? The one with the pot in/over the fire or the one with the stones in it?  Also: Since your channel kind of blew up concerning views: Did you get approached by the media or something? SInce I could see a TV show around this theme beeing something that might work.

Really, you look like that type of person who when he gets cast away, alone on some island hell just build his own big house with jacuzzi out of mud, wood and leaves, and will be sitting in that jacuzzi while drinking self distilled mojito from self burned clay glass :P There are only two things for now that i wish to see from you and that you didn't show how to make: How to make comfortable* and easily emptying toilet/latrine (preferly toilet :P), andhow to make good hmm. Grill placement? Oven? A place for cooking food with hard flat surface or grill. I think you know waht i meant. It would be really cool to see you doing thoose two, because i think they are most important things right after building a shelter. When you are abandoned on the island in the wild, you need a shelter from sun, rain,  cold... weather and animals. But toilet and cooking place are important. You need to eat. And to defecate somewhere. You probably will not be shitting near your shelter in woods, that's impractical. And you need to eat! So two (or even three things for you to do are: lone standing toilet with roof, cooking place with flat surface or grill, and optionally rainwater catcher (for situations when you dont have any water comming nearby.

@nomnomnomymous,"Some videos on making traps and hunting equipment would be cool/useful, but I wouldn't advocate going to all of the trouble to actually catch/hunt something. The thing is, in a survival situation where you'd actually need this info, you're not going to want the animal alive and unhurt. You want it dead so you can eat it without it fighting back, unless of course you're so well established that you want to start breeding them.  To note guys, he does this as a hobby. He's said before he doesn't live in the fucking forest, this is just something he enjoys doing.  Additionally, prepping an animal after killing it to eat is a LOT of work. People don't realize just how much work specialization and modern processing technology takes out of the equation for us. If you're a part of a community, it's not as big a deal, because other people can do things that you don't have the time for because you're prepping animals, and conversely, they don't have to prep animals because you do it. That's specialization. But when you're alone, you have to be careful about what you hunt. A pig would be way too much for one person, an unless you know what you're doing, there's a decent chance the meat will start to rot before you even get to start preserving it. You would want to stick to rabbits, squirrels, lizards, and other small vertebrates.

@JusBidniss,"Cool vid, as always!  I love your depictions of primitive tech, with no modern aids used, just walk into the forest with no knife or cordage or anything, and use what's naturally there.  I wish there were more vids on youtube like yours.  I look for a new vid on your channel almost every day, and am a huge fan.  Question on your clay processing?  How is it that other vids show various techniques for using stones in mortar/pestle-type grinding, picking out leaves, stones, etc., some vids show purifying the clay in containers of water, etc.  You just seem to dig it out of the bank, and it looks as pure a store-bought modelling clay?  Do you do other steps where you pick out twigs, etc.?  Or is it just a really good bank of clay you got there?   :)  Also question on your firings.  I see many vids out there showing more cracked pots than good ones.  And I do see you grinding broken fired clay pieces (for grog or temper?), so you apparently do have some breakage.  But how do you avoid the cracks experienced by others trying to depict primitive pottery?  Do you let the pieces cool all the way down before extracting them?  Is there some optimum amount of temper you use?    I can imagine the frustration of being in a primitive situation and waiting days for clay to dry, fire and cool, only to have all my pieces crack!   :)",10년 전,0,

You need permits to hunt on private land as well. Sure, it isn't too enforceable but it exists. He could possibly go out and hunt illegally if he felt like it and most likely wouldn't be caught. He seems to want to document his general activity out there though, and capturing video footage of an illegal activity isn't exactly going to happen.",10년 전,3,
@hitforhelp,+Primitive Technology Its like watching a real life RPG. Watching you slowly level up I love seeing the progression that you are now up to pots and being able to cook hot food. You should consider a way to fire the rocks without them being in the ash of the wood.,10년 전,5,

@soulextracter,+Kidz On Didz FYI you're all wrong about the reason it takes so long between the videos.  It's near impossible that it would take a month to build that little chimney and those pots.  The reason behind the gaps is probably that this dude has a life as well.  He can't be making pots all the time.  Some times you just gotta enjoy some pot instead :D,10년 전,7,
