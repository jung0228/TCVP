@snehashispanda4808,"Monotheism (the doctrine or belief that there is only one God) is blamed as the instigator of ignorance, oppression, and violence. Monotheism has been a ""totalizing discourse"", often co-opting all aspects of a social belief system, resulting in the exclusion of ""others"". Monotheism is less pluralistic and thus less tolerant than polytheism, because monotheism stipulates that people pigeonhole their beliefs into one tenet. ""Monotheism is irreconcilable with the existence in our nature of the instincts of benevolence"" because it compels followers to devote themselves to a single Creator. The logic of monotheism ... yields little basis for tolerating other religions"". Monotheism anesthetize the sense of wonder as if one were committed to a single line of thought by a cosmic legal contract"".",2년 전,1,

@DharmaTalksToo,"The Hell of Eye Shock: Men and women who use their eyes to commit sexual misconduct will be punished here. Up in the sky of this hell, there were many torture instruments. The torture devices looked like different variations of books, tablet computers, smartphones, computers (both modern and old like those back in 1998), and televisions (both modern and old). These instruments were used to punish the souls for their lustful thoughts.  In the Human Realm, people think that it’s a kind of entertainment watching pornography, but they don’t know that if these negative karmic seeds were sowed into their mind, they would eventually mature into a negative karmic fruit. As it’s accumulated every day, this negative karma will eventually mature. Only by reciting sutras, paying respect to Buddha, performing many wholesome and meritorious deeds, and repenting and reforming themselves will they be able to halt the maturation of this negative karma.

@marium1387,"THIS is an example of slavery of women to society's expectations. It is also an example of her confusion because she is tricked to think that she is 'free' and 'liberated'. In truth what this is, is exploitation. This applies to both males and females, but way too common in the West for women. Dressing modestly is the RIGHT of everyone but the way it works in godless societies is they need women in skimpy clothes to sell every product. This tells a lot about the men in that society too and their perverted minds. And hence she becomes an object and not a person. How many example can  can we find of men in this situation? Almost none, unless it is made into a joke! But this embarrassment is this woman's real life and lives of every woman who is expected to show her skin. What a scam!",2년 전(수정됨),0,

He could have let her know he emphasized with her without making it even more uncomfortable by trying to cover her up  3. It was falling off before she even moved 4. Why wouldn’t she call for assistance and maybe borrow a jacket before she got on stage if she wants to do a casual selfie 5. Should boobs really bother anyone to begin with? 6.

If you truly value her you will be much more concern about her eye health. Even her own family members exposed her due to her not acknowledging her lies and when she's cornered, she resort to a dangerous blinding procedure of eye colored implant which is illegal and detrimental to her eyesight. You are such a huge joke. I just pray that she soon realize her madness and immediately remove the implants to spare herself from going blind.

You're getting so bent out of shape that I just dont care that much about this person's lies or what her parents think or that her decision might lead to her going blind. Crossing the road without looking might get you killed. You are free to do that though it might be a bad idea. We all are allowed to make our own choices in this country. We have rights and I am so thankful you cant tell me that I cant put myself at risk because you disagree. It's just not a hill worth dying on here. She changed her eye color in a procedure that may or may not blind her and lied about it? So fucking what!? This is not important at all. She took the risk for her career and it seems to have paid off. Good on her. People need to let it go. Yall are acting like she committed murder and got away with it. Get a life,5년 전,1,
@maningmimong6535," @digitalblasphemy1100  yeah sure tell that to her when she get blind. So much for freedom. She is in public eye so she will definitely get criticize and subject to scrutiny. That's the kind of industry she chose and no one is stoping her from that except her lies. The extent of her lies led her to soon self-destruct and you fail to acknowledge that saying I am a controlling person when I'm just voicing my opinion about her. Yeah sure go ahead and enable her stupid choice it's not like you will be directly affected when she goes blind, you can just pick another model to look up to because your admiration to people only lies on the looks alone without depth.

Why do I feel the need to call out other issues when there are other rooms for that? Plus I am not hating on her in fact I voiced out my concern to her just like youtubers that calls her out for lying. The thing is lying to the extent of your own destruction is maybe fine to you because it has nothing to do with you and you have no connection to this lady.

@maningmimong6535," @uouo5313  Also the very reason why I am against her lying and surgery is that in my fellow country's experiences, we have a lot who resort to underground and dangerous procedures (the infamous silicon inject) only to be left with pure terror. Her eye implant procedure to me is like that. It's quite easy to enable things you don't know the repercussions. I am also not the person who argued about the idea that she is taking away the opportunity of people with heterochromia. I only slip when I said that it is a disease of which dandy must have taken mad about, I should have said that heterochromia is a condition. The word disease is quite problematic for that matter. I've done my part here preaching because I came from experience and also having a relative with a transexual procedure speaks to itself.

That being the case, you're singling her out for the lie or lies she has told and it feels like you might accept the lies most others have to tell or accept to work in the business because they don't relate to a health condition.   Fashion, TV, advertisment and product placement, movies, and the list goes on - all tied together and containing a mix of toxic delusion and dishonesty of one flavour or another.   I don't condone her actions, but the reaction seems very particular and perhaps unreasonable given the dishonesty all over those sorts of careers. In fact, some of the best attention getting is what one might call bad PR... 'there is no bad publicity'.... it could be a strategy and we've accepted many others who've used that track in the past.",4년 전,1,
@ghandimauler, @digitalblasphemy1100  I disagree with @Maning Mimong but I'd also like to point out that your time and its value hasn't taken you out from this troll fight.   I would not say 'no harm here' unless you mean 'no harm to yourself' in which case that could be entirely true.   But feeding the angry and passionate just leads to more of the same. Righteousnous will brook no argument.,4년 전,1,
@ghandimauler," @digitalblasphemy1100  And on a similar vein: How many women have gotten breast augmentation, tummy tucks, facial surgery, rib removals, shortening of legs (or lengthening more likely), and so on... all processes which are risky and cosmetic.... but at the root of it all, people have a right to make choices and even if I don't agree with the wisdom of their choices, I can accept that those choices are theirs to make.   @Maning Mimong can fight the entire internet to get the point across, but ultimately a) the way people feel about her is their business, not @Maning Minong 's. And being preachy and judgmental is really bad manners as well. It's intrusive and the only person you should sit in judgment on is oneself.",4년 전,0,
@maningmimong6535, @ghandimauler  I no longer feel that type of way about her lies anymore since she decided to do what she wants. I just hope that she didn't undergone the blinding procedure just to keep her lies and just stick with contact lenses. I haven't heard from her anymore nowadays. Some people will do anything to be unique and standout for their own career and other personal reasons. I was just hoping that she wake up from her lies and stop at an early stage so she won't regret anything in the future.,4년 전,0,

@Korremi,"Olivia Morales That’s not the point. What’s problematic is that she’s posing as a model that represents people with heterochromia, which isn’t just a mutation in eye color but can also be a mutation of color in the skin or hair. She blatantly lies that she was bullied as a child for having the condition, and wants to use her platform as a way to “build up confidence” in those who have it. By putting up this charade she’s basically undermining the actual struggles that people with heterochromia have, which is not cool. She’s literally using a genetic mutation to boost her fame.",5년 전,6,

@zqwc,It clearly looks like whoever picked her outfit for this interview did not get the size of the dress right. you can tell from the back that its WAYYYY too loose around her chest and that's why it keeps falling off. Imagine being her in front of millions of people trying not to expose herself because of a wardrobe malfunction. She keeps her composure throughout the interview very well and i'm surprised that Stephen didn't take off his blazer and just hand it to her.,7년 전,0,

Yes Sarah's looks like a contact lens but it's a bit more complex than just one eye is brown one eye is blue.

@TruthNerds,"+Melan Zligga The irony is that from all this wildly generalizing feminist talk of patronizing behavior one could get the impression that women today are super insecure and have to be protected from any suggestion they might possibly not be perfect. Anyway, she may have chosen a revealing dress but her body language makes it very clear that now she is not so happy with her choice.",9년 전,2,
@melanzligga7057,"TruthNerds Yeah, no. Her facial expressions and awkward non-reaction to his jokes make it very clear that he's digging her embarrassment hole deeper and that she wishes he'd move on instead of casting attention on her nudity, so putting his jacket on her might have made her straight up angry.   See what we're doing right now? We're debating whether she'd be offended or pleased by any action of his. Why should any man step on such a vague landmine? Women defend their public nudity aggressively and then they get uncomfortable in a revealing non-dress and expect chivalry? This is ridiculous.",9년 전,4,
@TruthNerds,"+Melan Zligga Oh, I think he handled it very well… not at all because he was sparing her embarrassment, but because he's a comedian, and he made comedy. In fact, a comedian often has to walk the thin line between the inappropriate and the outrageous. And I admit that the coat thing would be indiscreet in front of a TV camera. I object more to the notion that a man can never offer his coat to a woman because she chose to be almost nude, and that she must automatically be upset by the offer. What if they're out on a date and it's getting cold later in the evening? If she gets upset then, probably she already decided not to like him, or the presentation was really horrible.  OT: Nowadays, there's an industry of ""feminists"" who are working full time at defining male behaviors as socially unacceptable. As you mentioned, women fought hard for their right to walk around in public with almost nothing on. Now the ""feminists"" are fighting against ""manspreading"" (sic) because the men are ""sharing too much"". And then they're claiming that feminism is really about treating all people equally. Give me a break.",9년 전,0,
@alexbush714," @melanzligga7057  That doesn't really make any sense. He literally offered her duct tape. He already basically told her she was exposed. Offering her his jacket would've actually solved the problem as well as been the same (if not less) amount of embarrassment as him saying the duct tape comment. As you can see, Stephen Colbert hasn't been ""cancelled"" or whatever you thought would happen to him. He literally ALREADY insinuated that she's exposed and that her exposure is bad in this video.   What would've ended her embarrassment would've been just giving her his jacket after about the 5th ""pull up"" of the dress. It would've been balanced and normal looking as she herself called attention to herself by adjusting the dress in that moment, meaning that she can't really blame anyone but herself for whatever ""embarrassment"" you feel she would've felt in that moment. If he had given her his jacket quickly, the situation could've been resolved fast and they could've had an actual interview and this video wouldn't have nearly the amount of views it has. The ""cringe"" would've dissipated immediately and all we would've been left with was a sort of funny moment. That's it.   Your assessment of the situation is just plain wrong. Also, your other assertion that women defend their nudity and that men would be stepping on some sort of landmine is also ridiculous. She's pulling up her dress. That action means she is uncomfortable in her dress and would like something to change. End of story. No landmine there. Pretty cut and dry.  Stop trying to screech and cry that feminism is ruining your ability to be kind, considerate, and have empathy and just admit that you want to use feminism as an excuse to be inconsiderate, selfish, and rude.",2년 전(수정됨),1,
