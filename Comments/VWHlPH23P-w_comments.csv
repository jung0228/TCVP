It was the clearly the cheapest board that Walmart could source that was compatible with the 8700, which meant it had under-built VRMs to power the CPU (which is especially not ideal when you have a not-so-great power supply because the VRMs are the last defense against dirty power being supplied. It only has two slots for RAM, which while not technically an issue, single channel memory is just not acceptable (which having two sticks can limit you to if you are trying to save space for another stick in the future as done here. As for the USB 3 issue, the motherboard did have a USB front header (which the case is too crappy to make use of), but the rear IO was so budget that from the video it appears that it only had 2 USB 3 ports (hence the weird add-in card.)",9개월 전,0,

I mean AMD gave it a shot, but theres still much to Perfectionise on there, windows isnt really compatible with the whole ass picture as well so it's not like its impossible, its just not Compatible yet, but that'll change when Nvidia will start selling their ARM based Prozessors which somehow get Windows compatibility, that'll make Apples Macs compatible with Windows as well so the Majority will have windows on their devices, with ARM Being Way more Power Efficient and Powerfull at the same time, itll crash the market of our prozessors at the time and youll get way better Performance for a decent Price, plus it doesnt need as much cooling, which means to make a Powerfull Prozessor they wont need to cool it as much, or if you'd make a prozessor needy of that much cooling then itll be the best one out there, or at least one of the best ones out there",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@dr07828,"Linus is wrong about partitioning. I mean, I am not sure how the drive was partitioned. If it was one drive, then yes... not so smart. But if there is more than one drive, and they are fast drives, you can put a piece of VM on each and speed up VM.  Back in the mid 2000's I had 5 scsi drives, they were partitioned in a way where you couldn't tell there were multiple drives, as in I would mount specific directories to particular drives. But I had a piece of the SWAP on each drive effectively speeding up swap.  PS, there is nothing wrong with partitioning a drive either. For instance, if you put all the users directories on their own partition, if the OS fails, and you need to reinstall, you can reinstall but not format the user directory partition, make the same user with the same password and it's like you never left so to speak..... No lost files.. just like you left it to a degree.",3년 전,0,

Years ago many prebuilds from non-specialized brands would come with a 10 dollar cpu stock cooler rather than a proper one. Yes the usb choice for usb2.0 and the single lane memory is odd, however I think any person that doesn't know much about PC's and just wanna boot up some fortnite or whatever would be more than happy with this system being easily accessible and purchasable at a place like Walmart.

@munroborisenko7278,"That looks like a cheap micro ATX MB. Linus did not mention that they also save money by using a MB model with a slower FSB speed. Motherboard manufacturers always have a slightly cheaper version that has a slower FSB. The components on the board communicate thru the FSB (if you like, lane ways on the board), ie. sound card to CPU. So the FSB frequency does matter. I have never heard of only ONE slot for Ram; no dual channel and you are forced to buy a big expensive Ram module as you have no more room after that. USB 2.0, wow it's not 2005 !!!! That really makes the system look bad. And the $25 power supply (yuck); that will fail in three or four years. . I bet that mother board cost them like $40. Terrible for a gaming system; but that's how they saved the $$. I think they think people who are not technical at all will be blown away by the silly light show on the front of the case.",3년 전,0,

@FrostGamingHype,"you are just amazing fun fact:people are making animated looking game coz the beauty of animation is getting big and is more easy and looks good takes less time to make texures and all that c++/c/c# work and also the game takes less cpu utilization that we have today an simple i5  with an ddr 4 16 or 8gb ram gtx 680 graphics card can handle and also the reason windows 11 and android looks animated os type they look more nice and easy to handle gui also if that was not enough so the mac and linux also does this kind of work and also it is more easy to perform these tasks rather than windows 10 since more pixel requires more work in pixel art that's done by the computer but now it is going to be really easy since only 2,3,4,5,6 colors types are required to perform animated looking guis and all but when comes to super clarify it kind of uses 10 to 40 50% more utilization of the cpu,ram to send the code faster 0001=1(4bit) an 4gb of ram would have 1 billion of the zeros like 999.99million zeros and one  1 to make it ==1 and that's why the data needs to get faster 4200mhz ddr 4 ram=4.2ghz ram 4.2 billion clock cycles and an ddr 5 would have 5300 = 5.3 ghz so its an time to switch to intel processor since you can use the full clock speed without making your cpu get a lot lot lot hot like amd so intel 11th gen 5.3ghz or 10 gen can be used with its full speed = 5.3 billion cores executing work/s 5.3gb of the ram is getting executed fast",4년 전,1,

I easily get 300-400FPS (I play on low settings). Even for games such as Escape From Tarkov.. Sure, the FPS is only around 80-100, but having 240hz on tarkov is not as important as in a game like CS, for example.  I also play Richard Burns Rally, which is such an old game, it can run on a PC from like 2010 at like 200FPS.

@drek9k2," @wuyi250  People think Walmart is ""cheap""  this is not true Walmart has some of the highest fucking margins around, their whole electronics department is GARBAGE I would never buy anything but a cellphone portable battery pack or a USB drive from there. And even then you just know their Onn brand is trash like all else. They come in, bust all the stores, suppress any unions, no the company is crap. I'll give it this their pay rates and some things like PTO and insurance isn't trash compared to idk say, being a dishwasher, but the megacorp is itself a vampire. They I am not joking have among the worst prices and more or less drive it all up after bankrupting anyone else in the area, they're trying to become a microstate that has everything from your car mechanic to your family lawyer in it. It's truly Syndicate tier. It's rife with incompetence and greed. Don't ever buy things at walmart expecting them to be good or cheap for they are neither. The only thing more shitty is ""Alienware"" Dell computers, which have even higher margins and even worse build quality. I mean ffs at least you might get a Speedster AIB cooler or something. Dell is just trash all around your GPU resale value is below literally every single other GPU on the market yet the machine costs the most and performs the least. That stated, $2200 for a 1080ti, is sadly not even as horrendous as other shit I've seen, and by today's standards isn't even as shite.",1년 전,0,
@drek9k2," @hansolo631  No it's not. It has also got inferior VRAM. That guy's been had. He got a literally 6% worse performing 6gb GPU on an even shittier motherboard than the Overpowered. The GTX 1660 Super 6gb is WORSE than the GTX 1070 8gb. See this is the problem with so many of you kids, just because it's newer doesn't make it better, just because it's nVidia doesn't make it faster only more expensive (and also it probably won't last longer like a Radeon does, it's not just the driver fine tuning, the real reason Radeons last better than nVidias is because of nVidia's bad VRAM, compare a GTX 780ti 3gb to RX 480 8gb, the Radeon 480 is about the same speed maybe like 2% faster but they're basically the same GPU performance only the Radeon has over twice the VRAM this makes the 780ti practically worthless by today's standards whereas you still can use a 480 for budget gaming, for that exact reason is why GTX 660ti and 770 are useless they are 2gb, the GTX 570 1.2gb could play older titles if it wasn't utterly crippled by its VRAM limitations. nVidia only makes VRAM for the games out right this second, that is why anyone who bought a 3070ti got completely hosed because in 2 years there already was games being limited by 8gb, by 2025 the 3070ti is some cuckcard you need to turn settings to medium and some games might not even run, it's a horrible expereince on the nVidia RTX card whereas RX 6800 non-XT 16gb is going to still be a fantastic GPU for years to come).  So you got 6% slower card with 2gb less VRAM because it was ""newer"" overpaid for the worse GPU, got a really terrible prebuilt around it, all on top of that you probably could have easily just gotten a 5600XT for the same money but had 20%+ more power. Since it doesn't even have RT cores you can't raytrace with it so it's irrelevant it's a GTX card you're only getting raster anyway. This is why you need to pay attention.",1년 전,0,

@philiplin4518,"Good specs on paper, bad quality and design. 1, this case design is severely lacking airflow the front 3 fans are absolutely starved for air because the front glass is blocking them. they also use cheap fans that are purely for aesthetic purposes. The very demanding graphics card and cpu runs hot thus not performing like they should and will fail prematurely because of heat. 2. The motherboard is of very low quality and this is the thing all the important parts go in. Even though this pc has high specs the motherboard is bottlenecking everything due to low bus speeds, making it completely counterintuitive to put high end parts in it ( such as the processor and graphics card ) Just another place Walmart has cut corners and most unsuspecting people who don't know as much as a computer enthusiast wouldnt know the difference. 3. The ram is the lowest quality ram that Adata offers. It does not have any type of heat dissipating properties at all, another place that Walmart has cut corners 4. arguably the most alarming thing is the power supply they are putting in these computers. you will be lucky to get two years out of them before they could potentially and quite literally fry every component in the computer. This is possibly the easiest thing to cheap out on and just another corner walmart has cut. People often overlook the power supply in prebuilt gaming pcs. It's very questionable that the power supply can even supply enough power for the highly demanding graphics card under really stressful load. This is why computers crash, things become instable because of supplied power and needed demand. computer builders do not cheap out on power supplies because they do not want to risk destroying every component in their PC. this is easily a $5 power supply from China, and in my opinion should be considered a fire hazard. 5. As demonstrated by many reviewers on YouTube, the quality by whoever is putting these computers together is very questionable. they are leaving things unplugged, hot gluing things that shouldn't be glued etc. it's really quite laughable. If you get one that doesnt work, you will have to deal with a customer support that doesn't deal with computers. You'll have to ship it back before they ship you a new one. 6. The company Walmart is using to build these computers offer the absolute worst customer support imaginable. Walmart is not as lenient when it comes to electronics as they are everything else in the store. if something happens to this computer down the road you are stuck with it unless you purchase a separate warranty for it. I would normally say you get what you pay for but instead of calling this computer overpowered it should be called overpriced for what you get. if you want to pull a sick prank on somebody buy them this computer. I recommend looking for a prebuilt PC elsewhere with better reputation or consider building your own for far less, it's actually really easy, and you can assure every part is hi-quality.",4년 전,1,

@masacarre,"I mean, yes this PC has issues with reliability connected to the motherboard and power supply. Overall the critique on the expandability or upgradability was unnecesarry. anyone buying a PC from walmart clearly doesn't care enough about actually building the PC and just wants something to run out of the box. They won't be upgrading it they will just be buying a new PC in a few years. The reliability issue is something that can be glossed over with an extended warranty. if either the Mobo or PSU fail they will be able to be RMA'd. The biggest problem that I saw with this PC (acting as if I was a walmart customer) is that the GPU was unplugged from the box. Anyone buying this would have had no way of knowing how to fix that and probably would not have spent the time to fix it, overall wasting their time.",5년 전,0,

@Choom2077,"If someone gave me 1400.00 dollars and said, ""here, take this a make a good gaming PC with it"", I would have something put together that is a bit more reliable and stronger overall than this Walmart PC. It doesn't come with a monitor, nor a k/m btw. It's just the tower for 1400.00 dollars. For fun, I did a little fantasy shopping and this is what I was able to put together for the same price point. Slightly cheaper in fact.  Mobo: Asus Strix B450-F BIOS updated (proven to be an excellent gaming board on the budget) - $130.00 CPU: Ryzen 3600x 6 core 12 threads @ 4.4ghz (awesome single core performance as well as multi-core) - $250.00 RAM: Corsair Vengeance 16gb CL16 3200mhz (dual 8GB sticks) - $70.00 GPU: PNY GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB (used on Ebay and still an amazing GPU for high demanding games) - $450.00 SSD: 1TB SSD Samsung Evo 860 (for games) - $130.00 SSD: 256GB Samsung Evo 860 Pro (for boot up) - $87.99 TOWER: Cooler Master MasterBox TD500 Mesh Airflow ATX Mid-Tower (either in black or white. Comes with 3 120mm RGB fans)- $100.00 PSU: Thermaltake Smart 700W 80+ (more than adequate for the components) - $70.00 Windows 10 64-Bit Home: $100.00  (Prices grabbed from Amazon, except the used 1080ti GPU)  Grand total: 1387.99  I suppose if you're afraid to put these parts together yourself, then the Walmart prebuilt is your best option and I say this without any snobbery.  I understand that fear. Though I'll be honest, it's not as hard as it looks. Just wear an anti-static band (or touch your tower's aluminum frame to discharge. This is how we old schoolers do it.) and follow instructions. The CPU is probably the most delicate because it is a fragile component you don't wan to drop or bend pins.. but well, you get rewarded with a better PC for your money. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",5년 전(수정됨),0,

If the Walmart pre-built uses junk parts, you aren't going to be saving anything in the longer term because eventually you are going to have issues and what kind of tech support does Walmart offer? I can assure you that it won't be the same as Dell, Asus or HP. Saving a hundred dollars up front isn't worth it. If you want to save a hundred dollars, buy the parts separately and assemble them yourself. If you know what parts to look for, you'll end up with a better PC. If aesthetic considerations like lighting and a slick looking case design don't matter to you, you can save even more money by buying higher quality parts to put inside a more generic looking case.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

The performance differences would concern hardcore gamers and people who have the ability to build their own pc's and they would.... build their own. The minimal cost of things like powder coating a power supply is minimal for 1 unit, but buying millions of them would be a significant cost reduction.  It's a Wal-Mart pc, the return they'd get on spending more on rgb is higher than they would get for having more usb3, a pretty power supply, and a better mother board because all that demographic is going to care about is if it plays their game and if it looks bad ass.",5년 전,0,

If you're paying a whopping $1,500 on a pre-built, it better be nearly flawless.  And this gaming rig has too many flaws, both small and big. A teenager without any advanced knowledge could get away with this Walmart PC beast... but to others who CAN built their own and usually DO - this is why pre-builts aren't worth it.

The only 2 real points of critisism are the loose power connector, which, granted, is stupid, and the front usb 2.0 ports. Which is not that important for 99% of the people in the world.  What DOES one get? A PC which looks reasonably nice, with nice RGB, a subjectively cool looking case (it looks better than that HP thing) and performance as expected for the components.  This is not an objective review. Any objective review should have come to the conclusion that this is a reasonable deal. It's not a great deal, and yes if you build it yourself, you might spend a few bucks more on some components, but all in all, it's not a bad PC at that pricepoint. And, lets be honest, people who buy their PC at wallmart, are not likely to be the people who can build anything better themselves.  I get it. It's not 'overwpowered' as the box states. It could have been more expandable. But you're just faulting this based on other peoples opinions and reviews, this review is NOT impartial and NOT objective.

@prophetizing806," @mikerelf  Nit-picking and overly exaggerated reactions: 1000+, your opinion of real issues: 4. Yep, balances out.  It's a pre-built PC; if people wanted to expand it, then they should've just built their own computer to begin with. It's Walmart: one wire was disconnected, hallelujah! It was right in the open, pretty easy fix even for a six year old. Why would they spend for an exceptional motherboard or PSU instead of what's needed for that specific build? Especially with GPU's and CPU's having more performance with less wattage demand, and crossfire/sli support being abandoned. It's a pre-built PC: It's the same concept as buying a laptop, apple computer, brand-name PC, any other pre-built PC, it's not meant to be expanded upon, that's why so many enthusiasts build their own PC. The hot-glue part was very strange though.",4년 전,0,
@prophetizing806," @saltybiscuit8949  Agreed man. I was waiting for some real red flags, problems, deal-breakers; yet all I heard/saw was exaggerated reactions and nit-picking.

Good info though, thanks. While not an expert, I doubt the average PC gamer will come across an issue with their devices with USB 2.0 within the next half a decade.

It just makes it look bigger to idiots.  The hot glue is BAD. That stuff degrades over time when exposed to heat, and what you do NOT want is it breaking apart and getting everywhere. Depending on the glue it's a fire hazard.   The onboard GPU isn't that big Deal... except it's telling you about the quality of the MOBO itself.  And the USB slots? Are you dense?! Those front ones are THE most used USB on the entire thing. It's like having a car that only has cup holders in the back seat! That's abysmal.

@James-qn3wi,"Kykot  That's because what HP is doing is illegal. They give marketable PC's the best specifications to bigger corporations so they would ensure that it would not crash on workers. There is a tab on HP's page that sells a large order of desktops to companies without a microchip death timer.  And if you are a purchaser and get an HP PC at the open market then you would be buying one where the death clock starts when you turn  the PC on outside of the box. As soon as the HP laptop starts to slow down, then breaks, the first thing that would come to mind is that you need to get an another computer. And that's exactly what HP wants you to think. That's the reason why a lot of their products are dirt cheap. Anybody who reveals that secret would always get fired right off the bat in the factory.  Trust me, it's not worth it to get them.  Which is why I always use Dell. The CEO of Dell said that all of their computers are one and done. None of their products ever failed me before.

@tesityr6722,"If I may help those wondering 'why' it would be done [without answering directly whether it should be done or when or how, sorry], Partitioning Drives mostly just helps the Manufacturer or Assembler or Vendor these days.  For example, on a Dell system I worked on in the past, it was Partitioned into two, so that there was a “System Restore” backup of the entire pre-bought thing (imagine a ‘screenshot’ of the entire file system before it leaves the store), so that any customer could do a “reset” on the whole system – essentially ‘blowing away’ anything they had (backups are good) and restoring the system to a fresh-from-the-store configuration (data-wise, as in, how Windows would be clean and new, etc). This was very useful for many vendors (Gateway, Dell, almost any pre-built computer vendor [I’ve worked in a few computer stores in my day, as a Service Tech]) and is still done today in some, including some businesses. This allowed Technical Support to, as a last resort to solving some issue, remotely allow the customer to ‘reset’ their system to when they first bought it [I’ve worked at AT&T and done Technical Support for a few places in my day].  That is at least, is one reason why Partitions might be useful.  Another reason is potential virus protection for end users. As a manufacturer or vendor or TechSupport, you never know what a customer is doing with their computer. And that’s fine, but to help with reducing issues related to potential virus/trojan/malware, one simple (although not as effective these days) protection is to have a few Partitions. This way, you can say, have the Userspace (where files are saved by Default) on another Partition than Windows. Or have that System Restore data, mentioned above, on a separate partition. The reasoning behind this, is that most viruses/worms won’t ‘jump partitions’ – at least in the old days. They would ‘go up the file system’, looking for the ‘root’, trying to move around, as viruses do; but not really getting into other areas by going across Partitions. That was just how they were made and part of their simplicity.   Today, viruses/trojans/malware does different things, such as get injected into RAM (working memory), infecting Windows system files, downloading vectors (getting files from the internet connection to infect with), and more (like infiltrating/hijacking the BIOS or CPU). Thus, a separate space for files isn’t as much of a protection as the old days, but it still was one and is slightly useful for that still today; hence why some vendors might still do this on pre-built systems.  Lastly, partitions can help for other reasons, like filesystem malfunction (although this is more for mechanical, platter drives and not SSDs, and it doesn’t always work). If a filesystem becomes corrupted, say on a 4TB drive, instead of all those folders getting wrecked, it will only potentially corrupt up to the end of the partition on the drive (say, if you had a E: drive and F: drive, you would only lose access to the F: drive and not the E: drive, as an example of how it would be experienced). You could essentially just Delete the Partition and still use the rest of the drive until you could get a replacement (it would ‘still work’ despite it almost dying on you, saving your files at the same time). However, due to the FAT (File Allocation Table, like a ‘table of contents’ for the files on a disk) and other things, you could still lose access to the entire thing anyway (if the FAT became corrupt/damaged) – that is until NTFS became more widespread as a filesystem. NTFS has multiple locations for the File Allocation Table and other protections, which help against some of these things that Partitioning was potentially protecting against.   So while there isn’t as much need to Partition anymore, it can still have its’ uses, however potential or theoretical it might be. Just to answer the “why”, for those wondering.  HTH",5년 전,4,

@Holy_Sid," @bennettcarlson3974  It means dividing the hard drive storage in multiple parts. English is not my native language but I’ll try to explain.   Imagine that the hard drive as a whole is like a room. And the data you have to store are boxes. So when you make 4 partitions in the hard drive, you draw a line and divide the room into 4 parts.  The problem arises when you have to store a large file. In this case, a large sofa which won’t fit in one section of the room.   The advantage of multiple partitions is when you’re defragmenting the hard drive. Imagine your room is dirty with trash all over the floor, just like it’s more convenient to clean different sections of the room rather than cleaning the whole room at once.",3년 전,1,

Minimize the motherboard so you can't install extra components.

Don't buy retail, plus it's a fantastic experience and when it boots and runs for the first time the feeling is 100x that of just unboxing what you hope is awesome.

@user_friendly_9388,"I bought my gaming pc like 4-5 years ago, it is a nice little monster, not super mega expensive, but enough that it hurted a bit. I was looking for something that can get this much use after many years, so far I did just one update on the ram wich I double it, and I had to repair the videocard because there was a contractor in the area, turns up there was a bunch of dust in the air and clogged my fans on the card and almost burned the whole thing I was lucky to repair it with alcohol, big air cleaning and a nice load of cream on the chip. Runs great overall. My PC came packed with 4 USB ports on the front and 6 on the back. a quarter of them are 2.0's the rest is 3.0's, remind you my rig is OLDER  than this ""overcrap"". I notice the difference because all my newer peripherals run SLOWER with the 2.0's and sometime don't even run. Imagine buying a PC that costs some losers salary and you plug-in your nice and expensive, Blue Yeti Mic, the only thing is no one will ever hear you scream if you're streaming. Srsly, imagine you spend 200 or 300 buck in some cool gaming mouse or keyboard or any other cool shit, it's going to work like crap IF IT DOES! Not a good idea, also, OC's only get them if branded or if is benchmark OC's, unless you know your shit, also this comes from a loser who barely knows how to change ram sticks, even I can see the fucking mess that thing is, also creazy LED's are soooo 2009 boyos.",5년 전,0,

Even when they do, they WEAR A MASK AND SOCIAL DISTANCE. you are literally saying that you don’t care if you kill someone because ""I will never wear a mask!!!!!!"". does that make you tough? just put a fucking mask on. it takes under 5 seconds. it’s that fucking simple. but since you have the IQ of rusty metal, you can’t even do that. get a fucking life.",5년 전,1,

@GBOverload,"MixinThe Bisquic I would suggest listening to someone that isn’t your doctor than. As it seems his perspective is factually wrong, and given who the CDC is, you should listen to them first at least. I also want to add that h !’s perspective on being able to earn what he wants does have a valid point, no one, and I mean no one right now wants anyone touching their items unless they specifically say otherwise. Now are their people that don’t care sure, but those people who don’t take those precautions are only endangering themselves and others. Mowing a lawn in his area would require he have his own lawn mower to take around in order to not pass illness possibly, especially right now. Now could he do that, yes, that is an option. However the problem is how much is he willing to go to earn the items and money he wants. I was able to find a job myself that had I had no experience, I still could have joined. I just had to have the skills to learn new things is all that was required, and now I earn at max of 1,200 dollars after my training was finished. However not everyone has to will to go searching every corner, and do it safely. Both of you are wrong in certain ways, and neither want to see the other’s perspective to make both of you right.

That wedge is a slice of the market that you want to penetrate in order to continue expanding your product. Everything LTT says here goes along with that tactic. At first he notices how decent the gameplay is ""despite all these other things"". Then he continues to go on and say ""I just don't get it, this held up pretty well against the HP but then I see things like cheap PSU's and USB 2.0's in the front case"". That's exactly what I'd expect from a team that is looking to ship a product that does one thing well. The Walmart PC held up against benchmarks and actual gaming stats but did not hold up against LTT's scrutiny of craftsmanship. If I had to guess I'd say they just didn't care about that.

@SandyRiverBlue,"It's tens of cents to powder coat a power supply. Retooling your manufacturing line to include powder coating is in the tens of thousands. Assuming that they build the power supply in-house this may be the reason that they don't do it. On the other hand, 10 cents adds up when you're moving tens of thousands of units (That's $1,000 per 10,000 units). Since their buyers are already aware of the fact that they are getting a low-cost product there really is no reason for them to add all of these extra value points.   Also the hot glue on one connector but not the other: I've seen this on various assembly lines and it has to do with assembly process ordering. One thing may be protected while another is not because of the workflow necessitates it (Like if you have efficiency bottlenecks because your assembler keeps bumping into it while installing other parts- usually you can fix this by re-ordering assembly but where you can't you pad, you glue or you retrain). You'll find these kinds of features in product lines that have close efficiency inspection (essentially game tape that allows production managers to spot potential issues or after-the-fact identification to mitigate product re-work).",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@nahchief4847,So I recently got out of the army and bought a pre built cyber power. I am new to PC gaming considering the military uses IBM. I bought a 144hz monitor but seem to not be able to get to the max FPS on my pc. It only came with h 8gb of ram and no ssd drive. I was wondering if it’s not to much trouble if I could have some guidance on what to buy. I’m not super flushed with cash so if anyone knows what I should buy it would be a great help. My graphics card is an amd rx 560 and the cpu is 6300. If anyone could help that would be great. I like watching this channel even though I’m stupid and don’t know half the times what your saying.

@tesityr6722,"If I may explain, as a Retired Computer Service Technician; the Partitions are done by some pre-builts to assist in 'restoring' the system (eg. if there is a large problem that occurs). There is usually some type of compressed disk image of the 'final' version of the drive/partition (before shipping it out), which the Support can walk the End User through 'restoring' (the process), bringing the system back to it's original configuration/state (data-wise). End Users can also consult the Manual and walk themselves through 'restoring' the system with these disk/partition images (I used to do this for family members that bought these types of systems, when they did). These 'restoration images' used to be on discs that came with systems, back in say, Compaq days. Wow I'm old lol   Sorry to see this (and contribute) late-to-the-party, but I wanted to mention it, after seeing the stress poor L was put through seeing them (the partitions), heh.

@mathewsmith2990,"You really don't need that many partitions @lance...  Just one for OS and one for safe-keeping your files and program installs.  ...Aaaaand maybe one more for your system boot partition which is only used during start-up, and only if your system requires it.  But hey, do you.  If you are on an HDD i would highly recommend against partitioning it that much to get the most for your buck from that 2TB drive (Which I'm rather doubtful it's a 2TB SSD if you can't afford 4 500GB SSDs, price jumps are astronomical as the capacity of one unit goes up, most 2 TB SSDs are the same cost as 6 or 7 500GB SSDs.)  OS partition+user partition is harder on the life of your HDD but preserves your data in the event you have to wipe your OS and start over.  Also, you only need ~150-200GB for windows 7/8(.1), and about only ~30-40GB for windows 10, so I hardly see the need for a 500GB system SSD...  I am not trying to knock the way you run your system, just want to make sure you are aware the kind of stress you are putting your 2TB drive under (costly even as an HDD, probably as much as a single 500GB SSD).  The other option you could try in order to protect your data is by a second identical drive and run it as a mirror.  Unless you have the 3 other partitions mounted in the OS partition, in which case you might as well just run it without the partitions, as in most cases windows wipes all drives mounted as folders in the system drive unless you unmount before a wipe.  Been through that one a couple times myself.  The mount partitions as folders feature is meant to run an array of several drives as one for optimal performance (one drive, multiple read/write mechanisms allowing for faster overall registered speed as one drive, and the only way to get HDDs faster is to run them striped, but that required 2 identical drives installed at once for best results (one goes the other might as well be blank for all the good the every other stripe of data om it does).",5년 전,0,
@lancearn7332," @mathewsmith2990  For clarification, I have a 2TB HDD with 4 Partitions. My case will not allow for any more internal drives. I prefer to have multiple partitions to preserve data in the case of accidental or intentional acts to delete my data (which has happened in the past). But this is all mute at the moment,  as I am now currently looking to upgrade to a new computer which will have 4 x 1TB SSD's..",5년 전,0,

@tomdibernardo1699,"not true at all. There's many pre builds that are at a great price point with decent specs you just need to get them on places like amazon where you can see the components.

Best part yet was it let me get the computer right away and pay for it in interest free no credit check monthly payments. Alot of these pre built setups you could never build yourself for the same price . it's all a matter of doing your homework before buying the prebuilt.

Also, the Phenom II 820 is O/C'd to 3.41GHz utilizng the AMD FX 8k/9k series Wraith Cooler heat sink.  Funny thing is though, Can't do much with the GPU clocks because it hits a snag with onboard GPU clocks and full system crashes, BSOD and all, even though the onboard has no display attached and puts out no signal in win10 (no win10 driver without win8/7 upgrade driver rebuild for the HD3000 chipset and I do not have a win7/8 install media available anymore).  If i disable the onboard, the R7 gives no display at all other than POST/BIOS.

@kegginstructure,"For what it is worth, in September of 2003, I bought an HP Pavilion a265c from WalMart.  It had a GeForce FX 5200 card, good RAM and CPU for the time, including a P4 running at about 2.8 GHz with multi-threading.  Try to not gag over it, please...  consider it in historical context.  It was a GREAT gaming machine for that time frame, it was relatively cheap, and it ran WinXP.  But the best thing about it is that it is STILL RUNNING after 15 years or more.  OK, I expect it to die soon because when the HD dies, it is done.  It is too small and slow to run Win10.  But it is proof that SOMETIMES you can get a great deal from WalMart.  My wife's slightly different HP Pavilion (different sub-model) with 3.2 GHz and a Radeon card, also bought from WalMart, ran for 14 years before its HD crashed.  It, too, was too small and slow  to be useful in a Win10 system.   Of course, it helps if you can read specs and determine whether the system is overpowered, but the two I bought at the time were definitely overpowered when considered in context.  So yes, they probably got a ""sweat-shop"" assembly company and probably took short-cuts on that model you examined.  But trust me, sometimes you can get a darned good deal.",5년 전,0,

@setn111,Oh ok,5년 전,1,
@mathewsmith2990,"yeah, but that only requires 2 partitions: ONE for system OS, and ONE MORE for user info and installs.  And POSSIBLY a third smaller one for start up.  On my laptop though, it's an SSD split for 80 GB system and 130 GB user space partitions. I personally just use a 120GB SSD for system drive and an array of HDDs to separate installs (games etc), music, and videos to separate drives for my rig.  Also, more partitions on an HDD are NOT a good thing.  They slow down drive access times, as well as wear out your disk faster in my experience.  Typically, an HDD has only one arm for all it's heads.  Which means it can only be in one place at a time, only accessing one partition at a time, thus in trying to read from multiple partitions at once, it is constantly back and forth seeking across the disk between partitions.  Each movement of the swing arm puts stress and wear on the bearing and the control coils.  Eventually they wear out completely no matter what you do, but more stress=faster death.  For the longest life of your drive, you want as few partitions as possible.  Cannot blame anyone for partitioning off their OS install on a single drive system though.  Than if you have to wipe and reinstall windows, you lose none of your personals.  Also, my experience with SSDs is limited.  I do know that there are zero moving parts to wear out, but as i understand it heat is the biggest enemy of the SSD.  Also, I cannot speak to their lifespan vs HDD or partitioned SSD vs unpartitioned SSD.  But I have toasted many a HDD by overdoing partitions.  Had one rig that on a 320 GB HDD i had a partition for each version of 32 bit windows from XP on up to 8 and a fifth for Linux.  Did not go well for the 320 GB HDD.  Got 4 months out of it before it toasted and registered with a blank slot in bios.  Even went so far as to replace the drives I/O PCB with one from an identical drive that the data ring itself went corrupt on (any data written to it would become garbled or cease to exist within ten minutes).  Still got zilch, blank drive label at start-up.And it's I/O PCB on the corrupt drive yeilded the same results as the PCB swapped from it, so the problem was not the I/O PCB.  (Voids the warranty to exchange parts like such, I know.  But I had the pair for over a year before use already and assumed it was expired already, PLUS I had plenty others to replace them with).  There are advantages and disadvantages to every type of setup over all others, and vice versa.  Also, boot partitions tend to have zero impact on drive access because they are only typically accessed during boot up, so do not typically count towards multiple in use partitions.  I would not recommend going over 2 usable partitions per drive (preferably only one), and only if limited to one drive (ie. Laptops, all-in-ones(laptop in destop format), fresh out of the box PC).  I just wish i had though to go with a paiur of SSDs for the system drive to run the C drive mirrored for stability.",5년 전,0,

Look up some reviews and see what you can do, a great site is https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-2060S-Super-vs-AMD-RX-5700-XT/4049vs4045  Also look at the CPU. I would go with Ryzen (aka AMD) as they seem to have better value, but they fall short in high end systems where Intel can offer more. The Ryzen 5 3600 is pretty good, and of course if you’re budget allows the 3600X will improve soon it. It’s up to you, it’s you’re money.  Now some other things, if you’re streaming or video recording go with Nvidia. AMD isn’t bad, but NVENC just performs better than AMD’s video encoding. Ray tracing is another selling point, but don’t really get your hopes up for a 2060 to deliver good results with RTX.",5년 전,0,

@creationsmaxo,"Fact is... Walmart is only a reseller when it comes to electronics and their sale department doesn't even double-check authenticity nor quality of their product. There's a small silver-lining with their localized tech department, but only if it's available to you. Want to see how bad it can get? Look at this product sold on Walmart Canada : https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/10-1-inch-Tablet-Android-8-0-Bluetooth-PC-8-128G-ROM-2-SIM-with-GPS-Rose-gold-EU-plug/281N9MYT5JYP  For 60 CAD, you get Android tablet with a 10-Core CPU @ 2GHz, 128GB of Flash ROM, 8 GB of DDR3 RAM,  a 13.0MP back camera and 8.0MP front camera. Sound like that's one hell of a tablet, right? Well, if you think that it's a tablet from hell, damn right you are! This is a classic cheap knockoff Chinese tablet with falsified OS flashed onto the device. It's actually a Dual-Cores (2 cores) CPU @ 1.2GHz with 16GB of Flash ROM (falsified as 128GB which makes the device break within a few months due to data corruption) with a 2MP back camera and 1MP front camera. The device is being sold, originally, from a Chinese manufacturer for between 20 to 40 CAD a piece (depending on quantity) directly on Alibaba.  The worse of this is that it's not only a device that is fake, for a few years now it's also a device that is used to steal identity. The device doesn't always come with a recovery flash partition and has its OS modded to simply not delete any of the login/account data used on the device. Simply put, when you resetting the device to Factory settings, the device doesn't delete any emails nor even remove your account data from the device. All it does is log out off the accounts (while keeping stored login data in the flash memory). The only way to clean your data from the memory would be to Flash the OS which fails because it lack the recovery flash partition and using the usual hold-2-button just restart the device without access to the factory settings.  So, an unsuspected user who knows little about mobile devices ""risks"" would buy it and use it to access his bank accounts, Google account (right off the start when using the device for the first time) and check his emails. After 1-2 months, the data corruption from having a 16GB flash memory ""forcefully"" be simulated as a 128GB flash memory will make the OS crash or something bad happen. The user would then return the device for a new one. Walmart return the device to the ""seller"" who basically can access 98% of the original user's data with simple recovery tools.

Consumers (some consumers ... probably the less aware (more gullible) consumers) are swayed by numbers, so they have built the cheapest system they can that has the numbers (GB of ram, 1080Ti, cpu clock speed, SSD size) ... it ticks all these boxes (suspect the SSD isn't gonna be of the best quality), but none of these numbers that those consumers 'know' (or think they know) pertain to motherboard or PSU, so they can cheap right out on them.

I just looked at my wife and laughed and walked out without the cards.

@PinwheelCinema,"The Pros of Partitioning a Hard Drive:  1. Ease of Reinstallation  Keeping your Windows system files separate from your personal information makes it easy to perform operations on Windows.  For example, it’s relatively trivial to reinstall Windows when it’s on a separate partition. All you have to do is format your Windows partition and reinstall the OS. Your installed programs and files will stay where you left them.  If you like, you can even clone your Windows partition so you have an exact copy of your OS setup to return to.  2. Simpler Backups  Backing up your files is vital. While putting files on a separate partition isn’t an actual backup, it can make your backup scheme much simpler.  Like with your Windows installation, you can clone the entire partition to have an exact copy of its data. For a simpler approach, you can point your backup app to protect the entire drive, instead of having to pick and choose individual folders.  3. (Potentially) Improved Security  Partitioning your drive can also keep your data safer from malware attacks. If ransomware lands on your Windows partition, it would have a lesser chance of locking your personal files on another partition. You can easily reinstall Windows per above.  Of course, this depends on the specific attack, so we recommend keeping yourself protected against malware in the first place. The 8 Best Security Software for Windows 10 Malware Protection  4. Better Organization  Maybe you’re someone who loves to put everything in a certain place. Partitioning lets you add more dividers between data types. Perhaps you’d like to create a partition for games and apps and another for documents, music, and similar files.  If you find that the organization methods available to you on a single partition aren’t enough, adding new ones could help keep your data straight.  5. Install Multiple Operating Systems  We’ve discussed separating your OS files and personal data in most of the above reasons. But that’s not the only use for partitioning a hard drive. You can also add a partition to a drive to install another operating system on it.  Perhaps you want to run Linux alongside Windows, but your computer can’t handle a virtual machine. You can create a new partition for Linux without touching your existing Windows system.  Alternatively, you could install an older version of Windows for backward compatibility.  6. Use Many File Systems  Another multi-platform use for partitioning is to work with multiple file systems. While you probably don’t need to do this with your internal drive, it makes external drives more useful if you use them with multiple OSes.  For example, you might split a 1TB external HDD into partitions. Making one FAT32 or exFAT would work with Windows, while the other as Mac OS Extended would be compatible with your Mac. This lets you best use the available space for your needs.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

It gives a better look and when they don't have it, it usually means it's a very budget PSU since they even saved those couple cents per PSU to make it as cheap as possible. Often you can judge whether it's a cheap PSU or not just by looking at that fan side at the back. In short: not powder-coated = cheap PSU, not a good sign.",6년 전,1,
@ericpeacock79,"""Powder coating"" is a method of painting. Instead of liquid paint, a dry powder is electrically bonded to the metal, then heat cured. Powder coating will not chip or flake off like liquid paint will. The primary benefit, in a computer power supply scenario, is that a powder coat can be electrically conductive so the power supply can still provide ground to the chassis; whereas almost all dried liquid paint will insulate the metal.

Dealerships are required to offer warranty&recall service on new vehicles and they make profit from non-warranty service, that's why they have work areas.  Dealerships don't make vehicles or decisions on what materials are used for said vehicles.  Plastic and aluminum are stronger materials than gold, so using them is not corner cutting unless compared to carbon fiber.  Car manufacturers do indeed cut corners, but they try to only cut corners short enough so that cars won't typically fail until after warranty expiration(usually 100k mi or 3-5yrs).  Any new vehicle should have a warranty for, and be mechanically sound for a lot longer than a month.  Walmart cuts so many corners though that these things fail before you even attempt to turn them on.

@williamgolder3727,I would do anything to have a pc capable of playing rust again even a laptop I had a really nice pc but when me and the mother of my children split up I had a ruptured ulcer from stress and working so much to help her keep the house for my kids sake I was unable to work after my surgery and sold my 4000 dollar computer and my 2500 dollar computer and gave her the money to pay the mortgage while I was unable to work.  Now I'm struggling so bad because I'm still trying to help her as much as I can after she cheated on me after we spent 10 years together 5 children and I can barely afford to pay my own Bill's I miss waking up in the same house as my children and seeing them everyday I want to see my children everyday not just a few times a week want to be with them with all of my free time,6년 전,0,

@sonsofblades," @fiorbeth2662  The only advantage that PS/2 offers is ""true"" N-key rollover, and that's not really much of an advantage. Sure, PS/2 technically interrupts a CPU at 125hz, but USB polls its bus at up to 1000hz, so the speed difference is very little (100% imperceptible by humans), and anti-ghosting tech has mostly replaced N-key rollover.    That is unless you are in a enterprise environment. Then it makes complete sense, especially when security is concerned (USB is turned off outright in a lot of enterprise arenas). But, no enterprise environment worth their salt is going to buy hardware from Wal-mart's gaming brand. They will buy Dell laptops (or workstations), or Apple hardware. None of this boutique stuff.",6년 전,0,

Unless you travel a lot, gather a couple hundred more and get a budget desktop, something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A36hRAHRCVA Alternatively, investigate right here on youtube to see what you can do with your budget.  For a monitor, settle with 1080p and for peripherals, get something like a Logitech MK120 kit. It includes a membrane keyboard, but one that is quite comfortable for what it is. Couple that with something like a Logitech H390 budget headset. With these peripherals, you shouldn't cross the $150 mark in total.",6년 전,0,

@mikesully110," @2hadows  i build my first PC at the age of 13  and that was back in the days of pentium 2's.  Now a days it is easier as long as you buy the correct components.  The variety of components out today is a lot greater so it is more confusing to buy the correct components;  but once you do that physically building the system is a lot easier. There are a lot of online resources nowadays that can help with buying the right parts.  Everything is keyed so it will only fit into the right port. The heatsinks are a lot easier to install now (they screw in, the old heatsyncs you needed to use a screwdriver to force a latch over a bit that stuck out, the screwdriver could slip and gouge into your board) I'd still rather build my own than buy one, as you can get a decent board, PSU, dual channel RAM, buy your own SSD's etc  plus if you already have components you can re-use them  like reuse your old HDD as a secondary drive.   Plus watching Gaming Nexus video, he was actually shipped the wrong unit.  He bought a 32GB w/ 1080  and they shipped him a 16GB machine with a 1070.

I'd immediately upgrade it with another 16gb stick...  I have no problem with the power supply... or the wiring job... or the USB 2.0...  (nobody fucking uses 3.0 anyway)....   really the only big weakness I see is the choice in a bargain basement featureless mobo.  I want something with a ton of RAM slots.      I wouldn't pay $1500 for it though...  hmmm... maybe $400 tops?  According to Walmart the price on these has dropped to $899 so... there's that.  Then again, I wouldn't pay $1500 for any damn PC including that HP.  We''ve got two barns full of worthless PC's that at one time sold for thousands of dollars... $10,000 workstations even... but now.... total crap, not worth $10.   So no, not going to spend $1500 on any computer.   Computer hardware depreciates faster to zero than anything else in the world.  Probably the best part of this build was their case choice... a nice, square fucking case with matte black finish.

Respect the computer for what it really is, a decent deal, instead of shitting on it just because other YouTubers have.   Edit: I have to add this too.

@mathewsmith2990,"See, and here i thought RGB LEDs just added heat which leads to faster thermal throttling...  In fact, I have gotten an overall drop in system temps of about 7C from swapping 5 RGB fans out for plain black fans at 5-15CFM less per fan....  Looks cool, but definitely don't run cool with a lot of RGB effects.  HEAT is your ENEMY with electronics.  LEDs and the (necessary drivers for some as well as control modules for yet others) generate heat.  They can also steal wattage from your PSU if you don't have a sufficiently OP'd PSU for your core system itself, which can reduce stability.  Now, if you are sufficiently cooled and OP'd on the PSU in a well air conditioned environment, they impact wil be minimal, if even noticable to some from the RGB, but heat is heat and wattage is wattage.  RGB is more like computer bling.  Like that fake gold toothed grill or oversized chain wannabe gangsters often wear.  It looks cool, but don't put an over RGB's system in the same room you intend to sleep in if you ever want to sleep again.  Unless the Seizure inducing lighting effects help you sleep lol.  RGB is really just a way for manufacturers to get you to spend $5-$15 more per fan for the addition of 4-12 15 cent LEDs and like 10 cents worth of aluminum wire to power them IMHO.",5년 전,0,

@seti_o,"You must see what Lenovo has done with partitioning on some laptops, 6 /SIX/ partitions ! I've got the setup for a very limited time so i unable to demistify the mess, but it was like 2 recovery partitions, 1 OEM Install partition or something, 1 that I was unable to find the idea behind, and 2 for the user filesystem usage .. + the windows boot partition/S/ not counted in. It looked like someone used some older OEM one-key recovery builder tool and then another one on top of that and probably also upgraded Win 8.1 to 10 while leaving the boot partitions in the process. The problem - it ships like that ! So if you happen to see one, check it really fast to see if there isn't a hidden treasure of a video in there ;)",6년 전(수정됨),2,

The advertisement said an Intel 2.0Mhz. processor. At the time the processor was weak but passsible with the current software running on the computer. I ended up with an Intel 1.0Mhz processor. It literally took 30 minutes or more just use the computer after you log in. Or 45 minutes after you did a boot.   I had to borrow a laptop from the College Library and had to use more of my student loan money to buy a laptop from Amazon. Trying to save about $26.00 in taxes cost me $350.00. Thanks, Walmart.

I personally use that exact same cooler and its pretty darn good tbh. Cheap too, was 15.99 when i picked it up. Tip: If you add a second fan in a push pull system.. I'm getting average temps of 18C degrees  With That cooler on an AMD FX 8320, MSI 970 Mobo, 4 sticks of 1600mhz 8gb RAM, 750 watt modular evga PSU, a MSI GTX 6gb dual fan and 4X 120mm case fan's and a 200mm in a Cooler master Haf case.. my PC run's very cool.  In this video is seems as though the Video card they chose seems to be well purchased and CPU maybe? Case isn't the greatest but better then some, and they went all out on RGB. cool looks, good for kids, but has 0 functionality to the PC *RGB that is*. Having 4 fans is good, but how efficient are they? was there enough power to add a second card? Could you SLI? I'm assuming no by the looks of those punny wires.. and by the sounds of your reaction at first glance.. i'd assume no to SLI also LOL. Basically you are just over paying for a CPU, GPU and RGB fans/controller.. the Extension in the back is handy and reusable in most PC's with a 1x PCI slotBUT you can get one for $15 on newegg most day's... Most modern cases have them installed somewhere or this Gen of MoBo, at least that's what I've been noticing.

@TR-gj6xt,"you would be surprised how well these sell because most people don't know or really care. it's super easy to build it yourself, if you can't even do this then the odds that you care about any of the negatives is unlikely. built my first one when I was like 15, if you can do a basic puzzle then you can build a computer.  a friend needed help recently picking out a system to buy for their nephew. he wasn't sure what to get and was looking at something that was not going to be good at all, but it did have some lights. I recommending one that had a ryzen 2200g, rx 570, ssd and ram i think maybe 120ssd / 1tb hdd and 8gb ram, but it didn't have lights. i think the other one was a 1050ti (not even close in performance to a 570) and i3 6300.. whenever that system needs an upgrade it's done because you are limited with cpu options. the amd system allows a jump to ryzen 4th gen since they will make ryzen on am4 thru 2020 (it would be unlikely they stop at the ryzen coming out before this summer)  anyone who knows even a little about computers would agree the amd system is the way to go. the other one didn't even have an ssd, just a 500gb hdd and due to a sale they cost the same. the kid got it and started bitching because he said ""this is not a gaming computer, it doesn't have lights"", lol. it didn't look bad, it was an hp with some green glowing around it. this is how the average kid thinks who wants a gaming computer. they don't care about the things that matter, they just want it to look cool.   anyone who catches any of the issues with the prebuilt is just going to build it themselves anyway.",6년 전,0,

@amazingspiderfatty7375,I bought my PC from Best Buy and the shippers always and I mean always unplug internal cords so they don't get messed up when being shipped just in case or for cautionary reasons and almost 100% of the time when you open up the box the manufacturer tells you that you need to plug important cords back into the motherboard so I don't know why you guys are making this a bigger deal than this needs to be... Regardless I will never buy from Walmart but please don't try to make your videos over dramatic or force comedy where there doesn't need to be any. Overall I enjoyed most of your video especially the comparison test. Just make sure to open a box and read or look at all of the information inside of the box if you get any so you do not look a bit like morons while you are doing your videos. VGA is not that bad because it is meant for businesses and it makes life easier when you keep certain aspects to a PC and one being a VGA output.

They probably do not plug it in before being shipped to avoid damage to the graphics card - which actually kinda makes a little sense.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@Red_Dead_Director,"I am not sure what these guys were trying to accomplish -  seems like they go on about petty things that can be adjusted in less than a minute.  Appears that the Walmart PC not only is more aesthetically pleasing, but it runs faster and performs more efficiently at a lesser price.  As for the aesthetics on the one on the right, I just don't dig the transformers looking robot metal box with annoying red lights - looks very dated and something a person who puts bumper stickers and curb feelers all over their 12 year old Mercedes C Class would pick out.  When I want a game to load quicker I will throw it on a SSD drive provided I have space.  When he said it would not make a difference I chalked up the time spent watching this video to wasted moments of my life and an example of how I have poor time management skills (as I kept it going).  I think its great they posted this after what they were trying to achieve fell apart.  I will always build a computer ,  but people who do not have time or know how to can get a better computer than these guys built without having the hassle of putting it together and or/learn how to put it together ect.  In economics they call it opportunity cost -  for the person who likes to play games but is not into computer builds, picking this up at WalMart and plugging it in is worth quite a bit of potential-productive time that the person could have rather than spend the time building the machine that is slower and uglier.  There is a flaw in this example however, as the person will likely use that extra time (opportunity cost building the computer would have presented) to play games on it while getting drunk and ordering pizza.  I agree with the point you are trying to make -  I hate all-in-one packages (like Bose car stereos and factory car audio) - I have always found that the best components bring out a superior product quality-wise  - however you failed to make your point and are helping to serve the cause of dumbing people down -  The people who cant change a tire or mow their own lawn now know they will get a superior product at Walmart. Thank you for bringing this to light and have a spectacular rest of 2019.  If you want to make up for this folly, I suggest doing a video on what a top end build would likely look like 10 or 20 years from now -  That would be very interesting -  No one on You Tube has done this yet.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@o.w.i.m,"I would like to see the spec sheet for that^^ Walmart OP lash-up.  If this youtube vid ain't some kind of joke that is!?  Do Walmart actually sell those? and for 1400-1500usd you say??? Are PC components in the US way more expensive then in the rest of the world or something??   I just did a quick check for a ready built so called Gaming PC here in Sweden, first one I found under 1500usd went for 1287.36usd (currency convert today) which was the second cheapest build. Below that in price was one for 1007.48usd, thing is both of those come with a proper motherboard(ASUS PRIME B450-PLUS) with 4 RAM slots(part price 117.5usd) as opposed to whatever the thing in that oh so OP Walmart joke came with.   There is probably some nifty saying that fits for the travesty shown in this vid.  All I know is that you should never skimp on the foundations. In the case of a PC the foundations are the Motherboard and Power Supply Unit, oh and as Linus said one doesn't run any PC(gaming or otherwise) on a single RAM stick. That's why if you look at most any ""ready built"" gaming PC's spec sheet you will see that it comes with either TWO 4GB, 8GB or 16GB RAM sticks. A total of 16GB RAM being considered optimum/enough for games nowadays and 32Gb being what the enthusiast settles for. Things may change in a mystical future but that's the current thing..  If you don't know much of anything about PC hardware are strapped for cash and decide a ready built PC for 1000-1500usd is the way to go, well then doing some research will probably save you some short to long term grief and future dollars down the drain. Imagine having to remove and replace the foundations of your house by yourself after having removed everything above said foundations without damaging/screwing things up then replacing things on said new foundation. Yeah not fun, the description is somewhat macro but yeah you would probably have to outsource that work and the foundations would cost. My guesstimate.. Equated to above PC(vid) It would probably set you back 240-260usd MB,PSU and rebuild. Along with all the back and fourth, it'd take a week or more to be done..  Don't be played for the fool.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

,"4 partitions is beyond needed and very annoying because now you have to download a linux bootcd partition editor to fix the partitions.   But a thing I did long time ago on my WinXP machines was to create 1 partition for the OS and make sure to have plenty of space for all the games. And then another partition for your photos and documents and music. This technique increased file access speed for games like GTA or whatever and the OS responded to things faster. But in today's technology, I don't see much of a point to do this since everything is already fast. Even on my Windows 7 laptop,  just 1 partition. There is really no point to partition it unless you dual boot windows and linux and would like to keep photos and docs in a sharable partition.

@dfgh164,"Just so you know, Walmart has a very particular way of dealing with its suppliers. They decided what they want in very precise detail and how much they'll pay, then tell the OEM/supplier and it's up to them to figure out how to squeeze a profit out of that. The only saving grace is that Walmart orders in such large quantities that you make lots of money on volume. That is if you're willing to cut costs anywhere you can. It's why so many of their suppliers move to China for manufacturing. So why pay for a full sized ATX board when a mini will work. Why pay for a current gen case with USB 3.0 ports when you can use an older ""close out"" one and just put a 3.1 port in the back? As for the unplugged video card? The OEM is most likely saving on QA at the assembly site and are pushing for really low build times to again increase the profit margin. So more marginal builds slip through. If the system was really undercutting all the other competitors on price it might be worth getting one and just fixing it's faults. But it isn't, so there's many better bangs for the buck out there. IMHO, its a system built to have lots of bling and great paper specs, but really isn't anything special.",6년 전,0,

@SubstanceD91," @Glasses5x  Should be obvious but, an OS partition so you only have to reinstall the OS when the system goes down, and a recovery partition that you can use as the install media. You can include all the necessary drivers and programs you need in the recovery partition as well as have a more recent windows edition vs using the retail disc. You could accomplish the same thing with a flash drive but I find the recovery partition to just be more convenient.",6년 전,0,

@QuietWind01,"It wouldn't have anything to do with the cable(s). That's almost never an issue as long as the cable is not damaged physically. Really the only way you could damage a cable that bad would be if you had an animal that chewed on it or you tried cutting it or if it was damaged by something else. The issue is most definitely internally in the computer itself. It could actually be many different things... your graphics card (unless you only have integrated graphics), your power supply, your motherboard, or something else. The only issue with it being a CPU/processor or RAM issue and it NOT being your motherboard is that your motherboard should still power on and give some sort of signal, most likely an error. But if it's not giving out any signal whatsoever, that suggests that it's a power supply issue, GPU issue, or motherboard issue. Because if one of these fails, you're probably not going to get a signal. There's a few things I could run over with you to try and assist you, if you would like to email me at calebhesse42@gmail.com.

@zoltan1953,"I hate the ""RGB is for gamers"" mentality.  If I want a trippy light show, I'd take some DMT and go to a rave.  When I'm using my PC, for gaming or otherwise, I don't give a damn what kind of colors it's flashing.  In fact I find it somewhat distracting, which is a no go if I want to immerse myself into whatever I'm watching or playing.  So walmart went the cheap route with important hardware so that they could put money into a useless feature.  The only thing ""overpowered"" about that PC is the stench of garbage emanating from it.  If you're looking to buy a PC as a gift for someone but you don't really know anything about computers, PLEASE stay away from these computers.  They're ripping you off and taking advantage of the fact that you don't know what they're trying to sell you.  And this isn't about the quality of the PC that you're buying for your friend or loved one, it's about the money that you're spending weighed against the value that you're receiving.  I spent right around $650 (USD) on parts for a PC that I built myself, and it will perform on par with this walmart piece of trash.  Any shortcomings that it may have, I could easily upgrade for $100 or $200.  You'll spend the same amount of money upgrading just the hardware where they shouldn't have cut corners in the first place, but you're already $1400 in the hole right out of the box.  I'm not saying that you should build your own PC, I understand that not everyone wants to.  I'm saying that if I can build a PC for ~$650 that will keep up with the Overpowered PC for the most part, then you should have no problem at all finding another prebuild with the same pricetag as an Overpowered that has greater value for the money spent.",6년 전,0,

I like to have a partition for each OS, one for each type of Swap, a user storage, and in case of windows/Linux installs a universal partition that both can communicate with. As for the system it is a bit overpriced I think even though Walyworld uses the lowest bidders for it products.",6년 전,8,

@tabletopbattlezone5711,"I am getting the runaround right now. I bought one for my son with a Christmas sale and feel like I got a really good price for what I got. Happy with the computer and looking forward to being able to upgrade it in the months to come. However several times an hour it randomly turns off all USB devices in the monitors For 2 to 3 seconds each time. I cannot for the life of me figure out what the problem is or how to fix it and Walmart will not replace it since I’ve got the Black Friday price and had a discount on it. They will except a return and give me back my money, but that leaves me about $600 short to rebuy the same computer.",6년 전,0,

@KCOWMOO,I always use multiple partitions that way I can just re flash image of the winOS without losing anything and having to reinstall any software. Lately I been running a custom PE build of windows that loads in a virtual ram drive so now all windows files are in the memory instead of the hard drive so if decide to run strange exe or viruses that destroy the windows OS all I have to do is reboot and everything back to the way it was before I installed all that wonderful fun malware viruses. Almost 100% virus proof as long as it doesn't attack any firmware can even run windows completely in the ram with no hard drives attached or mounted and it makes super windows fast with no hard drive light because it completely inside the RAM.,6년 전(수정됨),1,
@JamesMcCarty,"An even better idea that I have been doing since the early 90s was multiple drives. OS gets its own drive with maybe some standard apps like Office and apps that run hardware functions. Games and other 3rd party apps get another drive. When drives became more affordable, a third Raid 0 drive(s) was used for data and mostly images and videos.  Partitions are fine, but when switching drives easily when one died or became corrupted, at least until fairly recently, it was far easier to just pop in a new drive.  PITA to install Windows (pre 7) on a partition without f-ing up other partitions on the drive. I'm talking fresh install, not fix.",6년 전,1,

Motherboard on one, and unresponsive keyboard another. Desktop Dell’s I’ve also had to replug or plug tighter components. Now I admit I distrust all PCs from Walmart, they sell the ones that failed performance expectations so company marks it as slower version and sells it to them. BUT a test review like you are doing you are already skewing results but starting out negatively. You don’t compare until you’ve run machine through its paces as is and actually played what system came with then install a real game yourself. Not these “test” programs. BUT then again because it did not work out of box it became an instant warranty issue so then it should have failed, by continuing you voided warranty and this just becomes entertainment. - From the beginning you tainted the scientific method. - I saw this just to point out the big difference between entertainment as you are doing and a true review.",6년 전,0,

@snownoheakennedy9561," @InfiniteQuest86   IDK where the hell your getting your parts,because I can go up to my local Fry's electronics and get a GTX 1080 for less then market price. I can get top of the line parts for 50% less then other retailers. I can pick up RAM, a 6TB solid state, a MSI motherboard, GTX 1080, I7 core and CX series PS for around 350-400.  I can also get cases there for like 20 USD. As apposed to spending 1,769.00 USD plus TAX on the lowest Overpowered PC pre-built or a cyberPower PC which is 800 USD starting price. right there I've saved 400-1,000 USD already. Just because I know where to shop for parts.  Sure I could buy the parts brand new and spend 600-1,000 USD or I could go to places like Fry's, Samual's PC parts, or Retro PCs and buy the exact same parts for less.  Shopping for PC parts is alot like shopping for warhammer. Sure I can buy the unit brand new, or I could over to my buddy, who's got that exact unit and give him 15 bucks for it, or even trade a unit for the unit I want.  So yes I'd say building your own PC is far cheaper then buying pre-built. IF keyword IF your smart about it.",6년 전,0,
@InfiniteQuest86," @snownoheakennedy9561  I think what you're saying is if you buy used. I don't think by anyone's definition that means you can buy it cheaper. As you pointed out, buying new part-for-part is more expensive than just buying a pre-built. Go to ebay and compare the prices to amazon for a Ryzen 3 2200G. The used parts are more expensive than new?! Crazy!?",6년 전,0,
@snownoheakennedy9561," @InfiniteQuest86   well Fry's sells both new and used parts. Same with Retro PC. At Fry's a new in the box GTX 1080 is about 80 to 100 USD as apposed to the 1,000-1,800 anywhere else. it's $5.24 more at Retro.  I can get a new in the box CX750m at Fry's for 39.99 as apposed to the 79.99 that most retailers price it at. You can get these even cheaper used. We're talking 20 bucks kind of cheap. A new in the box MSI mother board at Fry's is anywhere from  40-70 USD. Where newegg charges 87.35 and Best But will charge you 150 plus tax. Retro PC sell MSI MBs for 30-60 USD. That's also new in the box.  I7 core at best buy is 309.99 plus tax.  Newegg charges you 320.99 for the same product. However at Fry's I can get the same I7-8700 for less then a 100 USD new in the box. I can get it used at Fry's for 25-30 USD depending on the condition. RAM usually cost an average of about 120 USD. I can get the same RAM at Fry's for 25 USD on average.  That's just straight up brand new from the warehouse.  If I wanted to buy all these parts used from Fry's I'm getting them so cheap it's practically illegal.    I can also buy these parts Pre-owned but never used or trade them with friends and family or the community.   So it really is just about where you shop and look for PC parts. You don't have to buy from Newegg or Best Buy. I don't because they mark everything up by 45-50%. I sure as hell don't buy from Ebay or Amazon. That's a 70% mark up right there.  It's all about being smart and knowing where to look for good deals on parts. Same with guns and cars. I've never gone over 5,000 USD when building a PC. I've never gone over the $500 mark when building ARs. Cars.....well that's a different story. If I find a good reliable and relatively cheap  auto-parts store I'll let you know.",6년 전,0,

What I do know is that Walmart has made a long career out of strong-arming manufacturers (like Dell for ex.) into manufacturing custom feature-poor versions of their most popular products but with the same model number as the original popular product. This allows Walmart to sell what you think is the same product for 25% less than the competition with either of two results. Either you buy it from Walmart and walmart get the profit OR you buy it at another manufacturer and get them to price match so Walmart can drive its competition into bankruptcy.",6년 전,0,

@trevorallen3212,A budget gamer like me. I actually had a good deal with my pc for 2 or 3 years at $500 from Walmart. I then upgraded my pc with new $75 power supply 500 to 750 wats and then change my graphics card to plugin geforece gtx 1070 msi. I saved about $75 or $100 from not buying a prebuilt pc that's worth over $1000. I am lucky guy that found good prebuilt mother board and ram. Amd 8 core cpu and 16gb ram.  She can run ark survival evolve and rust with over 60 to 30 fps on average just fine. The only problem I had at the prebuilt at first was to deal with performance on my graphics card that is worth like $25  that can barely run ark without turning down its resolution and graphics combine but it still playable. I kind of glad I bought it to save money if you're the one on the budget this is perfect to save money. The only issue I have for gaming is the ethernet speed for certain games 10mbs min or more is what I want. I need to find a adapter to boost my signal or something.,6년 전,0,

@-GameHacKeR-,Linus are you taking the piss!  Competitive prices for the specs.  1. The hardware they offer is overpriced where ever you look.  2. The hardware is overpriced coming from walmart themselves.  It'd be better if they offered full AMD machines at a fair price  If your actually looking to build a highend pc for $1500 you could get something way more powerful if you went all AMD instead of intel & nvidia.  A full system built with all AMD components and all of your $1500 would beat a intel & nvidia machine that cost your $1500.,6년 전(수정됨),0,

@C4-1996,"I hate to say it, but they actually did a horrible job with it. Linus wasn't the only one who had the issue of an unplugged graphics card, and the plug clips in, it wouldn't have came unplugged during shipping. Other youtubers including Gamers Nexus had the issue, and the hot glued USB 3 header. The single ram stick is also an issue... sure it plays your games just fine, but could be doing it a lot better with 2 8gb sticks instead. The issue with using uncommon brands of power supplies is they may not be good, or go bad in less than a year and fry your $1400 PC, that's why reviewers make a big deal out of that despite Great Wall making power supplies for other well known OEMs. Sure, big time gaming PC guys nit pick the USB 2 ports, but it's a gaming pc, unless you're transferring big videos, there's no need for USB 3 just for a keyboard and mouse, and you can always get a USB 3 hub and a USB type C to USB type A adapter, but other than that, they're not essential for gaming and may not be used all that much by most people. There is one nit pick that I really agree with though, and that's the lack of air filter, and as Gamers Nexus points out, the lack of air flow because of the poorly designed case. Not only is that case restricting the airflow needed to cool the machine, but dust will build up and make it worse if not cleaned. The machine could burn itself out before a faulty power supply fries it. Gamers Nexus ran thermal test on the case with his testing rig. There's a big difference with that front glass removed. To make matters worse, what soccer mom would know better when they buy this for their kid? Gamers Nexus points all this out in his review and thermal test videos, and you can also search for ReviewTechUSA's video also. As a side note, I don't really nit pick on cable management, as my machines are a little messy themselves, just as long as it doesn't impede airflow.",6년 전(수정됨),4,

@KurNorock,Who cares if somebody gets offended?,6년 전,0,
@azurblueknights," @alonofisrael4802  The issue I took with him bashing on the usb 3.0 ports is that a vast majority of your computer accessories (mouse and keyboard, hello?) don't usually use USB 3.0! And its not that big of a deal if they don't. 3.0 was manufactured for devices that have really high bandwidth needs. A mouse and keyboard will almost never come close to maxing out a 2.0's bandwidth limit. The only benefit having 3.0 ports would be the rig no longer having to ""poll"" the device, which means absolutely no latency at all, but its not something the vast majority of gamers will ever notice. That tiny 3.0 in the back was more than likely just put there for people who have high tech smart phones.  However, what did eventually turn me away from this particular rig is the cheap PSU, Motherboard, and only a single stick of RAM. Couple that with a fairly low possibility of upgrading parts in the future means that I'll simply be better off just building my own.",6년 전(수정됨),3,

And  they aren't competing are they? If it was $1200 and not $1400 then fair enough...or even $1500 with a decent monitor... cos that's a big price difference. Even if it was a loss leader ...  That doesn't make your purchase bad in any way. I think its a fairish price for a halfway decent rig. Any foibles there you can sort really easily.  But if Walmart really want to enter the consumer PC market...well this was a valiant first attempt but ummm... ""Must try harder C+""  And to be honest that's as good as I'd give it.   Then again....I don't own one. I just think its a little pricey given their ability to buy cheaply. They didn't buy like 100 of these or even 1,000.... They likely buy them at 50,000 units a shot.  HP on the other hand make theirs but the HP machine wasn't bought from HP.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@azurblueknights," @kevinc9065  Oh, I agree. The fact that they slapped in a cheap motherboard and then couldn't even add a second stick of RAM into its slot tells me they were already close to breaking budget before they even considered the motherboard and RAM. 16 gigs of RAM is nice, sure, but having a single stick is just too much stress for that stick to handle regardless of how highly rated that stick is. Two 8 gigs would have gotten the same results as the single 16, but without the slight variances between games. While I dont own one and cant test myself, I imagine that the variances discussed between the two rigs would be a lot less pronounced if it wasnt a single stick of RAM doing all the work.  Honestly, for the same price, you'd be better off going to a place like Digital Storm if you want a prebuilt rig.",6년 전,0,

I mean I see gaming pc as being synonymous with multi-media and workstation. But this is clearly just ""gaming gaming""...with no intention of being anything otherwise. I'm not sure if we should rip on it for being that way, but I can't help but feel those who are getting one are being jipped on the actual practical uses of having a powerful pc..or any pc. AIn't that kind of a waste to end up with something that expensive just for gaming and nothing else? I just don't think it's right to give a premade like this, even at the relatively fair price. But ya...people have a point this is pretty fair considering the other horrible deals out there. So if the video was comparing this vs where you could do worse....this one would get alot more credit. Also don't be so mean, it's hard to learn all the know how of pc building from scratch. You need access to the materials first and foremost, and you need the proper knowledge laid out infront of you as well....both these things can be very difficult even in the modern era.

@jeffodell8912,well they’re buying the parts in bulk to make all these PCs to mass produce and sell so they’re definitely getting the parts cheaper than what you could get online to what degree cheaper I don’t know but they’re definitely making more than 60$ per assembly. Just wanted to make sure that wasn’t missed for anyone who might be curious.,6년 전,0,
@dy_dx0,"Custom built computer is always what I recommend. You get to pick individual parts for better performances and prices. Store bought pre-built computer is always garbage because they always try to put cheap crap as a lot of the components, and then your computer die in like 2 years. Whereas custom built PC can last up to 10 years without a problem, and you can replace parts very easily because you use an expandable motherboard.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@Wupazz," @Sploshification  he was commenting on the cheap cutbacks of the PC, the non-powder back of the power supply was a obvious needless cutback on cost, as well as the strange 3 2.0 USB ports on the front and the VGA port on the back. The motherboard was extremely cheap, and it all seemed to be money that was routed to make the PC look cool. The guide was a compliment to walmart, and its not a crime to think that a global conglomerate like walmart would put alot of detail in the quick start, but they did, and Linus was impressed by it. The set up of the PC was made to work well, but not for long. Not to mention other small cutbacks on cost, like the fact that the fans had no filter and the computer would need constant cleaning to prevent it looking like a dust trap, and they used only 1 RAM stick in a premade PC which, as Linus explains, effectively doubles your bandwidth, and is allegedly the issue with the CPU under performing. It makes the point that the computer has very decent equipment, but is riddles with things that force it to under perform, and that's where the core issue is.",6년 전,13,
@Sploshification," @Wupazz  I'm aware of what he was doing. The motherboard was exactly what he ordered -- it supported all of the components attached. Again, suck him off all you want, but he was clearly discriminating against it. Obviously, a prebuilt machine isn't going to be exactly to YOUR specifications, because it's built by THEM. I would much rather my PC come with single channel and be open to upgrading in the future. The things he's nitpicking on are ridiculous. A cable wasn't plugged in, the power supply wasn't powdercoated, and ragging on a processor that works but ""may not work for you""  -- that could literally be said about any processor from any manufacturer. This was a poorly put together, blatantly obvious, hit piece. He is joining the mob without giving this device it's fair shake. This guy sees the slightest thing and acts like the world is ending.

@Sploshification," @The_Cult_Nextdoor  Agreed. He knocked on it before even opening the box. Of course, a custom built machine gives you everything to YOUR liking -- that's with anything. This thing delivered and performed identically or better than it's $100 more expensive counterpart, and Linus has the balls to bitch about powdercoated GPU's and one unplugged cable?

I don't create them, but I have an old hard drive that had partitions and I used one of them strictly for my video games so I knew where they all were.

I been building pcs for 22 years and its worst i have ever seen.  when building a gaming rig you always dumb most of your budget on motherboard you don't skimp on quality as CPU prices come down you want to be able to put in that $1500 cpu you couldnt afford when it was new but used years later for $80 is a real bargain same goes for ram etc.. if they come out with a new standard for video card slots you want to make sure your motherboard uses the new design so that 2 years down the road the new video vards will work on your machine .. the fact the pc would be shit is a given.,6년 전,1,

@RobinHoodNCR,"Frankie Nelson The thing about the cable not being plugged is that someone buying this type of PC might not even know where to plug it. Realize that buyers of that don't know shit about computers. They will never open it, so not having dust filters and the gpu cables not being plugged in is a big deal. They will also never upgrade it and could not even if they wanted with that cheap ass motherboard, so having only one ram stick also does not make sens. Try to see it objectively and analyze the type of customer who are likely to buy this machine.",6년 전,2,
@koyrts6767,"The problem here is that there were too many setbacks for him to recommend this PC. While we have discovered that GreatWall makes power supplies for brands like Cooler Master, it doesn't mean they are great as well. If the parts in the PC were not as power hungry I wouldn't have a problem using this PSU but in this case it is a bit sketchy, also not having USB 3.0 on the front is just stupid in 2018 as pretty much every device nowadays takes advantage of USB 3.0. In addition while the motherboard did fit all of the components,it was still a cheap motherboard meaning that the VRMs and power delivery may be sketchy and probably have a higher chance of failing. It's no wonder that not only Linus but pretty much all Tech YouTubers who took a look on the Walmart PC were disappointed and wouldn't recommend it. I don't think he is being unreasonable. Today building a PC with quality components is extremely easy and no that expensive even for a pre-build so they had no reason to cheap out on those parts when every other manufacturer uses quality parts from well known brands.",6년 전,0,

People that buy these systems don't know how to fix that (even though it's super easy), and maybe it's just bad luck but I've seen two reviews where it's not plugged in. What he said about the CPU is true, the way it's configured means some will perform great and others will be an unstable mess. Just a disclaimer that your milage may very.

@blurrybiscuit1431,"You obviously are oblivious as to why he brought those points up. The fact that they were willing to pinch a couple of pennies by not coating the PSU is a bad sign. The fact that the onboard display options were limited to a singular VGA port means the manufactures were, once again, willing to cut corners to save a few pennies. This is never a good sign. Not to mention its just purely outdated tech, graphics card included or not. The fact that they partitioned the hard drive with, seemingly, no reasoning or point behind it, shows whoever decided to do that had no idea what they were doing. All of these points are signs that they used incompetent parts and/or parts. It's not hard to understand... Edit: reading your other replys further tells me you don't know too much about what you're talking about. Think about the people who are going to buy this PC. Do you really think the demographic in target here is one that will upgrade there PC and/or even know what to upgrade. The fact that they didn't include dual-channel ram is not good. Yes you CAN upgrade it but the people who are going to buy this are wanting something they can just plug in and play on.

@blurrybiscuit1431, @Sploshification  The outdated tech was a VGA port. I don't think you really know what we're even talking about lol. The cable coming unplugged is not a big deal (I never said it was so I don't know why you keep bringing that up). Cutting the HDMI (and other ports like DVI) just shows that they are willing to save money in ways that are completely unnecessary. If you know anything about PCs you know that you should never cheap out on a motherboard. Also why did they hot glue some of the plugs on the mobo? That in itself brings up an interesting question to quality and attention to detail.,6년 전,0,

@blurrybiscuit1431," @Sploshification  Wow you're thick... I don't know how to dumb this down for you any more. The fact that they are willing to cut the corners that they have cut, shows that they aren't using quality parts. The inexcusable fact that they put USB 2.0 ports in the front shows this as well. That is not good for the user by any means. When someone cuts corners like that, it MIGHT benefit the consumer in the beginning, however the longevity usually suffers. For someone who is looking to buy an all in one PC, they won't want to have to open up the PC to fix something in the future. Again, what's up with them hot gluing some of the wires to the mobo? It makes absolutely no sense. It just shows their lack of knowledge in this area. I actually find it funny that you have such a close minded opinion on this.

@Sploshification,BlurryBiscuit what’s wrong with cutting corners that have zero result on the end product other than allocating that money in other places?

@blurrybiscuit1431," @Sploshification  It most certainly has an end result. When parts have cut corners like that, they tend to not last as long. That is a massive downside.

@mikefranks4528,"Just my 2 cents, Linus is not the only one disparaging the WalMart ""GAMER"" PC. These conclusions means that there is something better out there versus this one. Remember, this is not your basic PC but a GAMER rig. So, I wouldn't say that he is nitpicking, he is criticizing on the basis of a gamer/geek not a regular user who games on a piece of old crap daily. I guess we have different demographics commenting on this - daily non-geeky users who know nothing about the basic A+ knowledge of PCs and the true geeks - hence the reason they listen to the geek on the tube and take his/her suggestions. Bottom line is anyone that is a respectable tech vlogger has put their FAILED stamp on the WalMart gear ""as a gamer rig"".  Now if you want an upgrade to your basic gear, then yes you can go ahead and purchase it since you're a basic user/casual gamer...though I KNOW you can put that same amount of money to a better rig. Aaaand, if you are a true gamer, I would listen to Linus and the other respectable vlogger geeks on this one. Don't buy it. Check out gamer enthusiast PC builders like CyberPowerPC. (where I usually get my cool gear THAT LASTS and performs - not paying me I'm just a fan). Also, check out digitalstorm.com. These PC enthusiasts will assure you're getting a good deal. You can get a much better system with the same or lesser price. If you buy the WalMart system you're basically throwing away $$$ due to the corners they cut.   Also, check out this review.

This thing is neither built nor marketed toward your enthusiast.

I'd venture a guess that it is assembled to a much higher degree of quality than Random Joe PC Gamer Sans PC Building Experience could achieve on their own buying individual parts (which likely would not work together - like mismatching RAM to the Mainboard).  The system could be easily tinkered with by the above-describe demographic.  More-so if the consumer has some tech-savvy friends.  Not sure I understand why you were complaining about it throughout the video.  You seem to be under the impression that this is marketed toward you or others that would otherwise build their own.  It's not.  Stop applying that logic to the system and review it as it is intended.  Once you do that, it's a pretty good buy IMO.

@l337pwnage,"Is there any particular reason why Linus is using a jab saw???? Personally, I might buy it, toss the guts, and build something better in the case.  ;)  I think it's a nice looking case. For all the whining all the reviewers do, it seems like they don't find a whole lot to really complain about.  The the only major thing I see is the lack of 3.0 ports on the front, but, in my instance, for example, I wouldn't miss them.  As it is the case I'm using for the PC I'm typing on has two 3.0 ports on front, but no 2.0 ports and I have problems were some of my older devices don't work on 3.0 ports so I have a 2.0 port hub plugged into the back that I use instead.

But at this point in time, the margins have shrunk to the $50-100 range, and there are quite a few risky things you can still screw up. If I am going to spend $1500 on a PC parts, an extra $50 for assembly, where they consume the risks inherent in installation (like breaking a processor pin trying to mount it) is nothing.",6년 전,0,

People that want to use hateful words towards me are entitled to say whatever they want in a free country, but I am also free to walk away from them and pay them no mind. If you notice, people like that tend to get a lot angrier and frustrated when they dont get the response and attention they are looking for. Which is why it is doubly good to ignore hateful words.

Some shops have a configurator app on their website, https://www.alternate.co.uk/PC/PC-Configurator#!/category/0 I don't know if they got shops outside Europe, thats for you to discover. But this is just an example, there are many more shops with part pickers. Those make it easy to select components, for example you pick an AM4 motherboard, then the system won't let you select an Intel CPU. Then you can't fail.

So, my advice is if you are going to buy prebuilt, then buying literally anything else already available on the market is better than what Walmart is offering. As other have said though.

@ACIDBURN6661,Be weary with those front glass cases. Like Linus said it doesn't have dust traps and also the glass restricts the air flow for the front fans.

There are many Pc noobs I can see buying one of these, and if its a common issue, that means they will get as lot of returns over that one poor build flaw.

,"PC Magazine reviewed the DTW3 (the high end model), unlike Gamers Nexus which TRIED to review that model but received a DTW1 by mistake. Oddly, it's both a better computer and harder to recommend, even at the $1700 discounted price.  It's better because it fixes many of the key mistakes in the configuration of the DTW1. It has an H370 motherboard, which is not top of the line but it will do. It has two USB 3.0 ports on the front panel (plus for some reason one USB 2.0 port rather than a third USB 3). And it has dual channel memory in the form of two 16GB memory sticks, with room for two more on the H370 motherboard.  But... at $1700 you have more options. And I question pairing an i7-8700 with a GTX 1080Ti. I'd rather go a bit higher on the CPU if I'm buying that GPU, like a 8700K or 9700K, and that would also require stepping up to an X370 or X390 motherboard.

The people who are serious about component specs, cable management, strong cooling, quiet operation, and a solid build are not going to shop at Walmart for quality anything let alone a Walmart branded gaming computer.  This is the same company that forces its suppliers and manufacturers to sell to them cheaper every year and most of it is produced in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen is the capital for all things electronics.  If most of the people who shop there cared about quality then they wouldn't shop there but they care about getting as much as they can for as little as they can and Walmart will gladly give them a shiny flashy looking computer that isn't quite right but still works like an old car with 300K miles on it but it runs and gets you to work.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@sireuchre," @FeministCatwoman  Partitioning is not completely pointless in a rotating media drive, if you use some tactics in configuration to go along with it. It is less useful now than it once was. If that system has, say, a 4gb rotating media hard drive, and you partition it into 4 nominally 1gb partitions, It will skip seeking over the other 3 partitions, reducing seek time. When HDs were mostly 5400rpm or slower, and the controller boards slow as hell, and caches on the drives were tiny, this tactic produced noticeable gains. An old trick was to install Windows on its own partition, then install all programs onto another partition, and store your bulk data on yet another partition. That made games perform MUCH faster. Modern rotating media drives are way faster, so the gains are far less.  Where it all falls down, of course, is that this system has an SSD that is presumably where you'll install both Windows and your games for maximum performance.",6년 전,5,

Just to be safe if win fails that happends perhaps once every 2years but you knewer know. better to be safe then sry. on the other discs i usely have 2 partition on em. but thats probly nothing you realy have to have. its just something i always have done from like win98 when sometging always failed you had backups on backups. and if you got a failure on a disc if you where lucky 1 of the partitions could still be working.",6년 전,1,

Systems should be shipped with 2 partitions - one for Windows, one for personal crap. The fact that Windows is still thinking that it's ok to put personal files on the same partition where the OS has been installed shows stupidity beyond imagination.

Personally, I would still build my own with proper component choices but that is at least a more acceptable price point for what it is.   Even then, if I was given one of these or heaven forbid, a family member gifted one for xmas, the first thing I would do is pull that PSU and RAM and replace them with a quality PSU and a 2x8gb DDR4 kit. That is the very minimum that should be done before actually using one of these systems.

@RyuuTenno,"Okay, I've seen how electronics come in from the warehouse, why in the world, would anybody want to get a Walmart PC? Like, buying a name brand PC from Walmart is already iffy (I'm on a Win10 HP 15 inch laptop, that I bought from there), but, even so, I'm not particularly trusting of how their electronics are really. And, no way will I ever buy a Walmart brand PC. Not happening. I'll stick with the name brands. Better quality, and, at least if it's cheap, I tend to know how cheap, and it's still put together correctly. It does however, have a really good look, and, ironically, about the only reason behind why I would ever get this one, would simply be to cannibalize it for part, cause, the RGB & the glass case look good. But, even so, I could just custom order those easily enough. No amount of discount would be enough for me to get one of these really.",6년 전,0,

From where? There is nothing special about the GPU that warrants leaving it unplugged during shipping. Besides, how the hell are the people buying this system supposed to know this is a thing?

@manut4963,"Hmm.. what's even more worrying is that this ""professional"" didn't even notice that this PC uses the absolutely cheapest and crappiest mainboard with the least performing chipset for this cpu. Which explains the single VGA port on the board itself and the lack of USB3.0-ports. A lousy Gigabyte H310M S2 at that...  and then not even the newer version of this crappy mainboard (H310 S2 2.0). That alone should sound a loud ""red alert"" regarding performance and sustainability. You also didn't look at which SSD they'd used (or the performance of that).  Sorry, Linus but you should have spotted that one!   In fact a case with only front USB2.0 ports isn't that much of a problem since a better mainboard (for example a GA-H370-HD3) would have gotten enough USB3.0-ports at the back (and in the case o/t H370-HD3 even USB3.1).  Anyway I wished you opened that HP omen alongside that Wallmart PC. To see what HP did wrong too. In my book, the best PC is the one that's been build by true enthusiasts not ""corporations"". In this particular case I would perhaps have gone for the GA-H370-HD3 and indeed the dual-channel memory, and toned down on the decal and/or RGB-lighting.",6년 전,0,

I really feel bad for parents, thinking they're making a good deal and just want to make their kids happy, just to get a total piece of shit system. Also, an ""unskilled"" person (parent / kid)would maybe never get the idea that the System wont start because of an unplugged power cable for the graphics card (even when it's said on the booting screen) and send it back, just to be really frustrated. These cable just dont magically unplug themselves during shipment, theyre locked with a pretty stable plastic lever. Without opening the lever you would destroy either the graphics card or the cable itself if you try to just rip it out, which you would have to do with a LOT of force. In every video I saw about the ""OP-Computer"" the cable was unplugged btw... Also i think the PSU would turn your ""PC"" into a bonfire after some time cause its such a low quality.

@Citebafla," Nob the Knave  I can guarantee you, you will be hard-pressed to find a single new PC/Laptop in 2018 that doesn't have USB 3.0 and this is especially a big issue if you ever want to connect an external hard drive on there for a backup, photo/video editing or anything. 3.0 saves soooo much time.",6년 전,3,

@wanderingwatcher3981," @guguigugu  Agreed. Although you could argue having at least one 2.0 port (somewhere in the back preferably) is a good thing for backwards compatibility. In teory, it shouldn´t be needed as usb 3.0 can emulate usb 2.0. In practice, it might not work. A common issue is that software emulation requires drivers, which can make installation problematic. Installing Windows 7 on a system with only usb 3.0 (from usb-stick) is a good example. Turns out windows 7 doesn´t include drivers for usb 3, so no keyboard during installation. It can be fixed by modifing the installation files, by it very complicated and a major headache, speaking from experience. :(  Backwards compatibility isn´t important for everyone ofc. But I prefer to play it safe. Someday I might feel like installing some Linux distribution using the first usb-stick I find laying around. And if I do, I would like it to work on the first try with minimal hassle.",6년 전,0,

@petermichaelgreen,OTOH most of the communication in a gaming PC doesn't touch the chipset nowadays. The memory and GPU (unless the motherboard vendor has been really stupid) go direct to the CPU.,6년 전,0,
,"They used an H310 motherboard. The bottom of the barrel for chipsets that supports current Intel processors. They should have stepped up to a B360, which would provide four RAM slots and an M.2 SSD socket. At least it's made by Gigabyte, a reputable manufacturer, as is the graphics card; Linus doesn't show that but other videos have.  Speaking of which... a 2018 gaming PC really should have an M.2 SSD, not a SATA drive. I'd accept the cheaper SATA in a general purpose PC, but a gaming system at this price point should have M.2. And yes, it should have had dual channel memory, though a pair of 8GB sticks might have cost a hair more than a single 16GB.  They gain a point for that USB-C port, and immediately lose it back for the poorly designed bracket that doesn't properly center the port. And just to pick on the motherboard again, if they had used a B360 they could have had a Gen2 USB-C port rather than Gen1.  Of course, if they had spent their money on better components (B360 motherboard, dual channel RAM, and M.2 SSD) they wouldn't have had it for the fancy RGB lighting. Style over substance.  Interestingly, the Gamers Nexus review system ALSO had a problem with the power connector for the GPU not being plugged in properly, though in that case it was loose (not clipped in) rather than being completely disconnected.",6년 전,2,

Will overclocking to a similar clock level and a clean boot (nothing running in the background) bring this Ryzen to the same single threaded score? Probably. I am about to see.  In relation to the Walmart machine ($1900CDN), that leaves me more than 1000 dollars to spend on the rest like a video card. As a photographer, I do not really need a high powered video card, so I bought a dirt cheep brand new GTX750Ti ($100.00 CDN tax in from a local Brick and Mortar). Yes, thats right, a 750Ti. That brought the price to still under 800 dollars CDN. With a new case , 120 evo, and 2tb spinning drive, I would still be under 1000 dollars, however, I already have those.  Obviously on synthetic graphics benchmarks my numbers are laughable, but as we all know, they in no way reflect actual real life gaming performance, which is stellar. I can easily run most games I play at max settings at 1080/60p. Even Flightgear runs into the high 40's, and that is got to be one of the biggest resource pigs I know of (love it though).  I AM eyeballing the RX 580/90... I'm sorta lusting a bit, but its hard to justify as anything other than an expensive toy based on my actual workflow needs (I enjoy games, but they are not what the computer is for). I absolutely refuse to pay the insane price of Nvidia's recent or current gen. They are all price bloated, but Nvidia just makes me go wow. No way will I ever spend that kind of money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two, especially as the price is based entirely on greed, and not actual production or development costs.  Anyway, off to overclock this puppy and see what the results are. :D pats the almost 1000 dollars saved",6년 전,0,

@dudeinco,"I bought a Cyberpower PC, because building yourself always ends up costing more, due to the Operating System (Windows).  I ended up having to replace the 1TB HDD right off the bat.  It was failing.  A few weeks later, it wouldn't boot at all.  I went through everything I could think of to get it to work.  Replaced ram, replaced motherboard (same board, no effect, returned), and ultimately replaced the CPU, which appeared to work, but had the same thing happen again, and can't remember what fixed it that time.  The short end of it is that when MSI - which I now have a really bad taste in my mouth for - updates their UEFI, it effs the system all to hell.  I'm not sure what happened, how I resolved, but it SUCKED.  Had I built this myself, I would have returned that MSI board IMMEDIATELY.  I got an MSI GTX1080 with this (as you can tell, this was purchased a while ago), and this thing does weird flipping chiz.  I was doing a broadcast training session, all my monitors cut out, and I had to reboot the system to get them to come up again (this has also happened once or twice during gaming).  The PC was on, you could hear the sound and everything, but all the monitors cut out.  You know what it's like when you're training someone, and you suddenly can't see what you're doing anymore???  Screw MSI.  I don't really know what to say here.  Do you blame CyberPower for this mess?  Do you blame MSI?  Is it all the above?  I ended up spending 50% MORE than I originally spent on the box, just trying to fix it.  I'm kind of feeling like ""Screw MSI"" and ""Screw CyberpowerPC.""  I should have built my own. I could have chosen my own case, and probably would have spent less, even with Windows, than I did on that POS.

@eyreland,"http://zetatalk.com/info/tinfo24u.htm http://zetatalk.com/lat-long.htm  Malaysia stands in the path of rushing water, which will drown even the mainland country of Thailand during the poleshift.  Several factors will create a rush of water over the Malaysian peninsula. When the crust of the Earth stops its slide and the plates begin to slam into each other, the Pacific will shorten and the India/Australia plate will subduct violently into the Himalayas. As this occurs, there will be a drop in sea level over India, the waters about India rushing in to fill the gap. Likewise, the Pacific will compress, so the sea level there is relatively higher, and as water seeks an even level this water will rush into the gap over the hapless and drowning India.   The Malaysian peninsula stands in the path of this rush, and once water begins to move, it creates it's own force, such that there is a press of water moving in the direction of India, and this pressure will be great enough to create tidal bore that will go up and over any mountains in it's path. Malaysia, and other countries in the path of this flood, will utterly drown. Malaysia is riding on the tongue of the Eurasian Plate and will suffer when plate movements occur prior to the pole shift. The Malaysia peninsula is lowland, and any reduction in sea level is devastating.",6년 전,0,

@geroldmanders9742,"4 is about right. One for the S (just the OS, no user related data, no temporary crap, etc). Second is for the programs and software you use. Again, any temporary needs of installed software is being re-directed). Third is for the personal data of the user account. It takes tweaking Windows to do this properly. Last, but not least partition is for the temporary files/folders that Windows, the installed software and user accounts generate/accumulate during use.   The Windows partition won't get ""disturbed"" much by inherent files being copied/moved/erased/created. So after a while the content in that partition will be optimally placed on that partition. Keeps the need for defragging really low and if it does occur, it is done very fast. Similar thing for the partition with programs/games. Even the personal data partition is not changing that much with most people. Indexing content becomes faster and less intrusive this way too.   A setup like the one above is useful when the computer only has spinning platter hard disk(s) inside. Add SSD or better drives and this is much less of an issue of course.  Another advantage from this setup is only valid for single user PCs, but by keeping this discipline up, is that making backups (non-cloud) is a more clear task.  Also, if you need to change the version of Windows quickly, without barely spending any time re-installing/re-configuring the software you need, that just became very easy too. You can now swap between OS'es in an hour or so. Don't really need restore point functionality anymore either.  VM's? Sure, run one or more of them at once, assign to each the partitions with programs and personal data and you work in these VM's just like on a standard computer, but you save big time in storage. Practically all the advantages of both VM's and Docker or Docker-like systems combined.   Partitioning is your friend if you do it well and keep up the discipline. Anyone who says differently, has not thought enough about the matter.",6년 전,0,
@maximepayne9997, @geroldmanders9742  Do you REALLY think that anyone who buys a Walmart PC is ever going to do that? All it does is make it more difficult for the average user to make full use of his drives.,6년 전,0,
@ronnetgrazer362," @geroldmanders9742   Gerold Manders  I pretty much agree with all of that, it's what I used to do back in the day, even though I never actually made use of the functionality this provided in terms of re-installing. And yes, it's still relevant for the unlucky few who don't use SSDs, many of whom are still using windows. To be able to say if the geniuses at Walmart had exactly this in mind, we'd need to know wether they configured Windows the way you described, and the size of these partitions. If they're all of equal size, that would mean a lot of temp/swap space going to waste, for instance. Sizing them in just the right way in advance is pretty tricky to me, I've run into trouble with that more than once. This approach is definitely not something I'd expect a buyer over Overpowered machines to be able to appreciate.  Windows tendency to keep growing its installed size due to the ability to revert updates caused me to abandon this methodology altogether, and resizing partitions is a far from trivial task in terms of corruption risk. It's still a bit unnerving to me on ext4.  I'm planning to pool together currently scattered HDDs of roughly equal size with ZFS, one to use as a data store and a second one as a nightly differencing backup.

@jupet4736,Those system also come with window 10 ( thats 150 $ CAD). It's not bad really. Sure the motherboard is entry level and they should at least go with dual ram for performance. Like you said maybe they should cut a bit on the stupid RGB and invest into a better psu. i guess cool lightning sell more PC for them..  Most people only use the front USB for their mouse or headphone anyway. Unless you do a lot of video editing and you need to transfer a lot of data. Who care about 2 vs 3 ? I think there's a bit of ''snobbery'' with those PC. The cable management is fine and better than what 90 % of those kids can do .  You made a video about best buy prebuilt system back in 2016 and you were quite pleased with the result.

@Night-FuryDreamer," @ElectronicsForFun  That is correct, but I am talking in a general sense. If you buy cheap, you will get cheaper parts or just weaker parts. Pay your workers cheap they would probably not put the thing together as they should have. Pay for cheap parts, then you likely will get parts that have less durability or a shorter lifespan overall.   And this one is more of a personal opinion, but I prefer building from scratch, that way you know for sure that everything is as it should be (as long as you have the knowledge for it) and that the cooling will be enough for overclocking if you wanted to do so, not to mention a bit more headroom for the PSU.  The point is, you pay for cheaper, you run the risk of getting a cheaply built product, or just simply cheaply made parts. :(",6년 전,1,

@vamuse172000,"I get that its a prebuilt with ketchup/mustard cables but there is wayyyyy too much bias here.

Linus acted looked for every excuse in the fucking book to hate this computer and the best he could come up with was only usb 2.0 on the front, no dust filtration, and no expandable memory slots? Big damn deal. You act like it caught in fire when you stress tested it to max load. Until you can build an identically priced computer with the cost of Windows included, a WARRANTY, and also get similar stress specs, might want to stfu. Not everyone is into delidding for a net of -3 degrees and min/maxing system capabilities of other sorts. I build my own rigs, but I enjoy doing so, something of which might stress someone out intensely. Moral of the story is, if you have $1400 bucks to drop on a computer that will run any game pretty smoothly and arent comfortable building your own, go for it.

When you buy a flash drive (""in this day and age"") then it's either USB3 capable or old stock. For external video adapters using USB3 it makes more sense to be connected at the back, which is why you'd expect some A and/or C type connectors on the motherboard as well.

@Miss_Loving,"Dear friend, we can forgive others as Father God, through Jesus Christ, forgives us. God doesn't simply forgive when we repent; He removes our sin completely. Scripture is full of commands for us to love each other and overlook faults. We are reminded that love “keeps no record of wrongs” (1 Cor. 13 : 5) and that we should be ready to forgive one another “just as in Christ God forgave you” (Eph. 4 : 32).           I am deeply grateful that God turns off the scoreboard when I fail. Again He doesn’t simply forgive when we repent; He removes our sin as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103 : 12). That is AMAZING!! With God, forgiveness means that our sin is out of sight and out of mind. Start living a life of pure forgiveness of others, as our Lord so graciously forgives by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be sealed in salvation, and your life will be forever changed!       Please find joy in praying the following prayer with me...Dear Lord Jesus, thank You for not holding my sins against me and for granting me a second chance. Help me today to forgive others just as You have so freely forgiven me. Please give me grace to extend forgiveness to those around around me. This I pray and give thanks in Your Mighty Mighty name, Amen!       May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️",6년 전,1,

@alecday3775,I think another thing could be is the thermals as well. I mean the front fans looked pretty much choked off and there was no top intake either. Steve did a really good video on how hot the case was and it was the hottest case he had ever tested so there could have been some thermal throttling going on as well. I mean the Omen PC has better cooling than the Wal-Mart PC and looks like it uses a better PSU than the Wal-Mart PC. I mean the Great Wall unit looks like it could go up in smoke maybe 3-4 years if the owner is lucky and that is me being generous. THAT is THE ONE THING no-one should EVER skimp on. It could go up in smoke and probably take his CPU and motherboard with it and then he would be out an entire system and that is really scummy that Wal-Mart would cheap out on the most important part of the PC. The gaming PCs from Wal-Mart seem like a really good deal on the surface but not so much when you start digging down to the gross underbelly.,6년 전,0,

On a system in this price range I would expect at least a boot SSD in this day and age as well as front USB 3 ports.  It is not like an internal card reader featuring USB 3 is particularly expensive, even budget machines have these features.  I initially suspected that too much of the budget was put towards the case and RGB.  While I like the look of the case itself, I would much rather be in a position of wanting to upgrade from a $20 case than a $30 motherboard being run by a $20 PSU with a $370 CPU and $300 graphics card.  Going by the fact that Newegg lists cases very similar to this one in the region of £40 that should not even be a factor here.

@MrBrendyn0,"Simon WoodburyForget gonna reply to two of your comments, first this one. What does it take to judge the kits? Experience. Ofc but they exist for people who may be above average but not know all about computers. Since a professional designs the kits, you get a curated kit which then requires you to acquirer  (typically) a keyboard, mouse, monitor, and or screen and most bare bones kit will tell you “Don’t forget x and y” and by having bought the kit you just reduced research requirement which btw you mentioned a week so forget your 25h argument so that you can have a stronger argument. Additionally kits DO exist for cars as well for those willing  and able. Your point is not everyone can do it. And if they can it will take time. Sure.  Let make a senario. You want a sandwich, with lettuce, tomato, and bacon.  I make you a sandwich and forget to put the bacon on so I throw it on the side and then I give 3 day old lettuce and 3 day old bread. I sell it to you at a comparable price to a professionally made BLT.  You are okay with that right? It was 10c less!  Even if someone where to just buy a computer all some people are trying to say there are better products whether pre-built or custom/self built.  Also not everyone who is non-technical will as a tech person so don’t assume that for everyone.   The same amount of research is required to ensure the pre-built is capable of doing what you want.  And not everyone is going to do the building themselves once they buy their components themselves.  So many scenarios instead of being so narrow let’s think outside the box.

@numberyellow," @SimonWoodburyForget    Irrelevant? the fucking power wasn't even plugged into the video card.. that's kinda important, as it caused the card to not function. so i guess functionality is irrelevant?   And then there's the low-quality PSU, which is almost guaranteed to take a shit within the first year of use, especially if you use it a lot, or leave the machine on continuously. Then there's the single-channel memory configuration, which WILL cause performance issues. The memory and SSD are from A-Data, which isn't a very well known, or terribly popular vendor, And that's for good reason. A-Data most likely jumped at the chance to supply walmart, even though they weren't going to turn as much of a profit.. aside from the gigabite mainborad, and GPU, and the Intel CPU, the rest of the parts are pretty much crap. the case is junk, and regardless of what you might personally believe, the absence of USB3 IS a big deal. There's a single type-c connector, on an expansion backplate, because that's obviously the most useful place to put it. So it has a single type-c port, on the back, where it's useless for ANYTHING...and because the mainboard only has one USB3 header, now we can't have USB3 on the front panel, where it might be a touch more useful.....so the user gets stuck with USB2, which is  awful because USB2 doesn't have very good data transfer speeds.   everything about this system is wrong. i mean, yes, the mainboard is a legit gigabyte board, and they don't make poor quality stuff....but the geniuses who came up with the system configs, decided they were going to get the cheapest, lowest-end gigabyte board they could find....which coincidentally has one of the worst chipsets currently available at retail, so that's gonna hamper performance...and i mentioned the single channel memory configuration will hamper perfomance even further, guaranteeing that this machine cannot live up to anywhere near it's full potential.

They don't provide completely stable power output, and they don't last as long as other units on the market. I have opened PSUs before..

Take HDDs for example...i really only use Seagate, or Western Digital for my rotational drives...because they both make a good product. When WD is having problems with quality control, i go Seagate, and when they're having QC issues, i go WD...if neither of them are having any QC issues, i'll buy whichever one has the best specs, for the best price.   My father is a software engineer, so i grew up around not only technology, but programming.....which means you can't bullshit me on that front either. while it is true, a high-end machine will perform better with well-optimized software, more ""horsepower"" will allow you to better run poorly optimized software. You don't seem to know much about this subject either..otherwise you'd get the fact that the GPUs entire job is to draw frames....it's processing time can't and won't ever go to anything else.. It's not necessarily the software that limits performance, and FPS...it is heavily dependent on the hardware, because the hardware has to be up to the task of providing at least the minimal functional requirements of the software....and then performance scales up linearly, as the hardware used increases in capability.  don't fucking patronize, or condescend to me...I'm not imitating anyone, and what i say is what i know to be true, based on years upon years of experience.",6년 전,0,

And not all cheap PSUs are created equally....any actual experienced I.T. repair tech is gonna know that.. some are shittier than others.

""The VAST majority (like 98%) of these systems will never suffer any catastrophic issue."" no offense but you totally pulled that figure out of your ass. l would say that 98% is for the computers that actually have a good quality power supply in them. walmart has only sold a few of these things and they are already taking them off the market for quality control issues so that must mean that they are the junk we all assumed they would be.   ""You act as though because Walmart made it the PC is guaranteed to melt down.

OTOH, (if the case can handle full ATX) I could see grabbing this, especially on sale, gaming on it for a year or two, upgrading the PSU, another year, MOBO and maybe CPU, another year, RAM, another year, GPU. Point being, you will have an adequate system with a seriously nice looking case for several years while you grab components when they get cheap and end up with a pretty killer product. And honestly, that should be the game plan for pretty much any computer at this level if you really want a great result really ever.   I seriously would happily buy just this case if it does full ATX.

@BeenADrill,"SSD does effect performance greatly because a lot of modern games make HEAVY use of levels of detail and loading on demand. So you're loading (and unloading) a bunch of stuff constantly (and with levels of detail loading even more crap you might never even see if it is obstructed somewhere in the distance) which makes the CPU do some extra work as well, but I imagine mostly it is wait time for the hard drive or SSD. Levels of Detail... Loading on Demand... LoD... LoD... Knock it off, developers. Let's say your base model is 200 triangles. Each tessellation of that object you load doubles the number of triangles. (This is true, but it doesn't necessarily mean that each level of detail is a complete tessellation. The devs might've manually retopologized each LoD for better optimization. I'm just using this as an example.) So, 2 levels of detail would make 200 triangles plus 400 triangles for 600 triangles total loaded to memory, then loaded to graphics memory. For a third level of detail, double the 400 to 800 and add it to the 600 you already had for 1400 total. And so on. There's more to it than that, though. Each triangle is 3 vertices. Each vertex has 3 pieces of data, one for x, y, and z. Don't know what size. 64 bit float? shrug And then you have animated objects that might have a bunch of armatures like trees and leafy vegetation. Each bone of the armature has its own pair of vertices as well as a bunch of weight numbers for each vertex bound to the bone. And then there's textures, which generally quadruple in data for each texture level of detail. I don't know if that game actually uses texture LoDs, though. So you'll probably see how this can quickly add up when you start loading multiple objects with multiple levels of detail up all at the same time. Developers make a decision whether to target only newer graphics cards that allow tessellation or to maximize their potential install base and thus increase profits by supporting older hardware as well. Technically, Shadow of the Tomb Raider does target a minimum spec of nVidia GTX 660, which does support real-time tessellation, but tessellation does add a LOT more calculation overhead that your graphics card has to do. It makes the graphics card have to calculate the location of the vertices between the primary ones loaded from the hard drive that create the basic shape of each object. That would probably decrease the number of objects you could render at once. Eidos Montreal have made the right decisions for the type of environments they are trying to build. If you want a great example of this performance being effected by type of drive phenomenon, try playing The Elder Scrolls Online. In fact, when you go to install ESO, the game launcher will warn you that you may have performance issues if you are installing the game on a drive that is not an SSD. Or at least it used to. I assume it still does.",6년 전,0,

PCPartPicker.com to give your feet of the ground. Just don’t be that guy from The Verge build.  iBuyPower, Origin, MainGear, NZXT BLD, for pre-builds.  The NZXT BLD route is pretty nifty because you select titles you would play, resolution you’d be playing and it gives you an estimated FPS on the specs, which you can bump up or down. The cool thing is that you can select just about everything, even the PSU. When there was a mining/gpu shortage, BLD was one, if not the only way to get a GPU at MSRP.

Good luck selling your hand built pc from 2011 for actual money. I built 3 pcs before my alienware. I could never sell them and they were obsolete after 3 years or so.  I got my alienware on a sale and it was only a couple hundred dollars more then what i could put together on tigerdirect so I went with it. (For that couple hundred dollars difference you also get warranty and support that you will never ever get from hand building a machine.) Got my pc since. Changed gpu a couple times and rocking a 1060 now for 1080p ultra gaming. More than enough. Pc still kicking hard even when I design 1-2gb sized vehicle wraps with dozens of large layers ( keep in mind the canvas is around 300inches by 100 inches!!!!! so it's a little bit different compared to when you work on your flyer or poster sized images)  biggest issue back then was that everything was always new. New cpu socket. you can't upgrade without a new mobo. Oh you want new mobo?? you also need new ram because your old ram is not compatible now. You want new video card?

(vendor) used to ship HDD's very, very poorly and U.. (shipper) is never very gentle.. It passed all tests, but would not allow me to create multiple partitions, it was a bad drive. Always make sure your new drive will partition... Unless you don't like your data! You could also screw up a single partition, and still be able to reformat it without screwing up your other partitions. You could reload your operating system without affecting your files, though you should always use an SSD in this day and age for that.

@FireMrshlBill,"Ya, but part of the hobby is putting your own touch on it. I've never had a $2k+ guitar, but even my $1k+ guitars get new pickups and other stuff (sometimes even QC stuff like filing frets and whatnot), and if they didn't its because they got flipped before I could. Same thing with PCs, constantly have the urge to upgrade/tweak some component. I am just as interested in messing with the hardware (both PC and guitar, and cars for that matter) as I am actually using it for its intended purpose (maybe even more so at points). And buying the cheaper stuff and messing with it to get the most out of it is more fun sometimes than buying something more expensive and being to afraid to do so. I envy the person that can just buy something off the shelf and be satisfied with it until it needs to be completely replaced.   But ya, buying that cheaper guitar that somehow had decent craftsmanship and wood, and then upgrading hardware and electronics to find that sound you are looking for is just great. As Les Paul used to say, chasing the sound.",6년 전,0,

I suddenly though (3rd video on this I have watch and all 3 have commented on the decent cable management in the back)... All the cases I have bought in the past have come with some kind of cable management pre-done (mostly the front IO). If the case comes with the PSU pre-installed then perhaps the cable management was done at the factory and Wallmart didn't actually do it? Its been a while since I have bought a case that comes with a PSU and the last one I did buy was so cheap it didn't have ANY cable management space behind the motherboard tray.  It could explain why the back is decent but the front cables is a mess.,6년 전,0,

From reading posts its supposed to be either on your CPU box, on your invoice or a separate card that comes with your purchase. I wonder how many people are missing out on this, apparently it has been thing for  years and should this be something to consider when buying? I've come across several packs that actually pretty decent containing games like Pubg, Warhammer Vermintide 2, AC:O and to make it even crazier you get something called ""Game coaching credit""?

Cleaned up old copy of Windows especially after viruses will most of the time remain slow. As for reinstalling windows files without formating drive that also not always tend to work,  I have seen plenty of times that problems with drivers mismatch or some wired thing going under the hood  wouldn't disappear after restoring factory settings. Safer, more reliable rout is to start PC from flesh drive, then start installation process hit custom.

What gets me is that the SKU people want (the DTW3, with the 1080TI) is going to be in short supply, since production of the 1080TI cards ceased back in November.

If you are going to own a PC you should at least learn how to maintain it and at least obtain some knowledge about it.  Your response is only to justify laziness and for the lazy people a piece of crap pC like this is what they deserve and when it goes POP in a few months they will stare it like an Astronaut trying to figure out a Plumbers job.  Building your own is easy, very rewarding and also inherently gives you the knowledge you need to try basic fixes before picking up that phone.  So yes we try to get people away from Lazy for all the right reasons.",6년 전,1,
@strayiggytv, @animalyze7120  so basically you don't understand that different people enjoy different things and think what you like is what everyone should like. Gotcha. Nobody anywhere said that building a pc was hard just that they don't want to do it. I know how to sew and needle felt but just because I enjoy doing those things doesn't mean I think everyone should enjoy doing them and that people who don't make their own clothes are stupid. What a strangely self absorbed world view to have.,6년 전,4,
@pupstermobster8567," @strayiggytv  totally agree. If people actually observe the world instead of being stuck in their own ass, they would see people have preferences and would rather spend time building their  own their strengths than being concerned with learning every skills known to man. I've met people who are outstanding at what they do but horrible with computers. That's why tech support exists. Duh.   As for the video, I think Linus was a bit bias. ""Only"" a VGA connector onboard? He even says it doesn't matter with the graphics card present, so why is he nitpicking? I never use the onboard HDMI and I wouldn't care if it wasn't there. VGA connectors are useful for troubleshooting in situations where the HDMI cable might be fried and you only have 1, when you have to use legacy monitors, when you need to connect to a projector you bought 20 years ago, and other reasons. Cheap power supply? Let's be realistic. It only matters if it's DOA or a lightning storm hits your house (which is never). Low chance of it failing and 500 watts is plenty. Everything else was valid criticisms. But hey, the computer performs great, so for people buying $1000 phones but know nothing about computer, they will simply see it as a reasonable performance-to-price ratio purchase.",6년 전,0,

@strayiggytv, @pupstermobster8567  exactly. You also bring up an interesting thought on product reviews in general that I've been thinking about for a while. To me a bad product must be at least one of three things. 1. Unreliable 2. Faulty 3. Does not meet it's self proclaimed performance. In the case of this Wal-Mart rig it seems more like a poor value than a poor product. It's performance was acceptable within the manufacturers specs it's just that you could technically get a better pc ( even pre built) for an equal or only slightly higher price.   It also begs the question of 'if a casual gamer buys this pc and doesn't know about all the minutia that makes it so 'bad' is it actually a bad product?,6년 전,0,

I guess if you add retail priced windows that bridges the gap.  My hypothetical build has much nicer components, involved no shopping around, no used parts, and comes in (kind of) under budget.

@ZombieBarioth," @bartoszbartosiewicz1123  From a pinny-pinching perspective it does, since they're usually a bit cheaper. As for 'not being stupid', we're talking about people who don't know anything about hardware specs let alone overclocking, and contrary to what many enthusiasts may think most people don't overclock their hardware to begin with. That's just an extra premium between the better board, cooling, and labor, for an extra bit of performance most people won't see or even care about. The current mid-range CPU's are more than capable of 60FPS at is, which is what most people play at.  I certainly agree that there are much better places to buy a prebuild though, and I have no idea who Walmart thinks is going to spend over a grand for a gaming PC but hasn't heard of Alienware or any of the other big brands. If they were selling actual budget gaming systems I could understand since there aren't many.",6년 전,0,

@ZombieBarioth," @bartoszbartosiewicz1123  I would certainly agree, but the problem is that wether something is 'good' or not is a bit subjective here. We're mostly talking about enthusiast standards vs. general users, things that bug one don't necessarily bug the other, and what you might consider ""a little"" isn't likely little to them. Heck, if they ask anybody anything it'll likely be a store employee.  The really important things like the system not booting or games not running well will pop up in normal product reviews. Things like single vs. dual channel, stock vs. overclock, or i5 vs. i7 aren't, not to the average Joe.",6년 전,0,

@RustBunny," @Abion47  I have one from them, spent $1200 for it.  Mine has an i7 8700K with Corsair AIO already installed, Asus Prime Z370-P, Asus GTX 1060 3GB, 1 TB Seagate HDD, 8 GB DDR4. Sure, it's not the absolute best motherboard around and the 1060 would hold me back if I was trying to do 4K, but what I have is certainly enough to work and play with. The included keyboard isn't anything special, but I am using the mouse it came with.  Also had an ASUS wireless network adapter, which I was not expecting in the box. It has only 1 USB 3.0 up front, but that's okay by me.     Other than Walmart's computer having double the memory and a 1070 instead, I feel I have the better system for $200 less and going up to 16 GB of RAM will still come out to less than the Walmart PC.  Not having a 1070/1080 or higher (or a Radeon counterpart) is no big deal for me; I am happy with good, smooth 1080p performance right now.  It is built fairly well with room to expand, decent cable management, better air flow than the OP.  I can barely hear it, and that's only if I am trying to hear it.  I haven't overclocked it yet, but I can if/when I want to.  I did add a 240 GB SSD that I had bought, but never used, after the initial setup and first round of updates for Windows.  No bloatware either that I cn think of; I dont see anything here that I didn't put there myself.  The power supply might be the only other thing I may end up changing out after adding/replacing memory (mine has a stick from ADATA, which Walmart's OP does as well), and I'll have to add an external optical drive, but that's going to be the case for many systems these days, pre-built or not.  I may have been able to build something for about the same price or a bit less, but for the first pre-built I have bought versus doing it all myself as I have in the past, I am very happy with what I got.",6년 전,1,

You can make sure to multichannel your ram which effectively doubles your ram bandwidth (2 sticks, each on a separate channel) a proper power supply, not this 500w for a higher tier gpu nonsense, a proper chipset on your motherboard that not only allows o/c but can properly handle RAM, USB 3.1, and other glaring bandwidth issues present with this H310.",6년 전,0,

@hurrdurrimaburr," @JJ_ExMachina  You can't compare a prebuilt on sale to picking parts yourself lmao. On the off chance that I find a prebuilt ON SALE that has the parts I want. Yeah, it'd be cheaper. Pre builts are not cheaper than building a computer yourself. I just went on ibuypower and checked. They want $1549 for a 9900K paired with a god damn 1060. The PSU was sub par and had to be switched. I upped the GPU to a 1070 and downgraded to a 9700K since that makes more sense. I had to add 8Gb more RAM since you want atleast 16gb. I had to add a 500gb SSD since they don't even offer that at this price point and only give you a 1tb HDD. And the cooling solution they'd chosen for the 9900K was a 120mm single fan rad. That's not gonna cut it, MAYBE for the 9700K but I still chose to be certain and upgraded that aswell to a Kraken 360 rad. Since you NEED that to overclock these CPUs.   All in all their ""cheaper build"" was poorly put together and needed work. It ended up costing $2013 and it only has a 1070.  edit: I just put together a computer picking parts myself that has almost the same components and a much better mobo for the 9th gen CPUs. It came to around $2400, and that's with the 25% VAT I have where I live. That's $600 in tax. Without VAT I would've payed $1800. And that is roughly what I would've payed for these parts in the US. So tell me again, how am I saving money buying prebuilt? Edit#2: Turns out it's even cheaper than $1800 https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Md3FMZ So I saved $400 building my own rig.

@jonnie__ix,Chris Simon but what would be the difference if I purchased this computer or simply walked into Best Buy and bought a PC off the shelf? Would it now be ok to buy a gaming pc from Best Buy? This is a pre-made rig for the fast consumer. This isn’t a pc meant to run games at an E3 conference. Not everyone cares as much as you. Simply put. You can call it crap all you want. But will it affect a mom or dad buying gifts at Christmas and deciding to do something nice for their child? Not every consumer cares in the way YOU do. Is that a bad thing? No.,6년 전(수정됨),0,
@jonnie__ix,"Shayn because its completely unheard of to grocery shop, and then make a big purchase? It's Christmas time, I've seen people do much greater things.

Because I’m trying to figure out, how is it, you say, “easy” to build a pc but magically in the future, someone will become incompetent at building a PC. Is there a fantasy time limit in this realm where building PC’s are easy one minute, but if you buy a Wal-Mart PC....the next minute, ALL future pc purchases will render the consumer incompetent forever and ever and ever? If it is so easy to do, then wouldn’t he be able to fix this metaphorical broken pc in the future, because....it... is... so, easy?

@vangildermichael1767, @raquelalves1868  Its that last part that is the problem.  with my brother's help.  I'm not there.  And he is surrounded by morons.  So there will be no help there.  I trying to make the point that for about the price of off the shelf parts it is a better solution to have it assembled for you.  Rather than buy a Walmart rig.  And I tried to stress that the $100 premium you will pay for this convenience will far surpass paying the same $100 premium at Walmart.  Because there at Walmart you will take sub-par parts.  And pay more for them.,6년 전,0,
@jonnie__ix,"@VanGilder Michael that’s genuinely not true though. I understand your logic, but...walmart’s entire gameplan has always been to, provide name brand items at affordable prices. That’s the entire reason they have become such a conglomerate. They offer all of the top brands in electronics, as well as their own lower priced brands (which btw offer quality as well). Walmart is known for price matching as well. If you find a cheaper price elsewhere, they will match. And what people miss is, their online shop offer even MORE brands, than in-store. So I don’t understand this notion that, the consumer is paying more for sub-standard parts. Once again the negative connotation about WalMart is a bit out of hand at this point. They are one of the few companies that, a decade ago, switched their entire operating eco-system to ease the complaints of consumers, and offer better opportunities for their employees. So why all this hate? Oh. I see, cause you can buy groceries there, and they edged out “mom + pop” stores. MSI motherboard, Nvidia GFX card, intel i7, 2TB HDD AND 256gb SSD (which they forgot to mention in the video) and a fancy case. Where are you getting that this rig is cheap parts for more money? Did they cut costs on some things? Sure. But this is also their FIRST line-up of rigs. People just look at these youtubers and instantly believe they are god-tier. So much information was missing from this video. On top of that the bias, is nauseating. Let’s dismiss Walmart, but the numbers show that people by the hundreds of millions still shop there. I’m sure most youtubers having their laughs at this pc, shop at Walmart. And not everyone who shops there, care about building their own rigs. This OP PC is geared towards THAT crowd. People have it in their minds that, Walmart is dull minded at electronics.....just because they sell lettuce there. Lol kk.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

I am not sure, but I do believe they may even have an option to add 3.0 ports or use a 3.0 adapter through the USB-C. I’m sure by their second run or by the time Christmas happens, they might have 3.0 already built in. I tried to check their website earlier today, to look at specs.

Also the motherboard is a el'cheapo sold for probably about $50usd the ram is cheap no name probably from china as well, so the only 2 items that I can tell that would be worth anything would be the chipset bought in bulk, the graphics also bought in bulk and we can't forget the cooler which you got it bought in bulk, oh and the case also bought in massive bulk as all those OP machines use the same cases. Well by my calculation if your lucky $500usd - $750usd OVER PRICED machine since that is what I would say the OP logo should mean, I think Linus was ripped off paying over $1400usd for that machine.

A cheap power supply could go out on you taking everything else with it.  $1500 gaming PC powered by a $25 power supply is a recipe for disaster.  The other glaring issue of only one stick of ram, well many companies have been selling pre-builts for years with just one stick in single channel.     My theory is Walmart contracted some Company to throw together a product for Christmas this year.  Maybe they will discontinue the line or not depending on sales and returns.  Maybe the company cobbling these things together (who seem to have some sort of idea what they are doing given the rest of the system) will push out a better product in the future.

It makes me wonder if the people putting these together know a thing or two but Walmart is strong arming them into making some unfortunate decisions. But then we look back at how the PCI-e wasn't even connected. What is that about? I'm just confused. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone either because the only people that are considering this purchase is someone that doesn't want to know what's inside. They just want to game. How furious would they be if they paid over $1000 and when you plug it in it immediately has a scary looking error and doesn't even boot?

@GameCookerUSRocks,What are your thoughts on Dell because that can't be much better than the Walmart one? And you should have opened up that HP computer and showed us what that had in it as a comparison.  to me if a computer is sufficient to do its job then it's doing what it set out to do. I am not saying that I would buy the Walmart PC but most people know nothing about PCs.  I remember back in the day when everybody was buying those $300 computers with the Intel Celeron chip and extreme graphics. Every call the reaction of people saying they were happy to have their new computer only to find out that after three or four months it was running like a slug and they couldn't even game. In that respect I think until killed the PC market turning people off of TC's and onto tablets. I'm only saying that because I used to fix a lot of people's computers and that was the sentiment of many of them. Even my mother to my dismay bought a Walmart special. And the Walmart specials we're not necessarily only sold in Walmart. I just called them that. I'm not sure if you were aware that HP Omen desktops for being sold in Walmart. In my personal opinion they were pretty decent computers for the price. And they look good too and even had the fancy monitors go with them if you wanted to buy it to have a matching system. I have no idea why Walmart dropped them. The HP Omen specs were really not that bad in my honest opinion. They had GTX 1070 cards and add GTX 1060 cards which at the time we're good. And I believe they had the 7700 and the 8700 chips in them. The only thing that was weird was I think they only had 12 gigs of RAM. That always seemed very odd to me.,6년 전,0,

@michaelskywalker3089,"If the manufacturers were to take Linus's advice, even if it added 100 dollars to the price, it might be a P.C. that could be recommended. Nevertheless it is probably important to sell a system like this for under 1500 or 1400. The  high price of  DDR4 RAM and the novelty of the new RTX video make it difficult to offer a true gaming p.c. for under even 1600. It is as if they planned to design a small form factor p.c. but realized that the price point would be too high, so they put all of that hardware into a large case, scaled up their case design and put the intended RGB controller/system onto it. The mistakes are significant but few and (imo) can be easily corrected. Using the same case (assuming the RGB system isn't too expensive) they should upgrade the fans, install a dust screen, add an air cooled system to the cpu, use a better motherboard with better expandability. At least two video card slots, 4 dimm slots at least 8 usb slots including at least 4  front facing usb 3 slots (as well as HDMI and audio ports). If they saved money on a mid-range solid state drive and a low end hard drive they might be able to secure a GTX 1080 as well. They should have doubled the ram by putting in two 16 gb sticks as Linus suggested. Overclocking the stock Intel cpu cores was a smart move probably.

Now, I am not experienced in gaming in modern times, and I don't have alot of money for computer equipment, but I sure have done alot of upgrading of my machines over the last thirty years, so I do understand a few things, apart from formal training in electronics and electrical repair and theory, so power supplies have always raised a red flag with me cause I have been given dead pc's with damage caused from dead or dying power supplies, which usually damaged the hard drives, but these gaming pc's are using alot more power, so I do understand more gets destroyed.  Maybe an expert can take apart the power supply and evaluate it with a projection of its longevity or durability, and if it is engineered to fail with a certain numbers of hours, something to think about if they expect to maybe sell the same buyers replacement gaming pc's every two years at least, or a projected number of operating hours.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@fakofakoson1667,"Even if you got a system that could perform exactly the same as a system from HP or some other major manufacturer gaming division, which is highly unlikely as Walmart cuts down costs at any possible cost including build quality and quality control (like outsourced assembly hence CPU binning); saving 100-ish dollars on the purchase will deny something as important as tech support (Walmart provides none).  Unless being a little experienced building and tweaking/repairing PCs going for the Walton´s offer is a very risky bet, I would say that if on a budget and depending on the gaming load the system is intended for, try to gather a couple hundred more and go for something from HP, Lenovo, Dell (Not their Alienware line as those are really expensive), or even Acer.  I for example got 2 laptop systems 1 generation outdated in September 2018 I use for gaming and have no complaints so far:  For the equivalnet of 1000 USD in local currency (Mexico) Lenovo Y720 1080 15.6"" IPS display 128GB M.2 NVMe SSD 2TB 7200RPM 2.5"" WD blue HDD 3 USB 3.0 type A ports 1 USB 3.1 thunderbolt 3 port 1 HDMI port 1 Mini-displayport  1 Fast Ethernet port 16GB 2400T MHz. RAM (expandable to 32) (Quad core) 7th gen i7 7700HQ @ 3.8GHz. turbo Nvidia GTX1060 6GB GDDR5 GPU RGB keyboard........  For the equivalent of 800 USD in local currency (Mexico) Acer R15 1080 15.6"" 10 point multitouch 360° IPS display 256GB M.2 NVMe SSD 1TB 7200RPM 2.5"" WD blue HDD 3 USB 3.0 type A ports 1 USB 3.1 (not thunderbolt) port SD card reader 1 HDMI port 12GB 2400T MHz. RAM (maxed out with 4 on board and a single slot supporting 8) (Dual core) 7th gen i7 7500U @ 3.5GHz. turbo Nvidia GT940MX 2GB GDDR5 GPU Backlit keyboard........  and a handful of bells and whistles that do not affect performance like fingerprint scanner and such. In both cases the CPU and GPU can be overclocked by tweaking a little and in the case of the Lenovo Y720 a more powerful GPU can be set up via the thunderbolt port.  On both systems I have been able to play demanding titles like Hitman2 on the high preset with a minimum of 58 FPS and less demanding ones like ARMA 3 Apex multiplayer and Madden 19 over WiFi on ultra preset @ locked 60 FPS....so there are many options to get much better value for you money out there.",6년 전,0,

You do know if they are such a large company they will buy in bulk wich costs them less and they don't have to charge the extra money on top. They will still get loads of profit and will look more appealing to knowledgeable consumer.  There are heaps of tutorials on how build a computer, it is easy. If I use one of my sites I shop on they only charge a $80 build service on top of the custom parts you picked not hundreds of dollars mark up on each item and a service fee like wall Mart, Razer and alien ware.  Like I said if you are a smart consumer you would shop around for way better deals or do it your self.

@owendeen679,"Sorry but if you're going to buy a computer, build it yourself. Prebuilt computers are just more money for less quality, most likely loaded with unnecessary parts and bloatware whereas you can choose and buy better components at a similar price. Sometimes it's a little more expensive, but it's way better than allowing a business to mix and match the cheapest parts possible then selling it at a ridiculous price to unknowing customers. You even get the pleasure of building your own machine. If you don't know how to then you can always learn from other people, or get them to do it for you.

@Soundaholic92," @chrisray4748  They probably plugged it in but not all the way until the latches click into place, and then it comes loose during shipping. It was in Bitwit's vid which I mistook for Canuck's lol.

A supermarkets primary focus will be on making money all off course they'll cut a few corners. Providing a basic motherboard that can't be upgraded is a perfect example of this because when you need to upgrade they won't be able to provide an upgrade without changing the motherboard so Wal-Mart would likely suggest a new computer. The same goes for the PSU which of course won't match the life and longevity of a PSU from Corsair for example, Wal-Mart want the computer to die after x years (after warranty) so are forced to but a new part / computer.  The computer still work just fine for 99% of users who buy them, their biggest mistakes are the lack of USB 3 front panel slots and the mistakes and cables not being connected.  Just look at how it performed with the benchmarks and games, it wasn't bad and would be fine for most people.

Usually with those machines you could save a few bucks by getting them used/discounted, and just adding more memory and a gpu. With this, you'd be better off building it from scratch.

My cpu runs at constant 4.3 ghz even doing solidword render at 100% cpu load. And occasionally turbo boost to 4.6 ghz. The only problem is that I am not ver satisfied with the cpu temperature hitting 90 degrees at 100% load  which is a bit too hot for my taste but it doesn’t thermal throttle.

I couldn't find the psu there, in fact it seemed like the entirety of the internet pushed me away from even trying to find a 500w great wall.  Almost everything in that build was the ""cheapest"" on newegg in ""current"" generation, except the GPU, which was actually the ""OC"" windforce model from giga (from the looks of the fan cover)which had 2 cheaper models. 45$ motherboard on black friday sale. Best piece in the build was the case it LOOKS like a Rosewill Cullinan MX which actually has the potential to be a really decent mid-line PC case, but as Linus stated the USB 2.0 were a huge downside. Walmart definitely controls the quality on these, that's why the connectors were hot glued, the regular pricing is actually a little higher.  Bringing down price for buying thousands of these parts, manufacturers probably gave a hefty discount for the sales.

That was a big issue for me in the late 90's because web-commerce was relatively new. On the other hand, they cheap out in weird places that sort of negate the advantages of a tower PC over a laptop (expandability).",6년 전,0,

@peterparker6584,"I didn't know you are in Canada  Linus.you should really talk to me sometime. I could set you up with some older gear for those custom computer projects. I get vintage crap quite frequently sell it online and make a couple bucks here and there.you'd be surprised the older equipment I get. Frankly, the hardware I use day-to-day would probably scare you. Age wise, but I'm not a gamer when it comes to computers. What I use as a daily driver is a very early ruggedized laptop with 1.5 dual core processors. Basically running Windows XP and I use it for basic internetwork. If you seen how much newer equipment. I've got sitting around here you'd probably be asking why am I using such an old machine, and it mostly boils down to me being able to put operating systems on the newer machines or just not having the time to do it.   I literally keep getting gaming machines that people throw of and been meaning to get around to reformatting the drives and replacing stuff they removed when they through the machines out . Several were t2000 and $3000 machines when they were new. everything you had with this computer. I've seen three other people mentioned in their videos. Next thing I should mention is at the risk of being insulting. I generally don't buy electronics at Walmart. What ID of the last time I built a computer from scratch. I did a little bit of fooling around and bought all the parts for a crazy amount last than what it would've cost to buy a prebuilt machine. This was around 10 years ago. Now, give or take, and I think it worked out to costing me about four or 500 at most, and would've cost me around 1500 to buy a already built machine motherboard and processor were like 130 power supply was around $50 video card actually cost more than the board and processor LOL. I forget how much the RAM cost. I think the tower was like $50. I put most of it together myself and ran into a problem of not being able to figure out where the power wire plugged onto the motherboard. Literally. I took it to the shop I bought the motherboard from and they had the exact same problem logically. Of coarse they went to the instructions and things went downhill from there LOL. There was a hell of a problem with the instructions being not put in English correctly and heavily misspelled by the time the guy was done he basically never wanted me to come back to is shop again LOL. And the joke was that was where I bought the motherboard from heat never had that much trouble for admittedly never really dealt much with that brand of motherboard other than ordering them for other people.  While I think of it, what in hell do you do with all these computers. After you make your videos do you resell them or something? I've always been curious given. You must go through several hundred cell phones and computers each year. What do you do with them. After you do the videos? Guys like you probably point at old caveman like me and laughed up until three weeks ago I was still using a rugby flip phone.. I ended up with a used early era Samsung rugby smart phone that literally looks like it's brand-new and started using it. Needless to say everything Internet wise on the phone is jacked up six ways from Sunday and I've got no idea how to have everything in the phone  reset. Basically, the phones got almost no room despite I tried to manually erase everything. It would allow and it won't allow for updates or anything because there's no room at some point I'll have to take it the somebody and have the phone reset. I'm sure those cell phone shops know how to redo everything and remove all the crap I don't need. 90% of the apps on these smart phones. I'll never use and I don't know if there's a way to remove them. Only thing I need the phone for is making phone calls and texting. I couldn't be bothered using the Internet on a cell phone for so many reasons that is probably why there's such an age gap between me and younger people I can't stand the concept of using the Internet on a device that fits in my pocket because the screen just doesn't cut it. Bad enough. I'm using a 12 for war Dean inch laptop screen. That in itself irritates me. If you're wondering why I'm still using windows XP. I keep having problems trying to get Windows 7 installed on machines for whatever reason Windows XP just works and these machines literally had Windows 7 factory in a lot of cases and keep running into problems with it. Not wanting to work , such as the updates Not wanting to install.if you're ever looking for old equipment or gaming towers. I've got a few laying around here as old as the 90s when it comes to gaming towers and in some cases they literally look like they came right out of the box. Every so often I sell a bit here and celibate. There where I've got it listed on the Internet. I still use single core laptops for Internet work doing things that basically if something goes wrong with the computer you reformat the hard drive and don't care or if the computer melts down. It's not any loss whatsoever. You literally got three or four more sitting in the Corner.generally, I specifically hang onto Dell laptops and most other machines when it comes to the old ones I put up for sale every so often I run into people looking for old year for parts. I've got probably five Dell laptops. I hung on to that are all the same single core model where I find that particular model to be pretty reliable. Other than that Acer's are generally what I tried to focus on for newer machines I've got this really beautiful Sony laptop I've had sitting for about two years and can't find anybody that can tell me what cable I need to go from the hard drive to the motherboard or that machine would've been put together and being used was a super expensive Sony laptop in its time and when I got it somebody had removed the hard drive and took the cable as well. Looks like a little $.25 wire and nobody seems to know the exact model to fit it I've gone through what if you and haven't found the right one.. I'll this time I thought you were in the US.",6년 전,0,

@jackielinde7568,"Linus, it's like whomever they got to design this system built PC's in the 90's. Back in the FAT16 and FAT32 days (see MS-DOS and Win95/Win98), It wasn't uncommon to partition really large hard drives to control cluster size. But NTFS is fine with large drive sizes, so you don't need to partition a drive to prevent a bunch of 100 byte files chewing up a huge amount of space on your hard drive. Likewise, the 90's saw a rapid change in memory from the DIPP chips to the SIPP form factor and finally the form factor we know and love today. Dual Channel Memory wasn't a thing until around 2000. With both of these things in mind, it's like Walmart hired someone who built PC's in the 90's fell into a coma, only to recently awake from it and go back to building PC's. (So, they got a former Gateway employee?)  The only thought I came up with the single stick of ram is that maybe one stick of 16GB ram is cheaper than two 8GB sticks? Also, Walmart Literature doesn't state if that is DDR3 or DD4 ram. Don't laugh, it's entirely possible that Walmart skimped and used DDR3 when the standard for that chip (per Intel) is DDR4-2666.

Dude, it's made by Walmart; a corporation that would throw their employees under the bus just to save a few thousand dollars and not even think twice about it. Nor lose sleep over it. That should tell you the answer right there. Honestly, when I first heard about these from ReviewTechUSA I knew without a doubt they'd be shit.  Edit: Also, regarding the PCIE cable not being plugged in, the same exact thing happened to Bitwit. That right there should tell you how their level of ""quality control"" is. And no, there's no way in hell that thing could get disconnected during shipping. Once that thing clicks in, it's LOCKED in. Sometimes I have to shimmy those fuckers just to unplug them. Like c'mon Linus, you should know better.  Another thing, regarding the hot glue on the USB 3.0 header, I'm thinking that could be some sort of ghetto tamper-evident thing. That could also be why it's wrapped around the graphics card so that if you were to say, unplug it and swap the graphics card with a broken unit then tried to return it, they could tell.

@RexKramerDangerSeeker,"So the price isn't bad, just the build quirks and part selection? I'm curious why the HP machine didn't get shit for being $100 more, on sale, with roughly the same specs.

No one said the cook is going to use the best ingredients or be a Michelin star chef. This is like the ""$500 PC CONSOLE KILLER"" videos that blew up to shit on people who just wanted to play games and not have to worry about drivers and compatibility issues.   The only issues I really see are the GPU not being plugged in and lack of a single USB 3 port on the front IO. The latter really even not being that big of a deal, just a nuisance. This PC is at $1200 right now and is as much as HP's Omen prebuilts were with the 7700 and a reference 1070.

Not to sound patronizing, but someone buying from Walmart will not be a 'technical' person at all.  They want something (like a Mac) that you can just plug in and go.  Given the 'gaming computer' tag, I think the envisioned customer is a working-class mom who's giving her son (excuse the gender assumptions) his own 'gaming computer' for Christmas at considerable expense, going to the store she knows (not a mysterious place like Dell), without having to ask too many questions. And, really, even with the single-channel memory thing, it might actually be OK for such a family, if it weren't for the showstopping failure to boot because the GPU wasn't properly connected.  And that really is a showstopper, and I feel genuinely sorry for a customer who happily brings this nice-looking box home, and gets the mysterious message when they try to boot on Christmas morning.",6년 전,0,

When you're making a pre-built low-cost product like this, any way you can get cost down without really impacting performance is impressive, not incompetent. You saw in the benchmarks how impressive it was for how small everything was, and especially how cut-down the motherboard was. The end user is getting a lot of bang for their buck compared to other pre-builts. The things you list are not errors. The motherboard does not need an upgrade, you're buying a system to use. The market for this is people who want a fast computer, and may not know how or want to deal with building and maintaining a computer. If you want to buy it and upgrade it, you can get a better motherboard, but if you're going to do that, there's no reason not to start with parts anyway.

@LycanShift,"13:50 FYI: Great Wall = Corsair/Thermaltake/OCZ/Riotoro.  Some models of Corsair power supplies are just rebranded Great Wall power supplies. Great Wall is the supplier of the CX, CS, and TX series of corsair power supplies. So in otherwords, you technically can say that the Walmart PC uses Corsair power supplies, except it's just not painted black & without the Corsair branding.  In addition to this, Thermaltake's tough power series also use Great Wall.  Also back when OCZ was still a major player in the PC gaming space before going bankrupt and Toshiba taking over, their power supplies were rebranded Great Wall power supplies (these were all highly rated) and i'm still using my now 8+ year old OCZ ZT series 750w PSU (bought in 2011) in the PC I am typing here today with which i just learned is a rebranded Great Wall PSU, is still going strong with zero issues in my current Ryzen 7 build.  Lastly, Riotoro's Onyx series Power Supplies are nothing but rebranded Great Wall power supplies too.  Even johnnyguru gives these rebranded powersupplies high scores.  Before everyone goes around knocking a brand of power supply because it looks cheap just because it's in a unpainted metal case and is a ""chinese"" brand, do some simple research. Just a simple google search would have shown that Great Wall is an OEM supplier for reputable brands such as Corsair, Thermaltake, Riotoro, and OCZ for their Power Supplies.. which I may add are all highly rated/praised power supplies and in the case with Corsair, one of the top gaming ""go to"" brands for Power Supplies and Thermaltake isn't far behind.  What many people don't realize is that many of the top gaming brands in the North American and European markets don't actually make their own components/devices, and instead just use rebranded Chinese components/devices and sell them as their own... for example, EVGA PSUs are just rebranded ""no name"" chinese PSUs made by companies with names such as Super Flower and Shenzhen Rui Sheng Yuan, etc.  Here's a link showing what OEM platform Corsair models use: http://www.orionpsudb.com/corsair or what EVGA power supplies really are: http://www.orionpsudb.com/evga OCZ: http://www.orionpsudb.com/OCZ  as you can see, a number of respected PSU companies are actually just rebranded Chinese Great Wall PSUs.",6년 전(수정됨),13,

But that's not how things go...now is it? 100% no.  Not at all.  Doesn't matter if Microsoft doesn't want you to do it.  Some of those keys get found out for being sold illegally, and you end up with a key that no longer works.   PSU isn't bad, unless your telling me Corsair PSU's are also bad..along with tons of other reputable companies which create power supplies from the exact same manufacture, Great Wall.  Motherboard isn't bad, it's just a Gigabyte H310m S2.  Not to bad for a non-k cpu.   Case is actually pretty decent and would definitely cost and upwards of $80-$100 max.  In fact, the exact case is actually the Rosewill Cullinan case (the closest I could find which matches the case Walmart is using in there OP pc's at least).   Which, as of today, cost $105 on Amazon.  Go on, take a look at all the reviews for it, pretty decent case over-all, air flow wise isn't great though.  You can keep on stating how Walmart buying these things in bulk obviously makes it much cheaper for them,  but for the person who builds his own PC you're buying everything brand new.

@leonro," @Nighterlev  You know that the companies that get Windows OEM keys and sell them are making a profit, right? That means that any company can get Windows licenses for really cheap, and expect Walmart to do the same. I'd be surprised if they pay more than 10 USD per license.  And Windows licenses on ebay are definitely not scams. Just get them from the top results whose sellers have lots of reviews and are +98% reliable or so.

@mycookingiswet127, @leonro  and? Hes talking about how much its worth compared to building it yourself,6년 전,0,
@AlpakaWhacker," @Nighterlev  I'll disagree on the case front. The case that Walmart is using although it doesn't look bad, for cooling it is absolutely awful - Gamers Nexus tested it with their standardised testing components and it is one of the worst cases they've tested and could not keep their components sufficiently cool, the only way to keep their components adequately cool was by taking off the front panel as there isn't enough airflow with the panel on. Now of course for the components that Walmart have put inside the case, this might not be an issue but it is still something to take into consideration.  I would also add that the case that you described (Rosewill Cullinan) is miles better than the case Wallmart are using - It supports water cooling, has mountings for fans on the top, has dust filters and has bigger intake vents to allow for more efficient cooling than Wallmart's case. If Wallmart were using the case you suggested instead, once again it would make it a much more attractive purchase. Based on the major differences in these two cases, I would actually estimate Wallmart's case to be maybe $50-$60 in value MAX.",6년 전,1,
@Nighterlev," @AlpakaWhacker  The case was the closest one I could find which matches the one Walmart is using.  Gamer Nexus even quite clearly stated it's the exact same case, with slight differences as the Cullian (such as the front panel being completely replaced with a glass panel instead that's screwed in, even though the case still has the exact same clips for the original plastic panel it had before)..You know this, right?  https://youtu.be/_CVAssVXdM0?t=71",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@AlpakaWhacker," @Nighterlev  I'm aware that he did say that but if you look at the cases they are definitely not the same case although they are most likely both made by the same manufacturer - Like I said, the Cullian features the top fans as well as the vented top whereas the Wallmart case does not, the Cullian also features different metal cut-out vents on the rear panel with two additional circular cutouts above the rear fan which the wallmart does not feature (meaning the Cullian may actually be slightly taller overall than the Wallmart but wallmart has not provided case dimensions). The metal work around the top of the Cullian is also completely different with a thinner metal overlap over the edge where the glass panel attaches whereas the wallmarts metal is approx 1-1.5 inches in height. All in all, all these differences mean that the case cannot be the same case.",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@Nighterlev," @AlpakaWhacker  Again: The front and top were custom made.  Yes, it's made by the exact same manufactur that made the Cullian, same metals and all that, along with sharing obvious similarities to the Cullian. You could take the front, and top panels off the Cullian and fit them easily onto this Walmart case.  You know this, right? It literally has the exact same fittings for god sakes.  The metal is also the exact same metal as far as anything can be observed.  No idea why you suggest the case was worth less then $60 at all, considering it's quite clearly a case worth around $80-$100 as I already stated previously.",6년 전,1,
@Auravendill,"​ @Nighterlev  The PSU is kind of the worst you can get without it exploding: No 80plus, no modular cables and not even powder coating. Of course it does, what it has to do right now. But how long? How much energy does it waste?   The case might look like the Rosewill Cullinan, but has far worse thermal performance. The front plate reduces the airflow so much, that even cases with much less fans outperfrom it. The CPU is constantly getting the warm air from the GPU. (Amazon reviews are also kind of problematic. They mostly judge how it looks and if it was shipped on time.)  The motherboard is also one of the worse choices: Two RAM slots in an expensive Gaming PC?!

@Nighterlev," @leonro  I thought I replied to this.  You do realize that companies can get EVERYTHING for cheaper buying in bulk..Right? That means you spend far less for 100,000 cases.  Let's say per case each cost $100.  That'd be $10,000,000 for all the cases. Instead, companies make deals, and get a 1-5-10% profit margin off the product they're selling.   So, instead those 100,000 cases end up costing Walmart $10 each.  Now it's only $1,000,000 that they have to spend on the cases alone.  Are any consumers going to do this?  Hell to the word No.    ""that means any company can get windows licenses for really cheap"" Yes..By buying in bulk, by spending over $1,000,000 for roughly 100,000 windows license keys... That's $10 a key, as you mentioned.  If it's $5, then they only got to spend $500,000 for 100,000 windows keys.   Any windows license key sold on Ebay is a illegal key, which automatically means it's a scam, and tons of people have already been angry that there windows gets deactivated after a few weeks to a few months.  It happens, a lot.  Of course you can always be lucky and your key never gets found out to of been sold illegally.   As I already stated, if you were to build this yourself, it would end up costing you roughly $100-$200 less then what Walmart is selling to you when you factor in everything.  Can go as much as $300-$400 if you don't factor in the people they have to pay to even build the machines, much less a valid windows license key.  Walmarts actual profit margins though can be as much as $500 per PC sold if you factor in how they got the parts in ""bulk"" at a reduced price.  Of course, this profit is spread among many different companies..because in order to get deals, you have to give them something back in return.  Whether it's money or items.",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@Nighterlev," @Auravendill   We don't know if it's 80+ or not.  It quite clearly has a 80+ label that's pretty hard to find, but that doesn't always mean it actually is 80+.  Keep in mind, Corsair also makes PSU's that aren't 80+.    The case has far worse thermal performance due to the front cover being different.  Take off the front cover, and you get even better temps then the rose-will cullinan for well, obvious reasons. Put on the Rosewill Cullinan's front panel and you get roughly the exact same thermal performance over-all.  Remember. Gamer Nexus did the test and I already posted the video they did of it just for you (with them even stating that it comes from the same people who made the Rosewill Cullinan).    ""two ram slots in a expensive gaming pc""  Uh..All pre-built machines are literally built like this.  Most pre-builts don't even come with 4 slots anymore actually.    Gamer Nexus actually demonstrated that the chip is faster, and slower in other area's, which they found really odd.  It also runs at a higher GHz, so who knows.",6년 전,0,

@sasjadv,"I have never benefited from USB3, for using a mouse usb2 has a lot of headroom, for storage it's just that I don't use a flashdrive EVERY day, and if I use it for a document or a picture, then I don't care about the speeds, if I want to put a large file on a flash drive, then I'm most likely putting an OS on it and that flashing takes time anyway. And I'm transfering a large file onto portable storage, then I just drag it into the folder and do something else, i.e. watch youtube, go to the kitchen, clean something up, make another document, etc. What else does a normal person use USB3 for? I'm like: yeah cool to have, but if there would be a price difference between USB2 and USB3 I wouldn't pay the extra money for 3. And I'm a person interrested in technology, electronics, PCs and I know how to program, I'm the sort of person that has a multi boot pc, virtual machines, CAD programs, etc. And even I don't give a shit about USB3. I'm the person that wants to know how a PC work from transistor to what you see of the screen. Look, even a lot of students of a technical university (possibly even most of them) don't know that the the connector they use for an external display is called HDMI. That's the reality, they don't know vga, dvi and hdmi, they say: the blue one, the square one or the new stylish thing, or the wider USB-like thing, or just ""the other one"". Show them a displayport cable and they wouldn't know it can be used for a monitor. They wouldn't notice if their powerpoint presentation would be capped at 30fps. And I'm talking about people doing a bachelors degree on a technical university here. The majority of the people wants something ""kinda skookum"" and doesn't care too much about the details. --- What's a real usecase of USB3? If i'm doing something else while files are transferring then I don't care about the speeds at all. And then: how often does the avg guy copy large files onto a thumbdrive?",6년 전(수정됨),5,

@prodromosregalides3402," @factsandstuff2832  When you buy an iphone at 1500 dollars , this seems like a hell of a bargain.

In fact even compromised this pc has at least 10 times the computing power of an iphone. I suppose you don't accept the fake geekbenches and antutus made only to boost the ego of arm derived manufacturers, do you? If we want to be fair, either the iphone should cost 150 dollars or this pc 15,000 dollars. And no I am not joking. The mobile devolution has inflated the prices of computing devices so much , that some times we forget how much lucky we are to get ""so much"" for so little when buying desktop class computing devices.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

That's like trying to use the fair price of a parakeet to judge whether your getting a good deal on your cow.",6년 전,0,
@prodromosregalides3402," @factsandstuff2832  I wouldn't buy a 1500 dollar phone myself, but for different reasons. :)  And though smartphones are useful for different things, mainly because they work at a different power envelope, they are not so different as a parakeet compared to a cow, more like a calf compared to a cow. They are for all intents and purposes von-neumann devices, do the same job, ""eat the same food"" and produce the same work; they are only different in terms of capacity.    So a comparison is quite legitimate and only people that make mobile devices are afraid of this , because they have been bullshitting the public for a long time. Instead of rejoycing at the marvel of packing so much computing power in so small power envelope(with all the practical benefits this brings), they have been demanding supremacy , characteristic examples being Apple , Samsung , and many other companies that borrowed ARM's designs.(yes borrowed , modification is good and all, but it is still copying and borrowing). Computing devices that consume more power will always be more powerful, barring , probably devices based on reversible computing, that have not been developed yet at least commercially that is. Your classical flagship desktop cpu consumes at least 100 times the power of a cpu in a flagship mobile soc. It just is not 100 times faster but about 10 to 20 , depending on how you look at things, because power and computational capacity don't scale linearly.  But throwing at our face yet again , the nth result from geekbench to acquire legitimacy for their pricing is worse than swearing at us. I could understand , if they say I have to pay for the screen , some materials and the mobility. But they do imply I pay more, because they are almost comparable to a desktop and this is ridiculous and unacceptable. So, yes by their thinking a desktop should cost 15,000 dollars , it is just we are still lucky we can buy so much computing ""so cheap"" . This could change though if Intel , Nvidia and company start understanding how much more passive and much cheaper  have been in this regard compared to  their ""mobile"" competitors.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@yulfine1688,Linus to build this exact thing would cost you like maybe 1000$ at most and that's ripping yourself off. They are charging 1400 usd for that not including taxes and such. Ok My 1080 8700k system only costs around 1700$ right now and its far far superior in quality to whatever the fuck that is. I7 8700k on a gigabyte aorus ultra gaming z370 motherboard. 16gb of ddr4 3200mhz ram from gskill. A msi gtx 1080 twin frozer. a 256gb ssd from Samsung and a 2tb wd black drive for western digital. MY powersupply is a corsair rm 850x which is made by seasonic in this  case. However corsairs low end psus are made by great wall actually which is why everyone tells you to avoid them because they're absolute garbage. My case is the nzxt h440. Basically gave my entire system specs and it costs around 1700$ to build this thing yourself. They have far less with a 1070 at that and not even a K variant of the cpu which for overclocking or even not overclocking yourself boosts higher for better performance with a higher base clock. Gigabyte makes the cheapest or close to the cheapest gpus on the market but at least they're mostly reputable. I personally hate my gigabyte  motherboard this stupid thing for a 170 or 180$ motherboard which is not cheap for a motherboard while overall seems and looks nice if you ask me is complete junk. I don't know what it is with gigabyte with poor bios updates and stability with other components and drivers and then their software is a mess mostly. I regret not getting an msi or asus motherboard instead of this thing evne though the bios is clean and very nice looking I just don't understand the stability and compatibility issues they seem to have.,6년 전,0,

@EszesBalazs,"A good reason to make multiple partitions on a single disk is to make it easier resolving file partition headers corrupting. I had two cases of this where it would have been less painful recovering the files.  1st time I think I dropped my laptop too hard, which caused boot files to go missing. Windows wouldn't let me install on top of it without formatting the partition, so I needed a second machine and an external adapter, I did get most stuff off it, and then the head finally crashed. 2nd time I had a Mac at a printer cause an NTFS external hdd to lose it's headers and show up as RAW disk, if it had multiple partitions then maybe I wouldn't have had to run a recovery software for like half the data. So right now if a disk is larger than 250GB and is used for non-redundant data, such as personal files I at least make two partitions, just in case something like this happens it's way more faster to recover and is possible to do without taking the working machine apart.",6년 전,0,

@noodlesthe1st,"After seeing all three videos on this gaming PC I still think it's a good product for the money. I mean your complaints are things like upgradeability and lets be honest here, anyone buying a PC from Walmart isn't going to upgrade their PC anytime in the next 5-15 years. Also your concern about the power supply is based on aesthetic. I mean based on that I could say a PC without RGB is bad because someone cheaped out on RGB. But the fact is without extensive testing there is no way for you to know whether the power supply is reliable or not and at the end of the day a power supply just needs to be reliable and efficient and you didn't test efficiency either.  I mean are you seriously going to complain that there is only vga on the motherboard when the user is NEVER going to use any display outs on the motherboard?  The one legit huge complaint is the graphics card not being plugged in. Because that would lead to the typical customer having to call customer support. And yes no usb 3 is also pretty bad.  It just makes me feel like you guys have been spoiled with being able to buil;d every system to a theoretical perfection where the smallest things become an issue for you guys even though in reality it makes absolutely no noticeable difference as long as you aren't a PC person and tear down the system.

Both are DC-DC regulated, and both use Rifle Bearing fans (confirmed by Jonnyguru). The CX being slightly better than the CXM, and less prone to coil whine.  The TXM is a slight update to the CS, so you calling the TXM high end, and the CS trash, just shows your lack of competence.  You're saying it as if multi rail is a bad thing.
