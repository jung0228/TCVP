@bestdressed,"hope you guys enjoyed geeking out over apartments with me! on a serious note though, if you see comments below with anyone asking/revealing what neighborhood or street i live on, PLEASE thumbs them down and report them. sorry i didn’t mention the exact neighborhood where my apartment is located - it’s in downtown manhattan, but i wanted to take some extra steps to protect my personal safety this time because some people found out my address at my last apartment in LA. i really love this apartment and it would break my heart if i had to move out because my address got leaked. sorry this is a weird comment to even have to write, i know 99.9% of y'all are so sweet and looking out for me but i just want to be safe! xoxo ashley",5년 전,3.8만,

@freohr789," @lacitygirl0146  while imo they could have worded it less accusationally, they're not wrong. If people keep bugging her to show the outdoors to her apartment, she can just ignore them because safety is more important than peer pressure. I know when Jenna Marbles moved to her new home, she decided to be very careful of showing off her front yard and neighborhood (she even walks her dogs in a different neighborhood) to try to avoid stalkers showing up to her home.   The problem with creeps is that not every creep's parent will control them (or even know that they are a creep) and some creeps do get away with doing creepy things. Just because they shouldn't doesn't mean they won't. It's because of that that celebrities have to take extra measures to stay safe.   It's sad that it has to be this way, but unfortunately that's just the world we live in. We can't leave our heads in the clouds otherwise that distracts us from the reality that we have to work with.",5년 전(수정됨),11,
@freohr789,"@Sweet V. I do entirely agree with you, but for future reference the best way to ""not come off as mean"" is to simply give the advice, not to throw the accusation in along with it (as in, there's a way of giving the advice without also basically saying ""this is your fault"" because saying that isn't necessary unless the goal is to make her feel worse :b)",5년 전(수정됨),15,

@mrvgstyle2442," @octaviahelena  , If you watch her California videos, she picked up that habit there, and when she had work to be done in her apartment she said she would get help from whoever she was ""f-ing"" at the time.  I think that's sad that saying something like that shows no respect for the person that's of help to you.  She picked up some really bad habits in Los Angeles.  She needs to let that go because if she really wants to advance herself as a person professionally, you speak intelligently, leaving the profanities behind.  I've hired people for a long time and collaborated with people as well.  I wouldn't want to do business with someone whose vocabulary is limited to the ""f"" word.  I'm a mature professional.  In other words, a decision maker who has been a professional manager for decades.  To someone like me, it leaves a sad impression of an otherwise intelligent person, than a bad impression because it puts Ashley on the same level as someone who hasn't received a higher education, much less someone who didn't appreciate the efforts of the people who encouraged it.",5년 전,1,
@phillyroots702,"To Start am here spending time showing love and support for  Ashley an incredible YouTuber! ======================== Hello If you can see this. I have experienced the horrors  of YT's algorithm. Am sure  this has happened to many on YT. 》Comments are ignored because the algorithm autos the comments as spam and sends  them to Likely Spam and will  never be seen in the comments sections until the video publishers approves comments are not spam. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& 》I had comments stay in  the comments sections (must  of been only publisher and  myself can see them) for over a year: without 1 like  or 1 unlike and not 1 reply. 》》In the meantime YT's algorithm gets many other  comments thousands of likes.  =======================  I know that the cost of living in  New York City is outrageous and unaffordable to most  people but apparently Ashley  is making a lot of money on  YT because of this channel (her videos are monetized.)  Apparently she can afford it.  &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& I did not even view this video  and I'm leaving a comment! I'm basing this comment on  the few videos I've seen and part of the videos I've seen on this channel bestdressed.  The very first video I viewed  on this channel was when I  found Ashley: was the great  idea when she took herself out on a date! That video is fascinating and incredible!!!  And to me Ashley is the real  deal when it comes to being  genuine. She is a fast talker  but think that's because she's  a multi-tasking mile-a-minute person and I can relate to her  that we do our best with little  time left to finish (backed up  to the wall) very last minute  to get things done.  Ashley in videos I seen is TMI  short for a (too much info)   and throws the f-bomb but in  this day and age it's being  used in many songs so it's  being more acceptable. But I  learned many years ago that  it's better to look at the big picture.   》So now I will focus on the  ""Incredible Ashley"" she done  things at her young age that  many people have never done  in their entire lifetimes.  Ashley is a super duper great  YouTuber who has lost many  hours of sleep dedicating her  time getting videos done. Her  Renovations in the LA APT  has been incredible to the  point that she had to put the apartment back the way it was  before she moved in this  woman is Superwoman! &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& If I was the landlord of the LA APT I would really  appreciate it that Ashley  made the apartment nicer then before she moved in.  All because Ash wanted to  move out to New York City.  Love her incredible detailed  information for each video. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Ashley is an incredibly self- taught person when it comes  to innovations and goes to  hardware stores to get  everything needed for the  renovating. She is as good in innovations as any pro!!!  》I know this comment is lengthy and I can keep going  on and on complimenting  Ashley but the people that are watching her videos know  how incredibly talented she is.  If I was magic I would of viewed all her videos already! I'm basing  my comments on the few videos I've seen and part of the videos I've seen.  My prediction is this comment will be auto selected by YT's algorithm and get ignored. But if I'm wrong to those that agree with me about Ashley give this comment a thumbs up. Nice comments are welcome and uncalled for one's will be reported as harassment or bullying.  For stress reduction visit my channel and view any of my dancing videos!  - Dancing Louie",5년 전,0,

@mackenzierivercasey6752,"I LOVED this, and girl I can relate! I'm from a highly sought after tourist town in Ontario Canada by the Blue Mountains called Collingwood. It's right at the base of the mountain.  It's popular for craft beer...skiing, waterfront etc. I grew up here and moved back after college thinking I could get a one bedroom for the same price as I could get in small city I was in during college. HAAAAA I was in for a shock! We almost have New York or Toronto prices here in Collingwood! I want to settle down in my hometown because it's literally the best place I've ever lived and I've lived in so many surrounding towns and cities. But man....the struggle is real even in Canada. Within the past 13 years it has become severely gentrified! It has a lot of history. It is the last stop in Canada for the underground railroad, it is one of the Country's oldest shipyards. My uncle used to be one of the shipmen before he joined the navy, and it has now become a place for rich retiring Toronto business people to buy up real estate and rent out Air Bnb's....making it almost impossible for young people to live here. It makes me so sad :/ <3 And it happened SO quickly while I was away in College!  I had no idea what I was up against when I decided to move back home...I really hope the renting problem gets balanced out soon because young people are getting screwed left right and center it feels! I know I'm not the only one who feels this way....I'd move out west but all I have at the moment is my family, and now I have to take care of my sick mom who is not in a position to move anywhere. I hope things get better for my generation. I know so many beautiful people who would be content and humble with a small space to call home!",4년 전(수정됨),2,

People can get away without paying rent for months before going through the eviction process. It’s horrible. If you’re an investor, never invest in NY- it’s horrible for landlords.

@maerum9412,"It’s very difficult to try to find AND secure an apartment months in advance in NYC. Apartments are constantly being snatched up in NYC and it can be sort of demoralizing. Searching and getting an idea of areas you’d like to live in is fine— but honestly it is such a case by case situation here. If you work minimum wage (which is $15/hr) in NYC you might be declined even the opportunity to hold a deposit on an apartment. MANY places ESPECIALLY in Manhattan need you to be making 40x the rent and have a good credit score. Otherwise you need to have a guarantor that makes an even GREATER amount of money than 40x the rent. You might be able to find something in Brooklyn, Queens, or Harlem that would be a little easier on the rent cap— but at $1,650(my 1 bdrm rent in bay ridge)x40– both my boyfriend and I barely had enough combined income to qualify. SO make sure to save your money to be able to prove you’d be able to pay rent if you sign a lease. :)",5년 전,0,

People literally seem personally offended when I tell them how much I pay in rent for my tiny apartment (600 sq ft, $1100 + utilities - ""utilities"" includes regular utl. and water, trash pickup, and even sewer charges). I've even had my rent used against me in an argument! ""rich b*! we can't all pay $1200 for an apartment!"" Ugh! No one asks how much of my income goes toward rent (more than half!), or even considers that I have chosen to value my residence over things like a new car, or expensive clothes and haircuts. So thank you for touching on that. As a abnormally 'high rent' payer (in my area) myself, I appreciate you mentioning that some people are okay with paying high rent to live where they want and that's okay.  (*regarding the town's real estate issues, I live on the very edge of town and need to communte about 20 min to the center of things to work. A friend lives on the edge of the center of town and pays $1000 for 300 sq ft, and downtown I have no idea what rent is but  purchase-only is between 1-4mil for 300-1000 sq ft.

East Village places we could afford were too small for our family of 3 but quite cute for singles/roommates. I just didn’t like the trend of splitting these buildings up so that there’s no living room. So many 2br just had two bedrooms and a tiny kitchen and bath — no common space. We found much better deals with more space in Brooklyn.

So, if you stay there for years, which most New Yorkers do because you don't leave a good ""cheap"" apt in the city because rent prices across the city go up every year.

The thing that gives us a bad score is just our crazy high crime rate - which you cant really blame the country for - just need to blame the individuals. And its very concentrated in certain areas. But obviously we would like to be higher than #15.  However, we are #3 in the world in Entrepreneurship - so its arguably the greatest place in the world to start a business. I believe the American Dream is still alive and well, not only evidenced by that Entrepreneurship score - but also by the fact that the US is still far and wide the #1 place where people want to immigrate too.

@pppmac,"Finding apartment is always a nightmare for me in Hong Kong. I have since learned my lesson not to trust real estate agent or landlord. My most  unforgettable lesson is both the landlord and the agent team up,  lied  to me that another  person is interested with the same apartment, after I’ve paid them the deposit. Unless I come up with a higher offer, I have to forfeit my deposit and look for another apartment , they know time is not on my side. Lesson two is, it’s all right if you have a day job or not working from home. For the first week after moving in, I thought I’m  in a nut house, the endless renovations and  stomping on the floor day or night , piano  lessons, mah-jongg , just a name a few, maybe is my bad luck. These are just some tips for those who are thinking of moving  to Asia.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

If you get a small apt in a bad location it will spoil your experience.

For hard-working people who don't believe in displacing people in low-income circumstances who just happen to live in developing and gentrifying neighborhoods, this video is not for you. Girls like this are everything that is wrong with NY. She flew here when we grew here. Transplants with daddy's money are the worst part about NY. People like this call themself NYers, when in reality, you're probably from Ohio or Iowa and just hated your life wherever you were before NY and now you come here and turn up your nose to hard-working people who have no choice but to live in these neighborhoods you are gentrifying. GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACING PEOPLE IS WRONG. PEOPLE LIKE THIS ARE RUINING THE BEST PARTS OF NY.

Move to Long Island city in Queens, close to Manhattan, awesome night life and so many restaurants and bars. All of the other boroughs are so much cheaper and you usually get more space for your money. Especially if you work from home there is no need for you to pay 2000- 3000 dollars per month for a studio. Manhattan is nice and everything but if you don't work or go to school in Manhattan it's just a waste of your money. Trust me, been there done that. I suggest Queens or Brooklyn close to, but not next to the East river ( sandy storm bad experiences). For 2000- 3000 dollars you get usually a nice 2 or 3 bedroom apartment, and you are 10-15 minutes of an uber away from the neighborhoods you are looking in the video.",5년 전,5,

@bikeninja956,"If you're happy with this, SUPER glad for you, but I still can't believe people pay this much for such tiny, outdated, decrepit old places just to say they live in NYC....the bang for the buck here is a joke...... 2000$/month would get you a seriously nice, brand new luxury condo where I'm from, with massive amounts of space, 2-3 bedrooms, full sized living room and kitchen, spare parking place etc. and that's close to an urban center, and the bang for the buck just gets better the farther away you move from the urban centers. For most, the catch is that NYC can offer a lot of opportunity, but if you work on the internet (youtube) or remotely,  you could live ANYWHERE, so just go where you get the best bang for the buck. That's what I'm going to do. PS, I live in Quebec, our real-estate is so cheap compared to everywhere else in Canada. Beautifully contracted condo's everywhere, in some cases located in beautiful mountain scenery etc. Sure, it's Quebec, so the job/economic opportunities are not as great, but again, if you work remotely, who cares.",5년 전,0,

@SunKissedBlissed, @DreamCloud124  Well for now agents can still charge a broker's fee. A judge temporarily blocked that ruling from being in effect because of uproar from the Real Estate Board of NYC. They believe the Department of State is in violation of their rights essentially when they stated Landlords/Building Management have to pay the broker's fee. I believe what is illegal now is real estate asking for an extra month's rent deposit.  The June 2019 law was tweaked January of this year so it states we are NOT due for a refund of a broker's fee. The court hearing was to take place in March but due to Corona it has been pushed back to September. Best to just keep your paperwork on hand and see what happens in September.   I hope they rule on the tenants side because renting in NYC is crazy. I paid over 5k upfront for mine and that is not even the least amount people have paid upfront.,5년 전,0,

@youngaries8,"Native New Yorker. Many apartments do not have a broker fee, and the ones with fees can be negotiated. Oftentimes, the building or landlord is willing to cover the fee if you can prove you'll be a stable tenant. I wouldn't pay a fee unless there was a spectacular deal that the broker got for you. My 1st apartment in NY had a broker fee of 1 month, but the broker got us 3 months rent-free, which was a great deal. We also negotiated $1,000 off his fee when we told him we would apply same day. So have your financial affairs in order before you look.",5년 전,1,

@sonyppl," @collics1  Yeah that's true as well. Slavery is no less important than the stories of immigrants. Both have built this country of ours with sweat and tears. I love my country, but there is so much work to be done still. Let's stay optimistic though. :)",5년 전,16,
@collics1,Gio Kang The blood sweat and tears of the ones who were forced to build this country out weight those of people who came here of their own will. This country was built on the backs of African slaves. Their stories are not equal. Please don’t ever repeat “we are all immigrants” to an African American. It completely disregards their history within this country.,5년 전,22,

@NJois3,"collics1 Hi! While I agree with you to a certain extent, not every immigrant is here because they just decided to move to another country. Several of us escaped prosecution, poverty, and extensive corruption and we just could not stay in our own countries no matter how much we would’ve loved to. To come to a new country with no contacts, speak a completely different language, and work jobs we’ve never done before in our lives is definitely blood, sweat and tears. The country was built off of the blood of slaves, I will not discount that. Their stories and their marks on the country are and will always be very important. But that’s not to discredit the sweat and tears that immigrants have put in the country either. Minorities will always stick together :)",5년 전,21,

@AS-kf1ol,"As an actual  lifelong New Yorker, here are some tips. People from out of town get ripped off severely. ALWAYS negotiate rent prices. NEVER just pay what they tell you. A common negotiation is $25-$50 lower rent to sign for a 2 year lease. You can even use how quickly you're willing to sign a lease as leverage. I pay 1700, for an apartment 3x the size as Ashley's in Brooklyn. People moving here who just take whatever they're handed are the ones who make prices rise for all of us, just because they're constantly getting ripped off and landlords there are plenty of people who don't know any better who are willing to pay way more than they should. Another tip is checking the public records for buildings. You can google it and see all city documents including information about pests, and other issues in the building. Always use that to your advantage.",5년 전,3.7천,

I was referring to the cost of reality in general in New York. Just a few hours away you could rent a bigger and nicer apartment for $500. You’re really just paying for the name in New York.

@LayaRay,"Pepé I never said Ohio was a generic NYC. I was clearly referring to the apartments. I’ve seen apartments in the same exact shape in Ohio at a fraction of that price. That’s basically the definition of generic. The apartments themselves are exactly the same but one is so much more expensive because you are paying for the name of NYC. I understand there is a fashion culture in NYC but most people living there don’t care about the fashion industry at all so that isn’t the reason they are able to create this monopoly style pricing on apartments. If you actually do your research, the reason it’s so expensive is because of how over populated it is. There is so little space and options for living that it’s overpriced like it’s “limited edition”. Because of this, construction costs are also high in NYC. If a landlord is going to build a new apartment complex, they have to up charge rent as well to get their money worth. Everything else in the city is over priced just because it’s a popular city. It’s a tourist attraction. Those things are in connection with each other. Everything around is overpriced due to high rental/living costs. And let me just say, there is no way in hell I’m going to pay 4X the reasonable rent because people want to visit my city. Another reason it’s so expensive is because of the transportation systems in NYC are considered convenient but based on how dangerous those transportation systems actually are, I wouldn’t consider that very convenient.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

I saw the apartment I am currently in get listed, contacted the broker, set up a showing for the next day, and submitted my application and deposit within 30 minutes in a grocery store down the street I came to while exploring the neighborhood.",5년 전,12,

Can you spread the word to be more careful, please, try to avoid public transport as much as possible, stay away from people at least 1mt and wash everyone's hands more than usual? In Italy there are influencers like Chiara Ferragni that are doing exactly the same but we need to spread this information as fast as the virus itself. People need to be careful. In Italy we have free healthcare and this is so beautiful but the virus is infecting so many people that our doctors cannot cure everyone, they dont have enough room and breathing devices to help us all - thank you so much, hope you'll read this comment!",5년 전,0,

I live in France btw, so the rent prices in NY shook me hArRd but i loved the tips you gave, tbh they're not very useful from a french perspective (since the laws, fees etc aren't the same) but the few tips about what to be careful about in the building, the neighborhood and stuff like that are spot on, cause they're actually relatable no matter which city you live in.

Most people who live in NYC when they are in their 20s have to have a roomate, unless your parents make a crap ton of $$ and you get lucky.. then they end up moving out of the city when it's time to ""Settle down"" , either moving to another part of NY State or a cheaper state because it gets old after a while and it's unattainable, but the experience is fun and the job experience of working in NYC will always look impressive. My friend and I work corporate finance companies in the city as well, so it may depend on your field of work you are in, but again, you make more money in NYC, so it evens out.

In other places you can afford a house with a yard, off street parking, shop online, avoid the crowds, etc. When a mortgage is paid off, the payments end, but you get to stay, unlike rent anywhere.  Sure taxes, insurance, utilities still exist, but being your own landlord is a good part of financial planning. I make less than I could living in NY, but it buys a lot more. I live in a 5 bedroom 3 bath home with 20 X 30 shop, hot tub, fireplace, rose garden, etc. I have visited NYC, and could again, if I ever wanted to.

I understand why so many NYC people buy here, (which explains all the relentless Developers, and insane rents/prices in some areas) and pay whatever outrage the fast train is to commute back to the Big Apple.  Good luck to all that can afford/stand the relentless struggle to live where they want...I'm a visual artist, and I'm leaving Philly after three decades, before getting completely priced out, when my lease is up.",5년 전,0,

You should get a good air conditioner before summer comes :) + I’m not sure if the gas utility fee is included in your rent, but if so, it’s a good life hack to use your oven as a fireplace in winter! My apartment was freezing in Winter and the radiator wasn’t warm enough. (It was a center heating system and I think my landlord rarely turned it in to save the utility fee) Fortunately, my utility fee was included in my rent so I used to leave my oven - the exactly same one to yours - turned on for like an hour with its door opened. I was able to stay super warm without any extra charge. Just make sure to turn it off when you go to bed or go out.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@Nalanzazu,"I just found an apartment to rent in Vancouver!   Well actually we settled in a suburb about 20 minutes outside of the city but nestled right between mine and my fiance's workplaces. Vancouver has astronomical real estate prices but our rental market now seems ~affordable when compared to New York. My parents were horrified that we settled on a place thats $1720 CAD for about 715 sqft but thats what life is like on the rental market in 2020 baybeeeee. If we wanted to be closer to the city (or even just cross the river thats right outside our apartment) it would be at least $2500 CAD which is $1840 USD.     Even then, if we wanted to /buy/ an apartment, a mortgage would be about $2500/ month so like it doesn't make sense  to rent in the city if you can put together a down payment.

@sarahmanroe930,"Ashley, I just wanna let you know that I LITERALLY, LITERALLY screamed when you went into your new apartment and said ""I live in New York now"" because I'm so happy for you! I've been a fan since the moment I watched your second room makeover when you were still in college and had roommates and seeing you grow especially career wise has been amazing and INSPIRING! I'm a '97 kid and I'm nowhere as independent as you and sometimes this fact saddens me especially seeing you so independent, while I'm stuck but you honestly motivates me to work harder . So what I'm trying to say is that you've gone such a long way and please be easy on yourself, take breaks and stop thinking you're not doing enough girl! Look at me! I'm still living with my parents (please don't judge) and still trynna get a job and figuring what I really wanna do as my career, so girl give yourself some slack and more breaks! Good job Ashley! You're seriously so inspiring! Keep on doing you and be you! Good luck and may life in New York be even more fun~! <3",5년 전,325,

Plus they want to see that you have the same amount if not more in your savings account to prove that you can actually afford the rent and won't default. Basically if you aren't making more than $70,000 a year they kind of look at you and go ""uh we'll get back to you"" and never do.

Moving out is almost not possible for anyone of my friends money wise (we all do an apprenticeship or go to university in the city, so probably no need to move out cause everything is nearby). But I wanted to move out so bad, and I was apartment hunting for a year with my boyfriend. And last October we moved in in our 750 square feet 3 bedroom apart and. And guess what. Rent is 650 €. We were so surprised about that price. And no nothing is wrong with this apartment. The landlord is just an old lady who never changes her apartment prices.

@phillyroots702,"To Start am here spending time showing love and support for  Ashley an incredible YouTuber! ======================== Hello If you can see this. I have experienced the horrors  of YT's algorithm. Am sure  this has happened to many on YT. 》Comments are ignored because the algorithm autos the comments as spam and sends  them to Likely Spam and will  never be seen in the comments sections until the video publishers approves comments are not spam. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& 》I had comments stay in  the comments sections (must  of been only publisher and  myself can see them) for over a year: without 1 like  or 1 unlike and not 1 reply. 》》In the meantime YT's algorithm gets many other  comments thousands of likes.  =======================  I know that the cost of living in  New York City is outrageous and unaffordable to most  people but apparently Ashley  is making a lot of money on  YT because of this channel (her videos are monetized.)  Apparently she can afford it.  &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& I did not even view this video  and I'm leaving a comment! I'm basing this comment on  the few videos I've seen and part of the videos I've seen on this channel bestdressed.  The very first video I viewed  on this channel was when I  found Ashley: was the great  idea when she took herself out on a date! That video is fascinating and incredible!!!  And to me Ashley is the real  deal when it comes to being  genuine. She is a fast talker  but think that's because she's  a multi-tasking mile-a-minute person and I can relate to her  that we do our best with little  time left to finish (backed up  to the wall) very last minute  to get things done.  Ashley in videos I seen is TMI  short for a (too much info)   and throws the f-bomb but in  this day and age it's being  used in many songs so it's  being more acceptable. But I  learned many years ago that  it's better to look at the big picture.   》So now I will focus on the  ""Incredible Ashley"" she done  things at her young age that  many people have never done  in their entire lifetimes.  Ashley is a super duper great  YouTuber who has lost many  hours of sleep dedicating her  time getting videos done. Her  Renovations in the LA APT  has been incredible to the  point that she had to put the apartment back the way it was  before she moved in this  woman is Superwoman! &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& If I was the landlord of the LA APT I would really  appreciate it that Ashley  made the apartment nicer then before she moved in.  All because Ash wanted to  move out to New York City.  Love her incredible detailed  information for each video. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Ashley is an incredibly self- taught person when it comes  to innovations and goes to  hardware stores to get  everything needed for the  renovating. She is as good in innovations as any pro!!!  》I know this comment is lengthy and I can keep going  on and on complimenting  Ashley but the people that are watching her videos know  how incredibly talented she is.  If I was magic I would of viewed all her videos already! I'm basing  my comments on the few videos I've seen and part of the videos I've seen.  My prediction is this comment will be auto selected by YT's algorithm and get ignored. But if I'm wrong to those that agree with me about Ashley give this comment a thumbs up. Nice comments are welcome and uncalled for one's will be reported as harassment or bullying.  For stress reduction visit my channel and view any of my dancing videos!  - Dancing Louie",5년 전(수정됨),0,

As someone who grew up here, I think the fact that you're moving to literally the most expensive district in the entire 5 boroughs says something about what your income is, NOT what NYC renting is like. I live in a 2 bedroom apartment (with a roommate! which is what many people do to get more space!) priced at $2100 for 1350 sq ft that is 20 minutes from manhattan. The fact that someone so young is moving downtown is ridiculous. Young people live in brooklyn. Ashley will most likely end up commuting out TO BROOKLYN to interact with others. Whereas she could have found a much larger apartment in Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Bushwick, or Park Slope for a much better price. She also could have moved to Manhattan north of 96th street, and gotten a great price. Yes, NY is expensive. But Ashley did everything in her power to make it as expensive as possible.",5년 전,1,

Who knows, when her lease is up she might be like everyone who is also in a creative field in New York but lives in Brooklyn instead and gets twice the space and wonders why the hell you even suffered the first year anyways lol.

Also, make sure you don't live in an old building where you can hear all your neighbors.  If you hear your neighbors walking around upstairs, walk out of there.  Good luck with that.

@sabinegilson257,"Informative video, but, I know I am swimming up-tide here, but is the vulgar swearing really necessary?  I don't understand how young women today believe that what we might have loosely called ""gutter talk"" ""empowers"" or makes them feel ""authentic"".  Young ladies should not kid themselves and think that anyone who chooses to use that kind of language, regardless of gender, is cool.  Actually those who speak in that manner demean themselves.  It's an unforced error.  The paradox with young people today is that they are so sensitive about their own feelings and needs, yet are often quite abrasive and insensitive when dealing with others.  Something to think about, I hope.  You are a bright woman.  Perhaps you could think about that, and do a video about it?  Also, just wondering if you talk like that around your parents, and if not, why not?  That might be a good place to start thinking...xoxo  Welcome to NYC!",5년 전,0,

@mioing,"It’s 4.30 am and I’ll watch the video later after I go to sleep  and I wake up xD came to make a quick comment CUZ I NEED SOME ADVICE   So I had been planning to move to a rented apartment on March and I am currently staying in a paying guest (PG). So i contacted my owner to let him know that I’ll be leaving soon and if he could tell me how much was my security deposit amount (cuz I forgot kskskskssk) and he was like no! The security deposit money is only available after 11 months of stay and you should inform me on the 1st if you are going to leave. “Please pay the rent. Thank you.” So now I’m like??? Do I shift in March only or do I wait out a few months more? If I leave on March itself, I will not get my security deposit money and I will have to pay the rent for this month too. Otherwise I was planning to pay this month’s rent from my security deposit. It has been 8 months since I’ve stayed there (including March). But I recently took up a part tome work, so I if I wait out a few months more, I could have more money and can shift with asking minimum from my parents. But I have really been wanting to move soon. We do not get food in PG and I am tired of eating out. I could buy the utensils and cook at pg too, but somehow I had already made up my mind that I will do that after I shift to my own place 😭 I’ve been wanting my own space.   Ok that’s it.

@ncoll36,"It amazes me how different the rental system is in the US. Here in Australia it's so different. First of all, weekly rent, not monthly. Brokers fee, why would the tenant pay that? The landlord is the one hiring the services of the real estate to rent out their property, for them to make money.   Then the application process is a little different. The documents you provide are pretty much the same, but I've never heard of the 40x income amount. There is no application fee, most of the applications are done online. The security deposit (called bond here) is 4 weeks worth of rent and paid only once accepted.   Depending on the real estate you apply with, applications can take a couple of days or even a week to process. Usually multiple applicants have applied, they are short listed by the real estate and passed on to the landlord for them to choose. None of this whole apartment taken before even the open inspection has ended.    Pretty interesting to see your experiences on the process.",5년 전,0,

@mychaela9603,"in dublin ireland, average rent for a 37m² (400ft²) 1 bedroom apartment is €2,044 ($2,319.87). I always hear people say that NYC rent is insanely expensive, but I didnt know it cost a similar amount as living in dublin. most people from around Ireland end up having to travel for hours to go to their college classes because they cant afford to live in dubli. if I'm completely honest I thought it would cost more to live in NYC. I thought I should share this cause homelessness rates in ireland are continuously rising and the rent prices are insane compared to what the average yearly salary (without tax) of a 21 year old in ireland is about €24,000 ($27,246.12).",5년 전,0,

@BeeBee-gi2zr,It's bizarre to think that 'Friends' created this impression that living in NY consisted of big loft apartments when in reality most of them by the looks of it are beyond small and hugely expensive. I've only visited NY once and booked a room in a large hotel across the road from Madison Square Garden.... I booked months in advance and payed a fair price and on the website the room looked good but they gave me a dingy small room at the back of the hotel.. The electrics didn't even work properly!  It definitely didn't leave a good impression,5년 전,2,

@AKoz85,"Yes! The windows! I never thought about what way my windows faced either. It was just never a priority. I had more important concerns like cost and square footage and neighborhood. But I have the opposite problem, I work nights and sleep in the day. So having windows that face east or west was just hell. Half the day was WAY too bright and WAY too hot in the summer. I got blackout curtains etc but if I accidentally fell asleep before setting everything up I had a horrible wake up call a few hours later that ruined my day. Still, I just accepted it. Then I moved into my new place and by accident got a north facing window with natural insulation from the brick walls I choose for ascetic.  I couldn't be happier, it makes SUCH a difference. The light is mild, even, and the same all day, and the temp doesn't fluctuate much (I live in LA). So I agree, if you have a choice, everyone should think about their lifestyle and needs when it comes to light.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@Kimmymora95,"New Yorker here 👋🏾 A lot of people are decrying the prices of rent in NYC. You guys have to understand that 1. You are paying a premium to live in one of the most dynamic cities in the world. Seriously, we have some of the best food, entertainment, shopping, and OPPORTUNITIES (it’s the financial center of the country so a lot of the best jobs and jobs that pay well are here). Our subway system, dirty as it is, is the best in the country by far in terms of availability (24 hours) and service (hundreds of stops and routes). You get to meet people from all over the world with cool stories and backgrounds. Your friend group will look like the United Nations because NY is SO diverse. I could go on and on. Point is, NY is something special and what you get in return is totally worth it if you can afford it. 2. Rent in the outer boroughs and in Harlem/Bronx are much much cheaper. Where I’m from in Queens, a 1 bed is $1500. You can get a 2 bed, 2 bath in Brooklyn with a balcony or a yard for like $3500. I know because I’m moving back after going to law school and am looking for apartments now. These are current prices. I’ve lived in 3 countries and St. Louis, have travelled to almost 20 countries and about ten states. I can tell you there’s no place like NEW YORK ! Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk 😘",5년 전,2,

@EmmaAppleBerry,It scares me that a fairly medium size master bedroom here in australia is bigger than someones entire home in nyc.   Like what. How. That should be illegal.   God i didnt think i was claustrophobic but growing up on a huuuuuge island with little people even though it still feels like too many and having fairly large living spaces my entire life regardless of what type of building i lived in and if it was owned or rented makes me realise im lucky to live here even if it is expensive af compared to the rest of the world the quality of life is better because we dont have a f tonne of people and we have large houses with backyards etc. Granted thats going downhill fast anywhere near cities or suburbia youll find it in country towns if youre lucky but its becoming harder to find good land let alone good houses in decent neighbourhoods. I feel like the government at birth should gift you an acre of land thats yours til death andnit can either be transferred to a new addition in your descendants or passed to freeholding and given to another whatever it may be itd solve homelessness if everyone outright had enough land to live on grow food on keep their belongings on amd do what they pleased with it. Everyone has the right to shelter and stability and security of a place thats theirs and cant be taken.,5년 전,0,

The broker represents you in the transaction (sometimes they also represent the landlord as a dual agent); the broker facilitates the deal. Can you imagine having to contact every landlord directly yourself to arrange to tour 10 different apartments, and then negotiate directly with the landlord who naturally has his/her own interests before yours?

Places that have only north facing windows can only be commercial or ""other"" use (e.g. store or a hotel). Residential apartments must have direct sunlight (there's a set minimum amount of minutes). There are also other requirements, such as green spaces, playgrounds for kids, etc. There's been a wave of cheaper ""apartments"" to buy recently, where people later found out that they did not in fact had  a residential status, which lead to a lot of issues later (e.g. you cannot declare your place of residence there).",5년 전,0,

@Kikiforfree,Watching this while looking for a place in Philly. Sooo many similarities. You would think it would be a piece of cake here. Units are popping up and gone within two days. We have old buildings that have been renovated but are managed by companies that are completely absent. The story with the older woman popping up to warn you was all too familiar. I’ve seen 10 places already. This is probably because I’m looking in younger/ popular areas around the city. But congrats! The new place looks amazing!

Your videos are good. even the thumbnails are on point. however, the only thing that I notice (I watch your ""Your beingproductive in a winter break vlog"") is that when your walking the video shakes so much that it makes me a lil bit dizzy (just a lil bit dont worry) but overall your videos are good, even the background music is good. Keep up the good work and goodluck to your youtube career 😊. I subscribed",5년 전,1,
@tamaram," @kckim4597  Thank you so much!😍💘💘💘 I think the reason it shakes is cause I used my phone. For filming at home I always use my camera, but it's a DSLR and not a vlogging one, so it is kinda hard to carry it around.

@freohr789," @lacitygirl0146  while imo they could have worded it less accusationally, they're not wrong. If people keep bugging her to show the outdoors to her apartment, she can just ignore them because safety is more important than peer pressure. I know when Jenna Marbles moved to her new home, she decided to be very careful of showing off her front yard and neighborhood (she even walks her dogs in a different neighborhood) to try to avoid stalkers showing up to her home.   The problem with creeps is that not every creep's parent will control them (or even know that they are a creep) and some creeps do get away with doing creepy things. Just because they shouldn't doesn't mean they won't. It's because of that that celebrities have to take extra measures to stay safe.   It's sad that it has to be this way, but unfortunately that's just the world we live in. We can't leave our heads in the clouds otherwise that distracts us from the reality that we have to work with.",5년 전(수정됨),11,
@freohr789,"@Sweet V.

@mrvgstyle2442," @octaviahelena  , If you watch her California videos, she picked up that habit there, and when she had work to be done in her apartment she said she would get help from whoever she was ""f-ing"" at the time.  I think that's sad that saying something like that shows no respect for the person that's of help to you.  She picked up some really bad habits in Los Angeles.  She needs to let that go because if she really wants to advance herself as a person professionally, you speak intelligently, leaving the profanities behind.  I've hired people for a long time and collaborated with people as well.  I wouldn't want to do business with someone whose vocabulary is limited to the ""f"" word.  I'm a mature professional.  In other words, a decision maker who has been a professional manager for decades.  To someone like me, it leaves a sad impression of an otherwise intelligent person, than a bad impression because it puts Ashley on the same level as someone who hasn't received a higher education, much less someone who didn't appreciate the efforts of the people who encouraged it.",5년 전,1,
@phillyroots702,"To Start am here spending time showing love and support for  Ashley an incredible YouTuber! ======================== Hello If you can see this. I have experienced the horrors  of YT's algorithm. Am sure  this has happened to many on YT. 》Comments are ignored because the algorithm autos the comments as spam and sends  them to Likely Spam and will  never be seen in the comments sections until the video publishers approves comments are not spam. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& 》I had comments stay in  the comments sections (must  of been only publisher and  myself can see them) for over a year: without 1 like  or 1 unlike and not 1 reply. 》》In the meantime YT's algorithm gets many other  comments thousands of likes.  =======================  I know that the cost of living in  New York City is outrageous and unaffordable to most  people but apparently Ashley  is making a lot of money on  YT because of this channel (her videos are monetized.)  Apparently she can afford it.  &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& I did not even view this video  and I'm leaving a comment! I'm basing this comment on  the few videos I've seen and part of the videos I've seen on this channel bestdressed.  The very first video I viewed  on this channel was when I  found Ashley: was the great  idea when she took herself out on a date! That video is fascinating and incredible!!!  And to me Ashley is the real  deal when it comes to being  genuine. She is a fast talker  but think that's because she's  a multi-tasking mile-a-minute person and I can relate to her  that we do our best with little  time left to finish (backed up  to the wall) very last minute  to get things done.  Ashley in videos I seen is TMI  short for a (too much info)   and throws the f-bomb but in  this day and age it's being  used in many songs so it's  being more acceptable. But I  learned many years ago that  it's better to look at the big picture.   》So now I will focus on the  ""Incredible Ashley"" she done  things at her young age that  many people have never done  in their entire lifetimes.  Ashley is a super duper great  YouTuber who has lost many  hours of sleep dedicating her  time getting videos done. Her  Renovations in the LA APT  has been incredible to the  point that she had to put the apartment back the way it was  before she moved in this  woman is Superwoman! &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& If I was the landlord of the LA APT I would really  appreciate it that Ashley  made the apartment nicer then before she moved in.  All because Ash wanted to  move out to New York City.  Love her incredible detailed  information for each video. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Ashley is an incredibly self- taught person when it comes  to innovations and goes to  hardware stores to get  everything needed for the  renovating. She is as good in innovations as any pro!!!  》I know this comment is lengthy and I can keep going  on and on complimenting  Ashley but the people that are watching her videos know  how incredibly talented she is.  If I was magic I would of viewed all her videos already! I'm basing  my comments on the few videos I've seen and part of the videos I've seen.  My prediction is this comment will be auto selected by YT's algorithm and get ignored. But if I'm wrong to those that agree with me about Ashley give this comment a thumbs up. Nice comments are welcome and uncalled for one's will be reported as harassment or bullying.  For stress reduction visit my channel and view any of my dancing videos!  - Dancing Louie",5년 전,0,
