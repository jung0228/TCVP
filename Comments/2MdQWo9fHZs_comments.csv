I will not go back to any other phone until everyone else gets their act together. I go from a 30% charge to 100% in about a half hour. I also charge my phone every other day instead of twice a day. It's crazy fast and no hiccups when loading or swiping. On top of that I have 512gb storage which is a huge increase from phones I've had before. Best thing out of all of that is I got mine for $400. It's fucking crazy how good the phone I got is for the price I paid.,3시간 전,0,

@WhiteEuphoria74,"A couple of years ago OnePlus and Xiaomi fucked up big time and decided to totally ruin the do not disturb feature. They have removed the ability to very quickly set the time you don't want to be disturbed.  Very useful when you're in a meeting or want to take a nap. Instead, OnePlus only has the option to schedule the time you don't want to be disturbed in a complicated way. What did OnePlus think? It's like going back 20 years in software development.  I don't know how it works in OnePlus 15 but my wife had OnePlus Nord CE and in the beginning the do not disturb was working as it should according to Google standards but suddenly OnePlus decided to make it a disaster with an update. Why does OnePlus boast about the vaper chamber when they can't even fix do not disturb? Marquez you should mention this in your videos!",2일 전,1,

@iMind-Juris,"1:29 Wait that's me :D  Edit: hold on, I actually love phones that don't sell me a camera. It's become my biggest frustration with the current market when people pretend they're buying a $1,000 camera when it should be a $1,000 *phone*. I take like 5 pictures a year, maybe, and all the subjects are entirely mundane in nature (no need for flashy features). That being said, it's probable a lot of money was still spent on this near-useless aspect of the phone, and it just ended up being mediocre (which wouldn't be as cool as them just realizing cameras are the last thing to worry about in a phone for people who aren't obsessed with social media). But maybe the lack of a partnership indicates they realized they should put that money elsewhere",2일 전(수정됨),0,

All of these phones are superb and atleast for me 6T was peak imo before they bungled up the software. In OnePlus phones everything runs super smooth, cameras are mediocre, but luckily I can edit them to my heart's content. In these phones you see the age only in the battery after a while. Back when I rooted the 6T with Lineage OS it was such a monster of a phone. Today there's no incentive of rooting one's phone because performance and battery are already peak. But still...the 15 is not enough of an upgrade from my 11 if I come to think of it. Tbh the design of 15 is absolutely bland and generic, makes it look like Nord and I hate it.  OnePlus flagship phones are like old refrigerators: they are robust and you needn't upgrade them because they do their job marvelously. Oneplus keeps users loyal by keeping a very attractive design and the specs top notch at a decent price, making it an all rounder and you'll never need anything else. Oneplus 12 had the best ever design on a OnePlus phone. I'll probably upgrade when OnePlus comes up with a better design lol.",2일 전,0,

I have quite a few friends claiming that higher FPS are useful and you can feel the difference - but when I switched the game to 60 fps max and didn't tell him he explained me how fluid the game was compared to low frame rates... they usually don't realize it and only when pointing out it's 60 FPS they get confused... it's a placebo effect at best... why 60 though? because a) people are different and b) there are always minor fluctuations in FPS... the biggest issue is though when the FPS drop below our fluid received threshold...,3일 전(수정됨),0,

Initial thoughts: glad they ditched the bulky camera island and OP13's weird colours, but the phone's edges feel kinda awkward to hold 😐. Could've spent more time perfecting the design, ya know? 🤔  Display's a letdown, they. Swapped 2K for...this? Feels like a mid-range phone (<half the price!) 😬. 144Hz refresh with 2K would've been ideal. Most people aren't gamers, so daily use display should've been prioritised 🤷‍♂️.  Camera? Not flagship material, for sure 😅.  Battery's the wildcard - silicon carbon's gotta prove itself! 🤑  Honestly, price needs to drop 40% for me to consider upgrading 🤯.

It's basically just your choice to choose among this or xiaomi. There's options like poco and iQ00 and other realme etc phones if you want performance on budget ( even Redmagic is expensive ) Every phone has just something it's good at and something it's not good at .

The jump from 8 gen3 to Elite was much higher 4nm to 3nm (wait for this Guys Focus on this). OP 15 is good, it's battery maybe much  more good but anything else seems waste, less resolution, NO Hasslebled, less powerful camera sensors, smaller vibration motor. Don't you say about refresh rate now, its 120Hz it's 165 when it wants to be. I gave my brother a OP13 and I have used it, now it has Oxygen OS16. And at the end I don't know about you the biggest downgrade for me was RAM, I mean we got 24GB in 1 TB variant.  This was the reason my brother didn't buy S25 Ultra because it came with 16GB in THAT PRICE.:face-fuchsia-wide-eyes: I mean we got 24GB in almost the half price of S25 Ultra. The people who bought 1TB S25 Ultra are dum.. No matter what anyone says what benchmark says, the more the storage ( either its RAM or ROM ), the better, ALWAYS. Guys, just wait along use wat you have tell the companies, it's not enough. Tell them to work hard. Don't get excited by these small marketing gimmicks and chocolates these companies throw at you.

@usernamehasbeenchanged,"1- Camera's are performing a bit better than Oneplus13 even with the downgraded hardware. 2- Processor chip is stronger now than before 3- Its back has extraordinary durability, only a diamond can put a scratch on it, moreover it is ip66/68/69/69k rated  now. 4- It has additional wifi chip in it, you won't drop signals and consistency will remain unlike other flagships. 5- It has newer touch sampling chip as well which makes user experience great and it matters for people who play games on mobile phones. 6- It has 165 hz now and it matters for gamers. However it gets activated only during gaming. During normal use, it switches between 1 and 120 only not 30,60,90 etc so yeah it makes user experience good. 7- Oxygen OS 16 is highly customizable and really good to use and this mindspace thing is actually nice and useful. Yeah, im a bit disappointed too because of camera's, it should be comparable to other flagships but it is not. Oneplus lags behind in camera but ig since they're associated with OPPO so their focus is now on performance/user experience side, while OPPO's focus is on camera and other stuff too like other flagships. Oneplus 15 Camera's are still good enough for daily use tbh but not at the level of other top flagships. If you want really good user experience, performance, customization, massive battery and somewhat above average camera then this is for you. If you want true high end camera's then but can compromise on some other things then you can for other brands. OxygenOS is really fun to use and remember, Iphone and samsung and pixel too still doesn't offer ip69 rating and Iphone's this year build is technically trash, can be easily scratched. Samsung is good and will always be a decent choice, pixel is good but trash at the same time since it lacks behind in literally every department except the cameras and OS. So yeah, think what you actually want from a cell phone and choose accordingly.  Correct me if I am wrong and missed something except the 1.5k resolution which really doesn't make much difference.",4일 전(수정됨),0,

@JLudwig06,What's odd about the 4 thing is that the phone ACTUALLY is #14. So that would make it unlucky no matter what. Unless they skipped 4 as well then this would truly be #13. So #16 is the real unlucky one. 🤯Maybe this is a good buy then. Next model not so much.,4일 전,0,

@techstar796,"I feel like Oppo and OnePlus are now trying to separate their identities. Oppo is becoming more camera centric 📸 and OnePlus is moving towards a gaming centric direction 🎮. But this is not the OnePlus we all knew before. OnePlus used to be the real flagship killer, the brand people trusted when there weren’t strong competitors between Samsung and Apple. It created a huge impact in smartphone history.  Now I’m honestly disappointed with the direction OnePlus is taking. Gaming is not the main priority for everyone. If they really wanted to target gamers, they could have done it under the Nord series with something like a Nord GT. They could have still kept the main OnePlus lineup as the flagship killer it once was.  Since the UI is almost the same as Oppo with only small differences, many people will naturally shift to Oppo. And if someone wants the best camera performance with this UI, the Oppo Find X9 Ultra or Pro would be the best choice 📷🔥. I think Oppo will now get the brand value that OnePlus once enjoyed.  I really appreciate Vivo and iQOO for what they are doing 🙌. They even moved from Funtouch OS to Origin OS, and now people will finally trust them more in terms of software. Let’s see what happens, but I don’t think OnePlus will capture much of the market anymore except among gamers.  Vivo will probably do much better because of this shift from OnePlus. And even the Oppo Find X series, which never got enough attention before, will now start getting the recognition it deserves ⭐.  This is my point based on my knowledge, and I genuinely feel this is what’s going to happen.",4일 전,6,

@RealTimeStrategy-Games,"I won't call them gamer centric but it's kind of right BBK has Realme and IQ00 to focus on that part. Altho I think RealMe focus on selfie sometimes at some price point. It's true that One plus is always known for performance which is why I use to be a massive fan . Still good , even after OS merge and many "" many "" changes..  Poco and Infinix and some some are there with performance and bang for buck. As for competitors I miss huawei. They're not my cup of tea but without them there is less competition . Even if I would or not buy huawei , their presence would matter because even if small competition is better than nothing. So that apple and samsung can't always be comfortable at their old strategy. Infinix (Transsion holding ) and Xiaomi are the only 2 brands that offer a cheap and good phone for many price point if you don't care a lot about photos or gaming, Just cookie cutter good specs for price. Tolerable camera at a price point and slightly more performance or storage/ram than other company. Samsung software is still best for android.",3일 전,0,
@techstar796,"​ @RealTimeStrategy-Games Hi, I agree with you on many things. But I still feel Xiaomi, once the true budget king, has completely lost that crown. Now they are fully focused on the flagship segment and ignoring their budget users. Honestly, I do not recommend Xiaomi in the budget range anymore. I prefer recommending Infinix or even iQOO because they offer much better value for money. Realme is still decent to some extent. Xiaomi is no longer the budget king. 😕  Parent companies always keep their brands separated. Oppo and Vivo are under BBK, but their user interface and strategies are completely different. Vivo already has the iQOO series for gamers and tech-focused users. Realme, in the last few years, has clearly positioned the GT series for performance lovers and gamers. So when these two gaming-focused lineups already exist, there is no need for OnePlus to shift in the same direction. 🤷‍♂️  OnePlus should have remained a brand-value smartphone series. Once upon a time, OnePlus was known for its camera quality and even surpassed Samsung in some models. They could have continued focusing on the camera and maintained that identity. Instead, they shifted towards gaming and performance, a space already covered by iQOO and Realme. This is exactly where my disappointment comes from. 😔  The original vision of OnePlus was to offer the best all-round experience in display, camera, performance, build quality, speakers and haptics at a reasonable flagship price. That vision deserved appreciation. But now, with this strategy change, they are losing the uniqueness that made people love them. ✨  Coming to Huawei, it was one of my favourite brands. If it was not for US sanctions, Huawei would have become the number one smartphone brand in the world. I used Huawei flagships when they had Android and they were absolute beasts. Even though I had a more expensive phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in 2015, the Huawei phone I used at that time had better tuning and better camera performance. I still remember how it even surpassed the iPhone 8 when it launched. Huawei was on another level. 🔥  Honor is doing great now, but they need to expand globally. They make excellent smartphones, but availability in my country is the problem. I have to depend on places like UAE or Kuwait to get their devices. And yes, Honor sometimes has software glitches and camera inconsistencies. If they fix those and improve their optimization, Honor can truly become the next Huawei. 🤞✨  Overall, I am really disappointed with how OnePlus has shifted its strategy. 💔",3일 전,1,

Suppose they create a smartphone that becomes something like an electronic copy of its owner, interacting with the person on a completely different level, perhaps even integrating directly into memory and consciousness—something like that. Meanwhile, the race for better photo and video quality and faster processors only makes devices more expensive, and all those features quickly lose their novelty.",4일 전,0,

Manufacturers should adopt liquid cooling like Nubia this year because this is the only way for this new chipset to be used at maximum capacity when needed without friying your hands. So if you are a heavy game this phone is garbage. Otherwise is a good phone with a nice price and specs.,4일 전,0,

@SanderCokart,"I am also still using an 8T but I kinda wanna upgrade. But the cameras don't seem like that much of an upgrade I mean yes the telephoto and the ultra wide are higher resolution than on the 8T but is it really that much different? I feel like Android has been stuck in this very irregular computational photography and then any of a really good camera app. I think these companies have just been swapping out sensors but the software has mostly stayed similar. I do love the bypass charging though this will definitely make my phone last way longer so maybe the next Oneplus I'll buy is the Oneplus 25. What I really wanted was for the camera, even if the quality was lower to be more consistent But from all the footage that I looked at the footage seemed very shaky at best when it comes to video. I also really would have liked a macro mode that was as good as the Oneplus 8. Sadly no such phone has been made since a large mega pixel sensor with capability to do macrophotography. Any photos that are shot on the newer phones simply used a telephoto and you need to crop in to make it look like a micro while it really is not.   Another thing I feel like I'm really missing out on is desktop mode. It's coming it's in beta but still. The number one problem I do have though is cases since dbrand no longer makes them for oneplus. My best bet will be a spigen or something but unknown when it will come out if at all. Now with dbrand Only supporting Google Samsung and Apple for cases it makes it really difficult. Especially because the Samsung phones just horrible charging even if the S26 Ultra is going to get 60 Watt charging It is also going to be more expensive for the 512GB or 1TB version. And you must have the Ultra then because it is the only one with the Snapdragon chip, all the other ones get an Exynos. iPhones keep having the best camera but the worst charging and the worst software experience across the board.",4일 전,1,

Such a great premium phone it was.   After launching oneplus 6 with glass balcks, curves, and the quality premiumness just dropped. Untill oneplus 9 pro came out. I bouth the 6, 6T, 7T, 9 pro and 11.

I am not a big fan of the more rounded design and the OP15 is way better in that regard imo. It is a big phone to me as I was a fan of the iPhone mini series, but the battery life is just awesome!! I sometimes get a couple of glitches that I didn't have when using iPhone, and I don't know if these are preventable, since I am not a long time android user. One thing that does bother me is that there is no way to mute notifications whilst still being able to get phonecalls through. That is crazy in my opinion?! If anyone knows a fix for that I'd love to hear, because it is not obvious to me at all. The camera seems more realistic than that of apple, but the results are still not as pretty as the pictures I took on iPhones. If I was very good with the camera and it's settings I could probably still get anything to look great, but unfortunately I am not that experienced. The quality for pictures from very far away is insane too! Even though it uses some AI upscaling that doesn't really bother me.

Was broken for 6 months. I love the idea of OnePlus but it's always such a risk. Also the one I had before, the 9, died permanently from being dropped in the ocean in 3 inches of water by my kid for 3 seconds and was supposed to be waterproof. And the 7 pro, with pop up camera, the pop up camera motor failed after 6 months. I loved the 7 pro otherwise and the 8 pro t and the 9 was great until it got wet for a few seconds, but then the other stuff like the ten getting no camera driver when they ended oxygen os. I'm just scared something will go wrong out of nowhere",5일 전(수정됨),1,
@MissMoffet19,I know a lot of people accuse Marques of being biased but it’s hard not to be suspicious when he just states that the cameras are bad and shows just a few photos that look like they were taken with an iPhone (I’m watching the video on a 65-inch 4K screen) and we’re just supposed to take his word for it that they're bad. So much work goes into these videos on that channel yet they don’t have time to back up their claims with a proper side by side comparison against another phone with what they consider a better camera? Prove your points because right now the only company that gets a thumbs-up in basically every category is Apple while everyone else gets constant criticism. And just to be clear I use an iPhone myself and I like it but this video is just suspicious because everyone knows the camera is a dealbreaker for many people so dropping a bomb like that at the end of an otherwise positive review as if it’s nothing feels shady.,5일 전,0,

@mikethekingj75,​ @peedddro23 from what I heard they wanted to go more natural looking photos. Not all that fake looking photos like Samsung. I feel people that whining about it are the ones that need to come back to reality with the natural tone. Its like people choosing cool over warm which warm is the natural color. Of course its their choice,5일 전,4,
@U.S.A.,"I use to take 3D photos whenever I can (with a regular phone it's only possible of still objects) and because of this deep depth of field is very important for me, and it's very annoying that most people say that a bigger camera sensor is better, but no, a bigger sensor is more light sensitive, but it comes with drawbacks, the depth of field gets shallower and almost all new flagship phone's camera has curved focal plane, which is a huge issue if you want to take 3D images or if you want to take a 2D close-up image of a flat surface, because in the latter scenario only the middle of the image will be in focus. (I've checked my iPhone 4S and its camera has flat focal plane as it should be, so it's possible to make such a camera, but that eighter would have way less light sensitivity or it would be very thick.)  So there is no better or worse phone camera, all they can do is change some specs and then the camera will be better in some scenarios but worse in others, the only way to actually make a better camera is to invent a new type of sensor which would be more light sensitive with the same sensor area. I also think that phone manufacturers eighter should have stopped at half inch sensors or if they want to go beyond that, then they must add physical variable aperture to the camera, releasing phones with 1 inch sensors and fixed aperture is one of the stupidest thing I've ever seen.",5일 전,3,

I chose OnePlus 11 as it offered pretty much top performance among Android phones in all areas at ~60% of the price of a top Samsung at the time.

And get rid of hole punch and apples ugly ass island taking up valuable screen area.  Just put a small screen on the back for selfies and video calls with the main good camera.

Previously they've been basically oppo phones with a different camera and body. now all share a similar design, yet now Oneplus no longer sharing the hasselblad tuning oppo still has, and still with bad cameras. hell the oneplus open was an exact copy of the oppo find n3 fold. At this point, the only reason Oneplus still exist is because it's the only way they can sell in the us, and without pressure from other chinese brands, they've become stagnant in the camera department.

In all my years of owning a smartphone from HTC right up to Xiaomi, not once have I ever shared a photo and had someone comment on the quality or lack of quality of the image. I think tech reviewers need to get back to basics when it comes to things like this, digital media is everywhere, captured all the time throughout our lives. Photos are not what they once were, we no longer take a photo to capture a moment in time and keep it as part of a family history. These days we mostly snap a pic of a moment just to share socially. Think about how often you go back over the thousands of photos you took ten years ago and sit and reminisce about times gone by.",5일 전,11,

@zahidshabir4038,The cameras and screen resolution let it down but I guess there needs to be some sort of trade off if you want to upgrade the storage and RAM and a larger batter and add a dedicated Wi-Fi chip and if you want a higher refresh rate screen you got to compromise on the resolution maybe the OnePlus 16 will be for me and hopefully EVERY SINGLE feature on that phone is BETTER than the OnePlus 13 and I too miss the alert slider knowing that I had muted my phone or unmuted without pulling it out of my pocket to see the screen because even though you can use a button to mute without seeing the screen you cannot tell whether your phone is or is not muted without looking at the screen so I cannot just reach in to my pocket and press the button hoping to mute my phone especially if it probably already was muted because i accidentally pressed it whilst it was in my pants muting it already and then I ended up unmuting it when I intended to mute it,5일 전,0,

I think people are getting way way too obsessed over cameras and their marketing points in general, but especially when 99.9% of the shots and videos will be amateur poorly framed ones and then they'll just be crushed down in bitrate and resolution on instagram or SMS. It just all seems about being sold on having the ""best camera"" yet it's almost entirely for people who don't make any real use of it anyway and very often don't even know what they're doing with one that is very good",5일 전(수정됨),1,

So much that I compared some shots I did on concerts with my Oneplus 5 and the 9 Pro, and the 5 was significantly better although it has nothing to do with hasselblad, has only 2 cameras and is old... I would say that no matter what the optics and sensors are, the software is just dogshit and they want to do too much stuff and it just break things. I feel like the phone cameras peaked around 2018-19 and from then it's going downhill with every phone, not only oneplus.  I watch every year what they release, but to be honest I still have a few complaints about this 9 Pro, but what came after ohboi... Not a single one got me hooked that I should replace my phone. I mean the camera is just one thing, but that slider button missing.... I use it all the time and love it, and now they ditch it. Why? 165Hz display, wow nice, ITS NOT A FUCKING GAMER PHONE DUDE, who tf cares? 120Hz is just totally fine. All I see that they put in new thing nobody asked for, they replace old working features which everybody liked for some unusable trash or just straight up ditch functionalities...

I'm not even a photogenic person, but I did notice that.  During bright days, or even snowy ones, I've taken some amazing photos with the phone though that I now use as one of my wallpapers on my iPhone 16 pro.

@ashitoshtamgadge4421,"@oneplus_india @oneplus @petelau  Subject: Feature Request – Call End Tone via Earbuds & Power Button Behavior on Incoming Calls (OnePlus 12 / 13s) Dear OnePlus Team, I’m a OnePlus 12  and 13s user and I’d like to highlight two important usability features that were available in earlier OnePlus devices (like the OnePlus 6), but are currently missing in newer models like the OnePlus 12 and 13R. These small enhancements can make a significant difference in user experience. 1. Call End Beep Sound via Earbuds or Bluetooth: When using earbuds or a Bluetooth headset during a call, there's no tone or audio feedback when the call ends. This feature existed on older OnePlus devices like the OnePlus 6. And Samsung galaxy s24, galaxy flip 7. Samsung phones currently offer this functionality with a ""call end tone"". It’s especially useful when the phone is in a pocket, bag, or placed away — users don't realize when the call has ended. Request: Please consider reintroducing the Call End Beep Tone (for Bluetooth/Earbud calls) feature in OxygenOS. 2. Power Button Function During Incoming Calls: When a call is ringing and the phone is on a table, pressing the power button immediately rejects the call, instead of simply turning off the screen. On the OnePlus 6 and Samsung galaxy s24 and Samsung flip 7, pressing the power button would just turn off the screen without disconnecting or rejecting the call. Samsung phones also behave similarly. This is especially useful during meetings, religious settings, or other quiet environments where one may want to silence the phone without rejecting the call. Request: Please consider adding a toggle option in OxygenOS for: “Press Power Button to Turn Off Screen Only (Don’t End or Reject Call)” Thank you for continuing to build reliable, user-friendly devices. Bringing back these small, thoughtful features can further enhance the overall OnePlus experience. Kind regards, [Ashitosh] OnePlus 12, oneplus 13s User, maharashtra, India",5일 전,0,

@Petar120,Isn't it ironic that all these batteries over 7000mAh don't really improve the time you have to charge the phone? Not  the charging times but the time you can use the phone on same settings as previous generation that had even less efficient chip and less battery capacity yet you get only maybe 2 hours more of your phone? The fact that the battery has 50% more capacity yet we get basically nothing useful from it should really be concerning. All this marketing about bigger batteries yet iphone and samsung still beat them with 4800mAh. Sounds like nothing more but a marketing stunt with no real life performance improvements.,5일 전,0,

@palashkale,"They clearly dialed back the camera to boost performance and battery while keeping the phone looking like a standard flagship. Nerds like me will appreciate that tradeoff, but it probably won’t shake up the market. Because photography is really important for people.  I used to be a huge OnePlus fan. I bought the OnePlus X, then the 3, 5, 6, 8 Pro, and 9 Pro all on launch day. But the 9 Pro overheated so badly that I finally gave up and moved to an iPhone 13. Since then I’ve gone pretty deep into the ecosystem: my mom and wife use iPhones, I’ve moved through the 15 Plus and now the 17, and I’m using AirPods Pro, a MacBook Air, and an Apple Watch Series 7 and now 11.  Maybe someday Apple will annoy me enough to switch back, but it’s unlikely. They’d have to disappoint me across multiple product lines for that to happen. That’s the tough reality: with Android you can switch brands any time, but escaping Apple’s ecosystem once you’re in it is much harder.",5일 전,0,

@RoughRunnerAce98,"I got the OnePlus 13 this year and its has been good but not great. The main problem I have is with Wifi 6 connectivity, on many networks the connection just cuts out and I have to turn off and on Wifi to get internet again. I read that it is a problem with the multi band steering router setting, I am not 100% sure but some posts say the 13 does not support this router feature for some reason. I have had to disable Wifi 6 to get stable performance and that is just awful. I haven't looked intro disabling the multi band steering on the router as its too much of headache to deal with, also all my other devices work fine with it and it is clearly a problem with the 13. Maybe them changing the modem has something to do with this, but maybe it still doesn't support multi ban steering, I kinda don't want to take the risk. Does anyone else have this problem on the 13? The rest of the 13 is great but everything I care about got upgraded on the 15, performance and battery, lower screen res for better battery, cheaper cameras are fine cause I don't care about them. Only thing lost is the easier to use alert slider, and I have the 13 without the glass back so its less prone to breaking. Honestly the 13 was a good value when I got it and a good upgrade from my OP6, but I I'm going to consider biting the bullet and getting the next Xperia when they re-design it, hopefully with the new battery technology and Qi2. I want the headphone jack back so much, I don't know if I'm stupid but every dongle that changes and has a headphone jack give feedback or the audio cuts out, I just don't know what I'm doing wrong...",5일 전,0,

I’ve considered keeping my flagship (wiped)  as a hotspot and using a Nothing or Oneplus on WiFi only, no cellular, out of the house and home based WiFi in the house or public WiFi like Starbucks (example)  That’s how desperate I am to get out of that situationship!

I've been a long time supporter of Samsung even though I quietly knew that iPhones took better pictures but now that isn't really the case my favorite phone I've ever had was a Galaxy S4 zoom with all of the compromises that phone had it had one thing going for it it took the best pictures of any smartphone available and it wasn't even close unfortunately I broke it and replacing it wasn't an option and no one knew how to repair it",5일 전,0,

@Hindshite2020,"I'm so glad I saw this video!  It puts me at ease because I juuust bought the OnePlus 13 from Best Buy like three weeks ago because my OnePlus 7 Pro FINALLY shit the bed, and I spent over a thousand dollars on this MF only to find out that they were about to drop the Oneplus 15!  So I was kind of kicking myself in the ass, but honestly, the fact that they are removing the alert slider, lowering the screen resolution and dumping their partnership with Hasselblad as well as gettin rid of the IR blaster, It kind of makes me feel a lot better because I would gladly trade all of those minor tweaks and upgrades the Oneplus 15 brings for the features they decided to get rid of for some reason or another.  I mean sure the battery is pretty cool and as somewhat of a power user I would have loved a 7000 mAh battery but hey, the battery on the 13 is serviceable. I do have to throw it on the charger by the end of the day because it knocks down to about 30% and I try to keep my shit between 80 and 30 for longevity purposes but, It beats putting my phone on the charger every two hours like I was doing towards the end of the life on my OnePlus 7 Pro...",5일 전,0,
@TRINVIDEO,A side grade camera at best and a downgraded screen. Their marketing was full of lies the phone gets hotter than they stated and scores less in AnTuTu than they claimed.

The lower end of the spectrum on these expensive phones nowadays still take completely fine photos.  Maybe they cheaped out a little on the cameras this time, but if you took a step back, didn't look at the specs, didn't actively try to see that slight extra bit of noise and didn't have someone tell you the camera is ""bad"", you most likely wouldn't even notice or care.

@christopher-," @John99YT  Not sure what you mean by ""authentic"". It's all mostly digital processing wether you edit or not. If what you mean is good straight out of the gate, that's pretty much an impossible task as everyone has different preference when it comes to how photos look. It can be objectively good on a technical level, but that doesn't mean it's to everyones taste.  My point is, most people just fill up their phone gallery without spending much time looking back at their photos, at which point, a photo being a little soft at the edges doesn't matter. And if they do, they look at it on their small phone screen, and it's the photo itself that matters, the memory, not as much the technical quality. If you happen to be one of the people that saves or prints photos you took with your phone, you're gonna want to shoot raw and edit anyway. Especially with printing, because it sure as hell won't come out looking the way you expect otherwise.  Sorry if i'm harsh here, but i feel like most people that complain about photo quality in modern smartphones are just spec-nerds and pixel peepers that care less about why they take a photo, and more about being able to show a friend how ""crisp and high quality"" photos their phone can take. If you really care about good photos, you probably have a decent camera already. I understand the convenience of a phone, but that convenience is always going to have a cost.",4일 전,0,

But the worst offender is that an update came through and completely bricked the outer screen. The screen was working fine, than I installed an update and what do you know, my outer screen is disabled. I could turn off the phone, close it then boot it back up and the outer screen turns on and the boot logo shows, but as soon as it's done booting it turns black and I can only use the inner screen.

So iPhones have been significantly slow with the resolution upgrades. I'm hoping their 20th anniversary iPhone XX is minimum 1440p and also adds continuous optical zoom.

A place that you wanted to be at, they were colorful and inviting. Phones today are like the McDonalds of today. Boxy, bland, flat muted colors. Not fun in the slightest. Unless you go overseas and get like a Nubia Z80 Ultra with that shiny Starry Night inspired back and amazing camera bump design. Or the new Redmagic 11 Pro Plus with the liquid cooled design!   And again, sigh, they keep putting the ever bigger and thicker camera bump off to the SIDE, making our phones more and more wobbly when set down flat on a table!

I liked the slider switch too, back when I owned a OnePlus, but you can still use the button to accomplish the same thing.   These downsides are a stretch. And cameras? A lot of us couldn’t care less about that either. It takes pictures. I can pull it out, snap a pic to capture a moment, then put it back in my pocket.   Only photography nerds and tech reviewer are hand-wringing over cameras. Like 5% of users. And they almost all have DSLRs anyway.

@Utkarsh-q3w," @nicholaswicks3077  its subjective as 120hz remains constant most of the time. And given that battery should last to its actual capacity other things are managed well. I appreciate one plus because it gives maxed out hardware in the price where other brands have some compromises. Also 165hz in all games is not available in other brands is it? So lets be realistic here. Alot of amount goes in r & d and I appreciate oneplus to bring these concepts needed to life instead of hyping it up and giving just a piece of cake instead of the whole. High ufs storage, top class processor with efficient cooling and hey CHARGER IN THE BOX(which other brands sell separately and the adapter costs 1500₹ while the cable costs 1500₹ giving an additional expense of 3000₹ apart from the cost of mobile itself). An actual all rounder phone that actually has some optimisation that work like for gaming it stays 165hz constant its no joke to actually pull that off. And the 120fps for genshin is another big point. Hardly any room for complaints with oneplus 15.

@Community-Notes-For-Youtube,"Loved how we all glazed the iPhone, Pixel and OnePlus but the S25U got shat on because the S-pen got nerfed even though it doesn't come on any other phone anyways.  EDIT: Just want to add that we are SO lucky to still even have the S-Pen with competitive battery life. It is a marvel that the S25U was basically the most powerful phone for a whole year without active cooling and 20% of it's internal volume is a literal water-sealed gaping hole. I don't think if you drilled a 3 inch deep hole through the bottom of the iPhone 17 Pro Max it would still work.   You could argue like in the replies that it's not as ""Ultra"" as it used to be but I'd still argue that it's absolutely the best all-round phone you could buy if you don't care about Apple.",5일 전(수정됨),28,

@RoboticDragonRider,"I mean if oneplus removed 10 watts from the charging speed of last years phone, mkbhd would complain the same way  What made the S pen very unique was the bluetooth. Now it has become just a cheap pen that fits inside the phone to decrease the phone batery size If it was a small change we won't be talking about it today",5일 전,1,
@Theicexr,"Not just that, did you even watch the review ? the s25u was a hilarious downgrade from the s24u. I use an s24u myself..... Samsung didn't give the s25 their all considering how high the bar was with the s24 series!!",5일 전,0,
@Community-Notes-For-Youtube, @Theicexr  For the S25 you got -Significantly faster chip - Longer battery life - Better ultrawide - Improved cooling - Proscaler for content I had an S24U a year ago and just 2 of these changes alone made it worth the loss of S-pen functionality.,5일 전,2,

@moh2028-t7w,"​ @Theicexr bruh, at least be honest, how the hell it's a downgrade? I mean, if u don't want to upgrade then it's fine but at least be logical. Just because they removed Bluetooth from S Pen it became downgrade? Really? The most hate is coming from s23 and s24 ultra users since they're in dilemma whether to upgrade or not.",5일 전,0,
@isaacfralish2147,That's because the S-Pen went from a useful tool to a basic built-in stylus. The Bluetooth was what made it unique - without it it's just a hilariously small stylus that takes up valuable space inside the phone.,5일 전,0,
@Community-Notes-For-Youtube, @zestiny_   Then go bark up the tree of the iPhone for having a shockingly easy to scratch frame or the Pixel for having shockingly bad performance compared to the rest.

@moh2028-t7w,"Still, you can't call it a downgrade. A downgrade is something like what OnePlus did with the OnePlus 15 because the camera is something that everyone uses daily. The S Pen was always a niche; people just preferred to have it, but literally nobody was using it daily. We can be disappointed and criticize, sure, but calling it a downgrade is definitely a far-fetched statement.",5일 전,0,

@Theicexr,"⁠ @moh2028-t7w  Yo bro I understand your point, I’ve been a Samsung fan since the S10+ it was my first phone till I switched to the s24 ultra and honestly it was peak engineering and everything was smooth  I was optimistic for the successor of the S series.. and when they released it, it wasn’t impressive I was disappointed and rightly so.. I’m sure most users were disappointed too with the bar that Samsung set with this series… There wasn’t any creativity in this phone it was a blatant copy of the S24u with just a few tweaks the battery was the same, the screen was the same, sure the chip was an upgrade but you wouldn’t really noticed, they messed up the S pen which was literally sacred… the materials were cheap it wasn’t high end like the S24u was, even the cameras weren’t to die for like it always were with new releases, in short the whole release was not an upgrade over the S24… it wasn’t worth it at all… so yes it’s a significant DOWNGRADE in my opinion…",5일 전,0,

@Mamoo-01,"Me too! I am rocking a 9 year old Oneplus 3T and was waiting for the 15 to drop to decide if I buy the 13 or the 15, but the crappy cameras and the loss of the alert slider is a deal breaker for me. A couple of days ago saw photo samples of the 15 on gsmarena and I already noticed the awful quality. Now that Marques confirmed it, I know which one I'll buy. The Oneplus 13 is a great phone and hopefully prices will drop a little now that the 15 is released.",5일 전,0,
@markpolo7," @Mamoo-01  But what is the point of switching to the OnePlus 15 and the 165Hz is just marketing and unnecessary, 120Hz is enough and they even boast about the display that it is better than the OnePlus 13 but it is not, it is worse, it is the worst model they have ever made and a terrible failure, only the battery is bigger and the screen is flat, but I like the screen in the OnePlus 13 more.",5일 전,0,
@Mamoo-01,"​ @markpolo7 exactly! That's also why I've decided to get the 13. It is still a great phone even if it has the 1 year old snapdragon chip, and the 15's upgrades aren't useful to me. Only the battery is better but 6000mah is still really good. Like you said the 165hz screen is no use to me because I don't game. And the screen is smaller and has lower resolution. I also prefer the design of the 13's back with the round camera island, it's classy. The 15 is just a generic iPhone look-alike.",5일 전,1,
