@tazhienunurbusinezz1703,"I hear ya. I have 2 prescriptions I have to fill for myself every month. One of them is $45 and the other is $2,900 if I didn't have health insurance & if I stop taking the expensive one, I will likely die in less than a week (luckily for me I have wealthy parents who have agreed to chip in to pay for it if something happened so that fact doesn't stress me out as much as it would the average person who, if they lost their job, would be unable to pay for it in a short period of time). My husband has 4 prescriptions every month & those add up to about $200, My stepson's 2 perscriptions are $350 a month, My oldest daughter has asthma so it's $75 a month for her one inhaler & my youngest daughter has severe allergies so her couple meds are about $175 a month.   We pay $1,500 a month for our health insurance plan every month but have a deductible of $3,000 per person and/or $6,000 per family. Every time you go to the clinic or hospital there is at least $50 for a co-pay & a hospital is $150 for a co-pay. We pay about $24,000 a year in health care costs because after the family pays the $6,000 deductible, the insurance company pays the rest however we still pay $1,500 a month for that ""privilege"". Basically what all this means is my family of 5 gets screwed (My husband, me, 2 daughters & 1 son) & everyone else gets rich (drug companies, hospitals, health insurance companies, pharmacies, doctors, specialists & the politicians who set up this system so a select few get rich off of everyone else.). We live in one of the richest countries in the world but the priorities of the 1% who are allowed to dump huge amounts of money into our political system, are to get as much money as they can from everyone else. The above info I provided is what an average ""middle class"" family is responsible for to get health care. I really wish we had a system that was more like every other developed nation has. In this country it's actually against the law (thanks to ""campaign contributions"" from the drug companies to our politicians) for the government to negotiate to get better drug prices for the people on medicare (which is the government run health care plan for the elderly & disabled) & if that doesn't show you how completely off track we have gotten here, nothing will.

@madman2u,"Simple ways to save money no matter where in the world you live!  - Walk, bicycle, use public transportation instead of a car. A car costs more to have if you don't have money. It may not be the thing you want but you'll probably have to consider to get rid of it.  - Don't buy stuff you don't really need. This includes snacks, soda, alcohol, candy etc. If you cannot get by, cutting down on these will help a lot. It may be lonely on a weekend without something, but you'll sleep good knowing you're not in debt.  - Turn off all electronics when you're not using them(i.e away from home). This includes the power led on your TV, stereo etc. Don't leave your computer running when you're not at home. Also make sure you don't have any lamps running.  - Switch out those old lamps for energy saving ones. Their life expectancy is generally higher and you'll save money on the electric bill in the long run.  - Make a list of groceries you need and if you can, buy them from day to day. This ensures, if you live fairly close to a convenient store, that you don't have to throw away stuff you may not eat. If you live far away, carefully planning your run to the store and what you need to buy, is far better than going in there blind. This saves money!  While you do all this your health may improve as well, as you're active a lot more than before. Now you eat and buy only what you need and can afford to put the little money you have over into savings for a rainy day or a treat.  I understand what it's like to not have much, it's not fun and can be frustrating to not be able to treat yourself with something now and then. But when you don't have any money, it's time to let go of self indulgence and think smart.  Hope these few tips helped someone in need out there.  Cheers!  Another thing I came to think of, this probably will hurt the most, but it's one of those things that will help you get by, financially, easier. If you own a pet, letting it go may be the right thing to do. Maybe ask a relative to take care of it until you get back on your feet.",10년 전,7,

@LoPhoGro,"I, as a Dutchman, have lived in the states myself and have an American girlfriend, so I have personally experienced some of the differences in terms of banking. E.g. at home I don't remember seeing anyone write out a check in my lifetime (25) , where as I have American friends my age who use them to this day.Regardless I'm still quite shocked by the systems explained in this documentary.. In case anyone is interested allow me to summarize this from the Dutch perspective. It isn't perfect either but it does seem more practical and even fair (as far as basic access/utility of banking goes). If you are bored already please save yourself the TL;DR effort ;)  So I live in the Netherlands. In order to have a private bank account as a non student, you pay an estimated €1,75 to €5 of a service fee per month, depending on the bank of your choice. The primary banking card used in the Netherlands is an ATM/debit card, Credit Cards have always been a secondary choice for the Dutch though it is growing in popularity largely due to traveling and non-Dutch online stores which don't include a debit card payment option. Paying with a Debit card in a store, or making digital transactions through the banks internet banking environment (which every bank has) is free/included in the above mentioned service fee and possible through your smart phone or your web browser. If I'mm not mistaken, in order to get a bank account in the Netherlands, all you need is to be a Dutch citizen or have a valid visa/social security number. If  you can demonstrate a steady income (1 salary transfer is generally enough) you can increase your limit depending on your income. As an example I could set my limit to minus €1000,- (max=monthly salary) which won't cost anything as long as you maintain a positive balance. If however you dip below €0 you will have to make sure you top off your bank account back to 0 and pay the interest over the amount you 'borrowed' for the duration that you did.

@MistressMorrigan,"My heart goes out to these people, but even with the bumps of life, their situations were preventable. Let's see how, starting at age 17:  1) Go to a local community college. In most states a 2 year degree fulfills core requirements and can transfer to a 4 year school. Take a credit load that's not too heavy and work full time. Live with your parents and save every penny you can.  2) Transfer to a 4 year school, but do your last 2 years over 3-4, part time, pay as you go and work a full time job  3) In this time, get a checking account and keep a solid minimum in there. Get a FingerHut account to buy holidat gifts as well as birthday gifts, apply for their credit, pay it off in full before due date  4) Graduate college. Get a full time job or advance in your existing one. Save up and purchase a used car  5) Apply for credit with a store like Value City Furniture. Get 12 months terms, get your basic furniture, and pay twice the minimum before the due date  6) NEVER pay your utilities late. Ever. Use only a cell phone, look for apartments with free heat, don't leave TV/Computers?lights on 24/7  7) Start a savings account. Get a 401k through work, but on your own open a savings account and each paycheck pay in until you save 6 months expenses  8) Get a credit card. set a budget for entertainment (restaurants, movies, etc) per week and pay with the card. Pay the abalance in full, each month, BEFORE the due date. By now you have a PERFECT FICO of 850  9) Don't marry anyone with a FICO under 600, and no debt that will take them more than a year to pay off  10) Get your partner's debt paid off before marrying  11) Share an apartment, apply for a car loan for a new car (not expensive) and pay it in full or more before the due date.  12) Consult with a financial advisor on a mortgage you can actually afford. DO NOT SPEND A PENNY MORE  13) Bump up your 6 months savings while house shopping  14) Buy a house, keep up on the mortgage, pay the balance due every month before due date or on due date  15) Once savings is accumulated, consult financial advisor on when you can afford a child. Sat a new savings for their college expenses  If everyone did this, there would be no payday or car title loans, no crippling debt. Do this and you have perfect credit, a newer car, a house, a responsible spouse, emergency funds, and a plan for the future.  WHY THE FUCK IS THIS SO HARD< AMERICANS?",10년 전,2,

We had two cars and a house that had a room for all and much other room to spare. I live extremely simple- I don't eat out either and I watch my food budget. I enjoy this but it is choice. Usually each meal I make is around $2 and I only eat twice a day(choice). But this is really being conscience about my spending- I figure more then the average. If you assume a family of five and each meal is $3 three times a day times five is $45. Round it up because you splurge once and a while $50, so for the year this is $18,000. This is more then I live on all year(by choice). And that's just food and that is also being very careful about your spending.  Something has to give soon- I believe 1/3 of the US is on food stamps. Amazing stat considering we are or were the richest nation.  Maybe its time we rethink our communities and push for more co-op worker owned local. Seems with all the big stuff all our money is spent on labor from overseas at stores owned by huge conglomerations that suck the money out of the community and into some off shore account.  Your not alone.

@BLTspace,"I see a lot of ""stop buying stuff"" and ""they just made bad financial decisions"". Seriously? I actually don't like how the emphasis was on credit in this either. It comes down to very low paying jobs at the bottom of society. I know couples with full time/overtime jobs that still have to budget small things just to pay the bills. The price of everything has gone up over the years yet ppl get paid the same wage. 15 dollars an hour is considered good and a job ppl are jealous of. Someone with a full time even 20$ an hour job would struggle to pay for an apartment/gas/food/bills etc. I don't want to start a minimum wage argument either but min wage is barely enough to buy milk and bread. A long time ago you could have a single income household/stay at home mom scenario and still live comfortably with vacations every year. There is zero chance of this happening today in the real world. I get financial decisions could be better but don't blindly blame these ppl and act like the system is fine the way it is. Havn't even mentioned the health issues ppl run into either. Even if you and your spouse do wanna work 2 jobs each and ""earn"" that house/vacation every year... you better find a babysitter because daycare can cost you a good bit of that money you're trying to earn.

@physica3985,"I am not an American and live in a developing country, though someday I aspire to be one. After watching this entire documentary, I've come to notice a few important aspects, though I may just be looking at it as a non-American. Nevertheless, allow me to list them out here. All of the people shown in this video except for the couple who're looking for a new house, live in houses that are huge and can easily accommodate multiple families besides themselves. About half of them are slightly edging towards the overweight scale of normality which is probably an indication of why money falls short. If groceries are going to hike your expenses, alongwith a huge house and its supplementary costs (power, water, other utilities). I noticed in one of the shots that Debii (the entrepreneur), had a Starbucks coffee on the table besides her. Ironically, it was the same scene where she was scrambling for money. Not that people shouldn't drink coffee or anything but coming from a country where Starbucks has negligible business, I can't help but look at it with a little skepticism (after all, Starbucks costs about 2$ around here whereas the actual production cost is about 20-30% of that amount).

I was so disgusted that not only had she miss lead her own child but no matter what I did to give her a way to get rid of the debt she stopped listening to me. So one day she mentioned something, she had been paying on a life insurance policy from my late Grandfather, her Father, for years which he had got for her, but my Grandmother, her mother, had recently given us both policies, and she said to me I'm going to see if I can close the policy account, I don't need it I have another. The policy cash payout was what we needed and I had the power to do what I needed to do. I made her take the cash pay out and got rid of that Sear's Charge account in one huge payment, we were free. Sadly though more troubles came our way, luckily we had saved a chunk of the pay out and it help greatly and a few more good things have happened, but once again my mother isn't listening to me but after seeing this I'm not gonna let up again, she isn't going to screw us over again with her stupid naive fears, I'm done, and if something has to be done it's gonna be me to protect my family even if I have nothing!",11년 전,0,

Just because they are overweight doesn't mean they are buying more food. It probably means they are buying less expensive unhealthy food.  I do agree with you about the housing though. Families used to group together to save expenses. That is not happening so much in America anymore.  Lastly, these people all lack or lacked a basic understanding about money and finance and its not all their fault. I had to learn the hard way as well.

Countries like the USA will become more of a totalarian system with more controls over it's population. We might all laugh when we consider what East Germany became with the Stasi Police, but we don't see it happening in front of us and to us.  Probably the only real way any of this will change is when the financial system as we know it can no longer sustain itself and we have a real depression.

More and more money being stuffed into the pockets of those that already have everything, whilst at the same time enforcing ""austerity"" on those that would spend the money if they had it..  The best advice is to make sure as many people as possible are aware of what is going on, and try not to play the game those in control want you to.

HOWEVER, i am not saying the system is good, on the contrary... it needs many improvements.  We could go all day on how one choice could have been made over the other...

It allows us to view each other in numbers, in potential currency gained or lost, rather than as human beings whose skills and lives ultimately have just as much value. If all we see when we look at profit is how much we have justly earned, how much we can hoard away, rather than how we could keep that money circulating and invest in each other, then this gap between the rich and the poor is only going to grow wider, leading those who were not privileged enough to gain employment that earns them profit after profit to seek more and more desperate and risky actions to survive. The more money one earns, the easier it is to think it is deserved, the harder it is to keep the money circulating, to be humble, and to empathize with those who have less than one does now.",11년 전,1,

@ryanharvey1098,"It's evident that everyone in this documentary made bad financial decisions. We've all made bad financial decisions. The first step to escape from financial prison is to change your spending habits. No matter how much help or opportunity you are given, if you only treat the symptoms of the problem you will always end up in the same place you were. Once you fix the bad spending habits disease you can realistically hope for a better financial future.  That being said, there really needs to be more financial counseling for people in these type of situations. Not only that, but I think it would be great to have financial institutions established in order to help these people get back on their feet rather than drag them further into debt. I don't even mind if it's government subsidized in some way because realistically, a financial institution is only in it for profit.

Stuff happens- for the most part, the people in this video could afford all the things they were paying for until something bad hit them. While it is smart to plan for disasters, you cannot possibly know the financial hit you will take until you get hit. My brother-in-law came from the school of thought that he'd never been sick, young guy, 35 years old, no kids, very well educated, an amazing artist and his knack was tattooing. He faced an armed robbery one night in his shop- the one night he wasn't packing heat, mind you, and wound up emotionally scarred from that ordeal so he went back to bartending.  He didn't have any insurance because remember, he'd never been sick and didn't have any kids, lived in an apartment he could afford ten times over. Thought he had appendicitis- went to the E.R.- full blown liver failure, he could have died that night. The hospital 'charitied' out the hospital room fee which was $60,000- the fees for the doctors and services have gone well over $200k. He is tattooed from his chin to his feet so there is a good bet that he will never have a 'normal' job- tattooing and bartending are out because even a drop of alcohol could kill him, cigarettes too. Were his choices poor? Maybe. But which ones? The drinking? Or being so heavily tattooed? He didn't have kids, didn't spend beyond his means, no student loans- all the things you all have listed as being poor choices. I don't know what the answers are in terms of falling into financial ruin and getting up out of it but walk a mile in the shoes of another and look in the mirror. Have I listed anything that you have done or currently do? Are you suggesting that people just not live their lives under the aegis that they 'might' get sick or be laid off?

@THE1SEEDS2OF3ABRAHAM,"""Don't Cry Over Spilled Milk"", You'll Be There All Day!  My comments to the YouTube Video: ""SPENT: Looking For Change"" My Classification: Finances - Financial Overhaul  Rather than discussing the obvious, the results of bad decisions regarding how one spend's or does not save money, I would encourage a dialogue that looks at the ""root cause"" of financial woes, both for individuals and corporations. We also must not forget the fact that 'corporation's' are groups of 'individuals'!   There is a money management system in place, and has been since the beginning of time, that if followed correctly benefits everyone.  It's simply: ""1 + 1 = 2"", ""2 - 1 = 1"", ""0 + 0 = 0"". Problem is this simple money management system does not work when emotionalism takes a front seat.  All human beings need to feel secure within themselves. How that security looks to each one is different as habits are formed early on in a person's life; before grade school! If a person has learned to make decisions using emotions as their 'yardstick', the outcome's can be disastrous.    Some of the causes of emotional spending are triggered by fear; the fear of being lonely, being unloved, not being able to live as one has become accustomed, no longer able to satisfy selfish desires, no longer accepted by those who are privileged. Fear turn's simple task's into monstrous nightmare's.  My opinion is that most of our governing laws have been created and put into action based on ""individual's"" emotion's. You must have an emotional experience that moves you to action. Something must be triggered deep within your soul which prompts you to 'do something'. When making critical decisions regarding finances, ask yourself this question, ""How will this decision affect me as well as those around me""? [affect - ""produce a change""  effect - ""result"" / ability to bring about a result. ]  If at any point and time you find yourself unable to stop and ask this question before you act, then there's a good possiblity the outcome will not be the most desirable.  I also believe there is always hope! Just because your circumstances seem bleak to impossible right now, remember a journey begins with the first step. Stop where you are and begin anew. Look back only to understand those things that got you where you are today; and be honest. Start a new journey by doing things differently. Also always keep alert as life is a constant change; each new day brings about newness.   Matthew 5:37King James Version (KJV)  37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.  5:1–7:29 The Sermon on the Mount is the first of five great blocks of Jesus’ teaching in Matthew (Introduction: Characteristics and Themes). It is the classic statement of the ethics of the kingdom of God. The early church favored a literal interpretation but fully applied the sermon only to special classes of Christians, especially monastics. Others, such as the Anabaptists, have attempted to apply it literally to every Christian. Still others have viewed it as legalistic, as a provisional, temporary code, or as a heightening of the law of Moses with the aim of inducing repentance (Luther). Finally, some have argued that the demands of the sermon are not to be understood literally, but that Jesus was concerned with inward disposition rather than outward conduct, or that the severity of the sermon is intended to compel a decision by the hearers either for or against God’s demands on their lives.  We must recognize that the sermon is directed to the disciples and through them to the whole church today. The sermon addresses both inward motives and outward conduct (5:21, 22, 27, 28). These legitimate demands are so strict (5:48) that no one can completely obey them, and we are therefore driven to the grace and mercy of God. In some cases Jesus uses obviously intentional exaggeration to illustrate the absolute requirements of God’s law (5:29, 30).  Matthew 5:21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30, 37 https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A21%2C+22%2C+27%2C+28%2C+29%2C+30%2C+37&version=KJV",11년 전,0,

@prwexler,"(01:21) ""...because of a financial system that leaves millions underserved."" Partially true, and here's the truth of the statement:  The Federal Government has made cheap money available to banks, and banks still maintain very high interest rates on credit cards.  All consumers must service loans having interest rates that are substantially higher than what banks pay for the money that they are given by the Federal Reserve.  Considering the rates charged to banks, home loans should be hovering at about 2 percent, student loans should be at about 3 percent, and credit card interest rates should be at about 10 percent.  There is another side to this story.  Manufacturing has slipped from America and has been sent to China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.  Americans must compete with extremely desperate people for work that used to pay a living wage.  Some argue that if only Americans would get rid of that pesky minimum wage, and those ridiculous clean air and water regulations, everything would be great!  If ""great"" means being paid less per hour than the cost of a small potato, then I guess things would be great, but I don't think that's a ""great"" idea.  I do not understand why Americans (even the desparate) are so against re-establishing tariffs on imported manufactured goods.  What is so wrong with that?  What is so wrong with employing Americans, FIRST?  Clearly, giving our manufacturing away to the rest of the world has not made it a more stable place.  Look at how China is rattling its sword at Japan and Taiwan.  Look at what's going on in the Ukraine.  Look at the continuing horrors going on in the Middle East!  Giving away American wealth has not made the world safer, and it has destroyed America's financial foundation.",11년 전,0,

@bikerboy2791,"I have several thoughts after watching this.  1. I agree that the banking and credit systems are rigged against poor people. Practical regulation seems reasonable, but most Republicans and many/most Democrats are against common sense anything.  2. Many of these folks made basic, bad financial decisions. The gal trying to build her hand bag business should have 1) Chosen a cheaper college, 2) Worked during college, 3) Gotten a job in her industry right out of college, and 4) Built her own business on the side. She did do something practical: not have kids before she could afford them.  3. Which brings up lesson #3: Don't have kids unless you can afford them. Being practical/choosy about sexual partners is best for several reasons. If you want to be promiscuous, WRAP IT UP and/or INSIST THAT YOUR PARTNER WRAP IT UP. It's not rocket science, folks.  5. Don't quiet your job to care for a relative or for any other reason unless you're FORCED to. You HAVE to take care of yourself first before you can care for others. This is NOT selfish. It's PRACTICAL.  4. The young couple trying to buy a house should not UNLESS it saves them $. If it does then she should get a 2nd job and work her a-- off to be able to afford a house on her own, then buy one with him. If it doesn't save them $, they should rent the cheapest place they can, maybe live with roommates, get a 2nd job and save up a huge down payment which will make getting a mortgage easier, even if they have to add his bad credit to hers.  5. I guess the couple whose son has down's syndrome has such high medical expenses that they can't get by. One of them should get a 2nd job. I know it's tough, believe me. And of course the recent ACA health care is barely enough reform. Dumb ass conservatives and red states are against even those weak provisions on the HUGELY PROFITABLE insurance industry. Boggles the mind. Still, don't have kids unless you can afford them. Be PRACTICAL. Get health insurance at all costs. If you have to, get a 2nd job.  I've made PLENTY of poor financial decisions. BUT, my girlfriend and I haven't had kids, live in a dumpy place, never go out, watch an old, old tv (dvd only), don't have cable, drive old cars, buy cheap food, rarely buy clothing unless we really need it, and rarely buy fun things (music, movies, camping gear, etc.). We MAKE things last. We don't care if we look poor. WE ARE.  I know these folks are doing the best they can given their past decisions. And I realize I'm sounding judgemental here. But my point is we can learn from their mistakes while promoting change in the financial system AT THE SAME TIME. They're not mutually exclusive.  I'm certainly PISSED about the rich continually getting richer while we poor folk wallow in never-ending poverty. I'm also just about given up hope on our politicians to do much good for us. The one thing we, the common people, CAN do is be PRACTICAL.  I just want to encourage all people, especially young people, to:  1. Spend LESS than you earn. 2. Make do with old things. 3. Don't have kids unless you can afford them. If that means you never have kids, oh well. At least you have security. 4. Work you a-- off. Get a 2nd job. 5. Choose college majors, romantic partners, spending priorities wisely. Be PRACTICAL. 6. VOTE. Lobby your state and federal senators and representatives for financial and health care system reform, if you can. I know it seems helpless, but it's all we have.  TLDR: Even though the financial system sucks and needs reform, please be practical. Your future happiness depends on it.",11년 전,0,

@purplemutantas,"One problem I have with these sorts of documentaries is that it's all about how the big bad capitalist system is screwing people. There isn't enough attention payed to the people them selves and any poor financial decisions they made. The fact is, many Americans do stupid things with their money. I wonder how many people who ""need"" a payday loan only need it because they spent money on something they didn't need. You need to take care of needs FIRST, then take care of wants. You need to evaluate a ""need"" to see if it's really a need. Far to many people spend money on ""needs"" that aren't really needs. Then they don't have enough money to pay their power bill or whatever. Also, when people have more money; rather than saving it, they spend it! I remember when my dad got a better paying job. He decided to upgrade to digital cable. The basic cable we had was just fine. We had plenty of channels to choose from. But he decided to go for the more expensive option because he could. It would have been better to take the extra money and put it in savings. This sort of thing happens all the time. People get a raise and suddenly they need a new car, or TV, or whatever. People need to stop trying to keep up with the Joneses.  I am an Anarchist so I am opposed to Capitalism. It would be great if we could abolish such a horrible and exploitive economic system and replace it with something more just. But that's not going to happen any time soon. So as long as we have the kind of system we do, we need to educate people so they can make better financial decisions. That is an uphill batter unfortunately. People who are smart with money aren't as profitable as people who are dumb with money. All those fees and interest add up to a whole lot of profit.",11년 전,83,

@briandupre1494,"Purple, you're right. I live in a poor neighborhood and I see it everyday. People get their checks cashed at small fee shops nearby and they are cash rich for a few days, then they're asking to borrow money by the 15th of the month, 2 full weeks before their next check. I feel for these people but here are a few tips for the poor: - Don't have kids. Period. Not one.  - Sell your car (bus passes are cheap), or trade it in for a smaller vehicle that would be better on gas, cheaper insurance, cheaper registration fees etc. - Scale down to a smaller home or apartment, even in a worse part of town. - Get a damn bank account. - Cut out all unnecessary expenditures. How do you afford a $150/mo phone bill if you're truly poor? - Stop buying expensive processed foods. The nurse in this documentary needs to focus more on keeping herself healthy. If an obese person is applying for a physically demanding job like a nurse, of course they won't get it.  If anything there should be more financial literacy education in America, especially among high risk areas. Ultimately I'd like to see society take care of each other better so parents that have special needs kids or people with elderly parents won't have to scrape like this. However, people in a free society are ultimately responsible for their own positions.  I moved to Hawaii when I was 19 with NOTHING. I hustled to get a shit job at a Korean BBQ joint working the grill, took a room in a house in a terrible neighborhood and bought a bus pass. I did all my shopping in China town for cheap produce and meat, learned to cook rice and other cheap staples and only shopped at second hand clothing shops. Every day I had off, I hustled for a better job, and I found one in a few months. I saved all my money and got a nice apartment in a better neighborhood with a few roommates and slowly increased my standard of living. I didn't get help from anyone because I didn't expect it. Keep in mind this was in 2007, the start of a terrible recession, so it wasn't easy. I'm not saying everyone has the same circumstances as me, some are much worse, but these people need to see that their decisions are leading them to the financial pain they are in. ",11년 전,4,
@purplemutantas,"Brian Dupre I hadn't thought about the phone bill. I wonder how many poor people are running around with expensive smart phones?

Between public transit and a bicycle, you can do quite a bit. I do of course understand that some areas are better for public transit and bikes than others. Yes ditching processed food is the way to go. The processed crap may seem cheap, but it's not compared to real food purchased in bulk. I can get rice for $20-$22 for a 40 pound bag. Or half that for a 20 pound bag. I just recently picked up 20 pound bags of pinto beans for $15. Rice and Beans make cheap staples in ones diet. Potatoes are also a cheap option and have vitamin C. You just need to make sure to eat the skin since that's where most of the vitamins are. I used to be on food stamps. I would find my self running out of food stamps and having to visit the food bank a the end of the month. The only reason I ran out, is because I was buying processed junk.

@briandupre1494,"purplemutantas You have the right ideas. I was raised by my grandparents for a few years (who were raised in the depression) and they taught me at 15 years old more than anyone has since about simple ways to make money. They line-dried their clothes most of the year, bought off-brand staples and grew as much produce as possible in the summer, saving those potatoes and winter squash for the fall and winter. They split a car, had a house with ONE bathroom (oh my! The horror!) and took quick showers. They opened windows on cool days and turned off the ac, they opened blinds on warm days and turned down the heat. I think we've all been sold on this disposable, semi-luxury lifestyle where we think it's weird to eat zuchini from a garden, but perfectly normal to drop $15 on lunch when we make $10/hr, but we can't blame the system, you have to realize if you're not rich that's ok, but maybe you shouldn't have a 50"" tv and go spending like you have money in the bank. One way my wife and I save money when we can't garden is shopping at ethnic grocery stores because they always have cheap produce and like you said, beans are cheap as fuck, put a little hot sauce on them and they're great! We bought a $50k house in the hood and got a BIG dog and for the most part it's been ok.

Government, not capitalism. Others placed their money in high risk/high return investments hoping for a quick turn around.  Placing it in a national bank would ensure their money was FDIC insured and not lost.  Anyone with a portfolio that would have diversified with larger portions in low risk low yield investments would have come through just fine.  I'm someone who lost a good job and had to settle for a lower paying one. You do realize it is capitalism that made having even the low paying ones around?  If govt. stayed out of capitalism you'd have long distance phone calls for 1 penny/minute. $1.50/gal gasoline. and job coming out of our ears.  Capitalism by its nature wants to expand to grow. It does this by creating new jobs.  Government stifles growth with regulations and taxes.

If the families in this documentary who run around paying bills at separate locations put some effort into starting a small account at a credit union, they could avoid many of those fee's and ruthless practices. The main thing is getting educated about HOW these banks are fucking you, and get access to a better system like a CU, and don't tell me it might not be convenient for them, because they clearly aren't afraid to drive an hour round trip for bills. There is an incredible amount of coddling and apathy among the poor. Yes yes yes there are certain extenuating circumstances and a lot of people are destitute, but if they truly are, they can frequently get government assistance. They need the education to learn what programs they can take advantage of, and access to those programs. Education and access. This is where programs like the United Way come in.  You're correct, it IS a rut, and a downward spiral but you have to get in the right mindset too. In this documentary, the nurse is on the phone with her boss/coordinator. She hasn't worked in over a year and is having a hard time getting her foot in the door. The person on the phone offers her a job (temp, daily, weekly whatever) and instead of saying, ""Yes! Yes! I'll take it, thanks you for the opportunity!"" She hesitates and says, ""Oh, that's an hour away...."". That is a losing attitude. She could have sucked it up, gone for that hour drive and knocked her potential new boss's socks off with great service, but she hesitated.  It doesn't matter if you have a master's degree, no one owes you a thing. For instance, we don't know particulars but the nurse didn't have to take care of her mother. If her mother was truly destitute, that is what medicaid and medicare and social security is for. If she had stayed at her (assuming since she has such a high education level) high paying nursing job and hired a home caretaker to come watch her mother for a few hours during the days she worked, it sounds like she wouldn't be in this situation. That being said, many people with college degrees know little to nothing of personal finance and common sense. Her apartment looks awful nice for someone who is ""poor"" and her daughter goes to private school. There is a ton of waste in that woman's finances and I know she thinks this is the correct way to do things, and her and her family deserve it, but that doesn't make it reality.  As a society, we need to realize this is a new normal. We are taught that our standard of life will never decline, that housing is a concrete investment, that a college degree will always pay for itself and that we deserve cheap, plentiful goods. This is incorrect. They call it the American Dream because you'd have to be asleep to believe it.  Also, if you are interested in this system and why it can't really work, check out Jacque Fresco, Peter Joseph or various Anarcho-Capitalists, you might learn a lot and awaken a spirit of resistance to the current system we have. We all deserve housing, food, community and love, but that isn't the current system and until we change it, you need to be flexible and adapt to the current system, not hold on to your current lifestyle with a death grip. Suck up your pride; downsize your living quarters, get rid of your car, get rid of your expensive phone, start shopping at thrift shops, grow your own food, find temporary work, stop buying people gifts for made-up-corporate holidays (Christmas).

Its really about solidarity: how much and in what way does a community or society want to pay for people who have financial difficulties. Here it is important to notice that the people in the documentary were having problems due to external causes, not due to ´stupid decision´. Nobody chooses to get cancer or autism. It seems to me a Dutch person living in Germany that in America the working class is blamed for problems they havent caused and then let them suffer, with the argument that they made stupid decisions and everybody is responsible for him/herself. And when it comes to big banks and financial institutions,...well ,..they need help because they are too big to fail.

I'm not against the welfare state any more than our current corporate welfare state. That being said, I think I made more than enough of a point with the nurse and how many poor decisions she has made, hence the need for working class people to get involved with financial literacy programs. Also, keep in mind that many American's weren't for the bailouts, it was pretty unpopular. Who was for it? Big business, banks, insurance companies and politicians, many from Europe. The Dutch and German banking systems took a hit but it would have been MUCH worse and a lack of American consumer spending would have destroyed the Dutch economy that relies on foreign trade, banks and natural resources. The German economy may have been better off but would have suffered too due to cutbacks in American and Chinese firms buying their high value exports.

@purplemutantas,"S Dutchguy No people don't choose to have cancer or Autism. But people DO choose to have children. People also choose where they spend their money when times are good. If you are going to have a child you should be prepared for the reality that the child might be born with a disability. People should also be prepared for disasters, whatever they may be. Besides typical things like food, water, and other disaster supplies; people should also have money saved up. I think most people in the US can afford to save some money. I bet most people aren't spending 100% of their money on real actual needs. Even if all you can afford to save is $5 a month, it adds up. This sort of thing is especially relevant to me as an Autistic person. If I lose my disability benefits, I can't just go out and get a job like everyone else.

@wandaring0,"Chavez Lives That is not an example of a poor decision. If your friend spent his money in the past on cars and houses, the purchases would have depreciated, broken, etc. and eventually lost value or even been stolen, etc. Occasionally, possessions can increase in value, but usually they are a liability in regards to needing to pay to secure them, maintain them, pay yearly taxes or fees, or insure them. The doctor would have eventually run out of money just to maintain his ""stuff"". He saved, but as you mentioned, inflation does eat up savings. But, it has not always been this way. Savings rates are very low due to lending rates being low. (no new businesses and less people buying homes, etc. )So, saving money is not the way to get ahead in a down economy, although it can create a bit of comfort and security to the saver. Yet, spending money only brings a temporary satisfaction and is risky and ends up being like the video: a never ending cycle of paying debt, paying for repairs, robbing ""peter to pay paul"", etc. What is the worst in today's economic climate is that people are spending money, but it is not so much on actual goods or things that we like or enjoy, but rather fees and invisible things. This certainly is less enjoyable than reflecting back on purchases that at least gave a spender a bit of pleasure.

Most of them are regular banks which charges interest like any other bank and we have also some few islamic banks.

So lets say if you deposit 20k usd while bank worths 100m usd. When bank worths 150m you earn as much as they earn so it becomes 30k usd.

@mrbit10,"There is a lot of that, I agree... as for profits of banks and stalled wages as some have suggested, the banks lost their profits as i recall and were then bailed out and now with the QE's get cheap money back in hopes of lending further but usually only results in an inflated DOJ/S&P.  Certainly is the choice of the consumer and we all make poor choices but it has to be balanced in that if the consumer is penalized for bad choices, so must banks.  Today now we have commercial banks that have absorbed others (merrill/BOA) such as investment banks as a forced measure by our gov...  The excuses given were ""too big to fail"" as if un occupied homes would go ""poof"" in the night on a failure... laughable... the point of such lending IE collateral was totally lost in that concept... nothing wrong with letting poor choices earn their consequence especially when the asset still exists and is open to new underwriting. There is also a flip side to this, how many consumers know that they have statue protections from falling into a trap of unable to pay debt?  I know all too many that either settle for 30 cents on the dollar such as with BOA's infamous warehouse debt sales and the fact that most junk debt buyers cannot win in the courts of law to make you pay, but as with one side of the coin where knowing would make better choices, so could the other... and is why over 80% in the debt trap never even show to court when they could have and changed the result entirely.",11년 전,0,

@LightAndShaddow5,"29:00 She has more orders than she can deal with, that's awesome! She says her challenge is that she doesn't have enough money to buy the materials.  Steve jobs had this exact same problem when he started Apple. He got an order of I believe 50 Macintoshes, but didn't have the money. So he negotiated with the supplier and with the buyer.  If she offers the buyer bettter terms for upfront payment, or for paying half upfront (or whatever the cost of materials is), she can buy the materials and still make the products and build her critical mass financially.  Or she can do the same with the supplier, negotiate, explain the situation, if necessary offer to pay slightly more for credit terms.

I estimate that 10% of those househoulds had large, bad, unexpected things happen, and that 5% had some sort of disaster happen. Those figures are probably very generous, but ok sure. I can understand that.  But the other 85%? That's 42.5% of households.  If I'm living paycheck to paycheck, I'd get up to a buffer of a few thousand quick smart.

@LightAndShaddow5,"I'm half way through this documentary. It seems that many people don't have bank accounts and are using check clearing services on an ongoing basis. Can someone please explain if there is anything that make it so difficult to open a bank account in the US? I get there are many people and systems who make a living sucking money out of the pockets of people like in the documentary. That people are offering these services that do not add value at all, they just take and create the illusion of value, it's almost a scam, except it's legally sanctioned. I get that.  I also get that people within that are unaware of how to change, and that other people have an interest in stopping them from becoming aware. I get that too.  At the same time, I feel like many of the people in the documentary are mostly just financially uneducated. They are personally making bad decisions, following the illusions of what is being presented to them. If they were more educated, then for many it would be easy to start making changes and stop wasting money on so many fees.  If they were more educated financially, and had a small cash buffer of $2000 or $3000, heck even just $500, then they wouldn't be spending $80 a month on fees. Then within a year they would be $1000 ahead of where they would be if they weren't paying the fees.  Other than their own behaviour, what is stopping most of these 70 million Americans from opening a bank account? In Australia anyone can do that, most bank accounts cost between $2 to $5 per month, and I'm not aware of any restrictions on who can open one. Easy.  I get that it's not easy if you don't know the strategies or mindset, or had no role models. But to me the actual actions of developing a financial buffer and stop wasting money on fees, the ""what to do"" part is incredibly easy. At least in Australia. Is it different in the US?",11년 전,0,

@tcironbear21,"I tend to agree with you.  Via trial and error I have found out how to work the personal financial system.  The secret is not avoid debt, but to manage it better.  The way I handle this situation is a little complex but it is definately less work & cost than running around with cash everywhere and pay day loans.  I get all my bills paid in about 2 hours.  Get yourself 2 checking accounts with little or no fees and 3 to 5 credit cards with no annual fees.  One of your checking accounts is your receiving account / main account.  It is the account that your pay checks, etc. go to.  You use this account to pay your debts.  NEVER, EVER have any auto-debits on this account.    The other checking account is for the ""auto debit"" items you run into.  You keep this seperate from your main account because auto debits will screw you up so easy.  Try to have about twice the amount of monthly auto debits in this account.  That way if forget to move money over or run into problems, you can afford to miss the month.  I always pay about $10 to $50 more than I need to break even on this account.  It is amazing how quickly that extra $30 a month builds up.  Now one of your credit cards is your ""all expenses card"".  This card is usually the card that has points or cash back.  You pay for pretty much everything with this card.  At the end of the month you review your spending when you pay your bills.  If you spend about your budget or less, GREAT!  You pay off the full balance of your credit card, paying no interest and earning some points in the process.  Take the extra cash and save it or use it pay down another credit card.   If you spend more than your budgeted, you look and see where you are wasting your money.  You make mental notes that you are wasting too much money.  And you try to make it up next month.  Never over draft your ""main account"", just pay less on your ""all expenses card"".  The interest on your ""all expenses card"" will be much less than the overdraft fee.  The other credit cards are ""competition"" cards.  The reason I call them this is because credit cards are aware of your other cards, and want your business.  And they are willing to offer you all kinds of deals to get you to use them.  They will compete for you. If one of your credit cards is giving your problems or you run into a major financial problem, you do not pay your ""all expenses card"" from your ""main checking account"".  Instead that month you pay the ""all expenses card""  with a balance transfer from a ""competition card"", and use the money that built up in your  main account from your pay checks.  Using this method you pay little to no fees, and the interest rates on balance transfers is very low (typically 0% to 6% annually).  You then work out how to pay down that ""competition card"".  Here is the best advice I can give anyone.  Take every no annual fee credit card you can get.  ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T NEED IT.  Take it, then throw the card in a drawer and never use it or carry it with you.  Some day that little bit of liquidity could be a life saver.  That is because when your finances are mediocre to bad no one will want to give you a credit card. ",11년 전,3,

Um, yea. They are clean, warm, hair is done. They own electronics - tvs, cell phones, video cameras, microphones, stoves. They haveeye glasses, a closet of clothes, drive cars, and have been fully educated. Their kids have toys and time to play instead of working or scrounging for food. They are wearing jewlery, playing guitars, and sleeping in beds. I see lots of doo-dads in their houses that could have been savings instead. I know it's not easy, but compared to 90% of the world's population - this is high-living rich to where they can't even fathom living with as much excess. I think we have become so focused on ourselves and what we don't have that we neglect to really see and appreciate how much we do have. I've seen lots of comments aboutthe rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. those that know what to do with money, how to get it, save it, invest it, will aqcuire more. Those that do not know, will repel money. It boils down to education and changing how we think and what we do first, then all those things will be added to us. I may not be ""there"" yet, but I am grateful and can see how much I really have, and am learning to do better each day by self-education in finance and money. The banking and money system is working - for themselves - making profit. It does not work for those that do not know money handling. Check cashing places are the same as banks - making profit. Our grandparents and generations before lived on cash and only bought what they could save and pay for. This is not a hardship - this is the way to handle money. Financial Peace University with Dave Ramsey (highly recommended), Rich Dad Poor Dad with Robert Kiyosaki, The Millionaire Next Door book by Thomas J.

And this whole student loan (read instant debt) business needs a complete overhaul. America needs to revolutionize how college works. In a way I'm lucky I'm now living and studying in the UK. Students here receive a loan from the government that pays their tuitions fees. And students receive (household income dependent) a loan to help them with living costs. Some students even qualify for a grant which doesn't have to be paid back. When the student starts earning over £21,000 (I believe) they start paying their loans back which according to my teachers before university you hardly recognise it. All remaining debts after 20 years (might be 30) is forgiven - this means you didn't make over £21,000 - which is living under the poverty line here or went on to do your masters, doctorate and wasn't able to pay back the loan fully before the 20 or 30 year period came around. Obviously you can't just copy and paste as both countries are different. For one, university sports here are certainly nationally televised prime time events. However, there is certainly a better way than saddling graduates like this young women with debts and scuppering their dreams. America needs to re-prioritize. ",11년 전,0,

My father worked as a roofer his whole life, like all my uncles and grandfather did. I'm nearly positive not one of them ever made $70k even in their best year, maybe $50k in a good year and they earned that money. You know who they hired? Mostly other older white guys with no skills who would work like dogs for $12/hr because they didn't come from money and had no options. It's pretty ignorant to throw race into the equation, it's all about socioeconomic class. My black brother in law's dad is an engineer, his mother a public school principle. He went to college and never had to pay a bill or get a job himself until after college. A black friend of mine's family is from Zimbabwe and his parents owned diamond mines and they are LOADED. Haven't you ever seen Chris Rock's standup where he points out that the majority of Americans on welfare are white? Just because you grew up in a community where the white's were all ""rich"" and priveledged doesn't mean it's like that everywhere. Go to parts of Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts and you'll see poor as shit white folk all around. Go to the Nevada desert or parts of eastern Oregon and the poverty would blow your mind. Better yet, seek out the pictures of Bobby Kennedy going to West Virginia where people live in lean-to homes and trailors with no roofs and the family splits one potato for dinner.

@dafv2011,I find it hard to feel that bad for most of these people.  Justin and his girlfriend are still so young and at the end he says he has no hope.  That is ridiculous.  Justin made some stupid decisions and it is going to take a few years but there is no reason he won't be able to buy a house someday.  It sounds like it has already been a few years since he stopped paying his credit cards so he should be able to get another one soon and start rebuilding his credit.  It will have a high interest rate but he should spend at most 20 bucks a month and pay it off each month.  Within 5 years he will have a great credit score.  That will give them time to save up a 20% down payment if they cut expenses as much as possible.  People just want everything to happen immediately and have no patience.  It takes years of hard work and sacrifice to get ahead financially.  If they were somehow able to get a house right now they would probably pick one that is to expensive for them and they would have almost no down payment.  Then if there is a recession and his business goes down they will be in deep trouble very quickly.    I can't even imagine why the nurse would have her daughter in private school.  That is just stupid.  She should have been in public school all those years and then her mom would have had more in savings.  Her daughter has an educated mother who can teach her so she would do just fine in a public school.  Private schools usually aren't even much better than public schools.  It is just all the kids who go there come form privileged backgrounds and so they do well.  I don't get this obsession about schools.  You even hear rich people complain that they are just so strapped financially because it is so expensive to buy a house in a good school district.  Well cry me a river.  You could buy a house in a slightly less good school district.  Where did we get this idea that we can't send our kids to school where there might be any poor people or non native English speakers or else they will be failures in life?  I went to elementary school with poor people but I still did fine and went to college.  When you are a single mom you can't just quit your job even if your mom is sick.  Even in nursing your skills will atrophy and it is going to be harder to get a new job the longer you are out of it.  If you are out of it to long you might even need to take a refresher course before you can get your license back.  She should have at least continued working part time at nights or something like that.    Why did Debbie the handbag designer go to such an expensive school and fund it all with loans?  I really do admire her dedication and her talent though.  If she was my friend I would give her a 1000 dollar loan with no interest to buy materials without thinking twice about it.  I know I would get paid back because her stuff is good and it would sell.  I hope she can find someone to help her out so she can expand production.  A craft business like that will always have limits though since there is only one of her and she can only produce so much even if she has all the materials she needs.  I guess if she gets famous enough maybe she could license her name to someone that could mass produce a handbag line.,11년 전,0,

The effective income of the middle 20% of households was $64,300 with a federal tax rate of 11.1% or $7,137.  From here  http://realtormag.realtor.org/daily-news/2012/01/03/what-does-average-home-owner-pay-mortgage  you find an average mortgage of about $200,000 with an annual payment of about $12,000. Maybe your state takes too much taxes. Fix it at the ballot box instead of whining.  So in summary: average family federal taxes of $7,137 mortgage payments $12,000.

@aljo909,"Melissa Vasquez The site you linked to is comparing apples and pears. It quotes 'average income' then looks at the global tax from all sources - not the tax paid by an individual or family.

If you compare the 10 most developed nations (highest GDP per head) then the US is significantly lower than them all. e.g.US 24%, UK 35%, Germany 36%, France 43%, Norway 43%, Sweden 45%, Canada 30%. ",11년 전,2,

@aljo909,"Melissa Vasquez ""Even if you take out corporate tax the average American pays more in taxes than for housing, food and clothing combined."" Show the source of your figures (a reputable source, not a claim in a blog).   ""corporate tax is paid by individuals - it's either paid by the shareholders or the consumers."" No, corporate tax is paid by corporations. The 'bottom 80%' owns about 5% of financial wealth. Your original post talked about the 'average american'.    Singapore and Hong Kong are tiny economic zones. It's ludicrous to compare them with a major industrialised nation. Switzerland makes a lot of it's money by providing secret bank accounts. Not an option for the U.S. Even so, according to OECD figures, Switzerland's tax base is 28.2% compared to the U.S. at 24.3%  ""And what has other countries paying more have to do with anything? "" It has to do with making a like for like comparison against other major industrialised countries. That would seem a reasonable way to determine whether or not a country is highly taxed. That's how you find out if a country has a high crime rate, mortality rate etc.   There are 34 countries in the OECD table and the U.S. has the LOWEST tax take.  Your claim:- ""An average American today pays more in taxes than they spend in food, clothing and housing combined,"" was total bullshit.

@whenindrought,"I'm going to go out on limb here but the entire point of the video is that people who screw up are punished with poverty and people who as some put it ""were unwilling"" to be born in the middle class or higher find it hard to make ends meet with nobody to support them or stop them from making bad decisions. These are not some sort of majority as some would like to put it but examples of when this financial system doesn't work. (which in my opinion is often enough to want change in the financial system). Nono but now you are going to complain that I 'don't get the bigger picture'. This is the bigger picture. Use your heads now everyone. Really think about this. Does the financial system in the world function as it should in a hypothetical perfect society? Not 'does it work'. Is it a functional potential system I would want for my children to raise their children under? No. But again this is not good enough for you I bet so I will elaborate. This system works, yes but why? It is because a select group of people have power and they use that power to maintain order using money. Now everything seems all fine and dandy on the surface but I guarantee many fall through the cracks (nope caught you before you tried it this is not an exclusively American thing it is a bigger issue regarding the world's economy which is based entirely on money and power...which is also money.) Think of America, my country, as an oil baron of the world. If you restructure laws then he will just pay the congress off to look the other way or he will make a loophole. How do you keep the baron from holding all the seats in congress? Devalue money. Money is the bigger issue but not in the 'root of all evil' kind of way. Why do people fall through the cracks? Because you can't get money without someone else losing money (an old law that was supposed to spare us this problem but the barons found a way) First step- war. Make the government spend all its money to raise taxes for some war in Afghanistan or better yet Iraq maybe the oil barons might get some profit. Taxes raised on the poor, evade taxes by shipping their money overseas. Step two- lock the middle class behind the poverty line. This could take longer but soon enough they will be 'tough enough' to only need the minimum amount of money to live so we can lower the wages so we can keep the rest. Step three(important)- use news channels and the government to make everyone think everything is okay. Wait I hear a voice in the distance trying to disprove everything I have stated by brushing it off as paranoia. Nope you don't get that loophole either. It has long been known that lobbyists exist and that congress doesn't vote the way of the people (democracy my ass if they ignore the people) and that the media (especially fox) is a bunch of stacked cards. But, oh, I hear you trying another argument that I am circling the problem well if you insist I will hit the hammer on the head. This financial system doesn't work. The world's financial system doesn't work. Let's pretend for a moment it was a good idea like most of you think. It's not going the way it is supposed to. Person A runs numbers and gets ahead, person B works hard and has no time to count numbers. Person A is now richer than person B because he is working on legal loopholes. Is it right to reward this kind of behavior? Should you win monopoly by a loophole in the rulebook? That should be considered 'weak and soft'. I hate my job and I know that I'm too good for it but I can't run off and write a book because I can't support myself. Is that right? Am I allowed use my fucking degree in English to earn a dime? Not in this country. Not in this world. I can only write on the side. If I'm not too busy working both my jobs or getting medical issues I can't afford to treat. Sorry I'm too 'soft' for some of you. Ok that's enough pretending, Earth. This system doesn't work. It's based off a gold standard back when apparently all people cared about was gold. Why change it? It still applies because now, all people care about is money. But nothing's going to change. Many at least got that right I suppose. Nothing will change because we are too lazy and we don't want it to change. It's just like the education system (which I could also tear down because its crap) we will spend billions and billions trying to fix it instead of the effort of making one that works. Why? I'll tell you why. We don't want to think anything is wrong. That's why we believe the media anyway. That's why every man that knows in his heart somewhere everything's been screwed up somehow but won't say a word on his way to his job, the bar, home. ""Everything's going to be okay' we keep saying 'We survived this long. Others have made it, I can make it'. Take it from a fellow philosopher life shouldn't be about struggle but we are going about this wrong. We struggle against change instead of struggling to stop struggle. People struggle to live but we look the other way. All we can think is 'I'm glad I'm not him' you know what the beggars think? They're not thinking 'I deserve this. This is justice. I will suffer till I die for what I have done' I'm looking at a bigger issue we see every day and just walk by without a thought sometimes. Society. It needs to change. We need a country just one little place where they try something new this time. A place where it doesn't have to be the same thing every day if you don't like it that way. We need to move on. The time for screwing around with resources and money when we damn well know that when we die, all we will care about are the smiles and the friends and the love and the moments. I'm not saying leave the world to burn becuase I'm going to die anyway, I'm saying most of these 'problems' these nations are facing are issues we already have solutions for. Like the 'energy crisis'. More like 'organize so we can save our planet!, oh well we tried back to natural gas I guess'. But if nothing in my life changes the only thought in my head will be 'Guess I won't write a book' when I die. That's not right. That's inhumane. I care more for people and inspiration than I ever did for money and look where I am. What justice is this? We need to move on but all our leaders have to say is 'There's just too many people with too many opinions, we can't change all their minds. Our way has worked for a millennia. If we disarm our nukes Russia will kill us all I know it.' And when I tell them what I think they say 'We are not ready maybe in a century, or ten, we need to figure ourselves out first'. They are right. The world isn't willing to change just yet. But every day I know I won't see the world I dream of. It only seems more and more distant. I wonder If the world will ever change. Or if we will just keep saying 'Just one more century of tradition and being on top' 'one more' 'one more' until all of existence is gone. We are not ready to take our lives, the world, or the issues of finances seriously. So long as we can go on our merry way and our kids can pay for another tombstone why not? One more century then... then we will change. So nothing's going to change now but... the least we can do is throw people a damn bone. Especially if they have a dream. That is what this video is about. There's nothing to argue about. There's nothing to disagree with. It's just what we all want. But God only knows if the people who actually make decisions in this country will do something, anything to help people other than themselves. You don't have to agree with everything I said. My point stands. I really can't imagine anybody arguing against what is morally right and wrong. I'll understand if you want to argue for money. I'll understand if you want to fight about grammar. Just remember that we agree that at least one thing is not as right as it should be, society. And thanks for reading.",11년 전,1,

@mepemcl,"Democrat programs advocated by TYT cause reduced productivity and reduced wealth.  Of course accountability by government can help protect consumers from scams, fraud, traps, and abuse of financial power.  However, a lot of Democrat programs also create waste force businesses to do harmful things like give house loans to people who will inevitably default, incentivize people to not work (or to work less) (or to not get married) (welfare cliffs), force arbitrary legal discrimination that often harms everyone including even the people they claim to be giving help (special privledges) to... All in the name of ""helping the disadvantaged"".  Democrat (TYT) programs also tend to advocate over-spending by federal government.  The huge amount we all pay in taxes for such a huge federal government...  There's less resources (and responsibility) left to state & local & private solutions.  People with a large surpluss can't spend on innovation and charity because government takes all their money.  People who would otherwise have a surpluss end up living paycheck to paycheck, with huge credit debt, or worse.  Why does this happen?  The biggest cause is TYT & Democrats.  15.3% in FICA taxes (half employee, half employer).  15% to 35% corporate tax (or small business tax).  Income tax 0 to 40% federal, 0 to 10% state & local.  Sales tax 5 to 10%.  Property tax 1 to 5%.  Misc taxes & fees ~ 5%.  Obamacare.  Plus arguably the biggest taxes of all - inflation caused by printing money, and an ever increasing federal debt.  Federal government spending as a percentage of GDP is over 40%.  And the federal government micro-manages a lot that is not accounted for in that number.  Brain-washed Democrats (TYT) don't realize that when an employer pays corporate taxes and FICA taxes, it reduces employment, reduces employee wages, and/or increases the cost of products.  Even raising the minimum wage has a regulatory cost and kills certain categories of jobs (or forces them into the black market), especially entry level jobs, especially for people who live in low cost geographies (such as teenagers, or extended families that share a single household)...  And more importantly, people with the worst financial problems (in terms of their actual wealth or lifestyle, not their IRS reported income) aren't paid minimum wage - rather they are unemployed or work part-time.  Ultimately, so much of our financial resources, even the entire financial system (the federal reserve) is controlled by our federal government.  Here's a fundamental problem with the ridiculous attitude of TYT & Democrats.  When federal government takes something over, be it our K-12 education system, aid to the unemployed...  Then the resources and responsibility are shifted.  TYT says ""if you don't support federal government take-over of X, then you are against X"".  X could be ""K-12 education"" or ""women"" or ""aid to unemployed"" or a million other things.  But the reality is when federal government takes something over, resources and responsibility are shifted.  A lot of problems can be dealt with more efficiently with custom solutions designed at the local (or state) level and by private individuals (philanthropy, private charity, personal responsibility, family & friends helping each other - to name a few examples).  Don't fall for the TYT Democrat propaganda.  It's not ""federal government take-over of X or nothing"".  The alternative to not taking something over by the federal government is to let it be handled by state & local governments and by private parties (individuals, private charities, etc).  Wealth is not a finite resource.  If we allow the economy to thrive, then wealth will increase.  Democrats are so worried that some tiny fraction of people might end up with an excess of wealth.  But when people have excess wealth, they tend to spend it, invest it, or use it on private charity.  Our legal system and federal bureaucracies is so huage and overly complex it's absurd.  Everything is illegal.  We have the highest prison population...  And btw this cultural meme that every American needs to have their own private house with one nuclear family, and you can't share with extended family or have two families share a house, or get an apartment...  This is another example of a very expensive meme pushed by Democrats (but this one also by Republicans).  You can't create wealth by passing laws that say ""everyone gets a free pony and a free swimming pool"".  All laws can do is create an environment where the free market encourages people to create wealth, which means to do productive work and to innovate and create useful products and services, and to save and to learn personal responsibility, and to decide as individuals how to use resources and time and money...  Or in the case of TYT & Democrat, laws can cause destruction that reduces wealth & reduces productivity.",11년 전,0,

@suburbansentinel,"I get that the American economy (especially financial institutions) do not adequately serve the majority of the population. But I find it hard to feel sorry for the people that are profiled. The leather maker did not need to spend a hundred large in school to make purses. The nurse chose to quit her job to care for her mother. Presumably, the musician did not purchase a disability policy that would have replaced his income in the event of illness. The video service kid really needs to get his act together before settling down.  All choices and consequences. Having an autistic boy is a curve ball that nobody wants to hit.  But everyone who has kids risks that they will have severe problems.  The documentary spends a lot of time bemoaning the payday companies, etc. I too think that these predatory lenders are loathsome dirt bags who have no qualms about rifling through peoples' pockets for loose change as they nail the coffin shut.  But there always has been and always will be people to enrich themselves through the misfortune of others. It seems that the implication here is that we need to change our financial systems and I agree. It is good that the video points out new and creative forms of financing for those not served by existing banks.  But I find it troubling that those profiled are portrayed as victims. Most of us will suffer great misfortune during our lives. Americans have gotten too soft and too weak. Many are now content to wait for someone else to fix their problems, wondering why they are stuck in a rut.  Fixing financial systems is important, but certainly less so than fixing attitudes and the willingness to change.   ",11년 전,39,

@unifieddynasty,"Are you arguing that students should not attend prestigious (but costlier) schools that befits their academic merit? Also, student loans have interest fees that accumulate over time. I'm Canadian so I can't attest to American student loans, but I do know that in Canada, even after the government heavily subsidizes our post-secondary education, tuition and living expenses are still very expensive (over 10k a year). As for the latter part of your statement ""to make handbags"", I think you are acting deliberately dismissive towards small-business entrepreneurs. It's not just about 'making handbags', but about running your own business as your own chief executive. That's a business degree right there. Also, there are degrees for craftspeople and designers too, both of which she has to be in order for her business to be successful.  As for the nurse, you are talking from a position of hindsight and a position with insufficient facts (as am I). It's easy to say what she /should've/ done, but in her contingency moment, she had evaluated her education and work experience and decided that she could be easily rehired. Plus she left her job because she had savings that could support her during her leave of absence. She could not have possibly forecasted or prevented the 2008 recession. I only hope that if your significant family member got diagnosed with an incurable and life-threatening illness, you would not be so heartless as to ship them away to a retirement home so that you could instead focus on your career. Also, the reason why her daughter was in a private school in the first place was because she was doing very well as a professional nurse, before the extaordinary circumstances occurred. As for the car, she knew exactly what she had signed up for. The point was that even once she put her car up in order to get some quick cash to repay previous loans, she could not repay back this new loan fast enough as well. The point is to illustrate the broken nature of this financial system, whereby supposedly remedial measures just end up leading to even more debt.  The young couple wanted to buy the house to start a family and because his lease was ending, not for ""unknown reasons"". I hope you think this is a worthy reason. His credit also sucks because in his youth, he had to put himself through the education system as well as earn a living for himself. His credit sucks not because he was lazy and a moocher, but rather because, in spite of his hard work, he did not start off on an even playing field and he accumulated debt every time his meager wages could not balance his educational and living expenses.  I do have to wonder though - why are you so keen on being a victim-blaming apologist for these wealthy loan companies that capitalise on other peoples' suffering?",11년 전,5,
@mystyc0,"No one has perfect information to make the best choice at every point in their life, but this is one of the basic foundational assumption necessary for an economical analysis based on free market principles.  So many aspects of the banking system exist to profit off of the mistakes of others, and to opportunistically prey on people's vulnerabilities.  That these banks charge overdraft fees or even charge at all for their services, is laughably crooked.  When an individual has money in their bank account, the bank uses that money on investments that provide profit quickly enough that no one notices that their money is missing.  As part of the fractional reserve banking system, a bank can use the same physical dollar up to 10 times at once, essentially using money that does not exist on their Wall Street bets.  All this digitizing of money and money services have benefited the banks the most as it gives them more time to use other people's money.  On top of it all, they charge you for the privilege of given them your money so that they can profit off of you.  The market crash that caused the Great Depression was one that resulted in the banks using all that money and loosing it.  As a result, normal people had their bank accounts emptied through no fault of their own. ",11년 전,4,

I do not 'really believe that you need a business degree' to be an entrepreneur, but what I do really believe is that if you are accepted into a prestigious post-secondary institution, then you should embrace the opportunity. Again you deliberately downplay the role of small business entrepreneurs and what it takes for them to succeed. You seem to think that a seamstress making purses shouldn't attend a prestigious post-secondary institution, but really, who are you to tell her what to do? You cannot argue that they are making poor decisions when you know absolutely nothing about what it takes to succeed in their field.  Moreover, it is entirely plausible to accumulate ~100k in student loans, especially if you study for more than 4 years and get more than one degree. The point is not that this woman has such a large student loan; it's that such a large student loan generates an incredible amount of interest that must be paid off before the principle.

Clearly, you did not read through my second post thoroughly enough, because you responded to that post by stating, ""They made poor decisions that is only their fault"", when I had already explained in detail why each and every one of those people were affected by extraordinary circumstances that were by no means the result of their own supposedly poor decisions.

My statement that, ""You cannot argue that they are making poor decisions when you know absolutely nothing about what it takes to succeed in their field""? You're right, I made an assumption that your situation is not identical or close to identical to Debbie's, therefore you have no qualifications to judge her decisions. Am I wrong? Are you a university graduate with close to 100k in student loans and are your own entrepreneur and manufacturer of handbags? If you are, then I apologise for assuming otherwise. But if you are not qualified to pass down judgement, then I had every right to make that ad-hom, because it would be completely accurate in describing your lack of qualifications - the qualifications that are a requisite for your argument from a position of authority/experience.   By the way, here's a nice little ad-hominem of your own against me, directly quoted: ""if you really believe you need a business degree to start a designer shop (or that it should cost anywhere near 100k even with interest), you are arguing from ignorance"". I do find it hilarious though, that you would accuse someone else of using an ad-hominem when you yourself used one moments earlier. The reason why I didn't accuse you first of ad-homing me is because ad-hominems - in this discussion - are completely relevant if we deem ourselves worthy of passing judgement on whether these people made 'good' or 'bad' decisions.  ""100k in student loans is a ridiculous amount, and you can hype up her chance at a ""prestigious institution"" all you want....it was still a DUMB choice.

Perhaps she should have considered interest more, or perhaps, being the first person in her family admitted to university, she saw the opportunity and honour in attending the university, in spite of the high expenses. The fact that you believe that people should refuse life-bettering opportunities, especially education, for the single reason of a temporary financial deficit, shows how out of tune you are to the ideal of the 'land of opportunity'. Perhaps instead of blaming Debbie for choosing opportunity and education, you should address the direr and objectively worse problem of exponentially higher student loan interest rates than similar corporate bailout rates, or the fact that American post-secondary tuition costs so damn much in comparison to all other First World countries.  ""The fact that you think these people are saints preyed upon by evil men in banking towers is about the most ridiculous thing""  If you had bothered to watch this documentary in its entirety, you would have found this one interesting segment whereby they explained the trend that banks are now closing in favour of quick-cashing businesses designed for the specific purpose of appealing to desperate people. The highlighted problem is not just about banks, but about intentionally profiteering off of the contingently downtrodden. If these companies acted more out of compassion and less like legalised loan sharks, then this documentary would not have needed to be made.  ""they knew (or should have known) the terms and risks going in. Complaining about how unfair it is now is just pathetic.""  Let me conclude by reiterating the fundamental premise of this documentary: every case presented therein had the commonality of experiencing external, extraordinary circumstances. Had these extraordinary circumstances not befallen the people in these cases, they would not have fallen into this perpetual cycle of financial indebtedness.

If The System is so flawed that it effectively subsists on scams and trickery, then I'd say those who succumb to such things are victims of The System.  I actually find it a little irritating that so much blame is placed upon individuals instead of the system-at-large when considering systemic problems.   If I may speculate for a moment about your possible perspective (correct me if I am wrong), is it that you believe when someone faults the system for systemic troubles that they personally experience, that they are essentially blaming you or ""all people?""  Or maybe that they are blaming their bosses, the bankers, Wall Street, politicians, ad nauseum?   In my speculation, I would disagree that there are specific people to blame for the systemic problems experienced by those in the video.  In general, although ""people"" are necessary components of a ""system,"" they are not the only such necessary component.  Cultural practices, traditions, and the nature of our relationship to each other, all play necessary and critical roles in making a ""system"" happen.   With systemic problems, how else would you go about solving them, if not by trying to illustrate the reality of such problems to people.  Our system discourages people who want to become more educated, or who want to get ahead in life by creating financial barriers to these things.  A system that encouraged people to better themselves, would more likely pay people to get an education, rather than bill them and inundate them with debt.  A system focused on the economic benefits of employment and production would have the infrastructure to train and relocate potential workers.   Also, the ""System"" does not automatically mean ""the government,"" and my examples of how a more efficient system would act are not automatically pleas for further state involvement (I am not a statist).  All this requires is collective action, which we typically and incorrectly attribute as ""state action.""   Even within our current system, children are trained and educated, in part, by their family, without forcing said children to take out loans to pay for such services.  Tradesmen, as a practice, take on apprentices who are paid to work along side experienced tradesmen in order to get on-the-job training for that trade.   Our System does not work, and I think we can do much much better.",11년 전,0,

So you do acknowledge the overwhelming evidence that the American financial system profits off of the self-perpetuating indentured servitude of its debtors. And you also do acknowledge that these debtors went into debt by sheer misfortune of experiencing extraordinary circumstances and not being well-endowed to afford any other alternatives. If replying with ""I never said that the system was not flawed"" was the only viable rebuttal you could make against my previous posts, then I assume you have defaulted to my position as outlined above. If you disagree with me, then by all means actually refute what I had previously posted. And while you're at it, you might want to resume your debate with Proteus Avatár as well, unless you've conceded to him too.  ""People should be responsible and know the scams""  So not only do you acknowledge everything Proteus Avatár and I have previously stated regarding the systemic flaws of the American financial system, your only proposed solution to these said flaws is to essentially 'be smart and stop going into debt'??? This must be the contemporary incarnation of the 'let them eat cake' proposal! Kudos to you! Proceed to the stage and receive your Nobel prize for solving global poverty! Seriously though, do you have no better solutions than to tell hardworking albeit poverty-stricken debtors to ""be responsible and know the scams""? What about, oh I don't know, fixing the flawed system through numerous ways already successfully implemented in other countries??

""the fact that if they just suck it up and live frugal for a few years, they can get out of this rut""  Ah, the classic 'pull oneself up by their bootstraps' argument. So what should the nurse with the terminally-ill grandmother and the young daughter do to ""suck it up""? Sell all their possessions and live in a motel with piss stains on the walls? Have the kid drop out of school and secretly become a child labourer? Tell grandma to 'take one for the team' and kill herself because she's gonna die soon anyways? Or better yet, pay for fortune-telling classes so she could've accurately predicted the 2008 recession?  What about the photographer? His credit rating was shit because of his inability to balance the budget when he was still a kid, despite working in his spare time from school to support himself and his family. Clearly he was a moocher and just needed more bootstraps! Screw compulsory education! Sleep is overrated! That kid should've 'sucked it up' and gotten another job or three!  What about the family with the dad being physically disabled and the autistic son? Suck it up! What, do you think you're going to get a free handout just because you can't move your limbs? And who told you to give birth to an autistic son anyways? You should've just thrown the autistic kid down a cliff, like the Spartans did in that 300 movie!  And what about Debbie the entrepreneur whom you've been endlessly disparaging towards throughout this entire debate? Why should she fulfill her dreams, gain a top-notch education, and make her family proud by being their first-ever university graduate, when she could have bootstraps instead? Bootstraps! We must punish those who want to pursue a higher education! What have educated folk ever done to help this country? Bootstraps!  "" But they all want to be rich or get whatever they want right that instance""  Oh yes, having reasonable goals is the real problem here.

I laughed at that more than I should have, lol.  I'll have to manufacture a situation so that I can use that line.  This whole blaming victims who succumb to systemic problems originates almost entirely from Calvinism and Protestant culture.  It is amazing how thoroughly deep that innately religious worldview has embedded itself in American secular culture.  Any possible solution to current problems that requires a change to this culture would thus seem unlikely.  But there is some hope in that regard given the people's response to the Great Depression.  In a sense, the New Deal set the trend for the progressive and social welfare policies now popular in Europe.  Collective action manifested during the Great Depression, despite the very same Calvinistic culture that venerates the rich and denigrates the poor.  Ultimately, change in the US will only arise when the various parts of the 99% that hate each other, learn to work together.   If the Tea Party had joined up with the Occupy Wall Street crowd, and vice versa, that admixture would lead to a ""perfect storm"" that would have resulted in some sort of revolution.  I think it is sort of good that it did not happen that way because I am not sure anyone has a complete idea about how to drastically change the economic system. ",11년 전,1,

@unifieddynasty,"TheVinster17 ""I don't know why you keep trying to put words in my mouth. Nothing that I saw in this documentary was ""extraordinary circumstances"" that could not be avoided.""  By definition, 'systemic flaws' are flaws that are unmitigable by the individual level. This is basic political science. When you conceded the fact that systemic flaws exist, you already, by default, conceded that these flaws were resultant from the system, not the individuals within that system. If you want a more in-depth explanation, I suggest you refer back to Proteus Avatár's previous posts regarding these systemic flaws.  ""Debbie did not need to go to that expensive of a school. There are cheaper alternatives. Regardless of the fact that you think she has a right to go there, taking out that much money was a mistake she made. That is that.""  Why was it a mistake to pursue higher education and increase her marketable skillset? Can you honestly make an objective claim here that will tautologically predict this woman's entire future as a result of her decision to pursue higher education at that cost? Will you ever provide your qualifications? Or have I been debating a 13 year-old kid all this time? You must know so much more about other peoples' financial decisions than they do! Look, seriously, I dislike using the ad-hominem on this issue, but if you are going to claim you know so much more than other people about their own lives, then you need to explain why you know so much more about them. If you don't prove you are qualified, then your argument from authority completely falls flat and you're just talking out of your posterior.  ""The couple does not need a house right this minute. He seems to be on the right track, but he needs to realize that his mistakes from the past have consequences. Its not like he will never get a house. It will just take time.""  Not necessarily a house, but they needed a new place to stay. If you noticed in the documentary, their lease was ending, which means they could no longer stay at their present location. But that is completely besides the point. You must recognize that the reason they could not get credit was because of systemic flaws that existed during the photographer's childhood. Again, let me remind you, this guy was NOT a lazy moocher. He studied and worked his ass off, but even then, it was either provide for his family or balance the budget, but not both. How could he have possibly done anything differently? As I sarcastically suggested earlier, maybe he should've dropped out of school and become a wage slave? How the hell did he make a mistake, unless you think that being born to a poor and dysfunctional family is a mistake? You're seriously going to argue that?  ""The nurse simply should have never quit her job in the first place. Regardless of the fact that she thought she would get rehired.""  Again with your hindsight fortune-telling. Let me repeat this to you for one more time: *she could not have possibly predicted the 2008 recession*. It is most certainly not ""regardless of the fact"", because under normal circumstances, she would have gotten rehired given her weighty qualifications. This means that given the information she had at the time, she made the rational decision.  ""She also could have taken a part-time job at least, which she seems unwilling to.""  She's not unemployed, genius. She got another job after her savings were exhausted during her leave. Just like the photographer, this woman is NOT a lazy moocher.  ""Instead she took a loan out on her car""  Not ""instead"", in spite of the fact. In spite of the fact that she had savings that she planned to use during her leave to take care of her mother, and in spite of the fact that she got another job later, the treatment for her mother put her into debt and she was forced to sign off her car just to meet the payments.  ""and then decided to fly to California (where on earth did the money for that come?) without making sure she could make the payments across the phone.""  She had the money to fly because obviously she has a job, and the flight ticket would obviously be of a lesser cost than if she instead reneged on her debts. And really, how stupid do you think these people are? It clearly states in the documentary that the only way to make that payment was at a direct location, in person. Do you honestly think this woman would've flown all the way there in person if she could've paid across the phone??? This is just another tactic designed by these loanshark companies to stall payments and cause the debtors to become further in debt because they couldn't pay on time.   ""I have no sympathy to her, because she put herself in that situation. Who else is to blame?""  Holy shit. SHE caused her mother to be diagnosed with a terminal illness? SHE should have predicted the worst American recession since the 1930s to occur right as her savings ran out?   ""The banks for causing the Recession? Recessions happen (quite often even), and they would happen without banks.""  Yes, the goddamn banks for causing and collapsing their speculative bubble, and for buying the politicians so they would be bailed out with virtually no consequences!  How desperate are you to pin the blame of the 2008 financial collapse on a nurse who decided to temporarily leave her job and use her savings to take care of her dying mother, instead of the goddamn multibillion-dollar banks? Your victim-blaming is unbelievable! It's like you'd rather fellate a rapist than to acknowledge the rape!   "" And you will note that I have not once mentioned the family with the autistic son, because they are the only ones I feel have even a remote claim to problems outside of their sphere of influence.""  Oh how magnanimous of you to at least concede the notion that being physically barely able to move and having to take care of a mentally challenged son finally warrants even a modicum of sympathy from you. You're a goddamn saint.  By the way, genius, you'll never guess who made this statement: ""This is hilarious....all of these people in this documentary screwed themselves up. They have no one to blame but themselves.""",11년 전,0,

I agree that people need to make wise and forward thinking decisions, but the system is set in a way that people always have to be in some sort of overdue payments or debt. The system today is only set up to benefit a very few, The bankers are not interested in helping people, they are interested in making more and more gigantic profits, while being able to award bonuses and incentives to their corporate executives and shareholders, all this being done by robbing and exploiting the hard working citizens of this country, and engaging in Unscrupulous activities that benefits the pockets of the executive and other top workers, while the country and the economy suffers in return, look at what happen in 2008 with the financial crisis, If these people really cared about the people of this country and indeed the world, they would have been more responsible, without people banks have no Business, and even so they continue to treat their customers like they own them, and with utter disregard. Wealth is being declining within the middle class and hard working sectors of the US population, the 1% is becoming richer and richer by the second, and the middle class is slowly becoming the new poor in the US, and the poor has now been reduce to nothing. It should not have to be like this, something most be done or else the US will be populated with a significant number of impoverish human beings. I believe that if someone works hard and makes the right choices, they should be able to achieve the American dream and live a very comfortable life, I still believe that this is possible, but for God sake we have to get the criminals in Wall Street and in the big banks off the backs of the working class population of the country or else things will not change.

,"Kind of funny; Half the things you wrote are a lie, and the other half are a consequence of problems caused by conservative policies.  The national debt for example ballooned so big because of the conservative regressive tax system that burdens the poor and the middle class, while relieving the rich and ultra-rich as much as they can.  Another good example: Cross-country statistics show that the more lenient the law system, the lower their crime rate and the less severe their crimes are. Criminology has proven years ago that harsher sentences do not deter.  Also you're rather sickening for supporting forcing Christianity onto schoolchildren by force.

@jinto1980,"I vote Democrat because I believe it’s okay if our federal government borrows $85 Billion every single month.  Yet Bush 43 took a budget surplus and fucking it real hard so he could give countless billions to his crone capitalist friends.  I vote Democrat because I care about the children … but saddling them with trillions of dollars of debt to pay for my bloated leftist government is okay.  Yeah I care about children too. My county just announced that next year all the students at school would receive a free breakfast and lunch. Why did they do that? Because many of the parents couldn't afford to pay for a school lunch. This last year those who couldn't pay where given a sandwich and a piece of fruit. While that is a fine meal for the likes of me. I'm 33 overweight, and a diabetic. So that low carb shit is right down my alley. However as a child not having a good breakfast and a lunch is really not good. Sadly that was the only meal some of those children would get for the day.  I live in North Carolina I was shocked when I heard about this. However that is the great thing about local government. They actually give a shit about the people. The new program is a possibility because of a federal grant. So yeah they aren't getting saddled with anything. If anything they could benefit from far more federal money. Education system I'm looking at you.  I vote Democrat because I believe it’s better to pay billions of dollars to people who hate us rather than drill for our own oil, because it might upset some endangered beetle or gopher.  Gee do you really want to drill for oil. When the sun and wind are so much easier to reach. While it might be more expensive now it is what you call a long term investment.   I vote Democrat because I believe it is okay if liberal activist judges rewrite the Constitution to suit some fringe kooks, who would otherwise never get their agenda past the voters.  Yet the supreme court which has a conservative majority. Seams to think that corporations are people... And that money Isn't a corrupting force.  I vote Democrat because I believe that corporate America should not be allowed to make profits for themselves or their shareholders. They need to break even and give the rest to the federal government for redistribution.  I got nothing against profit. I do have something against deregulation and predatory consumerism. I also like taxing them so that we can improve the infrastructure of the nation. Which the majority of those corporations use to make profit.  I vote Democrat because I’m not concerned about millions of babies being aborted, so long as we keep all of the murderers on death row alive.  Yup because killing a person is wrong, and ending a biological function is not.  I vote Democrat because I believe it’s okay if my Nobel Peace Prize winning President uses drones to assassinate people, as long as we don’t use torture.  Yeah I don't think that!  I vote Democrat because I believe people, who can’t accurately tell us if it will rain on Friday, can predict the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if I don’t start driving a Chevy Volt.  Go watch last weeks episode of cosmos. Very good way of showing the differences in climate and weather. So much so that I will not butcher it here.  I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is not as important as preventing people from being offended.  You got a right to say some hateful shit. I also have the right to tell you to shut the fuck up if you don't have anything nice to say.  I vote Democrat because I believe the oil companies’ profit of 3% on a gallon of gas is obscene, but the federal government taxing that same gallon of gas at 15% isn’t obscene.  Sounds like some ole bullshit to me. Sure I think it is cool that the government taxes gas. Like I mentioned before NC has a gas tax South Carolina does not. Let me tell you. You can tell the difference. North Carolina roads are great compared to SC. Pot holes are rare and major roadways are touched up or repaved every decade or so. SC is full of pot holes. The roads are decades old with really shitty patch up jobs. The difference in a price is anywhere from 15-25 cents per gallon. So you can have cheap gas, and shitty roads.  I vote Democrat because I believe a moment of silent prayer at the beginning of the school day constitutes government indoctrination and an intrusion on parental authority ….. but sex education, condom distribution and multiculturalism are all values-neutral.  Go pray in a church, schools are for everyone including those of other faiths or none at all. I wonder what you would say if a satanist group requested the right to pray to the dark one on school property. Sex education was a course I took in the 5th grade. I'm talking we got the full story. It wasn't controversial at all it was something our parent had learned in school. Condom distribution is a good idea, as safe sex is the best sex. Multiculturalism isn't that what America is all about. You know the ole melting pot ideal.  I vote Democrat because I agonize over threats to the natural environment from CO2, acid rain and toxic waste ….. but I am totally oblivious of the threats to our social environment from pornography, promiscuity and family dissolution.  Why should I worry about pornography. I thought you where for free enterprise and all that jazz. That shit sells if you know what I'm sayin. Promiscuity... hell as long as to people have an understanding of an open relationship that is cool. Now just sleeping around with a lot of single people. That is 100 percent cool in my book. You only have one life to live. If fucking like a monkey is what you want to do go for it. Just be safe you dig.  I vote Democrat because I believe lazy, uneducated stoners should have just as big a say in running our country as entrepreneurs who risk everything and work 70 hours per week.  Hey that is how the system works. I fore one really like the idea of stoners voting. When was the last time you ran into a angry stone dude. Not like those old white hate filled conservatives. Sorry ode white stoners didn't mean to lump you in with the rejects.  I vote Democrat because I don’t like guns ….. so no one else should be allowed to own one.   I  enjoyed shooting bolt action rifles when I was in the boy scouts. I understand the need for them. However I don't see the need that anyone should be able to own an automatic weapon. I've had a 38 police special for more than 2 decades I haven't used it once.   I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between welfare and the rise of illegitimacy.  Can the welfare system be abused? Yup. However I doubt that has anything to do about unmarried females giving birth to children. If anything the reduction of abortion services, along side a lack of good sexual education.  I vote Democrat because I see absolutely no correlation between judicial leniency and surging crime rates.  Do you even live in this country. The only people who get judicial leniency, are rich white kids, rich white bankers, rich white war criminals like Bush  43.   I vote Democrat because I believe you don’t need an ID to vote but you do to buy beer.  Yup cos voting is a right. While drinking is a regulated activity. You must be this old to party.. move along.  I vote Democrat because I believe marriage is obsolete, except for homosexuals.  Na marriage is okay especially for my gay brothers and sisters.  I vote Democrat because I think AIDS is spread by insufficient funding.  I go with that and here is why. In the 1980's the government knew about AIDS. I'm sure if they had spent a little money on a massive PSA would have made people more aware of it. Being aware of something usually increases your chances of avoiding it.  I vote Democrat because I think “fairness” is far more important than freedom.  How can being unfair to someone not infringe on their freedom.  I vote Democrat because I think an “equal outcome” is far more important than equal opportunity.  I believe in meritocracy. However since we don't live in a world where everyone gets the same perks as the others. If the state has to step in to make sure that everyone gets a fair shake at something so be it.   I vote democrat because I would rather hide in a class room while others fight for my freedom.  Oh spare me your jingoism. Today's solders aren't fighting for my freedom. I love them for doing a job that takes more balls than I have. However today's solders live and die for nothing more than the financial gains of corporations. Something they should never have to do.   I vote democrat because I’m not smart enough to own a gun and I need someone else to protect me.  Your not even trying anymore. We've already talked about guns. Yeah I'll tell you right now. If there is a deadly situation, and I had the option to call the police. You bet you damn ass I will. That is why I pay local taxes.  For police, fire, and emergency services.  I vote democrat because I would rather have free stuff than freedom.  Again not trying. Who says you can have freedom and free stuff. Like education and medical care.  And lastly, I vote Democrat because I’m convinced that government programs are the solution to the human condition, NOT freedom.   Yeah last I checked starving people didn't last long on freedom. It taste good but it isn't filling. Your being silly as if you can't have both.   I'll give you credit for this rather long troll post. Oh who am I kidding you copied this of some site on the web.

@CrownedFalcon00,"The Earth Circus First off i am not a Democrat, i am a liberal.  I don't buy into the right-wing pseudo-liberals that are called democrats. Second I have taken many classes about business and economics and it has only strengthened my beliefs on this matter. Our financial system only benefits the rich and at this point most things benefit the rich.  The tax loopholes and breaks that have gotten the taxrate of the wealthy and corporations is at an all time low.  During the 50's-70s (early 70s). we had the greatest economic boom ever and guess what.  The US had tons of regulations, fair wages and high Tax Rates on Wealthy and  Companies.  At the Same time small businesses were given fair shots and thanks to teddy Roosevelt many years before there were laws in place that prevented trusts and monopolies.  At this time public services were at an all time high and people like Eisenhower did NOT run deficits instead they ran a Surplus while adding government programs.  Even Nixon (who i don't like very much) did things that were good because he listened to the people rather than money.    Now money runs politics and that cannot be denied.  The financial system is a wreck and only serves the people who make money off it.  The same goes for insurance.  They don't care if they screw the average american in order to make a quick buck.  That is how the banking bubble that caused the collapse happened, DEREGULATION of the banks that allowed them to make bad loans to many Americans. The financial System is the same way they want to make money not serve the people. Without the FDIC and others we would have had the Depression part II.  Also there is no evidence to show that welfare decreases productivity.  I'd argue that social safty nets increase productivity for the reason that it allows people who fall on hard times such as the people in this video to get back on their feet without falling into a never ending cycle of loans and bad choices because they have to.   Are there going to be abusers? of course there are its bound to happen but the societal benefit is greater than the downsides.  The funny thing is most of the money the government borrows goes to military contractors and very little goes to social programs.  If you want to blame overspending blame the military industrial complex that profits off of meaningless wars.  I also believe in the rights of people.  People should have the right to do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt others.  This includes, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  Does this mean people should cheat? no.  Does this mean people should drink and drive? no.  Does this mean that people can commit child molestation? no.  Does this mean  that bestiality is legal? no.  A conscious consenting adult shouldn't have to conform to society.  The funny thing is that when you legalize drugs you get a decrease in drug use and a decrease in crime associated with drugs, this includes violent crime. Rehab should be the name of the game not locking them up behind bars. They didn't harm anyone, prisons shouldn't be for profit and they shouldn't be for just locking people up.  They should be for rehab to put people back into society.  People become hardened criminals in prison most of the time not when they are on the streets, and yet if you have money you don't have to go to prison even though you led the call to run the American Economy into the ground.  Instead the companies get bailed out instead of bailing out the american people and helping them stay afloat when a company screwed them.   Funny thing as well things like cable companies run monopolies in their regions.  This is due to a lack of regulation and this lack of regulation has caused american internet connections to be slower and more costly than in other places around the world.   A little added note on guns, most liberals are PRO gun... However many liberals want regulations on guns so that people with mental illness and people with prior histories with violence cannot get them and kill people. Guns are a privilege because they have the power to make the killing of people very easy.  They were designed TO KILL, and as such shouldn't be given to every person who wants one.  I don't care what the second amendment states, the second amendment is an older, more archaic of the amendments. I respect your rights but i don't want your right to own a gun to allow you to take away my right to live. A gun is a responsibility.    In Short, Taxes should be higher the more money is made.  We need to invest in education and R&D of new technologies.  We need to Regulate business so it doesn't destroy competition and wipe out smaller businesses.  Internet, Electricity, Gas, Water and others need to not be private enterprise, these are necessities in this day and age and shouldn't be for profit.  They should work to improve efficiency and make things less expensive not more expensive and make money while keeping the same infrastructure.  Our infrastructure needs to be improved, our roads, bridges and buildings are lagging behind other nations, and  we need to help the american people.  Life isn't fair, but that doesn't mean we can't give everyone with a dream a fair shot at their dreams. In this current system the poor rarely get to do great things and the rich can do everything.  Money shouldn't be a determining factor when someone is born, great people come from all walks of life.  If we stifle the next great scientist of musician because money didn't allow them to do that then that's our fault as a society.  ",11년 전,0,
@theearthcircus6664,"CrownedFalcon00 Wow that's quite a book you wrote there.  I agree with much of your sentiments.  The problem is that small businesses are regulated out of the market, while big banks are not regulated.  It should be the opposite.  So much of crony capitalism pushes regulations onto the smallest fish while alleviating them for the biggest banks and corporations.  The problem with much of what you have wrote, regarding the ""safety net"" of welfare and ""needing higher taxes"" is that you are forcing successful people to pay for unsuccessful people.  Taxation is the #1 idea of the communist manifesto, and also the major reason for the American Revolution.  Kings tax, free-market economies do not.  America had no income tax from 1776-1913, which was the largest economic boom for America that created wealth, prosperity, liberty, and became the beacon for immigrants to desire to come to.

@theearthcircus6664,"Toughnut I grew up with nothing, and turned it into something.  Rags to riches.  The problem with people who continue to struggle is that they just are not smart or competent enough to rise out of their situation.  And smart successful people are too busy being successful to have the time to teach unsuccessful people how to do it.  Although, there are many books and videos available of how to be successful by people who got successful by writing and selling the book.  That may sound ironic, but that's precisely how it works.  Being healthy is an important part of it all too, definitely.  Most successful people agree that it's not easy.  But humans are natural problem-solvers.  People just need to identify their problem and then work towards fixing it.

Affordable post secondary education without the need for massive debt, single pay socialized medicine with government subsidized pharmaceuticals and government funded social programs for youths in need which cover housing and food for minors. The problems is that the US has a system that revolves around profiteering and people who end up in situations like this have no alternatives so companies appear that fill the gaps and profit off the lack of government support which then forces these people to be stuck in their problems of just kicking the can down the road. The US system has always been about profiteering off others misfortunes and most western civilizations have some for of this of course but the US is the extreme case where the people be damned. Other countries have found a balance but the US has no balance. No money for social programs ""Gotta tighten up the belt and pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" and we cant afford that mentality but as always the US can afford 6 trillion dollars on endless wars billions of dollars scammed by defence contractors during this time as well and that doesn't even include corporate subsidies and tax loopholes that allow another trillion plus dollars to disappear .That's where all the money goes that could be in place if corruption in Washington wasn't so total. The US does not prioritize its people over profits because the lawmakers in charge are paid by those who make profits,that's the big issue and why nothing changes and systems are not in place to help people.

Not good or bad, just that few professional musicians exist compared to dentists. The lady sending her kid to private school is exceptional. Most people can't even afford to think about it (10-20K/kid/year). The guy who edits videos for a living - exceptional. Most people don't get to have such cool jobs.  BECAUSE they were exceptional it fell short of making characters that were easy to relate to by the average person. It was almost as if there was a secondary message in the film: don't take risks, don't be exceptional, or this bad credit thing will happen to you, even if you can make bags everyone wants or edit videos and find people to pay you to do it. Those two folks really didn't have much of a ""problem"" compared to the average person who'd chop off their right hand just to have half that talent.

Add a child or a sickly parent to the mix and I would have been completely screwed.  The diversity of the people used in this film was intentional and a wise decision. It would have been much less relatable if the people being focused on were homeless or working part-time at various low wage jobs. It has almost become expected that people living in situations like this will be struggling. It is not yet considered normal that educated, talented, hard working, smart, and capable people should be living so close to the edge, getting ever closer the more they spend away their savings to cover an continuously mounting amount of debt. Your comments are simply arrogant, making it seem as though you know you are right simply because you have your own business. As the narrator says at the end, these are people who believed in the promise of capitalism, that so long as they were willing to never give up, continuing to strive forward, that they will not be held back. This system, capitalism, used to operate on a simple premise. So long as you are willing to work hard for a living, you will be granted a comfortable life; and if you are willing to take the chance as an entrepreneur, you may do even better for yourself. But, if all else fails, a simple job with full time hours should provide you with a comfortable living. This is no longer true, the system has failed. It only continues to run on faulty investments and mythology. ",11년 전,5,
@Helghastl33t,"***** I agree with you partially, the out of the ordinary life choices do make them harder to relate to. Then again these people are following their dreams (Isn't that what living in a 1st world country should be about?) and getting held back by legal loan sharks that tricked them into signing for loans knowing the conditions were so they would be indebted to them for a long time so they could take what little money they have left. The secondary point of the documentary is that this often happens due to circumstance. Living in one of the wealthiest countries in the world should mean that when something happens you get helped to get back on your feat not held down. The tertiary point (chronologically the first) is that if you get dropped by the banks because you're having a hard time or you refused to play their credit-card debt games you're fucked. There is no way for you to get the money you need for a house/business/car that people who do live in the system have no problem getting.  To summarise, the docu wants the government to step in to prevent people from getting kicked out of the banking system or refused loans because of faulty credit calculations. It also wants the predator loan companies to be manhandled so they cant exploit people when they are down.",11년 전,1,

Why is the system setup in such a way that it was no practical and easy way for her to get a average break. Why couldnt she just go to a bank and get a loan. Why was there ""computer says nooo"" type mentality. Why did they have to drive everywhere for petty stuff. Why was there no regulation to counter these excessive multiple fees businesses practices.  Because the system itself is setup to NOT help people like this. People that under normal circumstance would have had a easy time getting the help they needed.

A person not having a bank card is unheard of where I live because banks can not setup these kinds of rules before they get in trouble with the law. Yes, there are some fees, but they are not in this manner, nor are they allowed to remove some choices in order to promote worse ones for the consumer.  True freedom is having options worth considering. Not having the choice between pest or cholera.  That you despite having had a hard time yourself think the system is fine just seems strange to me.

If you're willing to trust them at their word, then you open yourself up to fraud and bigger risks.  Eventually, if you keep getting burned, you'll stop trusting people...sort of like what happened with the housing crisis.  Anyone who bought a house after the bubble burst (like me) is probably still finding magnifying glasses up their butt.  If you're not willing to trust them at their word, you have to track all of that (or at least be able to get that info).  You couldn't just look at a pay stub...you'd have to have official bank records, which would just about make getting a bank account mandatory in order to get credit.  (There may be other ways, but this seems the easiest to me.)

If it doesn't work out for you... try again... if for instance one has a credit card that isn't fully paid off ... keep up with the regular monthly payments & then try! Bringing a co-signer will get you the small 500 dollar loan n bring the co-signer again for the 2nd 1,000 dollar loan.

The argument that the opportunity to get out of any bad situation or circumstance that exits is complete nonsense.

You simply had the bad luck of being on that flight. The Idea that self determination is all that is required for success is a nice fantasy. That said, Thinking people in the real world recognize the immense complexity of our social and economic systems and that very few individuals have anything but the tiniest amount of control over those same systems.

@ZeitgeisterOm,"porcupineracer2 have you ever looked in to a resource-based economy, a holistic social and economic system in which the planetary resources are held as the common heritage of all the earth's inhabitants. The current practice of rationing resources through monetary methods is irrelevant, counter-productive, and falls far short of meeting humanity's needs. Simply stated, within a Resource Based Economy we will utilize existing resources - rather than money - to provide an equitable method of distribution in the most humane and efficient manner. It is a system in which all goods and services are available to everyone without the use of money, credits, barter, or any other form of debt or servitude. To better understand a resource-based economy, consider this. If all the money in the world disappeared overnight, as long as topsoil, factories, personnel and other resources were left intact, we could build anything we needed to fulfill most human needs. It is not money that people require, but rather free access to most of their needs without worrying about financial security or having to appeal to a government bureaucracy. In a resource-based economy of abundance, money will become irrelevant. We have arrived at a time when new innovations in science and technology can easily provide abundance to all of the world's people. It is no longer necessary to perpetuate the conscious withdrawal of efficiency by planned obsolescence, perpetuated by our old and outworn profit system. If we are genuinely concerned about the environment and our fellow human beings, if we really want to end territorial disputes, war, crime, poverty and hunger, we must consciously reconsider the social processes that led us to a world where these factors are common. Like it or not, it is our social processes - political practices, belief systems, profit-based economy, our culture-driven behavioral norms - that lead to and support hunger, war, disease and environmental damage. The aim of this new social design is to encourage an incentive system no longer directed toward the shallow and self-centered goals of wealth, property, and power. These new incentives would encourage people toward self-fulfillment and creativity, both materially and spiritually.",11년 전,2,

Most people are now having to work multiple minimum wage jobs just to survive, even when they have college education or work experience suited to their skill level. Those people ARE working harder....but the end result only produces bare survival due to the costs of everything else that increase except their income levels. The wealthiest 10 percent are taking home record shares of income growth while the majority wage growth either fell or stayed flat. And then others are looking for work who want to work...but there are less jobs to be found. Many of the people making enormous sums of money don't actually ""work"" to get it...the income is passive, received on a regular basis with little effort required to maintain it. They will still make the same large sums of money even if they are sleeping. There aren't enough rich people able to support all businesses in the United Sates. Rich people do not create jobs, even if they found and build companies to employ people. Without consumers....their company goes down. Businesses rely on consumers, which make up the majority of the country. But the majority of Americans make less than $60,000 per year.  Business don't ""create jobs"" The real job creators are the consumers (something continuously overlooked). Demand create jobs....not tax breaks favoring those with higher income. If there aren't enough people able to buy goods and services (due to lack of adequate income) to support businesses....then demand drops. When demand drops...so do profits. If businesses don't have more customers, they won't hire more workers with nothing to do regardless of whatever tax breaks received. If that continue with decrease in customers...businesses can go out of business. But when people have enough to spend, demand increases. Profits increase. Businesses hire more people to meet demand. Taxes and regulations won't affect business profits if there is enough demand generating profits and the business is properly run. Low taxes & regulations for businesses won't boost demand needed to drive businesses to hire more people...it simply put more money into the pockets of businesses. Tax rates are already historically low.  And lately there's the repulsive practice where even if demand increases for certain businesses....they don't hire more people when they have the ability to do so. The reason is for the sole purpose of increasing their own profits. Businesses in our economy exist to create profits, not jobs. They have more incentives to eliminate jobs- bringing in machines, outsourcing or finding other ways to reduce the payroll. They simply increase the workload of the people they already employ and rarely increase their incomes. To the employer, employees are a cost and the goal is to reduce the number of workers they have to pay. That mean less jobs for people seeking employment...which can lower demand. There's no income increase for the employed even if businesses have increases in profits...which stifle demand. And the same useless cycle continue to widen the gap of income inequality and the economy can suffer. The need is for businesses not only to hire people when needed...but to pay well also...because that is what creates the demand that makes all the businesses work. The key is to make sure 1.-the majority of the country (which is not the top 10%) are not impeded from income growth capable of boosting demand. 2- for businesses to drop destructive practices.",11년 전,5,

@T8fgzz,"Joseph Blowseph Rantings of a delusional idiot.  No one ever invests in anything to create jobs. Corporations are concerned with maximizing profits for shareholders at the expense of all else -- including jobs. The problem with that is it can increasing affect a healthy economy. Demand is created when consumers spend money. When there is a demand, people will see the need and fill it. Demand also create businesses. But demand is driven by consumers. If people have little to no money to buy products and services....then demand decreases as a result of causality regardless of what products or services businesses offer. When a business sees that not enough people are coming in the door and employees have nothing to do, they lay people off. GASP!  You are also under the delusion that a free market can solve everything. There is no such thing as a truly free market. We have corporatism which is also not the same as free market. As the financial world collapse has shown with astounding evidence that not only is free market capitalism a failure at preventing such occurrences, it can bring a country to the brink of destruction.  A truly free market is a perfectly competitive market, which is not what we have. Businesses flee perfectly competitive markets like the plague, and this is part of what makes capitalism capitalism.  Taxes and regulations for businesses aren't the reason for why businesses don't hire, nor do studies reflect this. This argument ignores the fact that taxes on entrepreneurs and investors are already historically low. Entrepreneurs aren’t motivated by changes in tax rates. In the most recent survey the National Federation of Independent Business reports that lack of demand is the number one concern beating out taxes, regulations, inflation, and everything else. An efficiently-run business will already have the right number of employees. Issues like tax rates are just not in the consideration set of entrepreneurial companies. What they need is a healthy economy, because then consumers will go out and spend and buy things that new companies are selling. Therefore, the focus should be on the consumer.

@myxam2201,"*****  Sadly, this is a broad generalization and villianization of leasing landowners that is in most cases patently false. I don't know where you live, but one neighborhood/city/county is not representative of a populace.   My father came to inherit his grandmother's home which is next door to house we occupy at the moment. The home is old, and was apart of his childhood, and he thinks selling it would be an insult to her memory -- but he can't let it sit empty. Five tenants have come through that house in the ten years its been leased, and each has done more damage to the house than good -- he charged $400 a month starting out, a three bedroom, two bath home with full appliances and an internal well -- only utility is electricity.  The first tenant when moving out, ripped nails and screws from the wall paneling, flipped the dryer and left it in the living room and took a sledge hammer to the refrigerators door. Before we could file charges the family of five had fled the state.  Next tenant he raised the rent to $600, hoping to keep it from happening again. This tenant painted one of the bed rooms the ugliest shade of teal you can think of, and scattered popcorn kernals (unpopped) throughout the house, neglected the air conditioner, broke two ceiling fans moving out, terminated the electric bill before her rent ended, and destroyed the yard by driving her boyfriend's pick up through it after slashing the tires. We were able to press charges against her, but we didn't receive anything as she attempted to murder her son and her boyfriend before pleading insanity.  Finally, my father was reaching the point in which he was about to sell the home before I convinced him to let me attempt handling the lease. My first term was first and last month's rent ($1,200), and the Security of $1,000 up front.  Three tenants have passed through the house in the course of my 6 year tenure of being a 'Landlord'. All amenable, accepting of my terms, and generally friendly people. With the rate we've finally had the funds to make ends meet in our home as well as make improvements to the rent property. Our latest tenants -- a family of four -- even helped us to construct a ramp on the front porch, remodel the Car port, re-landscape the yard, and replace the remaining appliances which were coming to the age 40 years running.   Next time you think your Landlord is screwing you, think of how you've treated the property he's agreed to let you use, think of how people have screwed him before, and more importantly; get your head out of your ass.  On to the actual topic of this documentary:  While it makes no direct political statements, it does create an unease about the current state of affairs concerning the treatment of the Lower and Middle Class by the System and the Upper Class. It does a great job of informing you of the realities of the fact that just about anyone can fall to the breaking point and the challenges of treading water with $100,000 dollars in lead tied to your ankles.  But the question really is -- what is the realistic way to fix this? What can you do when you're at the bottom with the rest crushing down on you without discarding your morals? What will it take to change this -- will anything really change this? If you think you know it, ask why it isn't already happening (you are not the genius you think you are -- unless you've got something mind blowingly complex)?

The solution is one practised by western Europe for over 60 years now. Division of labour. Private enterprise has to make money and provide work, the government controls them through legislation so they don't fuck their workers, customers and the environment. The legal system enforces the legislation so they don't step out of line. And as a cherry on top the government provides a safety net from the pockets of both business and people to prevent people getting in to much trouble.  What is missing in the US is a separation of powers, the corporate system has infected the political system so they can screw over the people without consequences.

Yes the owner should make more than the employees but how much more? The average CEO makes 380 times what the average worker makes. They need to realize that those workers are assets. Without employs the company would be nothing. Pay them like assets!  Its called doing what's right! Greed is not a virtue. Not only is it morally right but when employees feel respected they respect you. They work hard for you and take pride in your business like it was their own.

@ToaAnanas,"Da Rush i have taken the liberty of reading all of your current comments on here just to make sure there is something I have not missed, and I have to say your morals are good and you mean well. but you and every other pro communism enthusiast seems either to neglect mentioning or to completely forget that there is one thing that is the bane of all of Marxism/communism: Human nature. perhaps you have heard this a thousand times but for my benefit I will ask you this personally. so how do you account for human nature in this Ideal society of yours? to start with all of the countries who have tried communism have turned over on asses due to corruption and difference in political ideology. the first part of human nature is that not everyone will agree, and therefor if power or any other means goes into their own hands, they may warp said Ideal. mainly this was emphasized in soviet russia where they split into two parties: the bolsheviks and mensheviks. The bolsheviks believed they should turn the government completely to the soviets then rather then the provisional government (who were supported by Mr. Vladamir Lenin who gets way too much praise). meanwhile the mensheviks wanted to follow Karl Marx through and through and first build up the economy with capitalism with the provisional government before the workers rise and become the new masters of their fate.   you see the problem is that human nature fucks up everything. and what if you did have this government? there are thousands of ways it could screw up and crumble on itself. for instance, it is human nature to expect compensation for work, but with communism you cannot expect everyone on equal footing as the quality of jobs is unequal, there for it is already split into a class based system that leaves some people hurting while others live in luxury. it is dishonorable and cruel but sadly that is how things work. and if that doesn't happen then some workers would rather sit back and do nothing or hardly do their job due to lack of motivation or worse revolt.",11년 전,2,

Furthermore, these people end up being customers of other businesses, so underpaying them winds up costing OTHER businesses through loss of customers.  Oh, and most small businesses DO pay living wages, only companies like Walmart, where senior management never have contact with floorstaff, will deliberately underpay their staff so massively (apart from  restaurants, but in the US, they live off tips, but that is a completely different fucked up story). ",11년 전,1,

@DaRush-The_Soviet_Gamer,"Aexeiz Deuam I have no issue with people getting wealthy through hard work. So a doctor of course will get paid more than a brick-layer. But what is important in a Marxist society is equal opportunity to succeed that depends on your intelligence and not your Parents ability to fund your education. Education of all kinds should be 100% free to the individual, but you should pass aptitude and intelligence tests before you are allowed to enrol in order to make sure tutor's time is not wasted on incapable minds.  Again I have no issue with a doctor getting on average more money than a shopkeeper. It is ok, but I hate people getting ahead on their inheritance and worse yet rent-based cash-cows. While humans are naturally not equal the opportunity to succeed should depend on your skill and intelligence and not on your/your parent's wallet.and connections.  So if a chav's son or daughter is smart and is given the opportunity to succeed in education the state must pay her/his way through higher education until his/her maximum potential is reached otherwise the greed results in a waste of resources and someone who could have been an astronaut is cleaning toilets.  Human nature can be a pain to overcome.... The best way to combat greed and evil is through good and moral education for the masses starting as young as possible....  Education is what separates good, intelligent and civilized people from barbarians.  Peaceful existence and an equal start in life is something any intelligent person would choose. Not to mention sense of security and safety through total co-operation and working towards common goal through sharing of resources and information. (The internet crowdsourcing and crowd-funding is a perfect example of Marxism at work)  The other option is endless competition and struggle... Inherited inequality and no purpose in life unless you are fortunate enough to come out of the right vagina, or be lottery-grade lucky.  Capitalism is a waste of opportunity and a waste of potential to achieve the ultimate societal performance. One minor hiccup can end in tragedy and death.  Communism may feel unnatural to those who prefer to work with natural selection, but it isn't unnatural as those who can excel will regardless of their financial status, or class, but we are also civilised enough to look after those who are too handicapped to be at the top for whatever reason.

(Don't get me wrong, I know that he isn't the ideal self made billionaire story, he freely admits he was extremely lucky, but he's very knowledgeable in business.) I get that people don't want to give up the equity, and that is fine if you can afford to not give it up, but people refuse to even knowing that their business is on the edge of financial collapse. I'm a business student and learned about all of these pitfalls in class.  Life is hard, it is a lot harder when you're stupid. Educating yourself in your field of employment isn't enough. My father pulled six figure incomes for decades and retired broke due to the Enron scandal. He is brilliant in his field, he can't even talk about his work with anybody else because it always goes over our heads, an absolute genius at what he does. When it comes to understanding finances, he's just never cared or bothered to learn.  I make it in this life because I've learned from other people's mistakes. Other people don't feel the need to educate themselves on how banks operate, or how to read a contract, and then blame others for their misfortunes.  Yes, people will seek to exploit the less fortunate. Since people are aware that people will seek to exploit them, they should use common sense and learn how to protect themselves against it. If they know people will try to exploit them, and they take no steps to prevent it...they are also to blame.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
