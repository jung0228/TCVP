@Sevilla1905-c5s,"I recently had a very unusual and confusing relationship with an anime/goth girl. She goes to college with me and I really liked her both for her looks and for the music she listens to. I approach her and she was very warm to me and even thanked me a lot for approaching her, only to throw a seen at my message on Instagram a few days later and ignore me in meetings. So she started saying hello, but nothing more than that. Admittedly, she really likes online attention and that's the most important thing to her, but this experience was very strange. Also that girl considers herself very absurd. And many of her videos are very childish and cringe-worthy",4개월 전(수정됨),0,

@7Romera,"Confess the Lord Jesus Christ with your mouth and believe in your heart that He died for your sins on the cross and God raised Him from the dead on the third day; repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit!  Evidence for Jesus Christ’s existence, crucifixion, and disappearance from the tomb (He rose from it):  The Lord Jesus Christ did exist, gathered disciples, and was crucified and went missing from the tomb. To argue about wether He was taken from the grave or rose from it, is an argument a skeptic can make. Because well if you disregard the eye witness testimony of the disciples and there willingness to die for Christ, and humans won’t die for something they know is a lie, when Peter is pinned upside down to that cross, he could have said that it was a fake, but He didn’t because it wasn’t, what care would he have about death in this world if he knew for a fact he had assurance of a life in another, Jesus Christ did rise from the tomb and is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Now the evidence for the Lord Jesus Christ’s existence really isn’t hard to find a multitude of non-Christian scholars and historians mention Him within 150 years after the time of His life. One such is Tacitus a Roman historian who reported on emperor nero’s decision to blame the Christians for the fire that had destroyed rome in 64 AD. Tacitus wrote:  “Nero fastened the guilt ... on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of ... Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome…”  In this Tacitus makes reference to not only Christians, but Christ calling Him Christus and confirming the Gospels going on to say that He suffered the extreme penalty (crucifixion) under the reign of Tiberius and by the sentence of Pontius Pilate, which like I said confirms the Gospels narrative.  Another important source of evidence about Jesus and early Christianity can be found in the letters of Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan. Pliny was the Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor. In one of his letters, dated around A.D. 112, he asks Trajan's advice about the appropriate way to conduct legal proceedings against those accused of being Christians. Pliny says that he needed to consult the emperor about this issue because a great multitude of every age, class, and sex stood accused of Christianity. At one point in his letter, Pliny relates some of the information he has learned about these Christians: “They were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble to partake of food – but food of an ordinary and innocent kind.”  This passage provides a number of interesting insights into the beliefs and practices of early Christians. First, we see that Christians regularly met on a certain fixed day for worship. Second, their worship was directed to Christ, demonstrating that they firmly believed in His divinity. Furthermore, one scholar interprets Pliny's statement that hymns were sung to Christ, ""as to a god"", as a reference to the rather distinctive fact that, ""unlike other gods who were worshipped, Christ was a person who had lived on earth."" If this interpretation is correct, Pliny understood that Christians were worshipping an actual historical person as God! Of course, this agrees perfectly with the New Testament doctrine that Jesus was both God and man.  You may have heard of the scholar Flavius Josephus who mentioned James as being the brother of the Lord Jesus Christ, which matches what Paul said calling James “The Lord’s brother” and there is another document that Josephus may have written which goes:  “About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he ... wrought surprising feats.... He was the Christ. When Pilate ...condemned him to be crucified, those who had . . . come to love him did not give up their affection for him. On the third day he appeared ... restored to life.... And the tribe of Christians ... has ... not disappeared.”  Now it’s up to debate wether this is the entirely original document of what Josephus wrote, or if a Christian had edited it. But regardless he wrote about the Lord Jesus Christ. Wether it was negative or positive like the possible document is. Anyways there are many other statements, documents, letters, and writings of all sorts from the ancient world talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and there is not one question if He was a real person or if He was crucified and went missing from the grave. That is clear as day, He is a real person, was crucified, and went missing from the grave. And He did rise from the grave. And for more evidence of the Lord Jesus Christ, there’s the Bible and you see there is no evidence the Bible is corrupted, a lie, created by the Roman government, folktale. It is the recount of the Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, now wether you want to believe it is up to you. And what profit was there in spreading Christianity, All the early Christian suffered persecution, beatings, and were killed. Another Scholar reported that James the Lord’s Brother was thrown off a building and then stoned to death for spreading the Gospel in Jerusalem. These people went to great lengths even giving their own lives for the Lord Jesus Christ.",1년 전,2,

That is clear as day, He is a real person, was crucified, and went missing from the grave. And He did rise from the grave. And for more evidence of the Lord Jesus Christ, there’s the Bible and you see there is no evidence the Bible is corrupted, a lie, created by the Roman government, folktale. It is the recount of the Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, now wether you want to believe it is up to you. And what profit was there in spreading Christianity, All the early Christian suffered persecution, beatings, and were killed. Another Scholar reported that James the Lord’s Brother was thrown off a building and then stoned to death for spreading the Gospel in Jerusalem. These people went to great lengths even giving their own lives for the Lord Jesus Christ.",1년 전,1,

@Lanwarder,"Why would plastic surgery be so wrong? I was complexed about a slightly abnormal part of my body since I was born (Most people never even noticed) but it was driving my so crazy and sad....in my early 20's I finally decided to go see a plastic surgeon. It only cost me 800$ and I have felt so much better about myself ever since. Why would I have paid for hours of therapy (which I also did, but for unrelated reasons....although hating your own body until you're in your 20s isn't great for self esteem.) Okay, maybe (probably) this person had plastic surgery too and it wasn't to ""make her more normal"", but so what? If that's how she wants to look, why shouldn't she be allowed to do so? You assume she necessarily did it because she wants to go to Hollywood and make millions.....so what? Even if that was true? What is so wrong with that? Plenty of actors gain weight, lose weight, get super muscular, go back to being super thin for roles.....that is actually bad for their health, I'm not sure that whatever plastic surgery she might have had was bad for her health. What's the problem with people wanting to look different? Are we going to start judging people who dye their hair, or cutting them? Are we going to look down who people who like to put on make up or to dress in a specific way that they happen to like? Her reasons are her own and she's entitled to them.",4년 전,0,

@MrsHeeroYuy01,"8 yrs old & this video just appeared on my feed... Anyways,  I love you guys but you really don't seem to understand the cosplay/anime culture. Girls don't do cosplay to get guys, we do it because we like the look, or the anime or the character we are portraying. It's for the community at anime conventions & connecting with other people who love anime as well; when normally we have people around us who mistakenly consider anime to be for kids only, like American cartoons or don't understand how we can watch it when its in another language.  I've watched some DARK anime that are more freaky, nightmare inducing and/or triggering than any horror film I've ever seen.  I'm not denying there are men who would love to put their hands on her, hentai is definitely a thing, but just like the human barbie she didn't do it for men, she did it for herself. The issue here in both their cases is that women are fed these images of the perfect appearance and some people go too far to achieve it. Whether or not i approve of plastic surgery is case-by-case issue. Here  i think both girls went too far. You need those eyes to balance out that super pointed nose otherwise they'd look freaky, so how do they feel about themselves when they take out their contacts & remove the eyeliner. There are ways of getting a pointy nose with makeup alone. The interesting tidbit about anime is that they are drawn with those large eyes & often very Caucasian-looking pale skin is because those traits are considered desirable, but they aren't supposed to be as big as she has made them, its actually just portraying a more Caucasian look, just exaggerated. If this is what they want to look like then I'm happy if they're happy; I just hope they don't end up regretting it..",4년 전,1,

@JoseTorres-dl3kh,"Maybe a lot of you should understand japanese anime. They are kid pornos that are bought at corner stores and gas stations as well as little girls panties that are used sold in vending machines. Jose, how do you know this? I was in japan four 5 years as a marine and in our introduction to coming to Japanese we are warned that we will see these things and that should we as marines purchase or view any such material that we are still subject to laws of our home country concerning kid born. Japanes animes are shows for adults to watch as snuff shows. Their practices would appallingly make you sick. The mother take the virginity of their sons and the fathers their daughters. His comment was him understanding this concept because he is obviously a well informed man. This girl is knowingly putting herself out there as one of these characters in a japanese anime that show little naked girls. It's a sick disturbing culture over there. This is not a joke look it up for your self or go to japan and find out for yourself.",6년 전,0,

@DesireeDisarray,"you dont even know this gitl and im guessing you didnt look into her, ive been a faithful following fan of hers for years! she had past issues as a child being ugly and unpopular with even adults like her teachers telling her so. in turn she picked up makeup and started eating healthier and for animal's sake became vegan. she also strives to be the nicest fun person she can be, you shouldnt judge her because of the way she chose to better herself. I wish I looked like this. Hell, my dad even knows who she is and we talked about that if I chose to do this he wouldnt be judgemental hed actually be excited for me because he knows it's what i want and what im into. i love anime and this girl is an inspiration to me knowing her back story and to me she is beautiful, in no way do I think she is sick. shes just like you and me and hangs out with people who even you would call real people. the real life barbie doesn't even live by her they just see each other sometimes and do shoots because they're considered the more famous human dolls. she has normal friends too who love her how she is",9년 전,5,

There are people who give themselves literal elf ears, others who go so far as to get rid of a leg for a character, etc. It's when they start seeing reality as a fantasy, for whatever reason. Whether they hate their shitty lives and want to escape it so badly they break psychologically and then believe they are in the world they've always wished to be in. What should be fine regardless, can be dangerous because any sort of making them remember that reality exists can turn them psychotic. Pathetic, but real nonetheless.",9년 전,2,

You should no nick pick on her life choices. If you do that, than I have a lot of things I could say about you. Actually, I think many of us do. If you are so against it, why don't you go have an interview with her and ask her why she made that choice. But seriously! Picking on a very innocent human being is just wrong. If you think that is morally wrong, then damn! Have you looked in a mirror lately? Obviously not! I will waste no more of your pathetic time, but just remember, if you think its disgusting and immoral, than don't make the same choice. Its your body and well being. If you wish to gat your body full of tattoos, than that is your choice and that choice might have have its own problems later in life.

@jaredbailey6746,"marci mars Holy crap, why are you so angry with this girl? lol.  I think you largely have her confused with the ""human Barbie"", possibly because they're both Ukranian. The Barbie actually does kinda give me the creeps. This girl probably would too, if she'd been crazy enough to actually have plastic surgery to look like that.  I can't say she's never had plastic surgery (naturally, I have no idea) but the anime look is 100% makeup and, as you mention, disc contacts. Without the crazy makeup, she really does just look like a very beautiful, Ukranian girl. She's thin, but not unnaturally so. Are you implying that any woman who's thin has some sort of psychological problem or eating disorder? Or any adult who enjoys anime or cosplay has something wrong with them? Your comments about ""anime girl"" and toward other commenters make you seem like a very judgmental person, without actually knowing anything about the person you're judging.",10년 전,0,
@leeving2999,"Jared Bailey Holy crap , you are psychic and can tell a state of mind via a YouTube comment ?  You are magical ;) .      I am very thin and have been accused of severe eating disorders because of it so I do not ever judge a person on account of weight . I am terribly sorry that you read that because that is never stated in my comment . I have seen girls do the Anime look with cosmetics and disc contacts alone and think they look adorable .  The two women I am referring to have both had various surgeries but refuse to admit it . Own it if you do and don't act like it is something to be ashamed of . One of the ladies has had a lot less work done than the other but she even refuses to admit  it . I do not understand the denial about plastic surgery to the point that one has convinced themselves and every Anime fan you can achieve the exact look they have sans any surgery .            The two women I am referring to are from Ukraine and Russia ( I do get slightly irked when people still refer to the Ukraine as a Soviet State due to the friends I have that nearly lost their lives escaping Communism as young children  and the fact that they have been separate for years now ) and both did some very underhanded things to others to promote themselves . I know this because of people I know that are still in Russia and Ukraine and they are very open about both women bilking others out of money . It gives the whole scene a bad name . Again , honesty . Their is no shame in being honest but their is shame in stealing from others to finance cosmetic surgery  in order to acheive any look . There is certainly Sociopathy in particular  acts committed by these two because neither seem to grasp or care to grasp that their actions have at least financially harmed others  and were criminal . Oh well ,  at least they look unique .         Now I do think the young lady in England that has achieved a following for her own simple yet obvious Anime look is very lovely . She is completely honest about her look and very humble . I think she has a very sweet personality as to where the Human Barbie and her ex - friend ( they were bickering ) act as if they have a major Detachment Disorder  and both have been bitchy in several media interviews . My point in bringing up the girl in England is that even though she looks like a Anime character she has a beautiful personality . Honesty and politeness is still virtuous  and valued to many people . I feel terribly sorry for people that admire the two that have rampantly lied about their Anime look as both are have acted so warped .      Things get completely lost in translation on communicating via YouTube so my statements about two women may have seemed like an attack on Anime and it fans but it wasn't . I personally  do not like it but have a brother that loves Anime and my son used to . We got lost in San Francisco because my son saw a store plastered with Anime and had to see it . If I objected so strongly I would have never taken him especially considering it was a few blocks from The Tenderloin District which is filled with very obvious "" Adult Entertainment "" businesses . We had to drive down a street filled with strip clubs that had  giant signs  some very explicit descriptions and my son ( 14 at the time) was like "" WTH why are you driving down this street  ? Mom why are you laughing and taking pictures ? "" . As a parent it was akward but my son wanted to go to Little Tokyo because he saw Anime and unfortunately getting there required driving through Tenderloin . Trust me even though my husband and me were both laughing and even our started to we still got embarrassed over driving our child into a porn filled area to get to an Anime store .       And please know my first paragraph was not angry . It was my way of being playful with you . ",10년 전,0,
@jaredbailey6746,"marci mars Thanks for the reply. That's interesting and certainly a good reason for your disdain if they have pulled some underhanded tricks to exploit people. I'd actually never heard of this girl before today, but when I looked at her youtube videos (sans makeup) she looked like a pretty ordinary girl--I didn't suspect any extensive cosmetic modification.

@mochimochu3847,"I agree! These people...This is how the world goes round. If we see someome of unexplainable beauty we point fingers and instantly accuse that person of plastic surgery. We do that. If we see a girl with big breasts, ""Oh that girl got implants"". If we see a man with big muscles ""Eww he got steroids"", but do we know for fact he hasn't spent a large amount of time exercising? So many people today are so insecure they resort to surgery as an explanation of a person that works hard to maintain a figure of great beauty. They think ""If I am not that pretty by nature that girl or boy isn't pretty or handsome by nature either. This is a very good example of coveting or jealousy. Tisk tisk",10년 전,1,

@baby_simik2165,"Instead of judging people who have plastic surgeries and want to look like dolls and all that, you should actually look at those people who have different interests. If people are into looking like this and doing all kinds of things in order to achieve their ""doll"" look then that's the way it is. Exactly the same thing as styles like goth, emo, punk, rock etc. When these styles have been introduced into the society, people were judging them as well and nowadays it is something that you see everyday with less and less people judging these styles. The same principle applying to people trying to look like ""dolls"" or animate.  If you want to talk about it being wrong then why not look at the typical American pageants for small children where their parents put tons of make up on, hair spray, fake eyelashes, fake tan, fake nails etc. How is that not wrong then? Some of those little girls are just bloody 3 or 4 and they already wear all that crap. I was not allowed to paint my nails until I was not 13 years old. So how is that not wrong then?  At least those people who undertake plastic surgeries and all that are adults and make their own decisions without harming someone else (such as obsessions of other people which are actually criminal like child abuse etc).  You have no right to judge them and say it is wrong if you won't look at other things too.  Personally, I don't like people trying to look like that, it just freaks me out the look of them but I don't go around and especially not so publicly and individually and I don't judge them for what they want to look like or achieve!",10년 전,0,

Although, if you look at her at juuuuuuuuust the right angle, she actually doesn't look too bad, like right here: 1:49 she looks kind of nice. Now, I'm not saying she looks totally ""kawaii"" or anything like that. I mean, I don't even watch anime. The only anime I've ever actually watched is Attack On Titan, and I'm not a diehard fan of the show, I just like it and don't try to bring it up in unnecessary moments. That's it. Most likely, the only reason people like the way she looks is because those who like her watch anime daily, and have nothing better to do with their lives (no offense, but it's the truth). They believe she looks ""good"" just because her physical form and her face is based off of something they enjoy. If they like that, then they'll like this.

I don't want to get into a fight, honestly I want to keep peace, but I think it's silly that all of you are fighting and saying nasty things to each other no matter which side you're on is there really any point to this or, are you just doing it because you have to be correct? Media is constantly an influence to everyone because it is everywhere and people take it into their minds either intentionally, or not by just looking at something you could be persuaded into one mind set. It doesn't have to be the internet it could be a billboard or advertisement. As well if you are referring to the fact that this is western media, anime originated from Japan and has a large impact on the whole world, of course I could have gotten the wrong idea and you may have been refering to real life barbie? I will admit I can see how you think she may be taking it, in the end much to far, but maybe she doesn't see it that way, how can you be sure she is a certain thing and cannot be considered living or sane it's possible she is a sane person in fact she probably is. She may have taken her obsession to far in others opinion, and somewhat in mine, but you don't know her life and as noted in the video previously I hope it's a free world, most know this isn't how everyone thinks and that some are always going to be narrow-minded and blinded by fear or because they can't see it in any other way, but I would rather have someone have an opinion and thoughts that are different then others because other wise things would be bad.

In as much, as any really well done cosplay, with a lot of skill, attention to detail, and effort into it can be. As for what I think of surgical alterations to look like this. I believe the best and highest value of plastic surgery is reconstructive. Where-in someone needs it to cosmetically repair the results of injuries. Even so, Plenty of people have gotten procedures like gender re-assignment surgery. And, I think that feeling ""right"" in ones own body is a fair extension of surgery's use. I wouldn't be up in an outrage over some one who felt they had to become opposite the gender they were born to getting surgery to takes steps towards that. So, it would feel wrong to be upset about this.  All that said...While I feel tolerance, attempt at understanding, and eventually mainstream acceptance of what have long been considered alternate lifestyles, is a good thing. I still have a concern. That being plastic surgery as a drug. I wonder if people can get addicted to this. And, if sometimes it is can be considered unhealthy. Moreover, I wonder about societies responsibility to such individuals if it is really a thing. And, if this is an instance of needing to be your brothers keeper. or leaving well enough alone as long as it doesn't harm you personally.",10년 전,0,

To tell someone not to judge is to tell someone not to look.  HOWEVER (again), just because we are going to judge, doesn't mean we need to have biased judgement. The good-nature people can judge a person based on much more varied decisions than just their own preferences.

@molomono9795,"*****  I always think it's painfully hypocritical to claim people who are fixated on their appearance are superficial. Because while some people choose to change their appearance, the motive for such actions can come from a very deep and complex place. Thus making it anything but superficial.  A great example is when people see someone go from fat to fit, often people say the reason he/she went through the transformation was because of social pressure to change his/her body image.  The truth is many of these fat to fit stories are because people want to be athletic, competent and healthy. Even in the rare case of social pressure being the cause. The seemingly superficial change they made is 100 times more incredible if you look below the surface.  Most people who preach body image acceptance are fixated on their social image. How people view them is directly correlated to how they view themselves, rather than actually finding gratification in your current body without social acknowledgement.  So is someone who changes their appearance superficial? We don't really know, but to view this question as a definite yes makes you shallow as all get out.",10년 전,1,

They say that body acceptance is something that is more important than you physical appearance.  Truth is they are fixated on their social image as much or more than those who just loose weight.

@CrossRoadsOfTime,"it's not wrong, people want to say it's wrong, because it's not normal, and they don't want this to become normal. And they don't want it to become normal because if it was then, this could be used as a standard which they are judged by. So they must do everything they can to convince everyone this is total creepiness that is just wrong on every level so they don't have to deal with it at all.   As for the argument that she's wasting so much time and money and effort on her looks that could be spent elsewhere that is really the same argument as before in a different package; they don't want to have to spend anywhere near the time and effort on their own looks this girl does so they gotta make everyone believe she's he freak for spending all the time there, not me that has other priorities. But in reality it's just like any other hobby, for example how much money do people spend on musical instruments, lessons,sheet music, accessory's like carrying cases stands and such. and how much time they invested in learning how to play, and actually playing it by themselves and with other people, that's no small investment either but no one thinks that's a waste. Here she's into makeup and achieving a certain look. It's not really that different in terms of spent effort and money then the person with the musical hobby I mentioned before.  And you can't use the argument that the musician can  play all sorts of good music while she can only make her self look like that.   Most musician's I've seen stick to one style of music just like she is sticking to one type of look again it's not that much different.  I'm not saying anyone has to like how she looks, or that I'm trying to say musicians are weird too because I made a comparison between the two. I could of just as easily picked any other hobby and made the same parallels, heck i could of even compared her to an athlete,  think of how much money and time is spent on training a group of people how to toss a football around a court. But it's far from being seen a weird waste of effort, yet it's way more dangerous, honestly how many people have gotten nasty sports related injuries, accomplishes just as little in the end and yet people don't mind calling that normal.  heck back when I've had to watch espn because my desk at work was next to a tv that always had it on and thus hard to ignore. one catch phrase they used often was ""it's not weird it's sports!""  well excto facto ""it's not weird it's makeup""",10년 전,0,

@Thrythlind,"I am an anime fan...that looks creepy.  However, as he said, it's a free world.  I am disappointed in the attitude that she's doing this just to get famous though.  Some people engage in extreme body restructuring because that's what they want to look like for it's own end.  It's entirely possible that the fame is a simple byproduct.  In any case, no, most anime fans I know would not simply assume that they can pay a girl for companionship just because she goes to lengths to look like an anime character.  Most of the gamer, sci-fi and anime fans I know either have stable family lives or no interest in relationships at current.  Some of your attitudes betray a basic lack of understanding of what anime is.  Especially that there is more than one ""anime"" look.  The look she seems to be going for is the shoujo look, where the huge eyes are characteristic.  Shoujo being anime which is targeted at girls age 8 to 18.  So the comment about six year old Japanese boys is erroneous.  That tall, slender alien big-eyed look is one popular with girls 8 to 18 or women 18 to 40.   Shoujo generally revolves around romance, character development and magic (especially of the sparkly variety).   Some other anime/manga demographic targets:  Kodomo - children up to about age 8, very silly stuff like our own little kids cartoons  Shounen - young boys age 8 - 18, typically this focuses around fighting, friendship and superheroes of one stripe or another.  These are most similar to our adventure cartoons like Superman, X-Men, Johnny Quest and the like.  Seinen - younger men, ages 18-40.  This tends to delve into more philosophical content that younger audiences will either not understand or find boring.  They tend to be cynical, focus on intellectual pursuits, heavy into philosophical points.  Josei - younger women, ages 18-40.  This tends to focus on responsibility, the struggle between independence and dependence.  The question of love vs companionship or love vs romance.  Family is heavily important.  Silver and Golden - older audiences, these rarely are made into anime since older audiences buy less of the connected merchandise and even more rarely make it to the US...there's very little market for them here.   Educational manga - manga for teaching history, science, math, and so on abound.  Again, these aren't as often animated and left as manga comics.  Hobby manga - manga focused on techniques, new developments and interests regarding hobbies like golf, model building, baseball and so on.  Like the educational manga less in the way of story and more in the way of a cartoon magazine.  Also rarely animated.  The pornographic stuff isn't something I know too much about.  Americans will call it ""hentai"" which confuses Japanese because that word simply means ""strange"" or ""weird"".   Japanese seem to use the letter ""H"" (pronounced ""ecchi"") or the term ""Ero"" based on the English ""erotic"" to describe porn anime.  Oddly, Americans only use ""ecchi"" to describe the later soft-core stuff that is limited to frequent partial nudity and heavy sexual innuendo but rarely ever has actual sex acts.  I prefer to watch seinen stuff, though some of the more mature shounen is great and I've found more than a few shoujo and josei I like.  My appreciation of action, exciting and deep storylines, character development and romance means I often enjoy anime that appeals to multiple demographics.  The demographics that most match the cartoons we have here in the states are Shounen and Kodomo.",11년 전,0,

@gayweenie1100,"Firstly. I'm a guy.  >All you fems want is more and more even though you're not entitled to it  Do you even understand what you're saying? Women just want more equality. It is not about dragging men down or taking away rights from men. It is about giving women the same opportunities. And no, women do not have the same opportunities, in both many first world countries and even MORE so in other countries where it's legal for young, young girls to be forced into marriages with men who are more than twice their age.  As well as that, women still don't have even a slightly equal amount of people in many important parts of the workforce as men do. Literally. All it takes is a quick search online on gender inequality in jobs to figure this out.  Feminism is not supposed to be about dragging men down. Modern feminism is about removing harmful gender stereotypes, double standards, and social pressure on gender. You know. The whole ""men have to be masculine or else they're not worth anything,"" or ""women have to be pretty, smart, soft-spoken, and the spitting image of femininity, otherwise they're a dumb ugly slut.""  But you CAN'T fucking tell me that women have it any easier than men do in most parts of life. They have a higher chance of getting sexually assaulted, abused, depressed, have to constantly deal with harmful and unrealistic messages about body image, held up to RIDICULOUSLY higher standards than men (a guy is applauded for sticking his dick in as many women as he can, but a woman is shamed for doing the same thing.)  Just because men also face issues (that are also important and we need to fix,) does NOT mean that we should completely turn our back on women. Feminism is about equality. I mean, it seems like a lot of people are going towards the term eglitarian due to all of the harmful and misinformed stigma that has been attached to the word feminism, but labels do not matter as long as everyone is going towards the end goal of neither gender being held above one another in any case.  Which a lot of people aren't doing when they don't want to call themselves feminists. They push and complain against any progessive actions without realizing that they're also hurting themselves in the process.  If there's some sort of source that has twisted your idea of feminism, I'm very sorry (part of me is guessing Tumblr.) But many of the things that make feminism sound ""harmful"" is simply misinformation circlejerked by guys who literally have never actually let themselves take a grain of salt in the matter.  ""Fems"" have been taking a backseat for quite a while, actually...the whole point of feminism is about making sure that everyone is at an equal level based on different amounts of attention for each gender in different areas...taking a backseat is very...well, backwards.",11년 전,3,

What really pisses me off is that girl in the back that automatically judges because she thinks she had all this ""surgery"" (which she did not) to look that way, now what surprises me is that I'm sure hundreds of people  have had surgery to look look a certain way and just because she goes for a new yet different look and not the average choices of people who decide to use plastic surgery, everyone automatically  starts judging.   I mean compare any woman who has had Botox and breast implants to Anastasia Shpagina  who has an extremely realistic anime look yet no fake plastic surgery what so ever, just really good makeup skills. most people would probably deem the 1st woman with plastic surgery in a way normal and part of society yet Anastasia as fake and weird. You see i've just compared two woman, one has had surgery botox,etc and the other has had no surgery and is natural yet different, unique. yet  one is still deemed  more normal than the other( I'm sure you can figure out which one is ""normal"") doesn't it go to show how twisted and easily judging of the different humanity is?

I was also thinking how wild and insane it would be if you were actually tripping balls on shrooms or LSD while chilling at a park and running into this girl.

I could only imagine the look on my face of the blend of awe, surprise, confusion, and intrigue plastered all at once.

Also, I'd hit that, and hit it hard. Hey, she is pretty, and it's not like it's every day that you get the chance to lay an ACTUAL anime girl.

@occamsrazor1285,"As a liberal myself, from a liberal family living in what could be arguably called the liberal capitol of American (San Francisco), I find that it's usually that we have perceived some-sort of slight against us in the past. Usually the feeling of being outcast by a conservative community because we spoke our minds.  As such, we tend to be ready to take up the cause of righteous crusade for anyone we feel is being slighted (almost living vicariously through them, coming to their defense when no on came to ours).  Sometimes you get wise liberals that will admit two things: 1) it's not that we were outcast for speaking our minds, its for causing trouble and drama for the sake of causing trouble and drama 2) There are only so many causes, and an abundance of liberals looking to take up a cause. Eventually you're going to get arguments about saving the nematodes from some shoreline construction project...  There is a fine line between speaking your mind, utilizing your 1st amendment right (I say a lot of inflammatory things here on youtube, but I also know that they wont affect anyone, positively or negatively.

And while I will grant you that sometimes they are, that's not always the case.  How can we know she has the same mentality as the girls who want to look like the ones in photoshopped images? We don't. The only thing we know is that she likes to take cosplay to the extreme. Or did you make the assumption that she's seeking some kind of beauty expectation because anytime a female does anything with her looks it's always because she's unhappy with herself? Right?  I like to dress like a vampire everyday. I wear Alchemy jewelry, black clothes, fake fangs, and the whole nine yard. I'm saving up money to modify my teeth. Why do I do it, because I love vampires. Obsessed? Likely. Unhealthy? No. I can certainly tell you that I am very content with my life. I have a job, good friends, and a supporting family. It's probably the same for this girl only with anime.  Whether she is unhappy with herself, you don't know anymore than I do. Something is only unhealthy if it causes harm or distress in the person's life or causes them to harm someone else. I personally think the girl is just obsessed with anime as I am with vampires  which is perfectly fine. The only thing wrong with it is that it doesn't fit into what you people deem as ""normal"", and that's what's fucked up about society.",11년 전,1,
@pinkqueenscookie,"*****  I didn't say unnecessary surgery was bad or that she was an unhappy person in general. And yeah that is unhealthy. We are humans, not anime characters or vampires.  ""You people"" Lmao wow I guess you don't think you're human. This is pointless, you have your view and I have mine. Let's just leave it at that.",11년 전,1,
@Souls_Are_For_Squares,"No. What about it is unhealthy? Can you explain that to me?  You people? The people who can't accept differences. The people who think it's unhealthy to stand out from the crowd. The people who people who are ready to point the ""unhealthy"" finger at somebody even though they don't hurt anyone else or themselves and only because it's outside the norm. Yes. You people. The one's that not willing to make a change in the world, but wants everyone to be the same because according to ""you people"" if it's different it's not right.  You can't give a decent reason as to why it's unhealthy because you don't have one. You looked at this girl, saw that she didn't fit into your standards, and you immediately labeled her ""unhealthy"", ""unnatural"", and ""weird"".  Something is only unhealthy if it causes distress in the person's life. We don't know if she is unhappy or distressed, therefore, we can not say that she is not healthy. Unless, by your standards, if it doesn't fit it, it's not right.",11년 전,0,
@pinkqueenscookie,"***** It's common sense. Obsession is not healthy. Please research that yourself I am not going to write an essay for you. Anime and Vampires are not real, if you wanna strive to be something you will never be that is your business. This isn't about being different, dressing like a lolita is different. Changing your face and shaving part of your skull and bleaching your skin to look like a lolita DOLL because you have an obsession is unhealthy. Stop trying to hide behind the word different. The world does not have to accept people who don't want to be human. ",11년 전,2,
@Souls_Are_For_Squares,"""The current version of the DSM characterizes a mental disorder as “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual [which] is associated with present distress...or disability...or with a significant increased risk of suffering.”"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders  As I said, if it does not cause distress in the person's life it is not unhealthy, and we don't know whether she is distressed or not. Dressing Lolita has become socially acceptable. Modifying your body to look like a doll has not, and that's why you are against it. I've done my homework, and you've just proved my point. You sheep can't accept anything that isn't ""normal"".",11년 전,1,
@pinkqueenscookie,"***** Mhmmm. I said obsession. What you have pulled up is from wiki (so credible) and about mental disorders in general.  You have not proven that obsession are in fact healthy. Classic. If I am a sheep you are not better, a person who cannot see beyond their own lashes. This girl is like you so you feel the need to bash those who don't think that this is a healthy self-image. And fyi lolita is not acceptable. My high school will not allow students to dress like that, as do many. I DO NOT have to conform to fit your standards nor do you to mine. I never said this girl was stupid or needs to stop. I only hope that she doesn't get in too deep. And yeah I think she looks creepy and uncute but I am aware that this portion is an opinion, albeit a majority one.  So why don't you get off your high horse, you are not perfect. :-)",11년 전,1,
@Souls_Are_For_Squares,"You said unhealthy. I assume mental disorders since we're not talking about physical. And the content that was in the Wikipedia article was quoted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders. If you don't trust that, then how about this? Why don't you prove to me why obsession is unhealthy? Give me a good reason why one's obsession is bad. Give me a good reason why anything that does not harm the person in question or another human is bad. I want to know.  I'm not bashing you, I'm arguing with you because I want to know why so many people have a hard time accepting things they are not used to. You are entitled to your opinion but, often times, but often times this opinion leads to bullying and discrimination (not saying that you bully and discriminate but, many times, this mindset leads to it). I called you a sheep because saying things like it's ""unnatural"", ""weird"", ""unhealthy"" makes it sound like you follow the heard which would make you like a sheep.  Where did you get ""conforming to fit my standards"" from? I never said anything like that. I want you to do what you want to do and make your own choices. That's what I'm arguing for. Neither did I say I was perfect. I am very much aware that I'm not and where you are getting the idea that I think otherwise baffles me.  Anyway, I didn't know you were still in high school. I will take that into account and give you the benefit of the doubt considering that, at your age, everything is about fitting in. I only hope this is something that you mature out of, though. When I was in high school people treated me like shit because I was considered ""out of the ordinary"". I don't know what's popular in the high schools these days, and I don't know too much about the Lolita thing (aside from the fact that I see it from time to time on the net) but I do know that too much is considered ""unhealthy"" and ""unacceptable"" in society when no one is harmed in the outcome. People will be hypocritical, accepting one thing that's ""different"" and another that's not because it hasn't been condoned by society and, quite frankly, I'm tired of it.  ",11년 전,0,
@pinkqueenscookie,"Oh I think she could have a metal disorder but mostly I just worry about people who obsess too much, you may not hurt those around you but you can be hurting yourself. I don't get why people need to go to extremes, what is wrong with being human?  She looks like she could have body dimorphic disorder. Let me ask you something, what is too far for you? For me it would be something like getting fangs but compared to that I have a friend who loved vampires too, but she's now in 'rehab' because she took it too far (according to her parents)  she started drinking blood (nothing illegal). I didn't know it was unhealthy until they explained it and i realized we can like whatever as long as we realize that we will never be more than human. I also have a friend who has an obsession with cats but she doesn't want to be one. I don't think weird is a negative word, me and all of my friends are weird! To me burn victims are more beautiful than plastic artifice. I won't argue that she is unhealthy, who knows maybe she plans to stop here unlike her friend or the woman who was Japanese and became a 'French doll'",11년 전,0,
@Souls_Are_For_Squares,"pinkqueenscookie For me, what is too far is someone who is causing themselves or someone else harm. I will admit, some obsessions can be bad, but that is when the person is having trouble in life (eating, drinking, sleeping, taking care of themselves, etc) because of it. If this girl does what she does out of depression or hate for herself then, I will agree, she is unhealthy, and I would advise her to seek help. But from what we've seen here, all we know about this girl is that she takes anime to the extreme. It doesn't have to mean that it's bad. It could simply mean that she really likes anime, granted more than others, but that's all it could really mean, and changing her looks could just be something she aspired to do. Kind of like those people who do ""out there"" things to get into the book of world records. I guess, what I'm getting at is, we shouldn't judge her until we get to know her reasons.   And the same could be said about me with my vampire thing. If I were drinking blood, hurting people, hating myself because I know I could never be a vampire, then I would consider myself unhealthy and get some help, but I don't do any of those things. I live a normal life. Hang out with friends. Go to work every morning and take care of myself, and I am very happy with myself and my life. I just happen to like dressing like a vampire. Your friend that liked vampires, I would consider her unhealthy because she crossed the line when she participated in the unhealthy act of drinking blood. We know that drinking blood is unsanitary and can cause harm to her body. The fact that she felt the need to drink, even knowing the harm it causes and to the point that she needed rehab to stop, that lets me know that, in her case, it was unhealthy. The line is only crossed when harm is done to someone whether it be the person in question or someone else. If it's something the person wants to do and it satisfies them without anyone being hurt or suffering depression or distress in the process, I say, let them continue.",11년 전,1,

It also sends out the wrong message to others, which may not affect the girls themselves, but the world does consist of more people than just Ms. Barbie and Ms. Anime, and after those two are gone (Ms. Barbie might leave quite soon if she does her sunlight and air diet), the others will still be here, cutting off bits of their body to look more ""beautiful"".",11년 전,0,

@XkriskrossX,"cassl14 I believe that she did this out of her own volition and not some sort of standard set by society. I mean look at her, is that an achievable standard to you? The positive feedback for her is likely those who hate definitions of beauty. Jokingly, I never saw this one as a standard. It's unnatural and creepy looking. In fact I don't think you can take cartoon animation and make it real. Most people would agree.  I also see obsessive attitudes about enforced acceptance of personal choice where she's told she shouldn't comply to standards set by our culture. This ""You have a choice bandwagon"" is actually deceptive & hypocritical because these equal rights factions are actually telling her to sit still and don't do anything crazy. Doesn't that seem wrong to you? I thought this was about choice. Good or bad.  A lot of people contradict themselves getting upset over ""beauty standards"" when this is someone has an entirely different idea. Weird? Yes. Strange? Of course.. Should EVERYBODY follow in her footsteps? Umm.. let the parents decide..  but when people behave holier than thou when it comes to what's okay and what isn't.

I think it's a creepy doll too. I can doubt she'll find a guy who can stay with her without bursting into laughter for more than a minute but using a white knighted approach of equality to advocate against individual choices in life will end up hurting us. It's a dangerous thing to do. Not only as a society but as a species. We love to dictate other people. This hasn't changed..

@7Romera,"Confess the Lord Jesus Christ with your mouth and believe in your heart that He died for your sins on the cross and God raised Him from the dead on the third day; repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit!  Evidence for Jesus Christ’s existence, crucifixion, and disappearance from the tomb (He rose from it):  The Lord Jesus Christ did exist, gathered disciples, and was crucified and went missing from the tomb. To argue about wether He was taken from the grave or rose from it, is an argument a skeptic can make. Because well if you disregard the eye witness testimony of the disciples and there willingness to die for Christ, and humans won’t die for something they know is a lie, when Peter is pinned upside down to that cross, he could have said that it was a fake, but He didn’t because it wasn’t, what care would he have about death in this world if he knew for a fact he had assurance of a life in another, Jesus Christ did rise from the tomb and is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Now the evidence for the Lord Jesus Christ’s existence really isn’t hard to find a multitude of non-Christian scholars and historians mention Him within 150 years after the time of His life. One such is Tacitus a Roman historian who reported on emperor nero’s decision to blame the Christians for the fire that had destroyed rome in 64 AD. Tacitus wrote:  “Nero fastened the guilt ... on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of ... Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome…”  In this Tacitus makes reference to not only Christians, but Christ calling Him Christus and confirming the Gospels going on to say that He suffered the extreme penalty (crucifixion) under the reign of Tiberius and by the sentence of Pontius Pilate, which like I said confirms the Gospels narrative.  Another important source of evidence about Jesus and early Christianity can be found in the letters of Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan. Pliny was the Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor. In one of his letters, dated around A.D. 112, he asks Trajan's advice about the appropriate way to conduct legal proceedings against those accused of being Christians. Pliny says that he needed to consult the emperor about this issue because a great multitude of every age, class, and sex stood accused of Christianity. At one point in his letter, Pliny relates some of the information he has learned about these Christians: “They were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble to partake of food – but food of an ordinary and innocent kind.”  This passage provides a number of interesting insights into the beliefs and practices of early Christians. First, we see that Christians regularly met on a certain fixed day for worship. Second, their worship was directed to Christ, demonstrating that they firmly believed in His divinity. Furthermore, one scholar interprets Pliny's statement that hymns were sung to Christ, ""as to a god"", as a reference to the rather distinctive fact that, ""unlike other gods who were worshipped, Christ was a person who had lived on earth."" If this interpretation is correct, Pliny understood that Christians were worshipping an actual historical person as God! Of course, this agrees perfectly with the New Testament doctrine that Jesus was both God and man.  You may have heard of the scholar Flavius Josephus who mentioned James as being the brother of the Lord Jesus Christ, which matches what Paul said calling James “The Lord’s brother” and there is another document that Josephus may have written which goes:  “About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he ... wrought surprising feats.... He was the Christ. When Pilate ...condemned him to be crucified, those who had . . . come to love him did not give up their affection for him. On the third day he appeared ... restored to life.... And the tribe of Christians ... has ... not disappeared.”  Now it’s up to debate wether this is the entirely original document of what Josephus wrote, or if a Christian had edited it. But regardless he wrote about the Lord Jesus Christ. Wether it was negative or positive like the possible document is. Anyways there are many other statements, documents, letters, and writings of all sorts from the ancient world talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and there is not one question if He was a real person or if He was crucified and went missing from the grave. That is clear as day, He is a real person, was crucified, and went missing from the grave. And He did rise from the grave. And for more evidence of the Lord Jesus Christ, there’s the Bible and you see there is no evidence the Bible is corrupted, a lie, created by the Roman government, folktale. It is the recount of the Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, now wether you want to believe it is up to you. And what profit was there in spreading Christianity, All the early Christian suffered persecution, beatings, and were killed. Another Scholar reported that James the Lord’s Brother was thrown off a building and then stoned to death for spreading the Gospel in Jerusalem. These people went to great lengths even giving their own lives for the Lord Jesus Christ.",1년 전,1,

I honestly don't understand the misconception that all people watch anime because they are attracted to cartoon characters.

NORMAL people grow out of cartoons,",11년 전,0,
@pinguefy,"Hunter W Like Joseph said, the word ""normal"" is highly subjective and varies on a person to person basis. You might think normal people are the ones who do what everyone else does, while I might think that normal people are the ones who do whatever they want. This point holds no ground.  Why is a cartoon so ""childish"" while shows like Breaking Bad or things of the like mature and fit to be seen be all ages? What if you took Breaking Bad, all of its dialogue, plot, characters etc. and made it into an animated series? Is this not allowed to be viewed by ""normal"" people? Whether or not it's acted out on a set or animated shouldn't have an effect on whether or not someone watches it. It should be solely based on what the series has to offer in its characters, plot, and so on.  ""it's almost always dorks that dress weird or children. "" I almost didn't want to address this statement because of how ignorant and generalizing it is. Of course there are people who enjoy dressing up as characters, going to conventions and coming together with people with similar interests and that's just what they enjoy. But anime isn't anything more than another way to tell a story. Sure, it has its tropes that traditional television doesn't, but that doesn't automatically mean all anime are the weird children's shows that you seem to think they are.   But, given that you classify your friends as ""dorks"" simply for consuming a different type of media than you do, I don't I'll be able to persuade you through basic logic.",11년 전,1,

By using make up she's transformed herself into Megan Fox, Johnny Depp, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Marilyn Monroe, Lana Del Ray, Marilyn Manson and more. She's also not the only person on Youtube who makes these transformation videos so why are you targeting her alone? Be honest, the only thing you people really don't like is that she's a white girl applying make up to look like an asian cartoon character. Why does it make you so uncomfortable? Are you looking down on her for doing this?   And also! just because a girl puts make up on does not mean she's trying to prostitute herself out.I Its obvious when you watch Anastasiya's videos that she treats make up like art tools and her face is her canvas.

@maxspiers480,"After further consideration, I'd like to correct myself. As outlandish as this may initially sound, it's most likely that your style is based on a fear of death. Bear with me.. Instinctively, humans are social beings, being that we desire the approval of others. This desire is an evolutionary hangover dating back to a time when being accepted into a group lead to a more successful chance to survive. Your choice in style is a reflection of that and how you feel the best way to achieve that is.",12년 전,0,
@maxspiers480,"I understand all that. But you're not looking deep enough into the question of why it actually pleases you. It all comes down to a subconsciously underlying factor of what actually motivates us. Humans are on this planet to survive and procreate. The complicated emotions we feel and the actions we take either derive from our basic primal feelings towards the opposite sex.. (or sometimes same sex) or our fear of death. Although you may not be aware of it, your wardrobe is based on one those two.",12년 전,0,
@Starslikediamonds,"Most often style is a combination of what the individual likes and what is well-known. Now, sometimes sexual attraction is a part of it, but not always, as this man is insinuating.

And (possibly) getting a plastic surgery on her nose is taking things a little too far. Now I don't condemn her for doing so and I don't hate her for it but still in my opinion she is going overboard with this. But if she really likes to do this kind of stuff then good for her.

@ElegeantFencer,"Fuck, I hate it when TYT covers a story that is Japanese/anime-related. Usually because many of the commenters who watch these start to develop ideas about many negative stereotypes about Japanese culture. As someone who admires Japanese culture I cannot stand the ignorance. Yes Japanese society has its imperfections, but those imperfections don't reflect the Japanese as a whole.",12년 전,0,

@RoninDave,I live in Japan and what I find funny in this kind of story is that anime isn't as huge with the Japanese as much as anime fans outside of Japan think it is. Usually anime fans come over and are in gaga land for a while but if they stay too long they discover Japan isn't like what they saw in their anime,12년 전,0,
