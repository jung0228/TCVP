@mr.kittysavestheworld695," @Bluesit32  The whole thing about fried food stopping your heart is almost entirely exaggeration and fearmongering. In reality, as long as you aren't living off of fried food and stay reasonably active, the likelihood of any sort of heart complication is extremely low.

@tetsudo6934," @hiddendesire3076  Well, of course with hospitals charging patients with more than 10 times what they cost them in reality, they have a bit of money to reinvest xD And it is also due to the fact that countries with socialised healthcare (all of developped countries except america) there is no preferential treatment, meaning that if you need a surgery, you have to follow the same rules as everybody. And rich people do not like to wait a few weeks and be operated on by no-name surgeons. They want it immediately and done by the ""oh so great doctor that has treated *insert celebrity name*"" and so they go to the US, pay half a million dollars for an operation that would have otherwise cost them less than a thousand. But if there is ONE thing rich people aren't stingy with, it's spending money for themselves. And there you have it, the reason why some people go to the US for operations and surgeries.",4년 전,32,

The difference is that in countries with socialized healthcare (which is the true name of ""free"" healthcare), you do not have to pay half a million to get treated for cancer. Because you will only be paying a bit each month for the expenses of everybody else and everybody else will be paying for your expenses once you need it. And before anyone goes and say ""yeah but you pay a lot in taxes"" it is totally wrong, you only pay a small bit. In France, having just one big operation (due to illnesses, age...),  will often suffice to ensure you have made a profit by paying healthcare. And that's not talking about chronic illnesses, mental illnesses and all the things like that that require multiple visit to hospitals and doctors. In the US, you wouldn't even be able to afford it, in logical and sane countries, you are taken care of by the rest of the community.",4년 전,22,

@doublewidesurprise6016," @Humanbeing171  Tax rates for individuals and corporations were cut. Why, really, should people who work hard for their money, be forced to give it to a government that foolishly wastes it? If invested — which is what we do when we build businesses — that money could benefit so many more people and also pay a lot more in taxes. Regulations, which had shackled the creation of businesses and efficient use of resources, were removed or rewritten to be less burdensome. Trade policies were re-examined and new trade agreements with China, Western Europe, Canada, Mexico and Japan were negotiated that were fairer to the U.S. but also encouraged an increase in trade between the countries. As a result of these three things, the American economy surges to it’s best level arguably in our entire history. Unemployment dropped to historic lows, especially for minorities and women. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of a number of agreement that were poisonous to American interests, including the Paris Climate Accord, TPP, and the Iran Nuclear Agreement. The American military, which was in shambles when Trump took office, was rebuilt, and new weapons’ systems went into production, making our military again a modern force capable of handling the challenges of the 21st century. President Trump honored his campaign promise to build a wall on our southern border to reduce the drug traffic and the number of illegal aliens who have been crossing the border in the millions over the last decade. A Space Force, the first new branch of the military in over a century, was opened to help the U.S. compete with Russian and Chinese attempts to militarize space. The President began what will be a long, complicated effort to withdraw the U.S. military from our two decade adventure in the Middle East and to bring an end to it’s meaningless drain on our young people and our treasury. In response to the emergence of a deadly new virus, COVID-19, from China, President Trump closed down all flights from China and later Europe and the U.K., opened a task force to coordinate the entire federal effort to fight the disease, led many of the televised briefings for that task force, invoked the Defense Appropriations Act to get companies to manufacture medical supplies in short supply, requested that people shelter at home in order to reduce the burden on the hospitals of huge numbers of new cases, encouraged the governors of the various states to reopen them as the numbers of cases fell to acceptable levels, led Congress to write legislature to provide relief for people without an income during the lockdown, and is working to make educational funds available to parents to fund educational opportunities where the public schools are not going to open in September. The president has encouraged the DOJ to send Federal Agents to defend federal property in cities where violent rioters are attempting to destroy the property. Offered to send in military troops to protect the lives and property of people in cities where arsonists and looters are destroying neighborhoods. Due to the BLM and ANTIFA led efforts to defund police departments all over the country, the President has made it clear that he supports the police and honors the efforts of the men and women who serve and protect in our communities. And countries in Europe have their flaws as well. But Gun laws aren’t one of them in the US.",4년 전,0,

I wouldn't recreate this, not because I don't want to, but because I am not even a remotely great enough chef as you. However, I do grill the best Tri-Tip of anyone I know and anyone who knows me, knows. Lol. My dad, according to my brother who visited him for dinner said his Tri-Tip wasn't even comparable to mine. I hate to brag but to be frank, it's all I have to brag about lol. I'm kind of proud of my ability to grill, but I constantly remind myself I'm just a nobody, and that mostly comes from my depression. Still, I try to stay humble. My dad tought me how to grill as a beginner, and my grandfather tought my dad how to grill. My pops was a legend at the grill. My dad sort of (ok almost always) burned the food most of the time, but he tought me how to light a grill and how to cook using direct and indirect heat. So kudos to him.",6년 전,1,

We also never ever did smash burgers and instead shaped the pattie with the palms of our hands til they were a little bigger than the size of the bread we used. Super simple and I still use that recipe at home. Salt and pepper were added just before cooking in case someone wanted to request no salt",6년 전,0,

Because as someone who's trying to learn how to cook, I was very confused when you just referred to a skillet on ""medium-high"" as ""ripping hot"", and in the past I've had trouble internalizing some of your lessons, both because I don't understand how to determine if my skillet is medium-high, and because I don't understand why I want my skillet to be medium-high.",6년 전,0,

@certifiedbootygoon,He used to be very thorough with every video. He would put in the work to make a faithful recreation and then use his own cooking knowledge to make a gourmet version. It was an interesting and exciting format. Go back and watch the Krabby Patty video for comparison. Ever since he grew in size he’s become more complacent and has been putting in seemingly less work.,6년 전,2,

@SatanLiterally," @certifiedbootygoon  hardly seems fair. He's changed direction focusing more on teaching techniques than on recreating TV show foods, but I don't think the quality has gone down. Plus, some recreations don't need a gourmet version. Like this one, for example, since the recipe is edible and well made on its own. The only ones that really need a gourmet attempt are the gross out ones like the trifle/shepherd's pie or rum soaked ham. And personally, I'd rather learn to cook and watch his recipes come together than see him gag on something stupid and gross. It's funny sometimes but there's only so many times you can see it before it gets old.",6년 전,0,
