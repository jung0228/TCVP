Hell, even the Jeep Wagoner, the very model Range Rover’s First Model was copied and competed with, was good off-roading.  But yes, the Jeep Wrangler, the direct decentest of the famed Jeep Willy’s MB, back in WWII; is by far more well known. And not without due reason. It is far more versatile and compatible with hundreds of custom off-reading equipment and car kits.  If you want Luxury but drive on the beach where you need more wheels; use a Range Rover. If you are going cross-country(at least in the US, because UK’s 93,000mi^2 isn’t much) and there are gonna be a lot of off roading, or you just wanna play in the mud, Jeep is the way to go.",5년 전,4,
@Offensivebeast,Most jeeps nowadays are fiats with a badge and body and plagued with reliability issues although the wrangler is a great vehicle on and off road the Range Rover in some circumstances Is better and the wrangler would be in others too and in my opinion the old model defender would squash the pair hundreds of videos online of them going roof level under water and being completely fine when fitted with a snorkel which a wrangler can’t do due to its many electronics that have been fitted over the years. In my opinion jeep is a car company trying to hold onto its old reputation and use its nameplate to sell more vehicles even when some of them can’t even off road like a 90s Cherokee unlike Land Rover where even their 2wd evoque can go off road (and probably break down within a month of the warranty expiring 😂),5년 전,1,

@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏ Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the   ‏ Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏    https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42    🌹  ‏https://youtu.be/YtQGJ1pS6Fs   🌷    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO/view    🌻    https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U    🌼    https://discoveritsbeauty.com/mobile/   🌺",4년 전,1,

And as far as i know Land Rovers always had troubles with corrosion (yours maybe does not have a problem with it, others do) and with the electrics in general. I heard that the engines are quite good, but in our times the electrics in a car are almost more important than the engine itself^^",4년 전,0,
@v8gtr," @Alex-zg7vq  Seriously,  I think it's a misconception that Range Rovers all have problems but everyone to their own opinion; I'm very happy with good fuel economy, huge torque, very comfortable elevated driving position, safety in a crash, better offroading than a saloon (nothing too adventureous though) and nothing wrong with the electrics at all which wasnt the case with a BMW X5 that I owned in the past. Perhaps I've just been lucky but my next one will also be a RR.",4년 전,0,

@AndorRadnai,"And because of it’s reliability. But my point still stands. It’s not just a pavement queen. It can tackle the rough stuff. Mud, Forest, Deserts, Trails. Not the toughest of them, obviously, it’s not a Defender or Land Cruiser. But enough to fulfil its purpose, which is greenlaning and getting about the country estate‘s parks, no matter how (medium) rough. The big Range Rover does that, the sport as well and even the little evouque to some extent. The Land Rovers are meant for the open world, the Range Rover for getting anywhere, and through anything your countryside can realistically throw at you, comfortably. The sort of stuff, shown in this clip. It’s maybe not a serious off–roader compared to a lifted Jeep, but it is to anything it’s being put against on the market.

@Strangleyourfriend,"The Range Rover is a very good looking car, and gives the impression that it can handle pretty rough terrain. But IMO it feels so out of its element driving in this sort of terrain. Feels like it belongs more on a muddy field or on a logging road in the woods. It feels waaaay too luxurious and expensive to drive on this kind of terrain. Sure, off road vehicles aren't cheap for the average Joe but reckon they are usually cheaper than that car. The TerraMax however was a pure breed beast of a vehicle. Given the choice between driving the Range Rover or TerraMax I'd choose The TerraMax in the blink of an eye.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@Darkus505,"I hate Land Rovers...  Dont get me wrong, they are well built, study cars, but thats what they are, Cars.. Land Rover used to be fantastic, the original Defender was one of the best 4x4 trucks out there, it was rugged, tough, mechanically simplistic, had a center differential so that it could be in permanent 4x4.  Now look at this Range Rover, in assuming that Land Rover knew what top gear were doing in this video (which im sure they did) This car is totally unsuited for this terrain, The wheels are like 20 Inch wheels, which is way too big to get any real off road tire (Eg: BF Goodrich All Terrain T/A KO2's, Mickey Thompson Deegan 38.. ect), there is hardly any room for the suspension to travel anywhere. Furthermore, This car is way too low, there is bugger all clearance from anything. SPEAKING OF WHICH, look at the angles of Attack, exit and ramp over, this car is way too long, with too much body in the front and rear of the car.. this would be useless in any kind of serious offroad work  Not to mention the cost of a Land Rover is Prohibitive at best!

It's then edited frenetically by chopping all the parts together with NO sense of pace, geography, scale, narrative or realism with silly epic music, typical outdated cringe-worthy British humour, Slow-Mo, annoying sound effects, & CGI map overlays to compensate & glue it all together.   I'm so glad I told the TV-License people where to stick it. The internet is hard to get to grips with at first..  having no strobe edits & epic music!! But now when I see clips like these, I see past all the bullshit, all the advertisements, product placements, scripted gags, premeditated story boards etc to a very brainwashed stylised form of trend-reliant entertainment at its' worst.

@rickvanhoek,"+FullSpectrum Survivalist   You do know that the 6x6 TerraMax in this video has full independent suspension, right? Independent suspension, properly equip will be better than a solid axle for off road.  The rock crawlers/jeep guys can have more flex/travel with their solid axles but why do you need all 4 wheels to be touching the ground if you have diff locks? While there is many more capable vehicles than the Landrover, the Landrover is a very luxurious vehicle that can go pretty much anywhere.  Even more impressive is they used the stock tires.",9년 전,3,
@SpectrumSurvivalist,"Rick V That's a 6X6 vehicle. In a 4 wheel drive independent suspension will get your ride turned over, so no a Land Rover will not go where a solid axle can go, and a Jeep will go better, and do it cheaper. They use stock tires because they don't really have much of a choice due to design of the Land Rover not being capable of being upgraded to large tires, so how is that impressive? Have you ever saw a Land  Rover turn over trying to ascend a steep grade?, well I have, and independent suspension is why. I can tell you he wished he had a live axle that day. Off Roading isn't about luxury.",9년 전,4,
@rickvanhoek,"There is also many serious military 4x4 vehicles with independent suspension.  With independent suspension, you get way more ground clearance.  95% of the vehicles on the road today with independent suspension suck offroad because they are not designed for offroad but that does not mean that independent suspension vehicles are not capable of going off road.  Jeeps have solid axles because of just that, they are cheaper to offroad with. But you still have the differential hanging down low. I've seen many jeeps turn over. There is this magic bar call the sway bar that reduced roll over. Most jeeps remove there's so they can have all 4 wheels touching the ground (more suspension flex) which if they are serious jeeps, they already have lockers, with lockers, you only need two wheels touching the ground as all 4 wheels will have the same power going to them and the 2 that are hanging down will not even have weight on them so they are doing very little anyways.  Landrover,  like Jeep has always had very offroad capable vehicles,  then they started getting more into the luxury side and while 95% of the people that own a range rover will likely never see a gravel road, they are still very capable vehicles.  Just like the Grand Cherokee,  many will argue that the older jeeps were way better than the new wk2 but they can still go many places offroad.  They make lift kits and I believe most will fit 17 inch tires which will have a huge selection of off road tires. There is many videos with a stock jeep grand Cherokee teetering on 2 wheels and still keeps going.  I'm pretty sure that there is many other tire choices in the size the Landrover uses. And if we are going to compare modified jeeps, a person could always put smaller brakes on the land Rover and fit smaller wheels/bigger tires. Rally cars do that all the time to fit 14 or 15 inch tires.  Yes a modified jeep will go more places for cheaper but I bet stock for stock, the Landrover will go the same places as any stock jeep will. Once you start modifing a Landrover or any independent suspension vehicle,  the independent suspension vehicle will cost way more but will be better offroad. Why do you think all the big ATVs have independent suspension? It's that little bit of extra ground clearance that helps it go more places. Offroading is not about luxury, you are right there but the Landrover makes high end luxury vehicles that are still very capable offroad. ",9년 전,4,

A stock GU Nissan Patrol and a new Land Rover Defender are also for better stock 4x4s, just to name a few.  I'm not saying the RR is a bad car, it does have good gearing and the traction control helps it a lot, but it really doesn't compare to more serious 4x4s.  Had they said it was the best off road luxury SUV in the world, I might beleive that.",10년 전,11,

@KTMcaptain,"Jeb Watson you clearly do not understand how lockers and open differentials work. An open diff sends torque to one wheel once the spider gears start spinning. Brakes cannot lock the diff for you at all, unless you had a torsen style differential. Lockers are SUBSTANTIALLY better, which is why they are regular gear on actual off road (stock or modified) vehicles. If it were close then they would just use the brakes and no one would care, but RR fans aren't educated well enough on 4x4 dynamics to care; nor would they ever put their rig in a situation where they could even tell.  A locker has no differentiation of speed between the wheels. Torque is sent to both wheels, and when one wheel has less traction it still won't spin until the other wheel(s) locked to it lose traction as well. That means, for the Rubicon wrangler (zr2 colorado, ram power wagon, and every other 4x4 system with a fully locked driveline), that you must overwhelm the traction of all 4 tires in order to lose grip. It also means that all 4 wheels simultaneously digg for traction. With an open differential and the brakes slowing/stopping the spinning wheel you have a few things going on. First, the open diff is only sending torque to one wheel and the brake is adding resistance to the other wheel with lower traction to force torque to the one with greater traction (but now higher resistance thanks to the brakes). Second, one wheel has its BRAKE engaged, which means it is resisting movement thus momentum. When wheeling hard one could easily feel this happening, especially on the front axle where the vehicle wants to turn towards the wheel being slowed/stopped by the traction control.   So, do you think a rear limited slip (which acts like a locker but with far less dynamic torque transfer ability (only can transmit as much as the clutch or helical gears can lock up) with an open front differential  (can only send equal torque to both wheels that cannot exceed the resistance of the lesser wheel before the spider gears move and transfer torque to ONLY the wheel with the least resistance) can compete with a true locked 4x4. The range rovers 4wd system under severe conditions acts more like a 2 and 1/2 to 3 wheel drive depending on the torque demands on the rear clutch pack.",7년 전,0,

America hadn't had cars whit good quality of construction till some years ago, and after your firts answer i went on looking for those jeeps (srt, overland summit) and i was kinda impressed, they are really getting somewhere now.  I never liked SUV's in my life, always thought they were heavy as hell and didn't make it well off-road(most bimmers and mercs (except the G class)), till i saw this top gear episode. First and only SUV that i really like! The only jeep i kinda like is the wrangler and the rubicon, i love that car. If i were to buy any off road vehicle it would be the wrangler or the rubicon for sure.  I only like THIS, and only THIS RR because of how it looks (its beautiful, you have to admit because you too know how to apreciate cars ahah) and its performance, and the quality of construction and the extras are just amazing, almost as good as a 7 series or an S class. The parts are expensive, i know. It's an expensive brand, but who has the money to buy them, has the money to repair them also.

Now stop comparing the two because they're in both in a class of their own, and it's like comparing a Camry to a E350, they may technically be in the same subset of vehicle because of their size, but they are worlds apart. Most people who bash on Range Rover's do so because they simply cannot afford them.   Also, if you pulled up in a Range Rover vs. a Truck, I assure you most ladies would choose to go home with you in the Range Rover than a truck that you added things to. ",11년 전,1,

That's my personal Opinion. My truck would out pull,out road, out off-road, and out work the Rover any day of the week then twice on Sunday. Why buy something for just one job oriented duty? Its a waste of money.  Also to the ""Ill do the same things to my Rover and make more power"" So your  84K USD for the basic model then add in about 10 grand worth of stuff?

@Mistakenshadow,Danny Lee I never stated it was superior due to modes. Ive personal fucking towed range rovers home. PERSONAL TOWED THEM HOME. I have a 2000 Model Chevy Z71 Silverado with 300K miles with original Engine/Tranny. Yet im towing a 2007 Rover home? LOL Yet Your going to me Its not superior? Yeah you get what you pay for but have you personally seen a Silverado High Country in Person? Probably not. Ive seen both and I can tell you that the leather isnt cheap there is no wood either. Yet it is just as beautiful. Your trying to argue about something you havnt seen in person. THats called being biased. Which means you automatically lose an argument. My Truck will out do out go and out drive a rover. Plain simple. Done .,11년 전,0,
@dannylee9593,"You really don't have to be biased to know that a brand new Range Rover is superior to a car that is over a decade old, especially a Chevy at that. Also, beauty is subjective, which is also being biased, and therefore by your logic, you have also automatically lost this argument. Also, it's not surprising that you towed a 2007 Rover considering that's when they weren't even near the quality that they're at now. And for future consideration, please don't substitute the word ""tranny"" for transmission, it's a bit odd. Also, the fact that the Rover does have and can engage in different modes for off roading should be thrown into the argument, since you are comparing the two vehicles off roading capability. It doesn't really matter if you towed a Rover home, and simply stating so doesn't say much about either car. The worst of drivers will destroy even the best cars, not saying that a 2007 Rover is a very good car, it's the oppositeFurthermore, if you're really going to nitpick how to lose an argument, dropping f-bombs, having terrible grammar, and writing in caps will really degrade your argument.

@ThreeStooges360,"Let's just get a few things straight. 1) Yes, SUVs and Trucks are comparable.

And since by GM's own theories and logic, the Escalade, which again by GM's own accord, is much nicer than the Tahoe since Cadillac is GM's luxury brand, I can honestly and sincerely say that neither vehicles put the Range Rover to shame. While they are nice, they are not up to the standard of the Range. The Range just about uses soft leather throughout, while much of my Cadillac uses soft plastic on the dashboard, and vert rigid, hard cheap plastic on the doors. It seems to have improved in the new Cadillac, but it still is quite far from the Range. GM skimps out on a lot of their vehicles, especially these SUVs considering the Chevy, GMC, and Cadillac variants are 85% the same as each other when you get into the mechanics and such.  But yes, the actual question is have you ever seen, been in, or experienced the actual and new Range Rover?

Let me even build a heavy $100K Dodge cummins or Chev Duramx and there won't be any RR going where a $100k built Pick up will go.   My point is you slam a stock Jeep because it does not keep up to $US/100,000 stock RR.

I think Land Rover should go back to building the series 2, at least as an option in their range. The difference between it and the new model is the same as a Jeep today and an old Willey's. No comparison, and I'm not saying the new models are an improvement! If your going to go offroad, you don't need carpeting or padding or power seats that will fail if you get them wet. Just a plain painted dash and maybe rubber floor mats with nice removable vinyl covered seat padding! (Nor plastic trim bits to break off at the first contact of terrain. See 4:45.) I've seen both early Land Rovers and Willy's painted with brushes, and they look just fine because it suits their character. Try doing that with this and it wouldn't work so well.

@EnaiSiaion,"It may be ""fake"", but it's fake in that they chose a route that would result in a close race, and most likely tested it several times before turning on the cameras. This makes sense when your goal is to create a watchable television program.  As long as a win for the other competitor would be equally interesting television, which is usually the case, they have no incentive to outright falsify the results.  When they do want one side to win (every ""car vs X"" competition) they choose the right conditions to give the opponent as big a handicap as possible without making it obvious, but they don't tell the opponent to throw the race on purpose.

@GrummanBearcat,"1)  The Range Rover is THE luxury 4x4.  BMW X5, Mercedes G-Wagen and Toyota Amazon are just pretenders.  No point even mentioning any American SUVs. 2)  Nobody would expect the Range Rover or any of the above to match the Terramax off-road - it's a military vehicle. 3)  It's pretty good off-road for what it is, but it's too expensive and shiny for most people to dare take it serious off-roading.  That's what the Land Rover Defender is for. 4)  Having said that you can park it next to an Aston, Bentley or Rolls Royce and it won't be out of place, out front, at your 5 star hotel. 5)  Top Gear is primarily an entertainment programme not a consumer advice programme. 6)  Jaguar/Landrover is owned by Tata, so it's actually Indian. 7)  If the US hadn't joined WW2 and the UK had fallen, you think the US would have lasted how long against the Axis powers?  So don't kid yourself you were just helping the poor little UK.  Oh, and by the way you're welcome to the fact we solved how to make your Bell X-1 stay in the air, and we invented the hovercraft and jump-jet that the USMC love so much. 8)  Best American Cars; Hennessey Venom (UK Lotus with a dragster engine), Shelby Cobra (UK AC Ace with a dragster engine) and GT40 (UK, please can you build a racing car for us so we can beat Ferrari?) 9)  American Cars = cheap interior but lots of cup holders, bad panel fit, gas guzzling pushrod engines, live axles, leaf spring suspension, vague steering.  No wonder they are at least reliable, they,ve been using the same technology for the last 60 years!  But then why don't they top the JD Power surveys?",11년 전,1,

@nbditsjd,Ya range rovers aren't that great. My dodge can very very easily outrun that rover and probably the terramax. My friend has a deuce and a half like that and he can't do really any fourwheeling or mudding because it's just too heavy. Both the landrover and terramax are cool for flat land stuff but any deep mud makes them both screwed.,11년 전,2,

@nbditsjd,Doesn't change the fact that Land Rovers are quite possibly the world off road vehicles you can find.  Who wants to spend 70k on something that is shit? The old ones were good vehicles and are no longer that way.  A Land Rover is an accessory - it's a look good SUV. There is no real offroad practicality. They just load it with some computers and say that it's the best offroading vehicle around.  Also - my dad drives an Audi S5 and my mom a GL450. The GL is supposed to be in the same class as the Land Rover. Bullllllshitttt they both suck.,11년 전,0,
@nbditsjd,No. This video shows British men promoting a British car... Hmm... let me think about that one for a sec! Love the show - love the guys - but lets be honest here. These guys can't just go on the show and say they don't like the range rover. They would lose many of their English viewers.,11년 전,0,
@nbditsjd,No because although Top Gear is sometimes a funny show - it is made to give a serious review of a car.  Obviously here it's very biased. Look all I'm saying is that the Land Rover should not be anyones first choice when looking for something that they want to offroad.,11년 전,0,

@nbditsjd,"My truck has 6 seats and rides better than my mothers mercedes. Full leather and suede interior and gets around 13 mpg. Last I checked the rang rovers were getting an advertised 14 mpg... The tires don't make much road noise. It is a laramie edition of the dodge ram so everything is top of the line. (Which I will admit is not on par with most of the European cars - but it cuts it pretty close) Either way - the truck is just as comfortable, is more fun to drive, can go more places, carry more things and tow more weight. Even without comparing I'll go one degree of separation away and tell you that any newer Jeep with the top trim is a better offroad vehicle than the range rover. From cherokee to wrangler we've got those British beat.",11년 전,0,
@nbditsjd,***** Okay well first off if you read what I said - that is not all it. Second - you're a complete idiot. The Land/Range Rovers only get about 1 mpg more and the compact version only gets about 5mpg more. Not enough of a difference to call it a fuel drinking global warming vehicle.  At least my vehicle won't blow up at 100k miles and can pay for it's self by being a good work vehicle. Don't be a dumbass. Also - how do you know if I'm beating my wallet? Trust me it barely makes a dent. My next truck is going to be diesel just so I can blow smoke at dumbasses like you. Ya it will cost more upfront at the pump but in the long run I'll be saving. You can kiss my tail when i get 20 MPG's + on that bad boy.,11년 전,0,

Very very few places in America can you legally go that fast. So, conversely, in Germany, one won't be running traction tires on the road, whereby in America it is common. Driving the common American truck past 65-75 MPH is not generally done as most consider ""the truck"" a general purpose vehicle not suited to ""hi-speed"" use.",12년 전,0,
