@TiaFireBull,"It never ceases to amaze me how ill-informed Republican voters seem to be. It seems they don't or can't research or fact check anything. They're all too willing to accept and repeat the lies they hear.  I understand fully why Trump loves the uneducated.    It's time to stop expecting critical thinking skills from people who aren't smart enough to realize that ""I love the poorly educated"" was not a compliment.

Mitch McConnell swears that he will do everything in his power to make sure that Barack Obama is a one term President.   (2016)  McConnell vowed to block any scotus nominee of Obama. (2018) McConnell asked for respect and dignity for their scotus nominee. INTERESTING 🤔   2008 ""There will likely come a time in which we have an airborne disease that is deadly.  We have to put in place an infrastructure to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to it quickly."" -Pres Barack Obama  On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.

From the moment his term in office began, he took aim at practically every one of President Obama's signature achievements.  Within one week, he pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In the months ahead, he withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation.  He removed Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants and installed his ""zero-tolerance"" policy which removed an estimated 5,000 children from their families.  He made repealing the Affordable Care Act an everyday talking point yet failed in his four years to do so or to implement his own policy.  He imposed sanctions and travel restrictions on Cuba, he did the same to Muslims traveling to the U.S.  He rescinded proposed controls on power-plant emissions, fuel efficiency standards for new cars and other environmental regulations, and removed some Obama-era controls on financial institutions.  Under Putin's demands, he attempted to destroy NATO. While increasing Russian oil imports by nearly 47% above the Obama administration.  His Jealousy of President Obama is still apparent today.  The personality trait of a weak man.   In Michael Cohen's book he writes that Donald Trump's disdain for Obama was so extreme he hired a ""Faux-Bama"" to participate in a video in which he ""ritualistically belittled the first black president and then fired him.""

@TiaFireBull,"Trump Evicts Stroke Victim, 74  For more than 30 years Mary Filan- widowed, 74 years old, and half-paralyzed from a recent stroke-has lived in apartment 6B, 143-16 Barclay Avenue in Flushing. Last Friday afternoon, she answered the insistent doorbell, only to be pushed aside by the henchmen of city marshal Norman Katz, who proceeded to cart her belongings out to an idling truck. Taped to her door was an eviction notice from her landlords, the Trump Organization.  They took Filan's sofa, chairs, TV, jewelry, dishes, and silverware, leaving nothing but a hamper for her to sit on. The marshals and the police tried to convince her to leave, but she refused to go until a neighbor, Bob Hennessy, convinced her to stay in his apartment until she could get help.  ""She was distraught,"" said Hennessy, and by Monday afternoon he was still unable to ascertain where her belongings had been taken. Thanks to her doctor and the Human Resources Administration, Mary Filan is resting in a bed at Parsons Hospital.  ""They rang the bell,"" recalls Filan, ""and I was still in bed. I don't get up much unless I have to. They rang and rang, and when I got to the door they pushed it open, and walked in, these three big fat men. They went right in the kitchen and started pulling out drawers, turning 'em upside down into one of those big cartons. ""They said they'd come to put me on the street because I owed four months rent. I don't owe back rent. The last thing I got from Trump was a bill for $10.20, about two weeks ago, and I sent that. They just want me out because they can get twice as much rent."" Mary Filan currently pays about $200 month for her apartment. Her income from Social Security and a telephone company pension is under $500 a month.  The Trump Organization is one of the biggest landlords in this city, a dynasty passed from father Fred to son Donald. Like most dynasties, it has flourished through the exercise of power; in earlier times, mostly through the Brooklyn Democratic machine; now, through Donald's liaisons with the governor and a variety of state agencies, particularly the Urban Development Corporation, which paid Donald Trump more than $800,000 for brokering its convention center deal. He has used political clout to obtain more than $160 million in tax exemptions for his renovation of the old Commodore Hotel on 42nd Street. Donald Trump is a very successful 33-year-old dealer and developer. So why did Trump evict Mary Filan?  ""The Trumps don't get involved in any of that,"" said a spokesman at their Manhattan office. ""The management corporation handles that kind of thing. It's part of the company, but the Trumps don't get involved with individual cases. He didn't know why Mary Filan had been evicted. She doesn't give loud parties, or cause property damage, or threaten her neighbors, who are actually fond of her.  ""The Trump Organization doesn't evict people indiscriminately,"" he said at last, and suggested another number to call for specific comments on the Filan case. There was no answer at that number; nobody seemed to care about the details. Two thoughts persist: How would Donald Trump feel if some corporation evicted his ill and aging parent, without notice or compassion, removing all possessions to some unknown location? And how does Trump manage to have the taxpayers subsidize so many of his enterprises? Mary Filan's hospital stay is being paid for by Medicare and Medicaid. -J.C.",5일 전,0,
@TiaFireBull,"I think, being right up there would be the story presented in the documentary film, ""You've Been Trumped."" On YouTube. It has to do with how Trump treated this 91 year old farmer lady from Scotland.  Her name was Molly Forbes. The was a former ""Land Girl"" during WW2. Those were young women who kept the farnms going for the victory harvest when the men had gone off to fight, and the farmers needed more help. She and her son lived in a modest farm on the northern coast of Scotland. Unfortunately for Mrs. Forbes, Mr Trump wanted to buy her farm for a golf course he wished to build on the protected dunes of the area.  The documentary tells the story of Trump's crews having ""accidentally"" cut off the water to the elder ladies farm. And somehow, this genius of the construction business who claims he ""knows more about infrastructure than anybody"", and constructs office buildings, border walls, and other amazing things was unable to get her water supply fixed for over 5 years.  According to the film, not only did the 91 year old woman have to revert to hauling water from a nearby stream to her modest home in order to flush the toilet, but she had to take baths using buckets of water as she stood in a basin. Her primary heat in northern Scotland winters was from radiators. No water, no radiators. So she was forced to use portable electric heaters to warm her home.",5일 전,0,

I don't know what's wrong with him--how he watched that documentary and took from it ""Hey, this is a good network to watch.""  I think he partly has O.D.D. (oppositional defiant disorder) he never grew out of.  He's arrogant about his own views and knowledge like a few too many people nowadays.  Arrogant but a bit too ignorant.  The story, where I saw a about a knife maker in a video being arrogant outlines a perfect example.  He was arrogant in a video about how his company would be impacted ZERO by the tariffs (recorded in April).  Yet he was finding out quick how NOT purely made in America his supply chain is.  What a surprise how not informed he was.  Yet still stubborn to say ""I'm not hating on Trump""  Too many of them are JUST LIKE THIS.  Ignorant.  Arrogant.  Stubborn.  This is not new or uncommon.  I've started to feel emotionally severed from these people.  You get flooded from the impacts of climate change and the warning system that would help you you turned down in a red state like Texas?  Oh well...Your farm is impacted by tariffs that you voted for?  Oh well...too f'ing bad.  Some people think the guy in office has O.D.D. (article titled ""Donald Trump is NOT a Narcissist or Sociopath"" which I disagree with..why can't he have all 3?) Coincidence?  Not entirely the only factor but maybe not....  LOT of factors at play.  There is not one.  There are a lot.  America is a complex place:  complex history and complex contemporary factors too.  Anyone that tries to explain it with some neat little article is in part sort of lying to you and trying to sell ads and confidence--that's what a lot of these awful sports ""analysts"" do and stopped watching that garbage years ago--I call them confidence exuders but they are in part hot air emitters.

@whoever_81,"Apparently Curtis Yarvin and ""Dark Enlightenment"" is the whole philosophical framework behind the Trump administration.  Perplexity (Deep Research): ""Who is Curtis Yarvin and what is his vision and values""  Curtis Yarvin, born in 1973, has emerged as one of the most controversial political thinkers in American discourse, known for founding the neo-reactionary movement and advocating for the replacement of democracy with monarchical governance. Also writing under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin has cultivated significant influence among right-wing intellectuals, Silicon Valley technologists, and certain political figures within Republican circles. His ideas represent a radical departure from mainstream conservative thought, combining techno-utopianism with authoritarian governance models.  Yarvin is most prominently known for founding, along with philosopher Nick Land, the anti-egalitarian and anti-democratic philosophical movement known as the Dark Enlightenment or neo-reactionary movement (NRx). This philosophy fundamentally challenges the liberal democratic order that has dominated Western political thought since the Enlightenment.  The core of Yarvin's political vision centers on the rejection of democracy as a failed experiment. Through his blog Unqualified Reservations (2007-2014) and later newsletter Gray Mirror (started in 2020), he has consistently argued that American democracy is inherently flawed and should be replaced with an ""accountable monarchy"" that would function with governance structures similar to those of corporations. This vision represents a complete rethinking of modern governance based on hierarchical principles rather than democratic ones.  One of Yarvin's most influential concepts is what he terms ""the Cathedral"" – his framework for understanding how power operates in liberal democratic societies. According to critics of his work, Yarvin incorrectly characterizes modern progressive institutions as ""uncoordinated, decentralized, emergent"" when evidence suggests they are actually ""coordinated, centralized, purposeful"". This concept has nonetheless been widely adopted within certain right-wing intellectual circles.  Yarvin's political values represent a radical departure from mainstream conservatism, embracing positions that many consider deeply problematic. He has been described variously as a ""neo-reactionary,"" ""neo-monarchist,"" and ""neo-feudalist"" who ""sees liberalism as creating a Matrix-like totalitarian system, and who wants to replace American democracy with a sort of techno-monarchy"".  His positions on race and civil rights have drawn particular criticism. Yarvin has:  Defended the institution of slavery  Suggested that certain races may be naturally inclined toward servitude  Claimed that whites have higher IQs than black people (while maintaining he is not a white nationalist)  Criticized U.S. civil rights programs and described the civil rights movement as a ""black-rage industry""  In terms of governance, Yarvin has written extensively about how America needs to overcome what he calls ""dictator-phobia,"" arguing that authoritarian or monarchical systems represent the only viable path for right-wing political agendas. He praises China's political system for understanding that ""unitary executive control is necessary for strong governance"" and has criticized the First Amendment as ""one of the biggest barriers to the right wing agenda"".  His main influences: Thomas Carlyle, Niccolò Machiavelli, Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Hans-Hermann Hoppe.",7개월 전,0,

@BruceBerube,"#Drumpf's actions are escalating at a terrifying pace. Every time we think we've seen his worst, he proves us wrong. This is not just another presidency—it is an accelerating collapse of democracy, stability, and global order.   Drumpf has openly sided with Russia, abandoned Ukraine, and signaled that NATO allies are on their own. He is preparing to let Taiwan fall and has hinted at annexing Canada. His administration is purging officials, sabotaging government operations, and rewarding criminals while persecuting those who hold him accountable. His rhetoric has shifted from authoritarian to outright dictatorial.   He is stacking his government with extremists, criminals, and enablers. The justice system is being weaponized. The power of Congress is being dismantled. Laws and institutions are crumbling. Drumpf is not just corrupt—he is an accelerating force of chaos, always seeking a new level of destruction. If allowed to continue, there may be no limit to what he will do.   This is not politics. This is survival.   How to Resist and Force Change   • Mass Protests & Strikes – Nationwide, ongoing disruptions that make the country ungovernable until he is removed.   • Legal Warfare – Overwhelm courts with lawsuits, challenge every illegal action, pursue state-level prosecutions.   • Economic Resistance – Boycott Trump businesses, pressure corporations backing his administration, disrupt economic stability.   • State and Local Defiance – Governors, mayors, and officials must refuse unlawful orders and protect democratic institutions.   • International Pressure – Global allies must be encouraged to apply sanctions and diplomatic isolation.   • General Noncompliance – A government cannot function if the people refuse to obey.   How to Cope and Stay Sane   • Organize Communities – Build local networks for safety, resistance, and resource-sharing.   • Mental & Physical Readiness – Stay informed, stay fit, and prepare for prolonged conflict.   • Secure Digital Communications – Use encrypted apps, avoid social media tracking, protect sensitive discussions.   • Creative Resistance – Art, music, and satire are powerful tools to expose and weaken authoritarian narratives.   • Demand Competency Testing for Future Leaders – Implement Rigorous Competency Testing for Politicians   1. Qualification Exams for Candidacy   Politicians must pass standardized exams assessing:   Knowledge of law, economics, and governance.   Critical thinking, ethical decision-making, and crisis management.   Third-party organizations design and administer exams to prevent biases.   Cost: $50 million annually for administration. Savings: Prevents billions in mismanaged funds through better decision-making.   2. Regular Performance Reviews   Biannual evaluations by independent committees comprising experts and citizens.   Outcomes published publicly for transparency.   Cost: $25 million annually. Savings: Encourages efficiency, avoiding costly missteps.   Step 2: Mandatory Disclosure of Affiliations and Financial Records   1. Real-Time Public Database   Politicians must disclose all personal, business, and lobbyist affiliations.   Financial records audited annually and made publicly accessible.   Cost: $20 million to develop and maintain the database. Savings: Reduces corruption, potentially saving billions.   Step 3: Multiple Levels of Monitoring and Oversight   1. Independent Ethics Commission   A non-partisan body monitors political activities, enforces ethics codes, and investigates complaints.   Members rotated every 3 years to avoid entrenchment.   Cost: $100 million annually. Savings: Prevents embezzlement and abuse of power, worth billions in recovered or saved funds.   2. Crowdsourced Reporting System   Citizens report unethical behavior anonymously.   Verified reports trigger investigations by the Ethics Commission.   Cost: $10 million annually. Savings: Increased deterrence of misconduct.   Step 4: Transparent Decision-Making Processes   1. Publicly Accessible Decision Records   Require all government meetings and decisions to be documented and available online.   Redact sensitive information only when necessary for national security.   Cost: $30 million annually for system maintenance. Savings: Reduces backdoor dealings and improves public trust.   2. Technology-Driven Monitoring Tools   Use technology to analyze policies for conflicts of interest or favoritism.   Cost: $40 million annually. Savings: Identifies wasteful or corrupt practices early.   Step 5: Media and Public Engagement   1. Unbiased Reporting Requirement   Media organizations covering politics must disclose funding sources.   A non-partisan review board ensures balanced coverage.   Cost: $15 million annually. Savings: Increases public understanding, leading to better voting choices.   2. Mandatory Public Consultations   Require public input on major policies via referendums or consultations.   Cost: $25 million annually. Savings: Policies better aligned with public needs.   Why It’s Time for Real Change   The Problem: We keep using outdated systems and expect better governance. The result is recurring corruption, inefficiency, and public disillusionment.   The Solution: A new system rooted in transparency, competence, and accountability.   Ethical Standards: Politicians must meet the same ethical expectations as citizens or higher. Governance must reflect public values.   Total Costs and Savings   Annual Costs: ~$315 million.   Potential Savings: Over $10 billion annually through reduced corruption, efficient policies, and increased public trust.   Why This System Is Uncompromisable   1. Decentralized Oversight: Multiple independent bodies ensure checks and balances.   2. Technology Integration: AI monitors patterns for corruption, reducing human error.   3. Citizen Empowerment: Direct engagement ensures government serves public interests.   4. Transparency: Every decision is visible, making backdoor dealings impossible.   The collapse of democracy is not inevitable—only your inaction can make it so. Americans must fight now, before it is too late.   #Resist #RemoveTrump #DefendDemocracy #MassProtestsNow #NeverAgain #DefendDemocracy #HistoryIsWatching #JusticeForUkraine #StrengthNotSurrender #MakeAmericaSaneAgain #MakeAmericaSafeAgain #MakeAmericaRespectableAgain #MakeAmericaStrongAgain #MakeAmericaUnitedAgain #MakeAmericaProudAgain #MakeAmericaThrivingAgain #MakeAmericaInspiredAgain #MakeAmericaInnovativeAgain #MakeAmericaProsperousAgain #MakeAmericaFairAgain #MakeAmericaHealthyAgain #MakeAmericaFreeAgain #MakeTrumpGoAway #UnDrumpfingAmerica #MakeAmericaHappyAgain   https://youtu.be/zH-_YfDUytg?si=TBLUUNN--O3w1oRz",8개월 전,1,

@handoveryourstool,My question is: WHY?!,11개월 전,0,
@richardparker2555,"@davidfuentes9957  its actually a long list of reasons but here are some.  1. Back in 2016 it was not only okay criticize the president but mainstream encourage you to do it. After 2020 the mainstream shielded the president from all criticism and you risked being censored for speaking out. Between the the two I felt I had more freedom to be openly critcal of Trump where with Biden  felt like kept getting censored and started feel more at risk loosing my job, freinds or better job opportunities. I was deeply disturbed which gow much the mainstream lied on behalf of Biden. Ironically that was something I was originally  afraid Trump was going to do. I had no fear telling people I didn't like Trump when he was president but I was terrified to tell people I didn't like Biden or Harris.  I feel like I can have a sided conversation with conservative who I don't agree with but I have to walk on eggshells around liberals even if I do agree with them. After awhile I started realize the left became pro-censorship and the right believes in free speech. I voted for Trump to protect democracy.  2.  I have no desire for WW3 with Russia. I use to think the left was pro peace but instead they want  to get involved in something that could be even worse then Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea and Vietnam combined. Say what you about Trump but Putin has way more respect for him then Biden or Harris. Trump might be the one guy on earth who can actually talk with Putin and make a deal to avoid nuclear Arm**geddon   3. The economy. It was doing better under Trump. The left kept trying to gaslight people into thinking it was great. Just like how kept trying to gaslight people into thinking Biden was ""really shap and not in mental decline""  4. The border crisis proved Trump right about the wall. I still support legal immigration but leaving the border wide open and letting a wave of people walk on in with no filter process to separate freind from foe is just foolish. Its like leaving your front door wide open and expecting no on to take advantage of that.  5. The transgender stuff was going way to far. I was seeing what was being taught in some schools. The erosion of women spaces. The ingoring of detranstioners horror stories. I use to think the left was pro science party, but now many them can't even answe what a women is. Which made it harder for me to take them to seriously.  Those are just a few. I have lot more, but that starter pac.",11개월 전,0,

@handoveryourstool," @richardparker2555    I never expected you to answer me. And by the answers you gave me, you are one of the reasons why America is doomed. You’re repeating the same talking points from conservative outlets and you’re not getting paid for it like they do, let alone in a multimillion contract.  -The border crisis was created by the GOP to blame “the left” for it and even then the Border Patrol is in charge of keeping the borders secure. The borders aren’t wide open. But people risk coming here because the legal process to come here is expensive and slow, and people need to leave their countries for a better one, without knowing that the better one is responsible for their home countries economic collapse, whether Neo-liberalism, or the war on communism. -When the GOP cut taxes for corporations, they cash in, buy back stocks, pay corporate board members huge bonus packages, cut down operations, buy the competition, consolidate the industry, fire workers, and raise prices on consumers. -You seem to imply that Trump is anti-war. He is not. He wants to invade my home country leaving most people that I know and love displaced or disappeared. -I welcome your criticism of Biden. He stood by Israel on everything till the last moment which is why Kamala lost, and he would have lost too. I hope you can take my criticism of Trump, but I guess it’s an uphill battle for both of us. More for me than for you. -And transgender issues, both parties did damage on that community for political gain. The difference is that one also did it because they genuinely hate transgender people and coerced the other party to do the same so there was no difference and the trans allies get discouraged to vote on the party doing anti-trans virtue signaling to have the party with a genuine hatred of transgender people win. You may not have cared for transgender in the past but it was politicized in the negative way… and you fell for it, so easily. It’s too late. Now we’re finding out.",11개월 전,3,

And although I don't agree with them I can see the appeal, he was an incredible charismatic person, something that the media overlooked.

@lileos2837,"I am looking for the clip back in 2015 when Trump finally settled on what he thought about Putin instead of just saying whatever statement would be convenient in the moment. For example Duke is a racist. I don't know Duke. Duke is part of a group of ""fine people"" - whatever. The secret is when he settles on an opinion and sticks with it. And the reason that he does that is always the same. So one day he comes out with his own opinion, that he came up with himself because no one can control him, that Putin was his new best bud, because he just talked to the guy yesterday and this idea popped in his head that America should be friends with Russia. When Trump settles on an opinion the reason is always the same. So Putin placed that shiny object in front of Trumps face and then there is policy. We all know what that shiny object was. We can go look at the dates. The guy will never ever admit that he is even capable of being played. The guy is so unbelievably easy to manipulate and will never be able to see it anything other than the shiny object, which now means that he doesn't just say whatever is convenient in the moment. Now he and Putin are friends to the end. Fast forward to today, when America still hasn't figured out that the problem is not left versus right, and Putin is now free to make his next move and we are not going to know it happened or what happened because America will never catch on to the fact that all you need to do is distract us and we will stop paying attention to the world because we don't have to because we are America. You can outright show us and we still haven't caught on. When you are that predictable, and so arrogant about it that you will make the same mistake over and over again and never change, you are easy to control. And no one is paying attention to Putin or the fact that he has just removed one of the biggest obstacles by being smart about what Americans will do all the way until the asteroid hits, which Americans very predictably made for themselves... We have the strongest military, but what does that mean when we pull out and the taliban is back in less than 24 hours but we are distracted by something else and not interest in that anymore. Your amazing military does not solve all problems and there are so many different ways to destroy a country. The easiest way is to set up a situation using predictable weaknesses and let them do all the work for you. Putin is an egomaniac but he knows he is and he knows his own weaknesses. America has been making the same international mistake over and over because we still believe we are invincible. And here is John Oliver who is probably also wishing he weren't so right back then too. I remember watching this back at the time and having no idea how far America would take that arrogance. Now I know. The left and right still haven't figured out that they have the exact same problem and maybe should be working together instead of fighting. And that maybe it wasn't THEIR idea to fight. Maybe it wasn't the Republican party's idea to rework what they have been planning since Reagan and change it all around at the last minute, and I doubt that all agree that non-Catholics are wayward children to be brought back into the fold sometime in the next 2000 years. Or sooner! Once all those abstract ideas become concrete and churches around America are no longer free to devote the entire sermon to the evil Christian church down the street, they still won't catch on. Maybe it wasn't the Democrat's idea to be all over the place on a topic where they should easily be united, like democrats have a tendency to do. Maybe there is something more going on here, and something more important we should be doing right now. Americans are too busy with their shiny objects to see that somebody put something in the water. They are too busy complaining about how somebody put something in the water.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

As anyone can get saved, if they make the choice to do so!  1-Realize that all have sinned before God in one way or another.  Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB)  10. ""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"" 11.""There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God."" 12.""They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."" 23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”  2-Realize that God loved us, even as wicked sinners,  enough to allow Jesus Christ to shed his blood on the cross to pay the price for our sins  Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB)  8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" 9.""Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."" 12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:”  3 -To be saved, you just need to confess unto God and ask him to save you, by accepting Jesus Christ paying the price for your sins, all in order to receive this freely given gift of forgiveness.  1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB) 1.""Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2.""By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.” 3.""For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4.""And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”  Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB) 9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 10.""For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."" 13.""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.""  Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB) 27.""And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"" 28.""So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”  Revelation 21: 8 (KJB) ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”  Romans 6: 23 (KJB) “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  (Lastly, an example of what to genuinely say to God in prayer to get saved and fully forgiven of all your sins.) “Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving.  I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me.  I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ. I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins.  I trust in him alone to save me.  Nothing else.  Not my good works or anything else.  Only Jesus.  I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”",1년 전,1,

@Tooamazin,"You are brainwashed and will never actually look into what I say but this is for anyone else who reads this fictional nonsense and actually believes in any of it.  Jesus's fictional story is just a rehash of MANY other fictional stories that came hundreds of years before man created another fictional person called Jesus.  Here are several stories that the fictional character jesus was created from.  Asklepios healed the sick, raised the dead, and was known as the savior and redeemer.  Hercules was born of a divine father and mortal mother and was known as the savior of the world.  Dionysus was literally the “Son of God”, was born of a woman who had not had sex with a man, and was depicted riding a donkey. He was a traveling teacher who performed miracles, and was killed and resurrected, after which time he became immortal.  Osiris did the same things. He was born of a virgin, was considered the first true king of the people, and when he died he rose from the grave and went to heaven.  Osiris’s son, Horus, was known as the “light of the world”, “The good shepherd”, and “the lamb”. He was also referred to as, “The way, the truth, and the life.” His symbol was a cross-like symbol.  Mithra‘s birthday was celebrated on the 25th of December, his birth was witnessed by local shepherds who brought him gifts, had 12 disciples, and when he was done on earth he had a final meal before going up to heaven. On judgment day he’ll return to pass judgment on the living and the dead. The good will go to heaven, and the evil will die in a giant fire. His holiday is on Sunday (he’s the Sun God). His followers called themselves “brothers”, and their leaders “fathers”. They had baptism and a meal ritual where symbolic flesh and blood were eaten. Heaven was in the sky, and hell was below with demons and sinners.  Krishna had a miraculous conception that wise men were able to come to because they were guided by a star. After he was born an area ruler tried to have him found and killed. His parents were warned by a divine messenger, however, and they escaped and was met by shepherds. The boy grew up to be the mediator between God and man.  Buddha‘s mother was told by an angel that she’d give birth to a holy child destined to be a savior. As a child he teaches the priests in his temple about religion while his parents look for him. He starts his religious career at roughly 30 years of age and is said to have spoken to 12 disciples on his deathbed. One of the disciples is his favorite, and another is a traitor. He and his disciples abstain from wealth and travel around speaking in parables and metaphors. He called himself “the son of man” and was referred to as, “prophet”, “master”, and “Lord”. He healed the sick, cured the blind and deaf, and he walked on water. One of his disciples tried to walk on water as well but sunk because his faith wasn’t strong enough.  Apollonius of Tyana (a contemporary of Jesus) performed countless miracles (healing sick and crippled, restored sight, casted out demons, etc.) His birth was of a virgin, foretold by an angel. He knew scripture really well as a child. He was crucified, rose from the dead and appeared to his disciples to prove his power before going to heaven to sit at the right hand of the father. He was known as, “The Son of God”.",1년 전,1,

I also absolutely believe our country needs to increase what is required to run for, and become, president. Bc right now it's age and born in US + living here before running. That's all.

@jeffs7879,"Donald Trump has never evolved beyond a 17-year-old frat boy mentality. He is brutally stupid and breathlessly ignorant. Currently, in 2023, he is unable to identify the president who beat him in the last election. He believes it was Obama. He believes that Biden is in charge of Russia and is leading us into World War II. He also believes that Jeb Bush got us into Afghanistan. He believes that windmills cause cancer, and the noise from windmills is killing whales. He believes that the cure for covid is drinking or ingesting disinfectant into your body. We know that he pays for sex with hookers and pornstars and has been accused by over two dozen women of sexually assaulting them, which he bragged about on a hot mic. The man could not find water if he was sitting in a rowboat. He doesn't tell it like it is. He tells us the way he sees it through his narrow, uneducated, uninformed, severely mentally ill mind. Lastly, the man and his campaign have gifted tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars from his supporters, by continuing to withdraw money from their bank accounts after they've given a one-time donation. Donald Trump does not give. Donald Trump takes. And as far as running the country the way he's run his business, he's filed bankruptcy six times. Who would bail America out after one bankruptcy? Donald Trump is probably not a billionaire. He's probably a simple millionaire, meaning he does not have hundreds of millions, he probably has a few million or maybe a little more., however, he is in enormous debt and most likely lives off of debt spending and repaid his Russian loans with the top secret information that was missing from their folders add mar-a-lago.

It's just mind numbing that there are so many people that are so easily fooled and vote purely on their own perception of the image he portrays to the public.  It's mind blowing that back in 2016 myself and many others were assuming the people who were ""voting"" for him were just joking and then after a terrible 4 years of him, things have happened in such a terrible way that it's extremely likely that we may have to deal with another 4 years and hopefully he hasn't riled up the low IQ followers enough to blindly follow extreme changes to America for the worst, like it seems he's trying to do with project 2025 bs.",1년 전,0,

I'm asking if we really learned or even pondered if the real source of our problems are our cultural values and attitudes - specifically our definitions of 'leadership', and even 'acceptable person' and 'respect-worthy person'? Did we redefine our ideas of 'abnormal behavior' and 'disrespect-worthy person'?  I don't think so.  Actual leadership is both coming up with new ideas that actually decrease badness for all in society, plus getting others to go along with you - NOT mere social dominance and power moves.  A respect-worthy person is simply someone who doesn't non-defensively hurt, harm, or degrade others.   A disrepsect-worthy person is simply the the opposite - one who with conscious intent sets out to non-defensively hurt, harm or degrade others. Until these ideas are overwhelmingly part of the mainstream, then we will continue to have more Trumps in the future, for laws are only as effective and persistent as the culture permits them to be.

@Mark-gg6iy,"Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested that the special grand jury investigating Donald Trump and his allies’ efforts to upend the 2020 election in Georgia has recommended multiple indictments and said that her decision on whether to bring charges is “imminent.”  The former — and possibly future — president is also a person of interest in the DOJ's sprawling inquiry into events surrounding January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The House select committee running a parallel congressional investigation into the siege has sought to build the case that Trump violated at least five federal laws connected to his efforts to overturn the 2020 US election. The committee subpoenaed Trump in October, 2022 which he did not comply with, and the panel has asked the DOJ to prosecute Trump for violating three of the five statutes it highlighted.  Here's a breakdown of the eight federal laws that Trump may have violated that Special Counsel Jack Smith is looking into at least.: The Espionage Act Concealment, removal, or mutilation of records Wire fraud Obstructing an official proceeding Witness tampering Conspiracy to defraud the government Inciting a rebellion  Trump may have violated at least three Georgia criminal election laws: conspiracy to commit election fraud, criminal solicitation to commit election fraud, and intentional interference with the performance of election duties.  Then there's that pesky rape and defamation trial coming in April, 2023. Oct. 2023 he will be going to trial in a $250M lawsuit by the manhattan DA for several financial crimes.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@williamwilson2270,"When talking about Racism, that's not really too much of a problem in Scotland, except where it seems to be central to the mysterious and often Satanic beliefs of the Masons who devolved from Pagan English immigrants and sodomite English beastiality Knights, who fled Acre when the big booted Moors gave them each a couple of achers at the end of the Crusades. Glasgow Rangers Supporters Club who were admittedly majority of moronic Scots with an inbred hatred of the former Rommin Kafflics. With an equally strong sexual preference for Sheep shaggin', but under the leadership of their infamous Angus McDumpfer, who later was exiled to Canada by the morality Committee of the Scottish government who thought the sheap stuff was bad enough, but found the perpetual Ass kissing of the English border raiders most offensive.  It is said that one group of the McDumphers and a mentally damaged Mcdonald Bred with the Big Mac Tribe of the dark wood points of Canada, lesser cousins to the more noble Mic Mac tribe. The McDumphers disappeared at that point in time, after one Bred with a Canadian version of the Old man of Loch Negar, the very rare 'Yolococa Susquache' so named for their strange genetic malformation of little pigmie hands and feet, but huge asses by which it was said they used for greater balance when firing their tiny bows. This later gave rise to the Glasgow Rangers motto/warcry ""weeArra people"" in reference to the tribal war cry of the rapidly expanding tribe of the Dumphers who were known for sneaking up to their victims and using the weight of their big asses to counter balance their ability to rake a person's pockets for loose change. History records that the Canadian government declared these creatures a menace around their camp sites around Winapeg and sent mounties and Hunters to eradicate this strange cousin of the Susquach who were of Little threat to the early settlers in the colony. By 1781 it was believed that the records of the French colonial authorities wrote that the last example of these strange genetic anomalies called ""Yoloca Dumpher"" creatures, was shot dead during a failed bank attack in Ottawa, so declaring these creatures to extinction. The strange hide of one of these creatures can be seen mounted in a frame in the Ottawa Museum to this day. It was a deap orange fur with a long brown streak down the middle in a skunk like manner. In its best, local early archaeology students found a scrap of Orange and white Plaid tartan with a broad yellow streak crossways, and seems to have been a totem of their early Scottish heritage, but on further investigation, Lord Lyon the Lord of Scottish Clan Tartans had no recognisable example of this list tartan within his archives. There is of course a legend dating back to 1847 when a strange band of pickpockets was found in Boston where a 2nd example of this forgotten genetic malformation of the 'little fingers' orange skinned mutant creatures was found. So the big assed tiny fingered clan of Dumphers entered the USA. As an expert I oppose the lie that these people were of real Scottish decent as the White Scots are pale white in general approaching a pale blue White colour in general. Often seen in early Summer in Spanish holiday resorts with pale blue tinge to their white flesh. A factor derived from the cold winters in Scotland. They can often be confused with their arrogant brutal colonial masters, the Southern English, but this is easily sorted if the suspected Scot has a ""Chin"" and are generally hairier with red or blonde hair, though dark brown or black is also common features. The Dumph's, Dumphers or Trump, Trumpets, are more orange in color, mutated with larger backsides, short legs and tiny feet and fingers, like the former US President, who is clearly not of valid Scottish decent. 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣👍👍👍😋🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿",2년 전,0,

The country would have been lucky to have her and the stuff that they brought up as her ""negatives"" or ""scandals"" were litearly all bullshit and was overblown beyond reason. And Trump got mentioned so much that at that point it was basicly prasing him. While Hilary got almost only negative coverage, while she was an inspiring candidate.   He didnt say anything uncorrect or unfactual, but the best example to show where crazy mistakes were made is that one episode where they talk about third party candidates and he comes to the conclusion in the end that: Third party members dont give you an alternative from choosing the lesser of two evil, but it makes you choose from 4. And that was ridicoulus, Hilary cant be compared to those lying, uninteligent, clowns. That was the narrative that they helped enforce in season 3.   Helping building up that narrative about Hilary was helping spreading the misinformation about her. And I have seen every single episode and they have done it over and over again.

@АбсолютСпирит,"At the bottom of the Rhine, the three Rhinemaidens, Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Floßhilde, play together. Alberich, a Nibelung dwarf, appears from a deep chasm and tries to woo them. The maidens mock his advances and he grows angry – he chases them, but they elude, tease and humiliate him. A sudden ray of sunshine pierces the depths, to reveal the Rhinegold. The maidens rejoice in the gold's gleam. Alberich asks what it is. They explain that the gold, which their father has ordered them to guard, can be made into a magic ring which gives power to rule the world, if its bearer first renounces love. The maidens think they have nothing to fear from the lustful dwarf, but Alberich, embittered by their mockery, curses love, seizes the gold and returns to his chasm, leaving them screaming in dismay.  Scene 2	Edit  Wotan's fortress of Valhalla (Brückner, 1896).  Alberich and the subjugated Nibelung dwarfs (illustration by Arthur Rackham, 1910). Wotan, ruler of the gods, is asleep on a mountaintop, with a magnificent castle behind him. His wife, Fricka, wakes Wotan, who salutes their new home. Fricka reminds him of his promise to the giants Fasolt and Fafner, who built the castle, that he would give them Fricka's sister Freia, the goddess of youth and beauty, as payment. Fricka is worried for her sister, but Wotan trusts that Loge, the cunning demigod of fire, will find an alternative payment.  Freia enters in a panic, followed by Fasolt and Fafner. Fasolt demands that Freia be given up. He points out that Wotan's authority is sustained by the treaties carved into his spear, including his contract with the giants, which Wotan therefore cannot violate. Donner, god of thunder, and Froh, god of sunshine, arrive to defend Freia, but Wotan cannot permit the use of force to break the agreement. Hoping that Loge will arrive with the alternative payment he has promised, Wotan tries to stall.  When Loge arrives, his initial report is discouraging: nothing is more valuable to men than love, so there is apparently no possible alternative payment besides Freia. Loge was able to find only one instance where someone willingly gave up love for something else: Alberich the Nibelung has renounced love, stolen the Rhine gold, and made a powerful magic ring out of it. A discussion of the ring and its powers ensues, and everyone finds good reasons for wanting to own it. Fafner makes a counter-offer: the giants will accept the Nibelung's treasure in payment, instead of Freia. When Wotan tries to haggle, the giants depart, taking Freia with them as hostage and threatening to keep her forever unless the gods ransom her by obtaining and giving them the Nibelung's gold by the end of the day.  Freia's golden apples had kept the gods eternally young, but in her absence they begin to age and weaken. In order to redeem Freia, Wotan resolves to travel with Loge to Alberich's subterranean kingdom to obtain the gold.  Scene 3	Edit In Nibelheim, Alberich has enslaved the rest of the Nibelung dwarves with the power of the ring. He has forced his brother Mime, a skillful smith, to create a magic helmet, the Tarnhelm. Alberich demonstrates the Tarnhelm's power by making himself invisible, the better to torment his subjects.  Wotan and Loge arrive and happen upon Mime, who tells them of the dwarves' misery under Alberich's rule. Alberich returns, driving his slaves to pile up a huge mound of gold. He boasts to the visitors about his plans to conquer the world using the power of the ring. Loge asks how he can protect himself against a thief while he sleeps. Alberich replies the Tarnhelm will hide him, by allowing him to turn invisible or change his form. Loge expresses doubt and requests a demonstration. Alberich complies by transforming himself into a giant snake; Loge acts suitably impressed, and then asks whether Alberich can also reduce his size, which would be very useful for hiding. Alberich transforms himself into a toad. Wotan and Loge seize him, tie his hands, and drag him up to the surface.  Scene 4	Edit Back on the mountaintop, Wotan and Loge force Alberich to exchange his wealth for his freedom. He summons the Nibelungen, who bring up the hoard of gold. He then asks for the return of the Tarnhelm, but Loge says that it is part of his ransom. Alberich still hopes he can keep the ring, but Wotan demands it, and when Alberich refuses, Wotan tears it from Alberich's hand and puts it on his own finger. Crushed by his loss, Alberich lays a curse on the ring: until it returns to him, it will inspire jealousy in all who possess it, and murderous envy in those who do not.  The gods reconvene. Fasolt and Fafner return with Freia. Fasolt, reluctant to release her, insists that the gold be piled high enough to hide her from view. Wotan is forced to relinquish the Tarnhelm, to help cover Freia completely. However, Fasolt spots a remaining crack in the gold, through which one of Freia's eyes can be seen. Loge says that there is no more gold, but Fafner, who has noticed the ring on Wotan's finger, demands that Wotan add it to the pile, to block the crack. Loge protests that the ring belongs to the Rheinmaidens, and Wotan angrily declares that he intends to keep it for his own. As the giants seize Freia and start to leave, Erda, the earth goddess, appears and warns Wotan of impending doom, urging him to give up the cursed ring. Troubled, Wotan calls the giants back and surrenders the ring. The giants release Freia and begin dividing the treasure, but they quarrel over the ring itself. Fafner clubs Fasolt to death. Wotan, horrified, realizes that Alberich's curse has terrible power.  Donner summons a thunderstorm to clear the air, after which Froh creates a rainbow bridge that stretches to the gate of the castle. Wotan leads the gods across the bridge to the castle, which he names Valhalla. Loge does not follow; he says in an aside that he is tempted to destroy the complacent gods by fire – he will think it over. Far below, the Rhine maidens mourn the loss of their gold and condemn the gods as false and cowardly.",3년 전,0,

""A term used to refer to a right-wing conspiracy theory that became popular among anti-government extremists from the 1990s onwards. 'New World Order' conspiracists believe that a tyrannical, socialist 'one-world' conspiracy has already taken over most of the planet and schemes to eliminate the last bastion of freedom, the United States, with the help of collaborators within the government. Through repressive measures, as well as manufactured crises such as terrorist attacks and pandemics, the globalist conspirators seek to eliminate dissent and to disarm Americans so that the 'New World Order' can move in and enslave them. 'New World Order' conspiracists also commonly believe that hundreds of concentration camps have been built in the U.S., ready to house dissenters; that the government will declare martial law, possibly on a pretext such as responding to a terrorist attack; and that the government will engage in mass gun confiscations.""  ....yet, still hasn't happened.  Of course the Trump administration got it a little closer by directing Homeland Security to figure out how to successfully arrest and detain illegal immigrants from a synchronized  nationwide raid(A plan that Homeland Security had never attempted to put together)..that got big cheers from the gun crowd ..too bad they can't see a couple of steps ahead and realize that their demands are causing more freedom to vanish...",3년 전,0,

@VitaeLibra, @mitchellcastillo2858  I've said it before but don't make the mistake of underestimating people. Don't assume people to be dumber than they are. That is dangerous. trump isn't smart but he isn't dumb either and he has experience in bullshitting people which is pretty much always better than being smart. He definitely knows what a nazi is and I'm willing to bet he has done his research on what [Godwin's law] did that worked and didn't work. There are some very interesting quotes from some of his books about the usefulness of lies and propaganda. So again. Don't underestimate him. 20 years in the business of lies makes a hell of a lot more difference than ones IQ. He might not know much about different things but he knows a lot about the things he needs to know to pretend he does. Which is why he wanted to handle his presidency like his business and why he managed to convince people it worked,3년 전,0,
@mitchellcastillo2858," @VitaeLibra  Hea not stupid but he is hindered by his narcissism. It's been said that he atleast owns a copy of mein kampf but he also doesn't like to read and has said as much. He hasn't written ANY books tho.  There's an interesting quote from the art of the deal that the author talks about dealing with truthful hyperbole.  Not an actual thing but he and his kids have been called to NY to testify about it.  It's when he inflates the worth of a building ""because it sounds better"" but when tax season comes around he deflates its worth. He's done it with all his properties and it's catching up with him now.    It's hard to believe he's actually intelligent if he can't can't a casino open though. ""The hoise always wins"" right? Unless it's poorly managed.   There certainly is some life lessons lost when all your problems Go away when daddy throws money at it. Such as doctors claiming someone had bone spurs.  It's even more apparent with his kids. Which again is why they are being called to testify in NY for Trump org. Shady dealings and tax fraud.  I don't think anyone under estimated him. I believe they over estimated the general population of America.  The bright shining city on the hill used to look alot better because in order to be heard you had to be worthy or rich or a crazy on the corner with a megaphone. Now you just need a cellphone.  Until you get permanently suspended from social media anyway.  Fanatical people tend to lean the same way and since everyone else doesn't show as much enthusiasm for things that are supposed to be a certain way the Fanatical crowd thinks they are the majority because they don't hear anyone shouting as loud as them.

@Ephemeral9862,"I’m going to get flak for saying this, but for the rest of the world outside America, the Trump phenomenon is actually understandable (although it still beggars belief). There is an innate drive, an Americanism if you will, that drives people to win at all costs. Success (or, at least the appearance of it) is viewed as the highest virtue and every other moral or even rational consideration is subservient to that. Trump is only the latest (and possibly the most extreme) specimen in a long line of such examples. Think of the astronomical fall of financial giants (individuals and institutions alike) who denied wrongdoing and even mistakes right up to the point where they imploded with such spectacular force that they took the entire financial markets down with them. America, as a country, has wreaked havoc in international politics over the years and refused to take responsibility for it when things went south (Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the list goes on). And yet, look how gently the country treats its greatest interlopers. It’s almost as if they are rewarded for their daring and cutthroat commitment to self-interest (success). The biggest corporations in the world are bailed out by taxpayers after they commit crimes that leave thousands of people destitute. The military used to act as a free-for-all in other countries, now the police acts the same way with civilians. The healthcare system is in a choke hold of financial complexity and policies that defund human lives to pad the bottom lines. The financial system is actively committed to getting people in a debt cycle right from their teen years. But talk about defunding and descaling the corrupt institutions and the very taxpayers that have been cheated out of their life savings in one of these schemes will balk - and will probably vote Trump in again. After all, maintaining the appearance of success is so much more important than the greater (and even personal) benefit. Americans are incapable of removing the rose-tinted glasses even as the ground and water beneath their very feet and their bodies are being poisoned by the very success they so desperately idolize.",4년 전,1,

Or at least more than... you know...),3년 전,0,
@Charlie-uz8vb," @VitaeLibra  Firstly, Forbes values Trumps net worth at 2.5 Billion as of 2021 so the original guys comment was a cope.  You're right Democrats didn't storm the capitol but you have a short memory if you say there wasn't political violence over the election. For example during Trump's inauguration there were riots.  The capitol riots weren't an attempted overthrow. They weren't armed or organized to take over the building. I'm not sure what to tell you if you think the entire government is reliant on one federal building. So stop with the hyperbole.",3년 전,0,
@VitaeLibra," @Charlie-uz8vb  well I wasn't really talking about his net worth but if you want to get into it his networth isn't just 2.5 billion. It has dropped all the way from ~4.5 billion in ~2015 according to forbes. So the dive is pretty steep and it get even worse when we apply the knowledge that he got A LOT of funding during his presidentiaæ campaigns and presidency. He's apparently been very shifty with a lot of the PACs people donate to too. One of them just plain out states he can use his money to do whatever he wants (vacations, buying luxuries, etc). Some of the other ones are located in his hotels and resorts on paper and thus he has them pay rent ($38.000 a month in one case. Even when they moved physical location they continued to pay rent). So the money goes into a piggy bank for ""a good cause"" and then falls out the bottom. He also handled the pandemic badly. And I don't mean the classic ""he's the reason we're in thise mess"". I mean he didn't invest in safer options and his real estate tanked as could be predicted by anyone. I'm not disputing that he's rich but he isn't succesful and he's slowly going broke. You know how people have gotten on his case for not paying taxes? The reason he hasn't done that is because his business has lost more money than they've earned. Not really successful. I've spent way too long on this. I'll get to the other stuff  I will say that when I had just started taking interest in american politics around 2016-2017 so I don't know that much about the specifics. As far as I found there wasn't a single death during the 2016 protests and most had good reasons for taking place reasons. I say most because a few were apparantly russia taken advantage of the outrage (so designed to make people angry. It sounds crazy but I'm just repeating what wiki says and there's sources) and one was the first protest in space lol. Of course riots happened. That's pretty much unavoidable. What I care about is the percentage of violent protests and from what I can find it was pretty low. Although it looked like violence happened often since a lot of protests happened too. Apparently, in january 2018, not a single day had gone by without a protest in response to trump. The womens march was apparantly the biggest protests ever in us history  This last one is just plain false. Plenty of people were carrying baseball bats and other blunt force objects/weapons. Also zip tie cuffs. A few have also been charged with possesion of firearms and conspiracy (ironic huh?). One guy brought a gun, a rifle, a shotgun, a taser and 11 molotovs. And some other stuff but I can't remember. And I don't care how organized they were. You have seen the clip were they're shouting ""hang mike pence"" outside by the gallows they constructed right? They had maps of the building. If they weren't attempting to overthrow democracy then why were and are they saying they wanted to prevent biden from becoming president? He democratically won the election and they wanted to prevent him from becoming president. That's overthrowing democracy in my book. I don't care about the building. That's just were it happened. I do care who was in it. How many seats do you have? Around 500 combined? How well do you think the government would run if they were killed and the guy who didn't have the majority vote was put in charge? Do you think the majority of the country would just accept it? And when your answer is no how do you think trump would handle the incoming civil war? The guy who skipped his draft for the war leading a war he created. And I'm sure no country interested in either maintaining democracy or getting rid of a temporarily weakened rival would jump in at all... This is hyperbole. Saying they were there to overthrow democracy is not. If it was such a simply tourist visit how come 5 people died? How come they made makeshift gallows? Why were they literally chanting the names of those they said they wanted to kill. I'm not the one saying all of this. They did that themselves. What was it you said? I'm not sure what to tell you if you think people attacking the government and ramming the doors in on the people in charge of the country wasn't that big a deal. If any other country did that the US would be sending in troops en masse ""in the interest of protecting democracy"" and you know that. They did it 50+ times in siuth america in the last 100 years. If mine is hyperbole you're about to overdose on muscle relaxants. I don't know how you've been conditioned to think this is normal but damn it isn't. You'd know that if you took a moment to think about it. How isn't people actively trying to kill politicians that big a deal?

The effort he makes, Donaldi , he makes ,all the time, insisting on these and other lies and before it was talking bad about Obama !! "" They invaded ,The Capitol, to look for papers that could incriminate the President - Elect , Joe Biden , using for that an apparent confusion of dissatisfied !! Donaldi , really wanted to find something to prove his delusions of power !!  "" Donaldi , he is a master at reversing all situations , everything he says reverses the responsibility he has into others ,or imposes on others what he wants to hide and what he himself believes not to be seen as he really is and thinks !!  - The Trump Taj Mahal is closing: did it make Atlantic City great? | Make the USA a Taj Mahal $$ ? OH! Yes , money fell from the sky to him , so easy !! Is that the reason for insisting that it can be political and with that speech destroy the country for its own gain $$ ? Dishonest? ----------------------- US Election 2016 ----------------------------------------------------What's the problem anyway, isn't it true?! Who pays is yourself! --------------------------------------------------------------------""Sorry, but all of this, coming from Donald, is very easy to understand!! What he wants is money $$ sent to him to save the USA, an amount that will be around ten to fifty billion US dollars!!Money to buy the American legal system and turn everything into irreparable chaos!!And that is all he has learned to do in his life and in his super limited view of the world around him!! Horrible. I'm sorry for all of you there in the USA!!""We will all accept Miss Kayleigh McEnany's invitation! Yes, we will enter the Republican Disneyland!! A Disneyland that lacks grace and surprises and cannot really bring anything interesting or really NEW to our lives !!Let's imagine the hundreds of voting ballots found in a river, unidentified, ones that had the name of Trump written on them, a name that is even stamped on ice cubes in the real world. Let's be curious. Had it been charged on Miss Kayleigh McEnany, we should at least be curious to know, like a Journalist who asked her where the river was at all, and was obviously left unanswered !! Take a look at the curiosity of this story: weren't voting ballots put there by the Republicans? Were they not manufactured somewhere, printed in a garage, with the name of Trump, for his own benefit? How were the ice cubes with the Trump name stamped ? To put them in the polls before they were opened to be counted ? --------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------And because they didn't have the opportunity to use them for that purpose, the Republicans threw them into a river no one knows where it is and no one knows its name? Or it would be, as he appeared in a short video, with an Hindu in a small car full of voting ballots for the Democrat candidates Biden and Kamala, explaining in typical Donald language that he would take all those votes for the Democrats into the electoral urns because they had been paid for that purpose, and he did it for money because money dominates the world and so he did it under Democrats order to cheat the elections!! A story obviously put there, in that car with a Hindu, full of electoral ballots, put there by the Republicans, who, even before the elections, had already built this tale of fraud, trying to make believe that they were being passed over!! We must not forget that this fellow, Donald, threatened a journalist who published in a newspaper that the Casino he had built would go bankrupt and was right by the accounts he had made! Donald's threats to him were fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars $$ and the end of this journalist's wallet! It seems strange that this defamation of the whole country caused by Donald has not yet had serious consequences! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So we are going to Republican Disneyland creating a story that turned back at them, after all, how could they have beaten Hillary Clinton in 2016? How was it possible? That was not possible! How could they have won without fraud?! How can a guy who doesn't know how to do anything but mess up have won?! Without having defrauded?! ""Doesn't it seem childish to think that in a fraudulent election, only Democrats defrauded? Look, if the Democrats had used the Internet through the WhatsApp to modify the Results of the Election, why wouldn't the Republicans?! It's a childish opinion, isn't it? Very comic and very stupid! ""He must have a very good advertising team that manages, based on the mentality of the US citizens, to stop criticism in their minds and open without thinking about everything that will be induced there! To brainwash unprepared minds! And that is what he has done with whoever calls it stupid! Be careful! In fact, it's not hard to see that he's manipulating, such a good psychopath $$ he is! ------------ ""He, Donald, insists on this and other lies because he was educated by his father that $$ money buys 90% of the people and knows that in this game there are billions of US dollars $$ and that judges, together with the oil billionaires in Texas, may join him, because he is desperate for the billions $$ and he is willing to do anything he can, even if it is necessary to destroy the the American Democracy for his own benefit and at the expense of others!! This Giuliani looks like a child who puts his hand in front of his eyes and thinks that no one else sees him!! Sorry ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""I think I know the truth equally and that truth is unique. Giulliani has already received to claim donations that reach 170 million dollars $$ to continue with this Circus show of clowns!! 170 million dollars $$ in just a few weeks of work! WOW!! It is not for nothing that he and Donald, hallucinated by $$ money, are laughing at the face of their followers and are now owners of 170 million US dollars $$, tax free, for lying for just a few weeks!! WOW!! He, Donald, never had 75 million votes! Never! He rigged that election and also in 2016! And the witch hunt was carried out for Hillary Clinton and never for this deceitful and lying man! I can't understand why they don't give this scoundrel an arrest warrant. With these lies he is putting the country in danger, overturning the whole order by repeating all the time that the current President, Mr. Biden, is just a fake President! By doing so, he destroys the core of the USA order and throws the whole country into chaos! And why is nobody doing anything against him legally? Very strange! Where are the laws to arrest him and make him pay for slandering an entire country?  ""What would it be like to dream then in the USA?Put a lunatic smart-ass in power named Donaldi? Please , who paid and paid $$ for all this , this very bad spectacle was the People , the same one that has the Power to grow with the support that is now being given to it in a serious and Democratic Government !! ""Sorry to say , but Republicans want the same money $$ only for themselves and what's already in Tax havens that add up to Eighty Trillion USD Dollars $$ !! WOWThe same place that Donaldi doesn't want that anyone go there in it place to charge what it should be serving the people of the USA and the whole world, paying $$ all the debts of the same world and creating more bases for a strong democracy and this is no dream !!It just seems like a dream for those smart clowns who want a big clown to clown to distract from Reality!!",4년 전,1,

Sure the shameless right-wing media like Fox, OAN, Newsmax and a horde of right-wing assholes on the radio helped this traitor but the real blame rests with the American people who fell for his unrelenting bullshit. Is it over? Think about this. Trumpo the Klown has further prepared the country for a slicker version of himself. Sure he may run again in 2024 but it is also possible that this country with its inherent short-attention span with get excited about another corrosive, regressive and younger asshole named Ron DeSantis.   It is also possible that the disease of the Rethug Party will be increased after next year's ""elections"" (that they are presently trying to pervert as much as possible) so that there will be even less chance ot passing new legislation that will help Americans by taking over the Senate and the House. Moscow Mitch's obstructionism would be given a major boost and that is just what he is hoping for.

@DrBigt," @Anvilman  Oh, please. It's a blatant hitpiece and shows this show's bias to the max because it's totally one sided. Meanwhile Joe Biden in recent press confrence casually starts talking about little girl crossing her legs and how she looks like 19 years old and no one says a thing because not Trump despite making really fucking weird comments to a veteran's daughter, while the veteran was literally right next to her.    Where's JO making a video about Joe Biden having weird inaproppiate showers with his daughter, that caused her to get mental problems? Or any of the other creepy fucking bullshit he's done over the years?   You know had it been made by Trump, we'd have this sort of a huge discussion by JO and video going ""What are you doing, you weird old man!""",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@Anvilman," @DrBigt  So you're incapable of acknowledging the fact that Trump was an objectively terrible president.  I don't see how that's supposed to be JO's fault.  Again, nothing JO said in this video is false or unjustified.  That's because after four years of Trump saying and doing stupid crap on a regular basis, Biden's occasional foot-in-mouth comments are downright mundane in comparison.  If you wanted Biden to be held accountable for such things, you shouldn't have let Trump normalize that kind of behavior.",4년 전(수정됨),3,
@DrBigt," @Anvilman  Because people voted Biden not because they liked him, but rather voted just because he wasn't Trump. Now that Biden is president, suddenly there's almost no discussion or views on the president despite Biden being a horrible human being.  Trump has never had his daughters say they had inapproripate showers with her father that caused her to get addictions. That's literally what Biden's daughter has written about. Since when has that sort of behavior been normalized?  It's not just ""foot in mouth"",  you really don't seem to understand that the stuff he's personally done is just absolutely vile. The only reason people seem to defend him is because he's not Trump, which automatically gives him get out of the jail for free from all criticsm it seems. Funny that when Biden says bad stuff it's ""foot in mouth"" and forgiven but when Trump says stuff, it's always taken at literal face value and should always be held against him.     Seriously, why isn't JO making any stories about Biden? Because there's plenty of things to be said. He's bashed Trump for far less serious and mundane things that Trump has said, as oppossed to things Biden has DONE. There is absolute no way there is not enough material for 17 minutes from everything in Biden's life and things he's said.

It's a bit rich to talk about double standards while this show is high in its double standards. Regardless if true or not, JO would be blasting these stories and look into the accusations and address them. Nothing like that about Biden, even though these claims are far worse than anything Trump has done. He's strung on every single word on Trump for less than Biden.  Literally all of Biden's children are drug abusers, that should raise red flags.  He promised to remove student loan payments and then backed down on his word in an interview after he was elected.

If you trigger the censors, your comment doesn't appear on youtube. You can try it yourself. Or search for ""youtube automatically censors"" online to find several of the examples.  I don't support Trump, I'm not even American. The double standard is in that democrats put Biden on Pedestral and ignore all his wrong doings just because he's not Trump. There's a reason why Creepy Joe is a meme. Again, JO has yet to make a story on Biden despite the fact that there's lots to talk about.  Why do you keep voting for people that are so old and creepy?

@robertkrakaur8987," @Anvilman  I understand what you’re saying, but here’s the problem: Congress. No president can do anything without congress, and it’s Biden’s own fault that congress is split 50-50. His whole campaign was anti trump. He won the primary not because he was the best, but because we weren’t looking for the best. We were looking for Not Trump, and the lowest common denominator. We got what we wanted. “I just need Trump to not be president anymore”. We both know people who felt this way, and they got what they wanted. But by setting such a low expectation, they also allowed republicans to do well in congress.

@kitsunekierein7253,"The foundational epidemic of american society   Stephen kierein   Perhaps our present misfortune is an epidemic of insanity in American society. We make excuses for the insane and the racist. We defend an insane man's right to be insane far more than we do the rights of others to be safe from that madness. We defend a lunatics right to have a gun more than a child's right to life and education. We are so obsessed with personal liberty that we fail to consider the consequences of those rights on the world at large. You are free to believe Q. We agree that that is a right granted to you. However, it is equally true that you are insane if you believe that bullshit. You need to be medicated and/or institutionalized if you believe that Nancy Pelosi drinks the blood of babies to grant her eternal life.    Reality matters.    Truth matters.   The truth is what the facts show it to be.    The facts can prove that basically everything the Q wackjobs believe is a fiction. A fiction birthed and nurtured by T***p. A fiction that i would not at All be surprised to learn that T***p and Q are the same person. He certainly helped give it credibility over the last FOUR YEARS!    These people are so insane that they have become terrorists. How insane must one be before their rights are overcome by the rights of the rest of us? How selfish must you be to believe that your own rights T***p the rights of the rest of us?    The domestic tranquility has been forfeited by these insane people. If communism could be investigated by McCarthy, then those who back the insane ought to get the same treatment. We must purge the traitors and the oathbreakers from our government, or else the crazy Fuckers will attack us from within again like they did on January 6th. Next time, the coup d'etat may succeed. Woe to the land of the free on the day the insane manage to take hold of power. They do not value human life as we do. T***p proved that, from his disinterest in containing the pandemic to the dozens of children who died of neglect in his care.   They only value their own rights and to HELL with everybody else.   The dichotomy of good and evil is vastly overused. However, this situation really is that simple.   Republicans believe they are right and everyone else is a socialist.    The democrats see themselves as right and the republicans as objectively wrong.   Unlike the republicans, the democrats proved it in the impeachment trial. Then the republicans signed the evidence by voting to acquit a provably guilty man on a charge of treason.    Why are we hostage to the whims of the insane? Why are the insane followed so willingly by those who are morally normal.   Why is DC Daniel free to threaten to Charlottesville me with a truck with impunity? That is absolutely insane. Dude admits to being a confederate. Dude seems to support the rioters on the 6th, both in real time and since.    He is just one of a great many insane people. For every one we can see, at least five hide behind a fake wall of sanity. I know of two others who are as DC is.    Its not right that terrorists get privileges in our society while the patriotic colored peoples cannot even go for a jog without loosing their right to life!   It's not FUCKING RIGHT! I want to riot. I want to destroy everything I can see in my blood rage! I want to go find these insane people and break their legs with a baseball bat. I want to, i really do so desperately want to...   But I am not evil like they are. I am not so lost that I cannot reason. The people who cried about the George Floyd riots were the same people who wanted to hang mike pence on the 6th.    I believe in justice. It may not be real, but that doesn't stop any of you from going to church. If you can believe in an all powerful sky fairy, then my belief in justice ought not be chastised.    However, justice failed yesterday and i nearly put a knife through my heart when I learned that BOTH MY SENATORS condoned the terrorists and their attack.    If the rule of law matters, then those who gleefully excused white nationalist terrorists deserve a great many evils. I must trust that the judges will do what our senators could not: condemn domestic terrorism.   I will compare the 1/6 attack to the 9/11 attack. Bin laden ordered the attack. His supporters did what he told them to do, and people died. Did we defend Bin laden in the aftermath? No. We made it our mission in this life to kill him and destroy his death cult.    The only difference between Bin laden and T***p is the color of their skin.    But it proved to be the only difference that matters to you people...  .................  Why do fascists lie?   By Stephen Kierein   They lie because the image of themselves is not the person they actually are. They need to lie, even to themselves. It is not by accident that politician and liar are widely agreed to be synonymous. A politician's entire career is built around pretending to be whatever others wish them to be and often has very little to do with who they truly are. Trump is a good example. He built a persona that he convinced people was his own. People who knew him privately knew him to be something completely different. His own blood agree he is a psychopathic narcissistic and incompetent megalomaniac. However, he fooled everyone into believing he was a top tier businessman and master negotiator with a godlike intellect never before seen in all the history of the world. Once people believe the lie, they can be controlled.   Fascism is exactly the same. Hitler was not seen as a monster by his own people BECAUSE he controlled the truth. Anyone who wishes to control the truth should never be trusted. A free press is designed to make truth completely separate from the controls of the powerful. So long as the powerful attempt to control the facts for their own ends, we will always be vulnerable to this kind of attack from within. Donald trump, or someone like him, will try to do this again. Do not fool yourself into thinking it could never happen. If the capitol building can be sacked, anything can happen. It is vitally important that we do something immediately to prevent this madness from repeating itself, and a doctorate could well be written on the myriad lessons we can take away from this civilization shaking cataclysm. There is a very good reason we are hardwired to be wary of those who lie. It provides a very real survival (dare I say evolutionary?) Advantage. Where politics is concerned, however, dishonesty is a fact of the game. Why ought the powerful get this kind of imbalance? Why did we build a system on a foundation of accepting the unacceptable?    We as a nation must ask ourselves this question. Unlike every other political issue, we MUST find solutions. The game is built to make solutions temporary and makes conflict the name of the game.    We say, ""you are not to discuss race, religion, and politics in public!"" But this is itself a damning demand. The damnation comes from the unspoken component. It comes from the answer to why you are not to talk about these things: to prevent conflict.   That answer admits to the asker that these beliefs should never be questioned if our civilization is to survive the night. These beliefs, which are not properly rooted in facts and evidence, are easy to disprove. However, the powerful have these beliefs to thank for the very existence of their power. That is why the powerful want exceptions. Without exceptions to the rules, legal or otherwise, the powerful would loose their power by the very act of preserving that power as this insurrection has underlined that point clearly.   The dishonest rely on objectively unethical practices like controlling who can and who cannot vote. We call this voter suppression. They call it election integrity steps. However, regardless what you call it, it is the same thing. You can do whatever mental gymnastics you want, but that fact will still remain after all of it. that fact cannot be overcome with facts, so we are expected to not bring it up. Its the same with most ""political"" issues.    Take abortion rights. The left and the right use different facts as their foundation in the same way that Christianity and Hinduism are founded on mutually exclusive sets of myths.

After he incited the insurrection, he did nothing to stop it, even though the lives of legislators and his VP were in jeopardy.

He told the proud boys to ""stand back and stand by,"" he appointed white supremacists to cabinet positions, he denounced peaceful protests by people of color as ""unpatriotic"" (from Colin Kapernick to BLM) while condoning the presence of right-wing white supremacist terror groups posing as ""militias.""

Biden's actions were those of a representative of the constituency of the time while he served in the Legislative branch.  Something he was duty-bound to do under the constitution.  At least he had professional integrity as an elected official (something Trump lacked), even if he was professional to a fault.  Robert Byrd was a FORMER Klansman, who called his membership in the Klan ""the worst mistake of his life.""  He regretted it to his dying day, and was an active champion of civil rights.  He had remorse for his actions and actively made amends.  Just because you're a PoC doesn't mean you're not a fascist.

@Chunkboi," Grub Goblin  Let's unpack yet another steaming pile of Trump you posted.  my points werent debunked: Then why were they completely debunked?  your contradictory comment said what I said using different words. Okay, so you lack reading comprehansion skills.   If it was debunked, Trump would be in prison and you wouldnt have contradicted yourself. Trump isn't in prison because 1) he was wrongfully acquitted in the senate twice, and 2) His due process is still ongoing for his tax fraud.  You dont know what debunked means. de·bunk /dēˈbəNGk/ Learn to pronounce verb past tense: debunked; past participle: debunked      expose the falseness or hollowness of (a myth, idea, or belief).  Which is exactly what I did with the falsehoods you posted.  I realize liberals dont know what a lot of words mean. Just because you have a tiny vocabulary, that does not mean the rest of the world is the same as you.  You hear it on cnn/msnbc one time and run with it. No, that's what people like you do with OANN, Fox ""News,"" ""News""max, and the words of the steaming pile of Trump.  Remember that lie you guys spread about a cop beat to on jan 6th (he died of a stroke on the 7th)? Well, no, because nobody can remember a lie that was never told (the stroke was a result of the beating he sustained on the 6th).  Remember that lie about Trump saying drink bleach (it was a biden lie)? No, because Trump said to ""inject disinfectant.""  There was no Biden lie.  Remember when you guys said he never denounced white supremacy ( which was a lie and even you admitted he did)? Well, he never did denounce white supremacy.  Every time he allegedly denounced it, he was lying again.  His own actions and policies, which condoned and abetted white supremacists and neo-nazis, contradicted the empty denouncements he made.  (And I was clear on that point...that all of his ""denouncements"" were fake, as proven by his actions.)  Remember when you guys blamed republicans for defunding the police( we have internet; it was obviously democrats)? No, because nobody adequately defunded the police.  The social programs that would attack the root cause of crime aren't being funded.  Remember when you guys ""debunked"" and called it a ""conspiracy theory"" that the virus possibly came from a lab in wuhan last year (wrong again)? Because last year, it was a conspiracy theory, as there was no evidence to indicate that the virus escaped from a lab.  In fact, research today still makes it just as likely COVID-19 still originated in nature.  However, the conspiracy theory that you fascists really pushed was that the virus was engineered as a biological weapon, even though the hypothesis had been rejected multiple times by sequencing and research.  Oh, but do keep showing us how much of a lying simpleton of a troll you really are, child.

@Chunkboi,"​ Grub Goblin  So, you demonstrate that you are a lying simpleton, then.  At least you proved my point on that score.  So, for the interest of those on the thread who actually have higher brain functions, I will debunk your gish gallop.  all of that and you still said nothing. Actually, I posted objective facts, but since you lack reading comprehension skills, you understood nothing.  Liberals think saying words makes it real i.e. men in dresses are women. And that's obvious projection.  You fascists think saying words makes it real, e.g., You guys are terrified of Trump because he loves America, while you people love communism.  Quite the opposite.  In fact, Trump does not love America...if he had, he would have resigned over the crimes he committed.  He loves himself and his money.  Meanwhile, liberals do NOT love an economic system which is mathematically impossible (look up the tragedy of the commons).  None of you can tell me one good thing biden has done Biden undid Trump's executive orders to ban LGBTQ+ people from military service. Biden put a stimulus package in play which kept the economy from collapse. Biden actually implemented effective vaccine distribution which allowed several states to re-open safely, instead of denying and/or downlplaying the severity of COVID-19. Biden is assembling an infrastructure package which we need to repair our crumbling transportation, information, and utility infrastructure.  (We can hope that McConnell doesn't filibuster the bill over his usual petty vindictiveness.)  because he is trash and you know it. We've known Trump is trash since the beginning of his campaign.  But he did the real damage when he took office (at least the damage which can be measured objectively).  Biden is so bad that not even his voters celebrate him. Biden isn't a saint, and just because he actually does his job instead of constantly playing golf or holding self-serving Nuremburg-style political rallies (unlike what Trump did) does not mean his voters don't appreciate him.  At least obama had actual fans. Obama had fans much like Biden has fans.  We appreciate what he does but we don't worship him.  He actually did good things for the country, just like Biden does.  I hope Trump continues to haunt you for the rest of your life. Trump's damage will haunt this nation for decades to come.  He alienated our allies, capitulated to our enemies, threw refugees into concentration camps, put us into a losing trade war with his inane tariffs, and bungled a pandemic response so badly the US had one of the highest per-capita death rates of any industrialized nation.

A lot more successful than Biden who has wrecked everything. And Biden acts like a dictator, forcing compliance on things on vaccine mandates (despite avoiding natural immunity for political reasons) and protecting his allies who broke the law like Fauci. The only child I see is you here buddy.",4년 전,1,
@Chunkboi," @caseclosed9342  Okay, let’s debunk your gish gallop…  You seem to have difficulty with the fact that effects do not precede causes. Biden cannot have surrendered to the Taliban because he wasn’t President in 2018. Gas prices went up due to demand, because more people were getting vaccinated and being able to move around more.  They were decreased before because demand went down due to voluntary self-isolation in order to prevent from catching and spreading COVID-19. The trade war did not protect us from China.  It drove US businesses overseas.  Trump himself created jobs IN CHINA. Trump being allowed to get away with numerous felonies is not “criminal justice reform.” Trump did not make international peace deals…he surrendered to the Taliban, capitulated to North Korea for a vague and ultimately broken promise of denuclearization, and refused to enforce sanctions on Russia that he himself signed into law. The border policy did not stop illegal immigration, it neglected our legal ports of entry and diverted funds away from effective border security measures to a boondoggle of a wall and concentration camps at which numerous human rights violations were committed. Biden is not acting like a dictator, but he is acting in accordance with the law.  Forcing compliance on vaccine mandates is not tyranny, it is protection for the public to keep anti-vaxxers from spreading a disease where “natural immunity” is incredibly rare, if it exists at all, and of those who get it, 6-8% will die, and the remainder will have varying degrees of lifelong debilitating effects.   Fauci did not break the law, that is another lie perpetuated by social media outlets.  This is all information backed by vetted evidence.  Don’t take my word for it…go check out the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the US Chamber of Commerce, the US Department of Energy, the US State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  All of their websites provide the information that back my statements of fact and refute your falsehoods.  Now, child, I told you to go sit in the corner.  Clearly you don’t know how to listen to your betters.",4년 전,0,
@caseclosed9342," @Chunkboi  yeah right keep believing fairy tales. You are a bootlicker and enable tyranny. I don’t personally like Trump’s behavior but his policies were way more better than Biden’s. If you’re too dumb to believe that, that’s your problem.",4년 전,1,

@Chunkboi," @gokubroly12009  that’s a tricky thing. See…I was trained in med school, not law school.  Lindell needs to face repercussions for spreading unambiguously harmful disinformation, but the real question is how we proceed.  Trump has a mountain of evidence that nails him on 1/6 but Lindell isn’t so highly placed with an office. Trump should have been convicted because his abuse of the 1st amendment led to harm of others. Lindell did not hold high office so he was not sworn to those high standards and thus not prosecutable unless placed under subpoena.  Should he face justice? Yes. Will he face justice? Doubtful. If we couldn’t bring Trump to justice over actual felonies…",3년 전,0,

You'll soon hear about the federal Pandemic Response Team being shut down by President Trump. As a result, more than 200,000 Americans die from a pandemic that third world countries have under control.  White supremacist groups are emboldened by rallying around #DictatorTrump.  Trump commits multiple instances of obstruction of justice.  and on...and on...and on...  We elected him back out, and he isn't man enough to concede.  Trump applies multiple tactics to disrupt the democratic election process, including lawsuits. The justices, like the American voters, throw him out for a lack of merit.   The adults in the room at the White House are hopefully keeping the nuclear football away from him until he permanently leaves the White House.  If I'm not back next year...well...we tried.

@legoworksstudios1,"The story of America can be likened to a sigh of relief following a massive panic attack and that's happened more than once. Such as:  American Revolution: critically under-equipped group of colonies does the unthinkable and sets a precedent for independence movements 200 years before it's cool.  Civil War: tragicomedy of errors shaped as Compromise of 1850, Indian Removal Act and others tearing the country in half crosswise and creates many generations of white supremacists and other racists who would go silent by the 80s (only to briefly return during his presidency and are expected to be challenged in a Biden presidency)  Civil Rights and Vietnam: another era that threatened to split the country open like a pair of legs juxtaposed with the counterculture of the era that would see an end to the Jim Crow era laws that motivated the Civil Rights era in the first place.  Cold War and 9/11: a country hellbent on ending communism in a retrospectively perverted way that could be likened to how it aided in the death of Nazism in Europe if the anti-communist priapism didn't also cause blindness, considering how we entered the early 2000s with a ghost from the Soviet War in Afghanistan coming back to break its neck over a steel beam.  I read a comment on a another video that explained the rest of the world sees the US the same way the US sees Florida, which is a comically blursed comparison to make.

If you haven't figured it out by now, Trump lied to all his supporters for MONTHS because he couldn't accept reality that he lost. And he showed the world Republicans overall cannot accept reality either lol.   But as time went on, even more truths about the ulterior motive of his lies surfaced. An example — He knew he lost but decided to grift his own supporters before his exit.   How? By extending his campaign fundraiser for months to help combat election frauds LOL.  And he was still greedy with that!   He tricked poor seniors and others less computer savvy with dirty tactics like have a fine print, and a finer last sentence print saying — make this a weekly recurring donations.   Donors who claimed they were victimized by the scheme included Stacy Blatt, a 63-year-old cancer patient in hospice who made a $500 contribution then found himself unable to pay his utility bills and rent when the transaction repeated, costing him $3,000 in less than 30 days. His fixed income was only $1,000 per month.   thedailybeast com/trump-campaign-duped-donors-including-ones-who-were-dying-into-recurring-contributions-nyt",4년 전,5,
@Vunomic," @voterrole2852  remember Trump campaign slogan that y'all on the Right said he's different then other politicans?  Drain the Swamp — he first signed it right when he took office, an executive order.   That Executive Order , that he campaign on, was an order saying: No government employee — who no longer work in US government, can be a lobbyists or foreign agent for 5 years!   Well it's just a sales pitch. He revoked his own executive order lol.  Now that he's no longer in office, he reverse his most important legislation that was Trump campaign image for ""anti establishment"".   Any more proof needed that he is just a business man exploiting America to further his own personal wealth and power?

@Vunomic," @voterrole2852  and now I want to bring it all back to the beginning. When y'all were all brainwashed by Trump's lawyer over baseless election fraud claims.   What's funny is most of y'all actually believe Democrats somehow convinced an all Republican red state like Georgia using Republican Governor and a Republican Secretary of State Raffensperger — to help Dems defraud hundreds of thousands of ballots, overturning Trump.  That alone should have been y'all signal that it was all BS and because y'all can't accept facts that don't care about your feelings, Raffensperger wisely recorded his convo with Trump.   Why? Because he knew Trump was going to blatantly lie about their convo to the public. Haha. Sure as hell, Trump lied about it on Twitter the next day.   I'm asking — why would a person who is looking for the truth & transparency in elections would lied the next day to his very own supporters what his own Republican Secretary of State told him?  And remember how y'all would love to post Trump's lawyer Sidney Powell baseless election fraud claims?   After losing every single court case (over 60+ cases) another example of why y'all care about your feelings more than facts LOL, Sidney Powell finally admitted in court recently when being sued.   What did she admit?  That the Right are stupid as hell, because her defense was — Only reasonable person thought her election fraud claims were facts Haha savage.   law com/nationallawjournal/2021/03/22/facing-defamation-sidney-powell-says-no-reasonable-person-thought-her-election-fraud-claims-were-fact/",4년 전,14,

Now that it's 9 days till election, I hope with every fiber of my being that the vast majority of Americans have finally waken up to see how corrupt and destructive Trump has been for the past four years.

@navonmyhand7999," Sigkim   @Sigkim  I didn't mention your name because I knew you would respond 😂😂 anyways I think I can answer both your questions? How is Trump everything he said other people were: 1. LIES! Trump (on his now banned Twitter account) mentioned or retweeted a post with ""lie"" 158 times, ""lying"" 103 times, ""liar"" 53 times. ""Obama"" + ""lie"" 17 times, ""Obama"" + ""lying"" 9 times, ""Obama"" + ""liar"" 4 times. Despite this he was counted by the Washington Post to have lied or tell a falsehood 30,573 times. 2. MEXICO ISN'T BRINGING THEIR BEST. Trump said Mexico isn't bringing their best, and notably mentioning the rapists and murders coming through the Southern border. While Trump not currently has 19 separate sexual assault/misconduct allegations of his own. Doesn't sound like he is one of America's best. 3. SMALL (TINY) CROWDS. Trump has lied constantly about his crowd sizes since 2015, he has also called the crowds of many politicians ""small"" or even ""tiny"". Well a lot of his crowds are smaller than Obama's were, the man he hated the most, so if Obama had tiny crowds.... does that mean Trump's were minuscule? 4. RIGGED [ELECTION]. Trump (on his now banned Twitter account) mentioned or retweeted a post with ""rigged"" 218 times! Funny enough, he was later impeached for abuse of power relating to the 2016 and 2020 election which was also the Ukraine scandal. 5. LOSER. Trump (on his now banned Twitter account) mentioned or retweeted a post with ""loser"" 158 times and ""losing"" 146 times. He in fact: was elected while losing the popular vote (one of 5), lost the popular vote both times as the party candidate (one of 3?), only served one term (one of 11), was impeached (one of 3) twice (one of 1), Trump is also the only person to have been elected without winning the popular vote, get impeached, then lose reelection. That's a lot of losing. 6. Bonus. GOLF. Trump proclaimed many times that Obama was not a good President, in part for his tendency to golf instead of being in the White House and working. Well I looked at the numbers, Obama golfed 333 times in 8 years of office, which was once per 8.8 days. Trump golfed 298 times... in 4 years, which is once every 4.9 days. Those are the first six things about Trump that he called someone else or he attributed to them while it actually applies to him, that came to mind.  I got all this information from The Trump Twitter Archive, Washington Post, Trump Golf Count, Golf News Network, and tweets from reputable reporters I can link them all later but I don't have the time right now. I'll reply with the 5 policies later since you did ask me that personally.",4년 전,0,

@magniwalterbutnotwaltermag1479," Sigkim  let me just ask a simple question, you ask for links and sources yet have provided none (that is clear) to be peer reviewed yourself and have instead of providing for example: an actual list of Trump's better policies decide to challenge the opponent to name better ones made by Biden, in which you are in the wrong, the point is not to provide a so called better answer but compare both views and you failed on that front aswell.  And may i point out that recently Biden has gotten millions of shots to american citizens in 59 days, while Trump had refused to acknowledge reports back in late 2019 from Taiwan and only managed a lockdown after more then 120+ countries already did which still did not include family relatives allowing fuether cases to enter, and that is without mentioning all of the stimulus cheques that have been passed and helped US citizens far more than Trump's $1200 cheque.  This is not just policy, this is competence, if you are a businessman who repeatedly got bankrupt and easily spent away your inheritance then you are not the master of the art of deals, you are a moron, and Trump has repeatedly attacked trade laws that have actually managed to make trade far harder in certain states and prosuce less jobs per month than even Obama who was in an economic recession which he inherited due to the past administration.  Your party has lost and decided to raid the capitol building resulting in 4 deaths, we lost 4 years ago and decided to rant on the internet, there is a difference there and one of thwm is that our candidate conceded her lost and yours promoted violence and supported harassment on the road against political vehicles.",4년 전,0,
@magniwalterbutnotwaltermag1479," Sigkim  what happened? I'l explain, i went to sleep jackass   Also firstoff you repeatedly asked mavon and others where they got their news and you refuse to answer woth yours, ypu can't have a cake and eat it too, of you want my sources give me yours and a credible one whoch means research centres not just news outlets like Fox.   All of ypur points are literally from CNN who refuse to make credible sources on where they got it, for example the iran deal which is actually one soded against iran who wanted nukes to defendnitself from other cpuntries that have missiles like idk israel.  You also point out xenophobia, idk about you but biden never called it xenophobic and onky the loud minority called the policy xenophobia and if he IS a STRONG PRESIDENT then he sjould not care what people think and do what is right, he did not, he closed half a month after all major countries already banned transportation.  Regulations bieng lifted is not an achievement, that means he literally removed ways to monitor businesses like the meat industry which has had multiple cases of deaths and not recorded or having private investigators who do not answer to the say even the local government or any health organisation, there is also the fact that contrary to popular belief he has made record low jobs compared to Obama which he only produced somewhere between 100,000-300,000 per month pre-lockdown while Obama was doing close to 400,000-500,000 jobs a month in an economic crisis according to multiple financing agents including the at the time right leaning Forbes or even papers from New York and Washington and these regulation reforms habe madsive consequences like the financing industry having a nightmare over tariffs as WE PAY THE TARIFFS not the other way around.   He promised a 6% growth i  economics and nly hit 4.2 in his last year while pulling only 2% according to multiple researches and most of those jobs are actually not confirmed to be because of coal or other plants not even building the wall, as the power olants are already mechanised according to Forbes only 13 jobs were made from the coal sector in a single state and thousands lost in electric workers and other energy sectors.  You also forget that the FDA and other organisations do their research i dependantly from the whitehpuse and can in a crisis function without the president wanting them to, you also forget that to this day american veterans have repeatedly geyting more taxes despite the reports and their veteran himes have been getting repeated budget cuts and just a month ago even nursing homes have had record low staffing with each having to care for 13-20 individuals with almost no pay and barely taking care of each as a rsult of budget cuts.  Small businesses have also suffered alot in certain states as big monoplolies like the ones in the early 1910's have begun reforming especially in oil thus making them fail and trump promoting them aswell as big weather analysts corps who leech out of the government and still profit aith barely any taxes which trump also supports.  The opiod epedemoc has been handled badly but not as bad as others report i grant him that, the consequence bieng human rigrhs violations on par eith the philippines and Venezuela in the 80's woth refusal to reform to the swiss model of containment which most 1st world countries have already adopted aside from right wing groups that call for force or the idiotic german green party, and by the way 6 bilion is a drop in the pond compared to the true price needed to solve the crisis as rntire systemic erforms about healthcare and access aswell as legalisation for study are needed, many things that trump while bieng neutral hhas a party stro gly opposing it and have actively made monitoring i gredients for research on drugs such as marijuana worse as special resourves are needed to get samples making the whole system choke up amd need more money just to even start the basic fundamentals.  He signed agaijst human trafficking, yet he allows ICE to detain literal children and making the border into a hub for kidnappers who take people and sell them off back as a hostage costing families thousands and american citisens too who have families involved such ar patrol or relief workers and exact numbers are thin as ICE itself keeps no record of the incidents but consodering the hostages who have been freed number in hundreds we can sepculate that a thousand or more have been killed as no payment was recieved and cartels enjoying the chaos by using them as cover, aswell as trump's party members suppoeting the idea of returning illegal aliens who seek refuge back to the country that wants them dead rather than a reform to the border system and betrer tracking of refugees who have to defend tlhemselves in court due to a lack of money, even the children need to fight these cases almost always losing.  The wall, it has been easily breached multiple times despite costing us billions and land themselves bieng trampled such as burials sites and of course nature fighting back such as winds and slight quackes causing it to bend and even fall TO THE MEXICAN BORDER COSTING MONEY TO GET BACK, and we can look to places like ireland as to why such a thing is dumb, remember the good friday agreement? Open borders between ireland and northern ireland resulting in the cease of terror attacks by the IRA and recent enforcement of borders have had a negative effect, with many voting to keep it open as they know the effect a hard border has on a country built on immigrants aswell as sharing of culture and lucrative trade between their regions.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Most politicians, even the worst of them, have at least a veneer of trying to serve the public. Not Trump. Those of you who voted for him got exactly the animal you saw all the time. You thought he would become more Presidential or rather you deluded yourself into thinking that. But Donald Trump is as he always was. But one good thing he has done is to show how fragile and in need of serious overhaul our system of government is. Our government has existed for more than two centuries on the honor system. Even Nixon resigned when it was clear that he had violated that honor given to him. Or at least clear that he didn’t stand a chance of not being convicted by the Senate. Honor and a sense of duty to the public has been the only thing holding out government together and along comes Trump to shatter that illusion.",5년 전,0,

As for the economy itself, very little actually changed once he entered office, Trump just likes to claim credit for the steady growth we'd been seeing since around 2011.  No he didn't.  The FBI was spying on someone else entirely, who happened to be in contact with the Trump administration.  Likely foreign nationals.  And no, he didn't make Flynn do anything.

Obama May have done well with the recovery itself but it took pretty much his whole 2 terms.  Lowest unemployment in 50 years.

I assume you're referring to unaccompanied minors and the temporary shelters the Obama administration had to set up in a hurry since they had literally no where else to put them?  That's a far cry from the cruelties enacted by the Trump administration.  Because it's yet another example of Trump prioritizing himself and his rich friends over the wellbeing of Americans as a whole, and at the cost of an even higher deficit, something Conservatives constantly complained about during Obama's presidency.  Thank you for providing yet another example of the Republican party's hypocrisy.  Pretty sure that's a massive generalization, and even if it is true, it's probably because the countries in question have far fewer loopholes.  Spouting more lies isn't going to make you look any less idiotic.  As I previously pointed out, we were making significant gains by 2011 and had entertained steady growth from then up until Covid-19.  Yes, because of the steady growth we've been having since around 2011.  Your pathetic attempts to give Trump credit for it just further proves what I previously said about you.  That's a total lie, Trump has spent most of the pandemic trying to downplay it's effects, repeating conspiracy theory BS.  Ah, what an excellent example of the typical hypocritical doublethink peddled by conservatives.

@chiefcaptaincole9889,Stephen2462 Hypocrisy and downplaying the effects of the virus huh.  I’m pretty sure it was the democrats who called trump suspending travel from China xenophobic and racist.

All of a sudden the democrats were overwhelmed with coronavirus cases and were completely caught off guard so they look for someone to blame but themselves.   Also when  BLM protest breakout there is no concern from the left over the virus but when there’s a trump rally there’s all kinds of accusations.  It also seems like California is suffering due to their communist government not taking steps to stop the Marxist lives matter protests which clearly are the reason for spikes in cases.

Yes, yes, I'm sure one could find a number of examples of individuals on both sides of the political spectrum that demonstrated poor judgement, especially since you've already demonstrated your willingness to lie and mislead.  But last I checked, we were talking about Trump, and literally nothing you said had any bearing on the fact that the Trump administration has fucked up royally in regards to how they handled the pandemic.  The fact that all you have in defense of him is a whataboutism just further supports that.  That's because the people Trump rallies have repeatedly demonstrated their willingness are actively ignore and downplay the pandemic as a hoax or some other flavor of conspiracy theory, acting in accordance to the BS spewed by Trump.

They are all sewage, how they live there life is sewage, their morals are sewage. It is a mystery why anyone would do anything that resembles an opinion these immoral turds have is beyond logic. Let me give you something to think about, JoeBiden says he will make the wealthy pay the highest taxes, Hollywood is the wealthy and Hollywood said vote for Biden, does that sound logical to think they would want to pay higher taxes or do you think there could be another reason they want JoeBiden in power?

Also, what if they were okay with paying more taxes, because it benefits people who don’t have as much money as them.(also, that’s how taxes are supposed to work, in case you missed that).

I can send you tons of proof where Biden is being racist, if you would like but as far as I know and I am very sure of this, there is no proof, zero proof where Trump is racist, and if that is the case then the person calling Trump racist is the racist. And if you want to look at facts, Trump may be the only Orange person on the planet and if that is true then to insult Trump is to insult an entire race of people which would make you racist. LOL, hay, you are the one trying to argue with Orange Man logic, lol. The DemocratParty has been promising free healthcare for over 50 years, is it free yet, how many times do you need to have the (President, and the majority in the House/Senate) to give the people everything you promise, Obama had the majority in his 1st 2 years in office and gave us nothing that worked.  Taxes do not work the way you think and they never will.

@danopticon,"Ignorant, childish, and malignant buffoon Donald Trump being allowed entry into the Oval Office is primarily an indictment of the USA’s failure to provide free high-quality education to all its citizens universally.  The USA’s economy has progressed beyond agriculture, beyond mining, and beyond heavy industry, and there are now basically a handful of cities, 20 or 25, in about 1/3 of the states, in which a highly-educated citizenry, working in finance, media, or information technology, produces about 80% of the country’s GDP — with the remaining cities and states benefiting from the federal government’s largesse in redistributing that GDP.  And that would be fine, and there are thankfully many areas of the country where folks in agriculture, or in the petrochemical industry’s labor force, or in other necessary but now legacy sectors, receive a fantastic education and the benefit of many cultural institutions as well…  …but in vast stretches of the poorer, redder states, there’s this stupid idea that the labor sector needn’t receive an education, so the resources those states are gifted from the well-educated and wealthier states get utterly misallocated.  Rather than invest in human capital — in education and social services — the poorer states often perpetuate a cycle of poverty and ignorance, treating the cultural and intellectual deprivation of its citizens as some sort of asset, deliberately cultivating a population which, along with believing the Earth is flat, is susceptible to the propaganda of the families Koch, Coors, Murdoch, Adelson, Bradley, Olin, Scaife, et al.  And alas, owing to the fact that influence over the federal government is not evenly distributed across the country’s population, but is instead arbitrarily weighted to favor some geographic areas over others, stretches of land with predominantly uneducated populations now have an outsized — and growing! — influence over the very federal government they’ve not been intellectually equipped to understand.  And here’s the really bad news for the USA: as long as the situation nationwide remains on a clearly downward slope, the USA’s most capable people — the one’s concentrated in the USA’s most productive cities, but excluded from their rightful proportional influence over the federal government — are going to begin leaving in droves. Most of the capable people I know have, at the very least, researched visas… and most are actively preparing for the very possible eventuality of having to flee a collapsing USA!!  So you guys really need to get your affairs in order and aright your ship and start sailing in the right direction again. You need to either educate your entire population equally, or you need to return to the principle of one-person-one-vote by eliminating the Electoral College, ending gerrymandering, providing for more proportional representation in the US Senate, and ensuring everyone can vote easily. And ideally you would do ALL of the above.  Otherwise, the USA is only about a decade of further missteps away from suffering the greatest brain-drain in history since most of China’s intelligentsia fled its mainland.",5년 전,0,

@TravisBlack,"So I'm a little bit torn on this. First off, let me preface by saying that I am not a Trump supporter, and at 27 years old, have still stayed away from even voting. I learned not to from the late George Carlin (R.I.P).  Okay so let's get into this. Trump is a good businessman, there's no way around that, if there's anything he can be accommodated for, it's that fact. Yeah he's had business ventures that have failed, but he's always managed to rise above it. That's fair. So obviously as a president, he treats the role in the same way that any investor would. He doesn't care about me and you, he cares about himself and his family. And while that's fair, as long as you're simply an investor, the line is drawn when you start to fuck with people's lives. Now, I believe at the beginning of his presidency (most of) the hate was unwarranted. He made a bunch of claims about building a wall and all that, but when he was just getting started you can't expect massive things like that to happen over night. There's obviously things to be tended to and taken care of in order to make something like that happen. No problem with that. But after 4 years, he hasn't made word on almost any of his promises. Not to say that he hasn't done a few good and truly helpful things, but there might be things that are confidential from the CIA or whatever, like what JFK (R.I.P.) told us about, that only he gets to hear and isn't allowed to say. Again, if that's understandable, assuming it's the case. That said he has the worst track record of a presidency since Nixon. THAT SAID a whole lot of this bit was either false, over-exaggerated, or cut/edited to not let the audience get context. I understand it's a comedy show, but when you have this big of an audience it's unfair to not provide context. Almost half of what Oliver used was edited to specifically make a person look bad.

@siberallla," @MeMe-po1ze  you’re name says it all. You’re the only one you care about. If it doesn’t affect you, it doesn’t exist. So don’t bother wasting your time replying because I won’t waste another second even reading your ignorant comments. Go back to go back to your uneducated white middle America bubble world. But here’s a little some thing to think about. Without us liberals you hate so much your world would be a whole lot different, and not in a good way.  A Day in the Life of Sue Republican  Sue gets up at 6 a.m. and fills her coffeepot with water to prepare her morning coffee. The water is clean and good because some tree-hugging liberal fought for minimum water-quality standards. With her first swallow of coffee, she takes her daily medication. Her medications are safe to take because some stupid commie liberal fought to insure their safety and that they work as advertised. All but $10 of her medications are paid for by her employer's medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance - now Sue gets it too. She prepares her morning breakfast, bacon and eggs. Sue's bacon is safe to eat because some girly-man liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry. In the shower, Sue reaches for her shampoo. Her bottle is properly labeled with each ingredient and its amount in the total contents because some crybaby liberal fought for her right to know what she was putting on her body and how much it contained. Sue dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air she breathes is clean because some environmentalist wacko liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. She walks to the subway station for her government-subsidized ride to work. It saves her considerable money in parking and transportation fees because some fancy-pants liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor. Sue begins her work day. She has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some lazy liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Sue's employer pays these standards because Sue's employer doesn't want his employees to call the union. If Sue is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed, she'll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some stupid liberal didn't think she should lose her home because of her temporary misfortune. Its noon and Sue needs to make a bank deposit so she can pay some bills. Sue's deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some godless liberal wanted to protect Sue's money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the Great Depression. Sue has to pay her Fannie Mae-underwritten mortgage and her below-market federal student loan because some elitist liberal decided that Sue and the government would be better off if she was educated and earned more money over her lifetime. Sue is home from work. She plans to visit her father this evening at his farm home in the country. She gets in her car for the drive. Her car is among the safest in the world because some America-hating liberal fought for car safety standards. She arrives at her childhood home. Her generation was the third to live in the house financed by Farmers' Home Administration because bankers didn't want to make rural loans. The house didn't have electricity until some big-government liberal stuck his nose where it didn't belong and demanded rural electrification. She is happy to see her father, who is now retired. Her father lives on Social Security and a union pension because some wine-drinking, cheese-eating liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Sue wouldn't have to. Sue gets back in her car for the ride home, and turns on a radio talk show. The radio host keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. He doesn't mention that Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Sue enjoys throughout her day. Sue agrees: ""We don't need those big-government liberals ruining our lives! After all, I'm self-made and believe everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have.""",5년 전,0,

Breitbart is on the level of InfoWars in terms of conspiracy bullshit. Even then, Joe Biden is ahead of Donald Trump. Also, the media never called Florida for Joe Biden. They used polls before the election, but the polls were definitely incorrect, and did not account for the ‘red wave’ that came in Florida, Ohio and Texas. And also, regarding your point that the democrats are trying to steal the election, can you give me a SINGLE source that links to primary information that shows mass voting fraud (5000+ votes)? At all? I highly doubt you can/will do that, because nothing that Trump says has any evidence behind it. Also, when you analyse the differences between what Trump and the GOP says, and what trump’s lawsuits accuse Democrats of doing, since the lawsuits have to be somewhat based in fact, the lawsuits argue that anywhere between 50-3000 votes have to be thrown out because of some court decision or just some accidents, some of which have already been corrected. “LMAO!!!!!1!!1!1” You cannot be unbiased between information and misinformation.",4년 전,1,

@jessicas3211,"Sigkim  Trump claimed Coronavirus would be gone in April or “just disappear “with legit no information to back that up other than “they say” (spoiler- it didn’t) Trump said Coronavirus numbers were going down in May when they were either still increasing or just hitting their plateau in every state. None had decreased. Trump: “If someone wants a test right now they’ll be able to be tested” -  was not true when he said it in March, Trump said if we didn’t focus on the economy- there would be more deaths by suicide then deaths by the Coronavirus. Almost laughable if this wasn’t about human lives.  Trump claimed we were GREAT on testing- better than South Korea. Also at one point “more than all countries together” .Actually we were lagging. South Korea had 5X the amount of tests as us.  Trump called the Coronavirus a hoax and said it was no more than the flu at the beginning. He minimized it so it wouldn’t affect the economy. Trump claimed nobody could have saw this coming when he was briefed on it in January. Trump lied outfront and said hydroxychloriquine was approved by the FDA when it was nowhere near it. There still is no evidence it works. He encouraged people to take an unapproved drug and spread a ton of misinformation about it. Extremely irresponsible. Trump said he thinks the states were asking for equipment they “dont need” and that instead they should be appreciative for what they have. Literally what the actual fuck. Claimed hospitals were also asking for an inflated number of masks and ventilators. In the middle of a pandemic. He was making assumptions that people dont need the supplies they asked for- THAT is dangerous.  Trump brought the use of UV light and injecting bleach into the conversation as treatment. Literally made medical experts go WTF  Most of these are just words and not even his actions. The travel ban did not make as much as an impact as his lack of leadership, and proper response here. 40 thousand people still traveled from china to the United States in February btw and cargo didn’t stop either. Plus- it was already here. He did a poor job of stopping the spread WITHIN our country.   Hope you enjoyed my rebuttal and go fuck yourself.",5년 전,30,

Anyone can see you’re just trying to bait people into arguments with rhetoric but no actual stable argument. It’s obvious.

You make me wish I prayed to something sir. Have a fantastic life loser.,5년 전,4,
@jessicas3211,Fella Einstein I mean I personally think its not fair to claim all of our current situation is his fault but also saying that people are blaming it all on his is a slight mischaracterization because it is fair to criticize his reaction to things and how he helps the current situation. It is the belief of myself and many others that he is doing a poor job in our current situation. Doesn’t mean everyone is saying it is all his  fault- but he hasn’t done an effective job of combating these issues in the opinion of many people. So I disagree- the problem is people like you who overgeneralize so either everything has to be Trumps fault or nothing is when in reality its not his fault but people are allowed to criticize his actions. Maybe when you become an adult you will learn not everything is black and white.,5년 전,0,

@OriganalPie," Sigkim  You've been at this for 4 months. You should probably be studying for your algebra 1 test instead of spamming toxic bullshit. No one is on your side here. Besides, that bonus round you keep going on about is flawed fundamentally. What about BLM makes you think that the goal is ""mending the rift between citizen [sic] and law enforcement""? The goal is to protest police brutality, not warm people up to it. So that's where you are ""in error.""  Unfortunately, I know that you don't actually give a shit. You aren't the first Drumpf troll I've seen and you sure as hell won't be the last. Even after he loses in a few days, I fully expect all the celebration videos to be spammed with endless bile like what you've poisoned this lighthearted thread about time-traveling with. I also know that you'll now spend the next few hours obsessively quoting me, making ""corrections"" in a desperate attempt to feel intelligent when you have no real way of doing so.  If you aren't just trolling and actually believe what you're saying, then I think you may actually be in luck. I'm in a research group at the university I teach at and one of my fellow researchers wants to become an expert in ""brain hacking"" or the process of brainwashing people using both the same things that hackers use to break into computers and cult tactics and he recommended this book by an expert on cult brainwashing techniques discussing the similarities between conventional cult tactics and the things Trump does. You can find it here: https://www.amazon.com/Cult-Trump-Leading-Explains-President/dp/1982127333  I understand that $20 may be a bit more than the allowance your parents give you and that the topic may be a bit advanced for someone in middle school, but I think that, if you put your mind to it, you could probably convince them that you're actually trying to learn something for once and get them to buy it for you.  If you are trolling, then I would tell you to suck my dick, but I'd rather not get involved with a minor such as yourself sexually (or otherwise, to be frank).",5년 전,2,

A summary analysis is here: https://www.factcheck.org/2019/04/what-the-mueller-report-says-about-obstruction/ And a legal analysis is here: https://www.lawfareblog.com/obstruction-justice-mueller-report-heat-map Extortion: This is the one that finally got the Impeachment ball rolling.  💩's phone call with Ukraine might be loosely interpreted as 💩 using a ""go to"" phrase by a defense attorney...what clinches it as an actual crime, however, is that he put a freeze on congressionally approved military aid to the Ukraine. THAT is what confirms the commission of a crime.

Actually, politicians usually make a great deal of effort to avoid lying outright, as it can easily come back and bite them in the butt.  Instead they rely on non-absolutes and complicated language to avoid committing to anything, much like elves in certain high fantasy settings.  Trump on the other hand, just spews easily debunked bs on a regular basis.  Your inability to care just shows how low your standards are.  Yes, the Republican party has turned into a cult of personality, approving of him regardless of how terrible he's doing or how blatantly corrupt he acts.  Just about everyone else thinks he's been a horrible president.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@BrokeredHeart," @sherwinpeters7397  What do they have to be happy about? Ever increasing income inequality, increased national debt, the erosion of American foreign policy, lost respect and trust among former Western allies, failed trade wars, lost jobs, and a pandemic that was made infinitely worse due to budget cuts and an absentee executive branch? These past four years have been a devolving cycle of lies, corruption, and failed governance. These were people that voted for small government, to ""drain the swamp,"" and to reassert American power and market dominance around the world, and he has failed to deliver on all of those accounts. And that is such a reductive argument, that all politicians lie. It's true in the basest understanding of that sentiment, but no two lies are weighted exactly the same. And however many times Obama or Clinton or either of the Bushes or Reagan were deliberately untruthful, their falsehoods and half-truths amount to only a fraction of the intentional and impulsive lies Trump publicly states or tweets hourly. They can be small and insignificant, like the size of his inauguration crowd attendance, or massive and damaging to American security, like claiming he was justified in killing Iranian Gen. Soleimani over the fabricated threat to 4 American embassies, or repeatedly claiming that Russia did not meddle in the election to help him get elected.  It appears that you specifically do not see an issue with Trump lying about such matters, but I know millions of people who are astounded by his tenuous hold on reality, and appalled by his bullish conduct in office. And he has the gall to accuse his predecessor of illegally spying on his campaign, when he's spent years defending his own presidency from oversight and investigation by challenging that the President has the right to ignore lawful subpoenas and Congressional requests for documents, essentially claiming that as President, he is above the law. So keep cheering on the demise of your own republic, Sherwin. You've got yourself an Emperor in the making.",5년 전,0,

The fact that most of them are asylum seekers who don't meet U.S. standards is completely irrelevant, because nobody deserves those sorts of conditions. And as for the veracity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's claims, forgive me if I'm more inclined to trust a U.S. representative than some dude on the internet (who, by the way, hasn't offered much evidence themself for someone who constantly complains about others not offering it).   And Yes, I realize he was probably told at one point that the hurricane had a chance of hitting Alabama, and it was an understandable mistake to make, but when someone is repeatedly corrected on a mistake and refuses to admit it, instead doubling down to the point of committing a federal offense, then they are lying.

@spongeintheshoe," Sigkim  https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/16/qa-trump-administrations-zero-tolerance-immigration-policy#q1 Trump's ""Zero Tolerance"" policy stated that we would prosecute all cases of illegal immigration, instead of just ones where they had serious criminal records or had re-entered the country repeatedly after being deported. (Most are harmless once they get here, and if they aren't, immigration authorities can always deport them.) By doing so, we massively increased the resources being spent for very little gain. They said that the family separation was a natural result, but they've been going out of their way to prosecute immigrants with families.  https://www.businessinsider.com/photo-hybrid-toilet-drinking-fountain-cbp-centers-2019-7  She didn't say that she ""had 0 clue"" about it, just that it was the first time she'd lived in a house with one. And a toilet is significantly easier to recognize than a garbage disposal. And yes, there were drinking fountains (toilet-drinking-fountain hybrids, which I'm going to assume are sanitary as long as proper hygiene standards are followed, even if it sounds disgusting) in the cells. The problem is that the dirnking-fountain part wasn't functioning. They were told to drink out of the bowl in response to complaints that water wouldn't come out of the faucet. https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1563353-donald-trumps-hurricane-dorian-map-sharpie-edit Yeah, it's illegal. And nobody was getting on his case for being wrong in the tweet. If he'd just acknowledged it and moved on, nobody would've cared. But instead, he insisted that he had been right, to the point of drawing on a National Weather Service map with a sharpie and trying to pass it off as official.

@DerickTheHeroV2," @ChandlerSomborac  The American population is grossly uneducated about how their government actually works, and I'm basically certain this gatekeeping of information is intentional. They need people to vote and participate, but not enough to really understand what they are voting on. In my American government education I was basically taught how to pick a party, but not about how their policies would affect me. I was taught how many seats in the House of Representatives there are but not how the house actually functions.   Democracies really only work if you have a population that cares and is engaged. Most Americans aren't, hell, most people in general aren't engaged with their government. We have so many people screaming about corruption and the inefficiencies of our government, but their disengagement empowers the corrupt politicians.   This may seem unrelated or taboo, but I'm truly starting to think that Democracy may just be a failed system after a certain point. I think these inherent flaws make them unstable. I love the ideals of allowing everyone an equal vote, but a large part of the Constitution and the Framers' ideology was that some offices and jobs need to be decided by those already in power. For a large part of U.S. History, Senators were not elected. The highest office in the Judicial system was not democratically elected, and the Supreme Court also supports this idea of some offices basically being an oligarchy. The United States became more democratic over time, and I'm starting to think that is correlated with the troubles we have today. Partisanship is off the charts and the government is in a stalemate more often than not.   Undemocratic societies and governments tend to suck for a lot of people, but at least they do things. DACA was the last big thing that Obama was able to get done in his last four years in office, and it went around Congress. Our representatives vote more along party lines than policy these days. This is unsustainable, and if the feds don't learn to play ball they are going to be replaced someday by someone who captures the attention of the public.   Jesus, that was a tangent, but I think there were some good points in there so I'm going to keep it. Have a good night.",5년 전,14,

@DerickTheHeroV2," @SmellsLikeNirvanna  It's not my job to throw shit at President Trump, it's my job to educate the future generations about the history of this country. That involves both good and bad. That means the good and bad of Washington, Johnson, Kennedy, Clinton, and yes, even Trump.   Partisanship got worse in the 1980s during the Raegan administration, and yes, the Democrats did start that fight when they rejected Raegan's Supreme Court nomination strictly because of his overtly Conservative values. However, at this point the slug fest has gotten out of hand and it's the fault of both parties. It's going to be my job to try to get as much true history and education to my students as possible so maybe they won't just vote along party lines like so many of us do, or worse, not even bother to vote.   I think the Trump impeachment has some strong similarities to the Clinton impeachment for the record. The stupid stuff we go through today is probably not going to be interpreted exactly as we believe in the future. Trump may be a laughingstock for future historians, he has certainly prompted that just recently by talking about injecting disinfectants, or maybe he will be seen as the Conservative populist that changed the platform of the entire Republican party around himself... or both. Probably a mixture of the two.   Trump and his presidency are very interesting and, I believe, the beginning of a distinctly populist era where memes change how politics is done.

@DerickTheHeroV2," @SmellsLikeNirvanna  Honestly, I think the USA is heading toward collapse right now. What you're asking is a huge point of argument in the history field, that being if objective truth can be found through the inherently subjective medium of keeping history. I don't know the answer, and I think it would depend wildly from different eras of history. I think in the far future, 100+ years, we would be able to find some kind of lesson in all of this that isn't horribly partisan, but in the short term I sincerely doubt it. Objectivity and subjectivity, or partisanship and non-partisanship is a core hurdle of the history field. The general agreement is that pure objectivity is impossible, but many believe they themselves can find the objective truth. Call me a fool, but I am one of these people. I try to surround myself with people who fundamentally disagree with me, and I believe that is a great step forward to avoiding echo chambers.   Even if the greater field of historians cannot leave their subjective and partisan sides behind, I want to present my students with as many sides of a conflict as I can... despite the wishes of the state standards I must teach. In particular, I would love to teach government and teach my students to think outside of party lines and think of politics conceptually rather than along party lines.",5년 전,6,

@DerickTheHeroV2," @rockleefanlj  To be honest man I don't take it very seriously. I literally told thequestion626 to spend his time jerking off rather than arguing. It's basically impossible to talk about current events without getting into talking points. Obama had similar shit thrown at him, Bush at him, Clinton had the Lewinsky scandal to terrorize him, and some people unironically thought that Bush Sr. and Raegan would plunge us into nuclear war. None of this is new, not really.   It gets easier to talk about once it is over. Someday soon, hell maybe even January 2021, (though I doubt it), the Trump presidency will be over. Once the dust settles it's much easier to have a genuine informed conversation about it. Basically, hindsight is 20/20, but the stuff that happens day to day is news to everyone. Things change, and this period we live in will inevitably end and we can talk about what it really meant beyond talking points. I think that the Trump era will open up a new kind of American political era, one where being a political outsider is considered better than career politicians.  I don't think that will end with Trump, and we are seeing that used by conservatives a lot in smaller races. I think even the Democrats are embracing it to a lesser extent.   You asked me a serious question, so here's a pretty serious answer. A lot of people just can't be convinced. Modern politics is deeply entrenched in the values of an individual, and now more than any other time in history are people abandoning traditional structures and frameworks. With all of the bad shit that comes with religions and other value systems, they do tend to keep large groups of people more or less thinking in similar ways. With these traditional systems not only dead but rotting, a majority of people have instead decided to base their lives and beliefs on political issues and parties. This isn't an American thing, it's a trend that came from Postmodernism.  There's a really solid Ted Talk about the way people find themselves politically and how its rooted in their values, you could probably find it by searching ""Politics and Values Ted Talk"" here on YouTube. It can help you get started, if you so choose to try to change people's minds. If that or anything else I've said interests you, consider reading about Postmodernism's effects on politics, ""The personal is political,"" things like that. A lot of this stuff is new to society, and a lot of it is as old as society itself. Personally, I care less about directly trying to change people's minds and instead want to introduce them to conflicting ideas to, hopefully, make them question why exactly they believe what they believe. That's the heart of the Socratic dialogue, not telling or teaching others what to believe, but instead asking them questions so they dig deeper in themselves. They may come out completely the same, but at the very least they may better understand themselves if they really think about the conflicting ideas and their response to them. There is always someone who disagrees with you.   I don't take YouTube comment drama too seriously, but apparently I'm doing something right because I've had people for months now attacking me for being both a Trump supporter and Trump hater... So there's that.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@DerickTheHeroV2," @rockleefanlj  Also, you should really look into Post-Truth and its effects on our world, especially since you brought up facts as your way of argument. Some beliefs aren't founded in facts, Logos, they're rooted in passion, Lathos, or worse yet, trust, Ethos. It's hard to counter a belief with facts when the belief has nothing to do with facts. Try to find out what their belief is rooted in and cater your argument accordingly and you will do well.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@DerickTheHeroV2," @markhenley3097  If you're looking for a pretty partisan impeachment from U.S. history you should read about the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. They had more obvious and citable offenses, but considering the Civil War had only just recently passed it was also hugely political. The dude only held onto office by one vote... genuinely fascinating stuff. Also, Clinton's impeachment was largely partisan as he was more or less just got impeached for lying to the American people about having relations with Ms. Lewinsky. Hell, even Nixon's would-be impeachment would have been incredibly partisan seeing as he got himself in trouble for partisan political ""crook-ery,"" if you will.   I can see that you are a truth seeker too, someone critical of others and their intentions. That's good. There's this really solid database of leaked presidential and other political documents online on Goatse . Ru  That's Goatse DOT Ru, all one word and a period ""."" in place of ""DOT"".

Or the mountain of other evidence brought forward during the impeachment.  He does, but nobody would have taken it seriously if he had, due to it being obvious partisan BS.  That's why instead tried to abuse the power of his office into strong-arming another country into doing it for him.  And there are regular channels Trump could have requested such an investigation.  He instead tried to do so under the table (and illegally) so it wouldn't be traced back to him.  Jeez, you're really desperate to convince people that I'm a bot.  It's pretty hilarious tbh.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@Anvilman,"@J.A. Bristol Good thing it wasn't hearsay and speculation then.  Meanwhile, not even a single witness was willing/able to testify in Trump's defense, not even Trump himself.  What a joke.  Cherry picking bits and actively ignoring the rest of it isn't even an argument worthy addressing, sorry.  Of course he did, he still has plenty of incentive to not anger Trump and no reason to get involved in ,American politics.  Trump put a hold on Congressionally approved funds under circumstances that don't allow it.  His attempts to obstruct the investigation are also illegal.  Sorry, but your whining doesn't change that.   Of course he said that; Trump could easily throw a wrench in the aid we send them (as this whole debacle demonstrates), and he has no benefit from getting involved in American politics.  Considering that said probe is being conducted by a couple of Republican senators, I don't see how that says anything about the Ukrainian President's involvement.  Or about Biden being corrupt, since it's obviously politically motivated.

And this would indeed BE the funniest cosmic joke since someone saw a good business opportunity in writing a book that would convince legions of readers to hand over time and money for no tangible benefit but capable of inciting wars for centuries - BUT- since no aliens have come forward to claim the joke as their own, America and the world are stuck with a racist, misogynistic illiterate, 11 year old posing as one of us.

Do your history as to your assumptions of corruption,as long as there is power and money in the game then corruption goes hand in hand,needless to say you only provided opinions and no fact as of yet,which leads me to your next question? In what manner is President Trump incompetent,as the fact do not lie,job growth is at a all time high,there is no event in America that is effectively directly effect Americans,so? Again ask what is so terrible about president Trump,his lack of character has nothing to do with what the American people voted him into office for,up to now he is for most part keeping his promises that he mentioned prior to being elected,I firmly believe when he is re-elected in 2020 he will build the wall and so? President Trump kept his promise after all.",5년 전,0,
@Anvilman," @octizhm  It’s not my personal feelings, it’s a fact; Trump is an asshole.  Most of us aren’t President, and at least make an effort to try to be decent people.  Trump is simply an asshole.  An ad honeim deflection like that changes nothing.  Also, Trump isn’t just corrupt; he’s BLATANTLY corrupt; he doesn’t even try to hide it.  Or perhaps he's simply too incompetent to hide it?  The Republican party as a whole seems to be making a concentrated attempt to normalize corruption (Moscow Mitch just bragged about it on Fox News) and their voters don’t seem to give a damn.  He has on numerous occasions demonstrated that he has no fucking idea how to rule the country, and typically just makes decisions based on whatever the last thing one of his advisors tells him to do.  This has resulted in a great deal of inefficient “flip-flopping”; sending bombers to bow up Iran then calling it off at the last minute.  Pulling troops from Syria just to send them back about a month later.  Going on rants about China and North Korea, then turning around to kiss their ass as soon as they give him a little publicity.  Trump has little to nothing to do with the current state of the economy, which is a result of trends that have been ongoing for about a decade now.  The fact that it’s the only thing you can come up with that you believe he’s doing well in just shows how terribly he’s doing in every other metric.  “his lack of character has nothing to do with what the American people voted him into office for”  On the contrary, I get the impression that his lack of character is precisely why a lot of Conservatives voted for him.  To put it simply, they (including you) simply don't care what happens to the country as long as they ""own teh libs.""  “for most part keeping his promises”  What promises?  Draining the swamp?  He’s pretty much done the opposite.  Locking up Hilary?  Putting aside the fact he made acting like a tyrant part of his platform, he hasn’t even tried.  Building the wall?  Putting aside the sheer stupidity of his vanity project, All he’s managed to do is replace some fencing, and had to subvert congress to even do that.  So you’re an idiot who wants to throw billions of dollars at a vanity project.  Sounds like a personal problem.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

Another thing is to listen to a diverse group of Trump supporters, voters, and various observers. I'm not a fan of Trump but that doesn't mean MSM should get away with lying and profiting from it.

@jimreily7538,"Trump ruined his brand, worldwide. He never expected to win, and only ran to promote his brand - that's according to Bob Woodward, Steve Bannon, and Michael Wolff, Jarrod Kushner, Omarosa, Gary Simms, and innumerable other Trump advisors.  He's ruined himself. All he truly had was his name, and he sold that name as a brand to luxury hotels and restaurants.  Those places don't cater to Trump voters whose demographic characteristics are: working class, with no college education.  Before 2016, if he'd lost, he could have bailed with bigger brand recognition.  Now, it's lose lose for Trump. His name is smeared in shit worldwide, and apart from his 35 percent hardcore cult base, even Republican support is tenuous - they support him because he's all they've got. But primary challengers like Joe Walsh are emerging.   He's being investigated or sued by everyone from Congress to local court houses (absolutely true).  He's in massive debt.  So, Trump might be able to slap his name on some filthy juke joint or chicken place in Oklahoma, but the five grand they'll be hard pressed to offer, he'll be very keen to take.  That's the real art of the deal right there.  Trump's finished whether he wins or loses. Nobody outside the political sphere (nobody who matters, that is) wants anything more to do with him.  Even 4chan shitposters will quickly lose interest, in one year or four.  Maybe they'll take pity on him. Maybe that's his way out: promoting a Help Trump campaign on 4chan.

It breaks my heart that my family fought and died to build, protect, and guide this nation only for someone like him to be given the reigns.

It may not be fair to lay the shootings, and the violence, and the white supremacists rallies at his feet alone. But he is responsible at least partway by his racism, his bigotry, his incitement of violence and his slander of people who are not white skinned.

@tommygunrunner4656," John O  1.) His presidency is still going and he just won a supreme court battle allowing him to move forward on the wall last week. Mexico will end up paying for it once he implements a tariff on all the money that Mexicans send back to Mexico which is in the billions. Even leftist media talks about Trump keeping his promises. Stay tuned. The Wall isbeing built as we speak.  2.) He didnt say ""all mexicans were rapist and criminals"". This makes you the liar. How about putting up his quote verbatum lol. This is called a reach, and you look bad doing it.  3.) He was ""hyper critical"" of 4 congress members who are ""hyper critical"" of this country. All he said is if you dont like it, you can leave. Quit crying like a baby. Oh, and Ilan Omar married her brother in order to get citizenship... shes as disgraceful as the rest of you anti-Americans, and yes, the evidence clearly points to it being her brother.   4.) The vast majority of non-partisans don't give two fucks about Trumps taxes. I would still bet Trump releases them eventually just to shut you hyenas up.  5.) The Mueller investigation lasted 2 years and found nothing. Donald Trump didnt obstruct anything, and even if he did, as a hypothetical, it would be obstruction of a coup. Mueller just testified and reiterated that Trump did not collude with a foreign country. I know it's hard for the hate in your heart to subside, but you have been bamboozled by the neo marxists.  Trump is the first President to ever step foot in North Korea, being the best potential for peace on the peninsula. You delude yourself pretty well huh.  Is it exahausting being told the world is going to end for 3 straight years, only for orange man to continue to Make America Great Again?

@Lowkeylie,"Tommy Gunrunner Ok, any other point aside, how exactly does a tariff against Mexican goods pay for the wall?  Tariffs aren’t taxes paid by the country importing them. They’re taxes on goods imported from a country, paid by the ones doing the importing (i.e., corporations in America), usually used as a means to try to make goods made within a country more appealing than those imported by artificially inflating the price.   That means the brunt of the cost is bore by the importing company and, more often than not, passed onto the consumer. That is by no means equivalent to Mexico paying for the border wall.",6년 전,3,

They are completely ignorant and will stay like that bc they dont care about facts when it comes to Trump. They live in thier own reality and they don't care about the truth they never will. You can put the facts in front of them and they will call it fake news. Even if it comes from a factual Institution if it doesn't align with what Trump says it must be fake to them they live in ignorance and they're never going to change.

@CaseyFinSF," @DrunkenSkittlez  I hear what your saying, but you really need to look at those Republican Presidents from a neutral view. And I am an Independent... so let's review. Nixon is best known for the Watergate scandal that forced him to leave office for being on tape authorizing the break in at the Watergate hotel in the Bay Area where the DNC had their files etc.  Couldnt get out of that one. But back it up... Nixon also was the first president to go to China and open trade with that  nation.  At the time it was all good ... now we realize that corporations took advantage of the minimal labor costs there, taught them the manufacturing processes, and moved all of our manufacturing jobs to China.  Not China's fault, it was the Corporations looking for more money for shareholders.  But Nixon made trade deals and opened up the China/American trade agreement....  Nixon also took us off the Gold Standard for our currency (signed off on it really) and put us into the FIAT CURRENCY or as we know it now - Reserve Status  currency called the Petro Dollar. All oil transactions across the world would be settled in U.S. DOLLARS which gave a small usury fee to the US and brought us income for decades. Ford replaced Nixon and was voted out. Carter replaced Ford and was voted out because of the hostage situation in Iran. Reagan came in and I have another posting in comments that covers that whole administration.  It was a nice looking package on the outside, and Reagan used his next door neighbor charm to cover some ugly dealings under his watch. But give credit to Reagan for getting the Berlin Wall knocked down, and for getting the Russians to the arms treaties table and we were friends with them now. Read my other post for more on Reagan's henchmen and Administration.  BUSH #1 was a carry over from Reagan, but kept pushing the New World Order garbage and raised taxes after he shouted our loud ""NO NEW TAXES!!!""  But he saw how fucked up the economy was from Reagan raising the debt ceiling 18 times in 8 years. Bush raised taxes to offset Reagans spending habit and got voted out. Clinton... the one President whose actions caused real damage to the economy about 7-8 years later under Bush who was just leaving office as it began. Clinton deregulated the Banks and took away the restriction for them not to use depositors money in risky adventures. The 90s were Wall Streets Golden years, and the Market Boomed under Clinton who gave Bush #2 basically a balanced budget with money left over ... a surplus.. first time in over 50 or more years that had been done. Deregulation of the banks caused them to make greedy moves and bundle up bad debt in the housing market and turn them into security assets that people were told had AAA ratings on the derivatives market.  The bubble burst when people started defaulting on millions of mortgages written during the boom under Clinton. But when the rates were raised a little past the percentage on floating mortgages people couldnt pay, and it snowballed out of control in late 2007 -2008.  Bush came in with a surplus budget, then he agreed to do what Cheney, Rumsfeld (head military guy), and Israel's Netanyahu had planned that changed the world we lived in. 9/11 was executed like a Hollywood movie, with key players in the media being told it was Osama bin Laden who did this, but it wasn't.  It was a False Flag to end all False Flags that accomplished many many different agendas for a lot of different people and organizations. It blamed the "",muslims "" , with Netanyahu leading the way pointing fingers. It was used to invade Iraq , but years later was revealed they had nothing to do with 9/11. Oops! We're sorry... we will help fight the terrorists in your country then. We invaded Afghanistan looking for Osama, and fighting the Taliban.  This also boosted the military budget into the Trillions that actually they were already ""missing the transactions for Two Point Three TRILLION DOLLARS of military spending. ""  Reported to Congress by Rumsfeld on 9/10 - the day before 9/11. Trillion,  not Billion. 9/11  happened, everyone forgot about that until years later and it magically was all a bookkeeping error for Trillions of tax payer dollars. Bush and his administration lied to congress, were complicit  in the murders of 3,000 people, if not directly responsible, and left office handing Obama a check for the debt Bush ran up after 9/11. Obama let Bush off the hook by not starting a new investigation into 9/11.  This makes him just as much a Traitor to America as Bush is.  They all smile together and act like their friends now.... they all made millions and billions from the wars. Trump lied his way into office calling Goldman Sachs crooks and part of the Swamp who paid Hillary half a million dollars to speak at a luncheon..., and after he was elected the first 5 out of 6 of Trumps cabinet appointees came from.... ?.... you guessed it- Goldman Sachs.   Trump lied and turned his back on the American people. He turned the economy over to Goldman Sachs and tax cuts for the rich like never before were the result.  He's raised the military budget,  raided organizations already counted to receive federal money for programs to put up a wall he PROMISED wouldnt cost taxpayers a dime. And he's making tons of money off the secret service by charging for their rooms at his hotels when he travels  - and he has outspent Obama's budget for playing golf Costs in 8 years, Trump surpassed Obama's golf budget in the first 2.5 years! There's your rundown on Presidents,  and why the Republicans deserve a bad rap a little more than Democrats.  They are both the same really,  but the Dems at least try to cover social programs whereas Republicans think they're a waste because they want to spend more to make more off of the United States taxpayers.  I lived thru all of the above.... and we are worse now than ever before with a False Economy propped up by the Fed with a HUGE BUBBLE WAITING TO BURST.  War is the only other option to continue this lie we are living under. Watch Venezuela and Iran...  Another FALSE FLAG IS ALREADY PAST DUE....BUT ITS COMING....",5년 전,1,
@DrunkenSkittlez, @CaseyFinSF  Ok so with that being said do you think we can ever recover from this or is it just a matter of time before something really bad happens? If so what do think you think will happen?,5년 전,0,
@CaseyFinSF," @DrunkenSkittlez  Wow, you're putting a lot of pressure on me, and we just met bro....😩🤣 Okay, settle down and let me ponder this for a sec... hmmm😤 Let's see... it really depends on a couple of things that are already in play. You do know about ""The Dumbing Down of America"" , right? We see the results here every day... it was a success. That's how Trump got elected.      Here's my ""go to"" answer for that question... In the long term I think eventually Truth will conquer the false history we are being fed and lied to about. It will be ""someday"", but not in my lifetime, and probably not yours either.  But I have to believe that Science and Truth will win out over evil and the head in the sand types who never want to progress. I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT or I might as well be one of those crazy shooters who don't give a fuck because they can't handle change.... I CHOOSE to believe in a JUST and Good hearted mankind that will overcome the evil bastards that are running things now. At the end if mankind's reign here it will be the spreading of Love that lifts man into the next whatever....  I know, I know that sounds all hippy Dippy and drippy, but I think we are GOOD people more than stupid self centered ones overall. And OVERALL will win out over the Fuck Off crowd in the future. And anyone who disagrees with me can Fuck Off .... 🤭🤣🤣  But back to our time here... man, it really depends on a couple things that will be very hard to turn around, but it is possible to do in one or two generations. One, people need to concentrate on getting good people elected at the Local Level in their communities.  Getting people especially on School Boards that will bring back a separation of church and state, and not let religion be a part of curriculum.   This alone will make a HUGE difference in the future. Religion has kept mankind from reaching its potential for far too long. Bring TRUTH in History back to the classroom. And make it more about raising kids potential rather than memorizing a bunch of stuff you'll never use.  Secondly, make education a PRIORITY again in this country. And stop all this University for Profit bullshit that Reagan put the U.C. system on... it gives only rich people the option for more education, and that's why we have such a big gap from the haves and the haven't got shit crowds under the current system. It's got to stop, so make it equal access and open more Universities for the country... we need more to handle the increase in population.  And last, will we have something bad happen, and what will it be?  The writing is already on the wall (not that one...well...move ahead..) for this, and it's not good.  The economy is nowhere near as flowery as Trump lies to is and says it is. Wall Street is on a bubble that everyone is ignoring,  and when it pops, it will make the Big Depression seem like the Good Ole Days... Seriously,  the Fed pumped anotherv168 Billion Dollars into the market to prop it up last October into November.   It was Quantitative Easing,  but they didn't call it that. QE is only done when things are bad as a last resort.  We are still in a recession, and have never come out of since 2008-09.  Prices are constantly going up at breakneck speed... but wages are stagnant, jobs are not the kind you can retire on, and there are more homeless than ever before.   The time is getting VERY RIPE FOR ANOTHER FALSE FLAG EVENT LIKE 9/11. Why? Because the GDP can be pumped up by the Arms Manufacturers  that will be making more arms crap for a false war. The GDP goes up, the economy looks better even when it's not, and the False Flag covers up the worst bubble in the marketplace that we are sitting on right now. Pensions will be list, corporations will move more assets overseas,  and there will be a big RESET as they - The Power Elite introduce the Dollarless economy and make EVERYTHING DIGITAL so they can control the masses.  They dont like what you do, they'll cut your access off to money and starve you out. This is already in place in China in some Super Cities they've built. We will go cashless as 'a good thing', but it really won't be.  How we can get out of being turned into slaves for the Corporate Machine and AI?   I really don't know.. but the answer is out there, and not too far away.. at least I hope it aint.  Keep spreading the truth about 9/11. That's really important.  And keep an eye on Iran and Venezuela as possible False Flag events.  We all need to be aware of the bullshit and lies that come at us every day ... but we will change things for the better...  I'm just not sure of the timeline for that,  that's all.  Hope this answered your inquiry sufficiently. ..  Good Luck... hang in there,  and Fuck them if they can't take a joke...

The worst president was George W Bush for being complicit with Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Netanyahu's Mossad agents acting as Art Students who planned and planted all the devices used in the False Flag  of 9/11. Since Bush allowed 3,000 America citizens to be murdered on 9/11 that changed the world into an ugly place , he has to be considered the worst for selling out his country and pushing the Empire building agenda that Cheney and Rumsfeld along with Netanya ,- for these reasons alone BUSH Has to be considered the Worst (and most tresonous) of all time.

@elhombredeoro955," @CaseyFinSF  well it was just hyperbole. Obama was just an average President. The objectively worst President ever was President Buchanan. He sat idle with his hands crossed and bragged about possibly being the last President of these United States when the country was falling apart all around him. He did nothing, he didn't want to do anything about the southern states seceding one after another. He famously told Lincoln “If you are as happy in entering the White House as I shall feel on returning to Wheatland (his estate near Lancaster, Pennsylvania), you are a happy man indeed.""",5년 전,0,
@CaseyFinSF," @elhombredeoro955  I didn't know that about Buchanan,  but then again my knowledge base is grounded in the decades I have existed on our blue marble here.  I'll take your word for President B's demeanor as the Chief Executive. You're characterization of Obama is correct, and maybe even a little generous.  I can tell you from my standpoint of living thru 11 different Presidents that the one thing  that Obama shined better at than anybody since Kennedy was the man knows how to sound presidential, and above all sound intelligent doing so.  Until Obama came along we have been subject to some pretty sub par excuses for the presidents that didn't sound very smart.  George W takes the award for sounding like an idiot hands down... with Trump coming in a close second.  It's the False Flag of 9/11 with some sloppy execution and the murders of 3,000 citizens that for me puts Bush at the top for Worst of All Time. Plus he always made me cringe listening to his dumbass , sounding even more stupid than he looks  which I thought would be impossible.  But no, Goerge W made that an easy call whenever he opened his mouth..",5년 전,0,
@elhombredeoro955," @CaseyFinSF  well you are correct that President Bush Jr is not the brightest bulb in the room. He was the worst President since Carter. He left us in endless Middle Eastern war and financial ruins, but he was not morally bankrupt.   President Buchanan left United States in much worse position. He was so bad that even the Democrats didn't nominate him for a second term. The civil war is still the costliest war fought by USA in terms of lives lost. He was not dumb or inexperienced like President Bush. He had served in the position of ambassador to UK and Russia and Secretary of State under President Jackson, President Polk, President Tyler, President Pierce. He had served in so many elected positions in Pennsylvania and United States Congress. But as President he never tried to stop the Democrats from seceding. He could have nipped the confederacy in it's bud, but he put party over nation.",5년 전,0,
@CaseyFinSF," @elhombredeoro955  I would have to disagree. Bush Jr., whether he was pushed into it, or just went along with it, or covered it up to save his own ass, was definitely morally corrupt for colluding to murder 3,000 citizens on 9/11, and for passing the draconian Patriot Act which has nothing to do with patriotism and everything to do with corrupting power of the presidency over the people using alphabet organizations against it's own citizens.",5년 전,0,
@elhombredeoro955," @CaseyFinSF  well if you consider doing the wrong thing is worse than doing nothing at a time of national crisis then perhaps Bush is worst President. But in my opinion thinking that Dred Scott will resolve the issue of slavery for posterity and doing nothing about it is perhaps the worse. He even pressured the two Republican judges to vote in favor of slavery to make it unanimous as he thought it will give more credibility to the ruling.   President Buchanan supported Lecompton constitution which would have allowed Kansas to become a slave State.  When the abolitionist John Brown raided the federal arsenal in West Virginia he was quickly tried and hanged for treason, but when his buddies, the Democrats were plundering the federal arsenals in southern states, he did absolutely nothing. When Buchanan left the White House Fort Sumter was the only thing that was left with the Union in the whole of South.   When the Southern states started seceding, he said ""I have no constitutional power to stop them.""   President Buchanan was not an idiot. He had one of the longest resume. Longer than Dick Nixon and Hillary Clinton. He was a successful lawyer. The infamous Chief Justice Tawny was his buddy from college. He was considered by his peers as a pleasant man. He was famous for the parties he gave. He was well known in the country. Infact he was sent to Europe by President Jackson and Pierce because they felt threatened from him. He was elected because people thought he can solve the slavery issue. If you ask me he turned out to be a mighty disappointment. He had solutions, but his solutions were the wrong solutions. That's why I think as bad as Bush was, he was no where near as bad as Buchanan.",5년 전,0,

@overlydramaticpanda," @mackielunkey2205  The thing is, that particular office Trump's spent the last 3 years blundering about in just so happens to be one of the most important offices in the entire world. It's very difficult at the best of times to just ""fucking get over it"" when the leader of the country you currently call home is someone you can't stand on any level - it's even harder when he also happens to be one of the most important and influential people on the planet who literally hasn't been able to get a single thing right in 4 years and insists on bashing people over the head with his own incompetence virtually every chance he gets. If Trump wants to be treated like an adult and not be mocked at every turn, then the onus has always been on him to act like an adult and a President. Instead, he acts like those ""edgy"" people on social media who post things like ""god my life is soooo awful but don't anyone dare ask me to clarify anything!!!!!111!!!1"" and then gets annoyed when people (rightfully) call him out on his childish behaviour. If he ever acted in any way that even resembled a sensible human being, he wouldn't be nearly as popular a target as he has been. As it is, there's no one to blame for the amount of times he's been mocked but himself.",6년 전,5,
@mackielunkey2205,"Overly Dramatic Panda oh ok. I understand. Trump being a president is really important. But in a way, I think America kind of deserves it. Trump’s presidency to me is an opportunity to observe what we stand for, and which people we actually want on power.

We need to vote for people that do, so we show the government we stand by our principles. (I’m actually Canadian, BTW.) I’m really sorry for what I said earlier.",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@overlydramaticpanda," Sigkim  Oh wow, I'm so sorry. I forgot for a moment how easily you guys are triggered by people saying anything remotely negative (or true) about your Glorious Leader. Please forgive me for that. Also, didn't you hear? He's no longer calling them ""fake news"". Now it's "" corrupt news"" - you really ought to stay on the ball with regards to Trump's nicknames, otherwise you'll just get left behind.   Okay, so you asked for at least 5 examples of him blundering about over the course of three years (which no doubt you will disregard anyway despite easy proof since you've managed to convince yourself Trump is the best thing since sliced bread, but no matter). So here are just 5. Believe me, there's plenty more where they came from. 1. Discussing state secrets and confidential intelligence with foreign nationals and failing to hide it. 2. Escalating tensions with North Korea by resorting to playground level taunts a 5 year old would be ashamed of and then failing to gain any realistic or permanent promise that the country would even so much as slow its nuclear programme (and North Korea has been repeatedly proven to be continuing its nuclear programme, only now they apparently don't have to worry about America stepping in to help out anyone they might target - such as America's actual allies). 3. Repeatedly ignoring protocol for meetings on foreign soil - including, but not limited to, shoving another world leader out of the way just to be in the front row (which endeared him to exactly no one), and walking ahead of the Queen during an inspection of the royal guard - overwhelmingly referring to other countries (including America's allies) in a highly derogatory fashion, and instead cosying up to authoritarian dictators, most of whom are guilty of several human rights abuses including (but not limited to) state assassinations, illegal internment of dissidents, advocating torture, interference with foreign affairs of state, and total control over the press to spread state propaganda. 4. Refusing to unequivocally condemn the actions and beliefs of actual Neo-Nazis (you know, that group spawned from the people Americans like to brag about beating singlehandedly in WW2) even after someone was murdered by one and countless others were caught on camera advocating literal genocide (you know, that thing Hitler was trying to do that Americans like to brag they stopped him doing in WW2). 5. Spending over 75% of his time in his office of President of the United States of America generally doing literally anything else apart from the duties that said office is meant to consist of - including (but not limited to) taking golfing vacations to his various resorts, tweeting, picking pointless and often absurd fights with various celebrities (he's the most important person in the country, at that point he really shouldn't give a damn what late night comedians or actors or whoever says about him - Reagan went through an actual attempted assassination and he was still able to joke about it afterwards), and giving phone-in interviews with Fox News.   And like I said, there's plenty more to choose from. Like how he endorsed various sexual offenders and proven paedophiles for office with his only excuse seeming to consist of ""hey, at least they're not Democrats"", lying countless times about things that range from being pointless to be lying about at best or downright dangerous to be lying about at worst, putting children in cages with no plans to reunite them with their families (but hey, they're only migrants*, right? Not *real children at all, huh?), generally presiding over one of the most (if not the most) objectively shambolic administrations on record and turning himself and America into such an international laughing stock that a congregation of world leaders actually outright laughed at him (and yes, it was definitely at him and not with him as he tried to spin it), bragged about committing sexual assault...although that happened before he took office, so...maybe we should give him some slack on that one, right..? And that's not even getting into the naturally more subjective area of things like healthcare and gun control.   As for what he has accomplished...I'm going to say this and you're going to ignore it. Trump is far less responsible for the (slow) economic improvement of the US than he or his supporters like to imagine. You know who is overwhelmingly responsible for said growth? The guy who led your country through the outcome of the crash back in 2008 (which was caused by people whose business ethos tend to be remarkably similar to Trump's, by the way). Trump has essentially been riding the wave that Obama started, and his pettiness is such that I'd be willing to bet that if he ever realised that, he'd crash the economy all over again purely out of spite. Strengthening the border? Apart from the claims of him and his supporters, there is little actual provable evidence that either drugs or migration flow has suffered any kind of substantial dip, even with all his frankly ridiculous (and sometimes bordering on illegal) extra measures. Job creation? Sure, but mostly in what are realistically unsustainable industries which have been made even more unsustainable by his insistence on pulling out of various deals with other countries and threatening tariffs on various imports and exports while simultaneously systematically cutting funding and various programmes those workers are likely to rely on, purely because the sad truth is that if your net worth isn't $1M+ at the very least, he doesn't give a single damn about what happens to you (demonstrated by all the proposed tax cuts for only the very richest citizens, among other things).    I am sorry you believe him so completely, even when there's demonstrably a very very high probability that he is in fact a pathological liar, and I know it's hard to give up on someone you have such faith in. But in all sincerity and despite my earlier sarcasm, I really hope you and all the others who still support him do give up on him. Because he genuinely does not, never has done and never will care about any of you. At all. If he was ever presented with a choice between anyone else (even his most loyal supporter) or just himself, he'd choose himself every single time and probably not lose a second's thought over it. We've all seen where the logical conclusion of having a leader like him leads and the US has historically been proud to fight against it almost every single time. That really ought to tell you more than any news station or person ever could.",6년 전,4,
@overlydramaticpanda," Ayylmao  I've got some bad news for you, dude. I don't watch CNN, I have no clue what TYT stands for, and the late night hosts just so happen to share the opinion I'd already formed on my own. The fact that Trump supporters assume everyone is told what their opinions should be by TV ""overlords"" and they blindly obey says far more about the state of mind of Trump's followers than anything else. I know Trump is bad because of things like common sense, recorded evidence, and a basic understanding of human decency.   That meme you're repeating makes it far easier to mock you and all Trump supporters since it's essentially the same as admitting you have no real ground to stand on so you resort to the equivalent of a five year old sticking their fingers in their ears and going ""BLAH BLAH BLAH I DON'T WANNA LISTEN TO YOU"".

Yeah he may be doing something resembling diplomacy with North Korea, but America’s allies are generally just laughing at him and dealing with the rise in similar candidates in their own countries (As an Aussie, Pauline Hanson is the example I look at).

@SmackWaterMack001," @hejoric    whats wrong with Trump ? Have you ever heard of: Trump Steaks ? GoTrump .com ? Trump Airlines ? Trump Vodka ? Trump Mortgage ? Trump, the Game ? Trump Magazine ? Trump University ? Trump Ice ? Trumps New Jersey Generals ? Tour de Trump ? Trump On the Ocean ? The Trump Network ? Trumped! Talk Radio ? Trump News Media ?  probably not. these are just some of the FAILED BUSINESSES that Trump is responsible for.  Theres plenty more too....  Trump Entertainment Resorts and its predecessors have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection four times, in 1991, following construction of the $1-billion Trump Taj Mahal, in 2004, 2009 and 2014.  Yeah, a casino, where people come from all across the country, and the world, to practically give their money away to his casino, and he bankrupted it too...  He's an idiot. A USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found that Trump has been involved in  MORE THAN 3,500 LAWSUITS  over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.  At least 60 LAWSUITS, along with HUNDREDS of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.  Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.  In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens — filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work — since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time.  Trump is a well known, and despised New York businessman and conman, far from the great businessman or moral human being that you believe him to be.  Im wondering if youre aware that he stole from his own Childrens Charity Organization, funneling the money into his campaign for the Presidency ?  Do you know about Trump University ? Google it, and see how great of a man you think he is after that...  How about the fact, that your failed businessman is reported to have lost more money in real estate and other businesses in the 90s than any other human being on the planet ? He lost hundreds of millions of dollars.  youre also aware that Trumps dad, who loaned him his first 4.5 million dollars, was a liar and a conman as well, right ?  Like father, Like Son....  Trump is a piece of shit, always has been, always will be....  How would you feel about him, if the crippled reporter that he mocked, on national television, was your Brother ?  You do know that, after he was elected President, that he went on a ""Thank You Tour"" to all the states that voted for him, holding rallies, where he actually told his rabid supporters that he ""lied to them on some things to get their vote, but its ok, coz I (he) got elected""....   ...and do you know what those thousands and thousands of ignorant dumbfucks, all across the country, rally after rally,  did when he told them that ?   They yelled and cheered for him !!!  that is the braindead, bonehead dumbfuck mentality of those uneducated simpletons that turn out in their ridiculous maga hats to support him.  Im 57yrs old, Ive grown up seeing Trump on tv, in the news, etc, and its always been obvious that he's an arrogant, self centered asshole who thinks everything is all about him.

It seems like it’s the cash cows that run this shit and we are just a long for the ride. Hillary won the primaries because the DNC used and discarded Bernie- the ONLY candidate who was at the very least consistent. And what does it say about us that we hold politicians to a much lower moral standard than we would for ourselves and our friends?

They're all the same in the end, their effect on the vast majority of individuals is marginal at best/worst. And they get written in the back of dictionaries from inauguration onward. We move on, one more gone, another to take their place. Trump doesn't deserve to be hated for what he's done, because frankly nothing he has done will effect enough people to make difference in the end. Is your life any different since he took office? Was your life any different 18 months after Obama took office? Live and let live, he might be dumb but he's not worth unhealthily stressing over. If you want to really get back at him, just ignore him. His name will stay in the history books much longer than Hillary Clinton or even many actual presidents, that's just a fact. In large part because of the enormous emotional response his haters. Hitler isn't remembered because he was an arrogant Austrian who became powerful through manipulation and charisma. Nor will Trump be remembered because he's kind of an asshole ego freak with a gold plated plane that became president by inflaming the bi-partisan system. No, we will remember him because he is hated. To quote the old cliché ""you die twice, once when your heart stops beating, once when the last living person utters your name"" by that measure, Trump will outlive us all, and he has his haters alone to thank for that.",7년 전,0,

@akaimizu1,"Isaac Roebuck no. He will be remembered due to things that happened in his name as well as lasting effects we have from what he’s done. Our relationships with our allies stressed, but most of all the people. The hate groups and bigots that really felt empowered by him. The actual deaths by such people in the sweep of the soul of our country that was affected. Some are going to live with this for the rest of their lives. Completely outside of the politics you mentioned, there are a number of regressive things our citizens went through, based on that decision. Whether Clinton would or wouldn’t be much better herself, going another way would have had a major different affect on the crapshow of our people against “the other” people we have gone through. You see the effects everyday, especially on the Internet, and often enough in person. So yeah, the new lease on Life of us attacking each other and some glorifying bullying and being a butt to each other, WAS an effect specifically emboldened by this. He won’t be remembered because he was hated. Not at all. I don’t even hate the man. He is remembered for the hatred he emboldened and supported because he wanted the votes of hate groups.  So who felt the effects? Ask a number of minorities? Ask a Muslim? Ask an Indian person who is mistaken for a Muslim by people who don’t know better who are willing to attack Muslims? Ask a woman? Ask the LGBT ? All of these where identity politics was put into identity policy. Executive orders meant to affect their rights. Including, in one case, the right to serve in the military.

@blackdogslivesmatter1568,"As many Republican leaders abandon Donald Trump — and some donors ask for their money back — one deep-pocketed supporter has remained generous and steadfast: the National Rifle Association. The NRA is spending more than it ever has on elections this year — more than $36 million at last count, with another four weeks until Election Day, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.  And Trump is by far the largest beneficiary, with the NRA spending more than $21 million to help him: $9.6 million on ads and other pro-Trump materials, and another $12 million attacking Hillary  Clinton, whom the organization sees as a threat to nominate a Supreme Court justice seen as unsympathetic to gun rights.   Several million more have gone toward Senate races, part of an effort by the NRA to prevent, in the case of a Clinton victory, Congress from approving such a nominee, which its says could lead to a reversal of a landmark 2008 Supreme Court decision that upheld an individual's right to bear arms.",7년 전,0,

@raphidae,"+UnYin99 Perhaps you've been reading reports from years ago? Because that's just demonstrably false. The unemployment is down, it hit an 18 year low in may 2018 (3.8%) and is currently (august 2018) only 0.1% higher (3.9%), the economy is growing, wages are going up, consumer confidence is up. The US economy has been better in 2018 than those of Europe and Asia (and is projected to be better for at least the next few years). And obviously the US economy is not worse now than when the mortgage crisis hit (2007), that's less than 25 years ago.  See the Financial Times summaries: https://ig.ft.com/sites/numbers/economies/us/ Literally everything looks awesome.  As for violent crime, after a 2-year rise in 2015 and 2016, violent crime has been going down in 2017 and 2018 and that trend continues until last month:  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/12/17453632/violent-crime-murder-2017-brennan-center https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-12/pssst-crime-may-be-near-an-all-time-low  And this is just New York, but other cities report similar drops: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/pr0904/overall-crime-down-august-2018#/0  ""New York City this month (august 2018) experienced fewer major crimes than August 2017, continuing to make this year one of the safest on record.  Key highlights from this month's crime statistics:  Year-to-date, overall index crimes are down -1.2% Robberies, assaults, and burglaries continue to be down year-to-date There were 76 shooting incidents this month compared with 83 in August 2017, resulting in a -8.4% decrease and a -3.6% decrease in shootings year-to-date""  So your claims only make sense if you live in the UK, where they are true.

Fact is that he didn't impede the economy in any case.   Then someone else made the claim that the US economy was at a 25 year low, to which I responded with numbers that show that claim to be false. I made no attribution to Trump other than to say that most likely the economy would not be this great under Hillary as she would have impeded economic growth (among other reasons, she promised to create a no-fly zone over Syria, an action that the military had clearly stated would require going to war with Russia).",7년 전,0,

Mass immigration does two things at first: Raise the unemployment rate (due to the number of people arriving, not due to them taking any jobs), raise the crime rate (Especially from the domestic citizen bigot side). However, as the immigrants are integrated and employed, there comes positive development: General job creation (especially the Social Work sector), low end wage job creation en masse and typically the wages of citizens, especially those who went through the native education system, go up.

He was a bufoon then and he hasn't progressed emotianally since. It's not the 'compromised media' that has influenced me at all. It was Donald Trump who influenced my opinion of him. Please don't diagnose my concerns with your ignorance. He was an idiot 35 years ago and he is an idiot today. He is not an example of the American dream (unless the dream included getting millions from dad). He is not making America great again (unless you think nationalism and isolationism is making this country great). He is not helping the average citizen when the tax breaks were for the wealthy and the corporations (who used the money to buy back their stock which may one day help workers if they have a pension or 401K, but does nothing for them now). He has used the military as a political tool (even Mattis, the only real sane person in the cabinet, couldn't take it and quit).  Now talk to me about the compromised media. Are you talking about the one that Trump uses as his advisory committee? Why doesn't he just hire them. Oh right, he is.  I'm sure you were proud when he separated families, approved of Nazism, disparaged the handicapped and the military (I could be wrong but with a name like Sarge I assume you were in the military. If so, how did you feel when accepting a Purple Heart medal from a veteran, Mr Trump said that he always wanted one. This coming from Mr Bone Spur Deferment. The Donald certainly doesn't understand how one is awarded a Purple Heart medal). And I am just giving examples that you may care about. These issues I have mentioned only show the tip of the iceberg of his faults, so don't give me me this crap about compromised media bullshit. I don't watch, let alone own a tv.

@SuperTrumby,"Can we stop citing Politifact as though it were a completely objective and legitimate source? I'm not saying it's completely awful and carries no weight, but it's very easy to see where it has been biased in the past, so using it as a basis to call a conservative candidate a liar, or prove a liberal candidate is honest, isn't as solid as John Oliver seems to think it is.  When For America, a conservative news outlet, said that average American family earns $4,250 a month, while Obama spent around $18,972 a month per illegal immigrant child, Politifact rated it as ""Mostly False"", admitting that the numbers were completely valid, but taking issue with the comparison existing in the first place.   Donald Trump made the claim that our real unemployment rate was ""anywhere from 18 to 20 percent"", which Politifact labelled false, arguing that ""no credible number is that high"", but when Bernie Sanders said that ""African American youth unemployment is 51%, and Hispanic youth unemployment is 36%"", they said it was ""Mostly True"", despite (as they themselves even pointed out) the fact that the real figures for those groups were 31.8% and 20.8%, respectively, simply because they were still higher than the rate for white youth at 15.7%  Hillary Clinton claimed that, in the time between the 2015 Democratic debate in Nevada, and the one in Iowa, just one month's time, 3000 people were killed by guns. Her basis for saying this was the CDC's overall death tally for gun deaths in 2013, divided by 12, which even then averaged out to 2,803 deaths, not 3000. And this was for 2013, there was no data for the amount of gun deaths for the month she was talking about. And yet despite the fact that she made an unproven statement, something which is certainly not a fact, it was labeled as ""Half True""  When the difference between whether or not your inaccurate figure or unverified claim is listed as outright lie or ""Half True"" is your party affiliation, you are without question a biased source, and should be treated with skepticism, not as gospel.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@Thelonuh," Sigkim  Lindsey Graham, a drumpf supporter himself, once said that failing to comply with congressional oversight, or ordering others to do so, is an impeachable offense.  He even said the president doesn't have to have committed a crime to be impeached; all impeachment needs is for congress to believe the president's conduct is unacceptable.  If drumpf supporters maintained consistency with their beliefs, instead of hypocritically favoring their party over everyone else, then even you'd have to say drumpf should be impeached.  And you'd have to concede that even if drumpf is truly innocent of any criminality, congress can still decide to impeach him if they find his conduct unacceptable.  But you won't be consistent.  Because then you couldn't get what you want.  You wanna ""own the libtards"".  You don't care about facts or logic or reason or law or ethics.  You don't even really care about this nation or it's well-being.  You just wanna see the democrats cry.  You're as unpatriotic as can be, and you're a bully, a troll, a fascist and an idiot for continuing to support drumpf.

@Thelonuh," Sigkim  1.) it doesn't matter what Lindsey Graham was referencing, a drumpf supporter told congress that what drumpf has done is an impeachable offense.  It just happens to have been told before drumpf was president.  2.) all impeachment needs is for congress to believe the president's conduct is unacceptable.  I'm glad this isn't correct.  Score one for checks and balances.  But you may want to inform some of your own republican leaders, though.  I was only telling you what Lindsey Graham said.

It's only perceived to be disrespectful to the flag by people who disagree with the statement. It's unanimously intended to bring attention to the real issue they're protesting.

He is the perfect president for the last stand of white supremacy and the war mongering Empire and its terminal neo liberal economic system. His policies demonstrate an interest for the elite to raid all that is left in the coffers at the expense of poor Americans. He follows the authoritarian playbook of scapegoating minorities as the reason for the current state of mass poverty in America. As much as we need a revolutionary change from the corporate owned 2 party system of neo liberal warmongers who find it acceptable to drop 144 bombs a day, lose 21trillion dollars, and spend 700billion on the socialist defense budget but at the same time call the idea of universal healthcare and free public and university education communist thinking. That said I rather have Trump than Mike Pence.

Fuck that.  The whole collusion is bullshit the. ""Liberal left"" msm had way more influence in the election with all the 24/7 free coverage of Trump in order for them to profit off of him.

In the meanwhile, we can vote for our national parliament, but they no longer have sovereign power as it has been ceded to the EU commission, whose members are appointed and NOT elected.   All the above are reasons why I am emigrating to the US as soon as possible. If only we had the US voting system here (flaws and all) we might still have had something to say.

This is an awful system and shouldn't exist in its current form in this day and age, but it unfortunately does, and hence Bernie got the shit end of the stick even though he was almost certainly the better candidate. You yourself seem to find no fault with the man apart from how he went along with the people who demanded he trust them in their terrible decision, rather than stand up for himself, as indeed I agree he should have done - if he even had that option. The same cannot be said for either of the candidates who were in the actual running; Hillary is popularly regarded a tool of major corporations, while Trump is... a tool.

Furthermore, as you could see in the video, of course, that is if you're not just a troll coming into random videos just to make incoherent comments, he isn't even a good businessman, he isn't as rich as he says he is and falls short of the 500 richest people in the world. There are many reasons people would want him impeached, probably one being that he keeps embarrassing America in the world, I mean, how horrible of a person would you have to be to be protested at foreign lands. Just face it, Donald Trump is the world's biggest punchline and the only reason I wouldn't wnt him impeached is because I just simply don't want Pence on the throne.",7년 전,0,

I'm frankly surprised anyone supports him even if you actually ARE an outright Nazi. I find it mind blowing that so many Americans don't even care or know that Trump is going around committing war crimes, ceaselessly breaking maritime and international law, rebelling against the UN and committing crimes against humanity and terrorism by definition. The American media will hardly touch the serious stuff Trump does because it's so appalling they don't know how to talk about it. How do you tell Americans that their president is making their soldiers terrorists?   I mean the guy even donated 300 million tax dollars to an actual genocide and government sponsored purge by the dictator of the Philippines. For fucks sake, the entire ""drug war"" is literally the anarchy of Rodrigo Duterte telling people murder is legal, go kill any possible drug user and we will award you with American cash...  literally legalizing and incentivizing murder...

A gym costs a lot of money and free time. Poor people also tend to have more children bc a career isn't their primary focus. As added bonus: if you are starving contrary to eating regular, consistant meals every day, your body goes from normal to starvation mode. If you eat again afterwards, your body will store all of the food in fat bc it is not sure when the next meal will come. Those fat cells do not disappear. They will remain intact and will be filled again when you eat. Not eating for a week or two is the worst possible diet bc you will gain all the weight back in a week afterwards.",8년 전,13,
@gwenwalravens8030,"V. V - I do not see people with less money as a victim. It is more like a problem and in general I like to analyse problems hollistically (kinda my job but in the IT/Pharma sector).   ""LOOK AT THE RATE OF UNWED MOTHERS COMPARED TO INCREASE IN SOCIAL SERVICES, THEY GO UP PARALLEL"" That is caused by today's social model. 30 years ago, we believed in marriage and giving a child a mother and a father. Instead of making it work, a lot of people just evade the conflict all together and just get a divorce. Today, divorces are common and not getting married is common as well.  I'm also for helping the poor but it has to end somewhere otherwise everyone will become poor instead. The same issues exist in Belgium. I pay 33% taxes. So for every 1000 euro earned, I give 330 euro to the country and that is just on my paycheck. There are taxes on everything as well like 6% on essentials like food, 21% on luxury goods like electricity (YES, electricity is luxurious here ;-) ), ... But when you get ill, you pay next to nothing to the doctors, hospitals etc. This I like because that means that at least everyone will be as healthy as possible if they commit to it. But on the other hand, a lot of people from other countries know this and get an operation for free here. While I wouldn't mind this if we were all superrich, we cannot support this kind of exploitation. We also pay people who can't work or do not find a job. However we are making the wagegap between a job and minimal wage bigger to entice people getting a job or keeping a low level job. We also increased monitoring by a lot.  I'm all for social services like that but they need to be balanced and controlled. We have tons of social services (the US has almost none compared to Belgium let alone France). But you have to throw out the people who are not invested or just profit from it w/o wanting to give anything back.  As a side note: I agree with your first post. Most politicians just shout empty promisses or are using issues that aren't there. I just disagreed with that one line I quoted.",8년 전(수정됨),1,

It's almost a waste of time to reply to you, someone who CLEARLY spends too much time on the internet being propagandised by the alt-right media. No one can argue with you because you immediately de-legitimize their point of view by denouncing their sources and calling for proof when the proof is in the pudding. You won't accept views from an opposite viewpoint, or facts presented by the left because you live in a vacuum. If you expect people to have a debate or argument with you, then you need to stop with the bullshit and listen. You CANNOT debate facts. You can debate where the facts came from, but then again, we come full circle, because you will then label such sources as 'fake news', and de-legitimize the whole thing.",7년 전,2,
@garywilson3042,"Well, for starters, Donald Trump was aware of and approved the meeting between Trump Jr and russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya  1. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45079377 - even though Trump has stated vehemently that no such meeting took place. He lied about it, and is now saying collusion is not a crime.   Michael Cohen has confirmed this too with his prior knowledge of meeting.  2. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/27/michael-cohen-says-trump-knew-about-russia-meeting-in-advance  His character has been called into question, when he bragged about grabbing women by the pussy, and his multiple racist and xenophobic comments. 3. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/15/opinion/leonhardt-trump-racist.html  Trump has sided with Putin over his own intelligence community, strengthening the collusion case.  4. https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-russia-putin-summit-722418  He calls the mass media 'fake news', undermining and delegitimizing its importance to free speech. 5. https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-fake-news-media-real-enemy-people/story?id=56687436  So in summary of just some of the reasons why trump should be impeached; he knew about the Russia meetings, and even approved of them, but when challenged about it in the past denied it, calling the media 'fake news' for reporting it, and a witch hunt. However, now that a possible trial could be coming, he backtracked and admitted that he knew about it, but that it was not a crime, contradicting his previous statements. Michael cohen has  corroborated this too. Trump has made racist and xenophobic remarks, and also bragged about sexually assaulting women on multiple occasions. He sided with Putin, a dictator and former KGB agent, over america's own intelligence community. He calls the media 'fake news' when it is critical of him or unfavourable, which sets a dangerous trend that is used in russian propaganda.  These are just some reasons why I think he should be impeached.         Heres the ""challenge"".     An actual case for ""impeach"", or evidence of Trump/ Russia Russia Russia ""collusion"".  Well I have given you sources, but it won't matter to you, because your logic is your own enemy.",7년 전,0,

@konnermorris1753,"Gary Wilson I may be late to the party. But this part of the youtube is the part that people cry in. Seriously. This section has been off and on active for almost an entire 12 months...and all yall have done is tear each other apart... Honestly. Thinking back. Hillary/Trump...regardless of who would have been elected. There would have been a political upheaval. Frankly Trump as a person is perfect. Kinda the give standard as all politicians are sleeze bags. If a person wants to change a part of society. You dont send your fucking soldier in to the fucking mess especting him to walk out clean. Makes me equally sad that a god awful troll has had such a profound effect on what can be countless numbers of people. The fact that a person can go and justify their actions as their own ""enjoyment"" and disregard the effects is disgusting. However. Heres something ""good"" Trump did, but honestly Im not here to defend a man who spawned multiple problems(Eh. Live in Vegas. Know the shit he pulled with several construction workers. So I have a heavy bias personally against him.) Trump DID unlike any politician before him. EVEN BERNIE ""Feeling the Burn"" Sanders. He ignited multiple generations to participate in politics. He made many people care about what actually happens inthis perfectly flaud but beautiful country. He also unwittingly(?) pushed many women who had previously given up on sharing their experiences to come out. Like it or not Trump restarted the Me Too movement quite spectacularly. Dont get me wrong. He also fucked our economy. He also fucked are legal system. He also fucked our foriegn affairs....which all need to be fixed. Choices were made and we need to move on. Stop fucking tearing into each other cause if anything this is the time we come together as allies. Not as god damn enemies.        TLDR; Trump Bad but Good. Lets not kill each other.",7년 전,0,

@konnermorris1753,"Gary Wilson Sure. I completely agree that Trump is a toxin to the very concept of Democracy. But to say that the world would be better should Hillary or even Bernie by some mystic political magic be elected...is short sighted. What Trump did even before he was elected was inspire the previously silent majority who had given up on politics for whatever reason. If Hillary or Bernie was elected. We wouldn't see the same picture we are seeing now. But the picture wouldn't be better. My claim and warrant is simply this. Trump is at the end of the day going to be toxic. People. Certain ones anyways. Are equally going to be toxic. It is the job of us. The people. To stop the above type of toxic conversations. Like I said. Late comment, but I feel the need to post this simply because I see way to many comment threads just like this. I know im a naive college student. I believe however that we shouldn't be tearing each other apart....because thats exactly what this anti-trump story wants. We need to stop hating. Start listening. Lick our wounds. Move on.

@konnermorris1753," Sigkim  well. Theres a couple flaws here. Firstly America is a Democratic Republic. In this we vote for reps who make decisions for us. Second. Not to seem like a Full John Oliver Viewer....but you did just use whataboutism. I talk about the President. And your response was ""And the media????"". I agree with you. I despise our government. I despise the idea of only caring about your seat(Reps and Senators) whenever your seat is up for election. And I despise how the news perpetuates problems that are offered by the WH. Proof of Donald Trumps Crimes? The only definitive proof I have right now of anything trump has done is breed toxicity and hate in his supporting base, the media, and his white house. Trumps Big Ego does little to decrease this toxicity. His...theory. Of economics. And for that matter Communication is an undeniable joke. Convincing people according to trump. Is simply ""LISTEN TO ME. I AM IMPORTANT."" However this does the intended opposite result. He is ignored. He becomes the brut of jokes. He walks on glass and ignores all of the noise. I cant give you a definitive....warrant that Trump did commit crimes. (That is not to say our present affairs may reveal some. Ill hit this chat back up should I find definitive evidence.) However, how he treats our appearance like an after thought. Instead, what comes first is Trump. Then his family. Then America. (hopefully.) When a president is elected. His family becomes everyone. Every citizen registered or not. He is their caregiver. He is their charge. He is the man or women(i guess) who will maintain the balance of our democratic democracy.  Moving on. Our President is not there to use his position to bring any person. No matter ethnicity. Sex. Gender. Belief. Ideology...But Trump does. He spreads toxicity. If someone disagrees with him. He insults that person or group of people...It makes me even more...sad...that you were one of the many who have given up on the institute that should be built off trust. In regards to ""Trump....Trumps"" is that sure. He ""called"" people out. Thats fine. Im okay with an honest president. But when a president makes generalizations for the middle east. For native americans. For african americans. For other countries....That is not okay. Insulting people. Is not justified. Cannot be justified. Its not ""locker room Talk."" Its bullying. Its chillish. Its unpresidential. Its not what our government is built on. However. In regards to your final claims...and your frankly aggressive actions with people above...is crass. A person is not a liar if they are unable to do something....however. You can read above the impossibility of the peoples claims above was definitive proof. For several reasons.....but eh.

@garywilson3042,"I can offer a case for impeachment, several actually; 1. Trump has used various 'charities' of his own to cover for his tax evasion and illegal funding during his presidential election campaign. 2. He has been involved in sexual harassment cases, where he even admits in the past to assaulting women, touching without consent, and their are even allegations of underage sex with his own beauty pageant contestants.  3. His ties to Russia have been documented by several close acquaintances, including his own lawyer Michael Cohen, and it seems now that proof is just around the corner that shows the russians, under the control of Putin, undermined the democratic process for people to vote. Putin has been well documented in his use of propaganda to get himself and Trump elected, and due to russian bots/hackers, the USA is fractured in half because nobody trusts the media. 4. . He cheated on his wife several times, and used campaign money to pay off at least two that we know off. 5. He is trying to delegitimize the media, banning reporters from asking him questions. He will cherry pick from Fox news to support his own agenda.   By calling everyone who criticizes him part of some 'fake news' conspiracy, he is effectively causing people to not trust in objective reality. There is no accountability for his actions, and his supporters are not seeing through the corruption that lies at the heart of his presidency. There are many more reasons to impeach trump, but I don't have time to write a 1000 page fact sheet, so do your own research if you care about democracy.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

In the meantime the economy suffered, our streets became crime ridden, and the nation became a divided people. Well now we hired someone who will get the job done. You may not like it but the job is getting done. He is a workaholic, works through the weekends, and is beginning to run the country like a business.

@Splax77,"""There were good people on many sides"" - Trump's response to a nazi ramming a car into a crowd of protesters. ""I'm not a Trump but supporter, but [insert pro-Trump talking point]"" - the favorite concern troll tactic of Trumpanzees He may not be a nazi himself, but he definitely sympathizes with them, because condemning nazis is the easiest thing you will ever have to do as a politician. It took him 48 hours to read a condemnation off a teleprompter, one that he walked back not even a day later.  With regards to the economy, the President has much less influence on the economy than most people give them credit for. They can pass legislation that affects the economy, but it takes a few years for the effects of that to really be felt. Right now we're still running on Obama's economy.  With regards to ISIS - Trump doesn't know a damn thing about ISIS. He probably couldn't even point to it on a map if he had to. The military is doing the same thing they were doing under Obama.",7년 전,1,

First off, this came from the forestry service and they've already pulled the picture and apologized. The 2017 picture was from much earlier in the morning. Compare the shadows in both pictures- it's obvious. Here's the Gigapixel picture from CNN. It clearly shows the crowd going all the way back to the Washington Monument.

That's insane.   -That he's ""self funded"" and not beholden to any donors - also a lie, as he did not self fund his campaign and took on many donations from, super PACS, big donors and special interests   -The ""he's such a good businessman"" argument  - another lie, he's actually bankrupted a number of businesses, received lots of help and bailouts from his rich father, and run many businesses into the ground. And when he did succeed (and even when he didn't), it was often at the expense of Americans, either by outsourcing jobs overseas for cheaper labor (despite his antithetical rhetoric), or by cheating and scamming both his employees/contractors (the people who completed jobs for him and then got stiffed when it came time for trump to pay up) as well as customers (trump university anyone?). Plus, the fact that he refused to release his tax return (clearly doesn't want us to know that he might not be as rich as he claims, among other things) and the number of times he's used his foundation's charitable donations coffer to settle his lawsuits or purchase paintings of himself should be evidence enough to cast doubt on his alleged ""business acumen"".",8년 전,121,

@queenk2738,"In my opinion, I disagree with many of Trump's policies. If you are one of those devoted supporter of his just ignore this. But if you insist on reading it's fine with me. I don't think ending TPP is right. Many citizens don't have enough education on global affairs and don't understand the benefits in TPP, which overweights its downside. Every policy has good and bad and a leader must choose what's best for most population. TPP can bring in goods from abroad that produce faster, thus more quantity, and so at cheaper price. More manufacture goods means more competition in U.S. market, which means people can buy goods at lower cost with more variety. This can also prevent inflation in goods price. Trump wants to close TPP completely is irrational; in a world where everything and everyone is more connected ever because of global economy and trade, internet, etc., to close the trade with other countries is like rejecting the reality of the globalized world we live in now. But guess what Trump supporters? After he got elected, he said he might slowly close the TPP deal, in contrast to immediately and completely which he promised. If the U.S. leave TPP, Asian countries won't lose so much; the major roles will just become Russian and China instead of the U.S.   As for guns, this is easy to talk about. The current gun policy just doesn't work in the U.S. society. Bush allowed guns for the citizens because of 9/11, the initial intent was to allow citizen being able to protect themselves at home. It soon became a business scheme for gun corporations. Some politicians support gun accessibility because gun manufacture companies have given them benefits. This has to do with nothing but monetary means. Corporations want to keep making big money thus rejecting gun control. Guess what? Deaths cause by gun violence increased the past decade, and many deaths could have been avoided if those weapons were not so easily accessible, even to kids who went on killing! Those who argue if countries like Switzerland can have all of their citizens legally possess guns and why not the U.S., you have ignore all the cultural and history factors and differences. Swiss citizen can have guns but has one of the lowest gun violence rate in the world, whereas gun violence in the U.S. has just been increasing every year. It just doesn't work in the U.S., it did not protect the citizens as effective as it supposed to be. And for those machos that argue people used to possess guns in the wild west long, long time ago, wake up; we are in the freaking 21st century where everybody in anywhere deserves higher safety than this.   Lastly, U.S. is probably the only developed country that did not have solid healthcare plan. Countries in Asia have superb medical and surgical skills, and the bills are covered by the government because of the healthcare plan. For those complain about Obamacare, you just aren't used to paying for a bill that is meant to be a form of health insurance until you need to pay for a huge amount of medical cost, such as cancer and the likes. A lot of you complain about Obama, but in truth he actually has done a solid job in rebuilding the economy and introduce jobs.

@formerhunter2,"+David Smith  Your claims are wild, harmful to hard-working immigrants, and as far as I can tell, completely based on your opinion, rather than on facts.   Here's a fact: President Trump gets his news from completely unreliable sources that don't differentiate between facts and opinions, he makes wild accusations based on those claims, and then instead of blaming his shitty sources, he goes after anyone who disagrees with him. This behavior is barely acceptable when you're a CEO, much less a President.   Here's another Fact: President Trump either doesn't know, or doesn't care about how diplomacy, or foreign relations work. His interactions with other foreign leaders range from cringeworthy to outright disastrous, and a number of the United States' allies have refused to deal with him, or have spoken out against him, due to his completely unreliable temperament.   Another fact for you: The wall is a simply imbecilic idea. Estimates for the wall's cost range from 60-70 Billion Dollars, and to be completely honest, there's a much better way to accomplish his objectives.   Put five military-grade spy satellites into Orbit. Each can range from 40-500 Million dollars. Equip them with the current highest level imaging hardware, and software, possible. Post border guards along the US-Mexico Border, and pay them the same as you would other Border Guards. Making Jobs.   Each of those five military-grade spy satellites will be scanning the US-Mexico Border for activity. They'll cost anywhere between $290-390 Million each to get up there, and Bandwidth can cost $1.5 Million a year.   Assuming you need ten of these puppies, that's 3.9 Billion at first, with an additional cost of $15 Million a year. Let's assume Maintenance is going to cost you the startup cost again within five years. That's only about 7.9 Billion.   Let's Also assume that the new program would require...Let's say Double the current Border Patrol Budget for the next three years, to train over 40 000 new patrollers, give them shiny new vehicles, and to give them new equipment. Over the next three Years, America would be spending over $8 Billion a year. That $24 Billion (half of which you're already spending, by the way) brings the total cost up to about 31.9 Billion Dollars, less than HALF the cost of Trump's Wall.   This would more than double the amount of border patrollers, creating new jobs for people along the southern Border, the Satellites would be programmed to identify illegal crossings from Space, and alert the Border Patrol so they can catch them, keeping track of them and alerting the Patrol as to their locations in Real Time. They could also help identify entrance and exit points to Tunnels, which is honestly one of the biggest problems, drug-wise. This would also stop the problems of people shooting drugs across and over Border Fences, since the Spy Satellites could identify the catapults or cannons used to shoot packages across. If you create Border Patrol Barracks, like Firehouses or Police Stations, then the infrastructure created is useful, rather than completely useless.   Half the cost, much more effective. I'm a 21 year old Media Student from Canada, and I just blew your President's Plan out of the fucking Water.   Here's another Fact: There's a Bipartisan effort to shut down the Wall, and a number of Trump's other plans, because they're Dumb ideas and even the politicos know it.   Another Fact: Trump cut the Federal Education Budget by 9.2 Billion dollars, and the casualties are after-school programs that serve Millions of poorer students, and child-care options for 9-5ers who can't get there for the end of school.

He has goaded a dictator with Nuclear weapons and then proceeded to sell military hardware to its allies closest to North Korea i.e create fear and capitalise financially while putting millions at risk just to sell merchandise. He has attempted to block all attempts to investigate collusion with Russia, appoints people with barely any relevant qualifications to do incredibly complex and important jobs of which many have been fired (this is not the apprentice Donald) and others have quit. He lies constantly and behaves like a thin skinned petulant child when confronted with the truth and labels it fake news.

Less than 48 hour previously he had, on live TV, denounced him when asked and had done so with zero equivocation.  As you pointed out he called Duke a racist and the part you left out was that it was the reason he pulled out of the Reform party.  And again, later that day he denounced him again.  So are you telling me that Trump has to be prepared to flat out denounce a person multiple times, whenever you throw it at him OR he's a racist?  And if so John. let me ask you this.  How many times has Obama denounced the New Black Panthers?  OH I got an even better question... How many times have you even asked him?   The truth is you never cared.  You guys used these questions like drive bys and if someone had the audacity to respond with anything other than the pre approved answer, like with something that was akin to ""why do you keep asking me this stuff, I don't know the guy, wtf?"" instead you LIE LIE and LIE.  We all know he denounced the KKK and has done so multiple times.  We also know he was best buddies with the Clintons.  Have you been asking them about their ties to the KKK?  No, because you are a lying hypocrite who thinks snarky comments are the same as smart comments.  But we didn't fall for your crap and now you can't figure out why Hillary wasn't elected.  Just watch this video and count all the time that YOU bent or twisted the truth and then realised that we are not as stupid as you wish we were.

There were people in the Russia and China that may have supported the rule, supremacy of the Huns, Mongols and all of the ideology, narrative surrounding it that doesn't mean they weren't discriminative of their own people for individual ""virtue signalling"" gain. But anti-White doesn't exist wouldn't exist according to people like yourself does it? Let alone that you'd recognise that a great deal of it comes from J*wry. Let alone that you'd let people defend themselves from it without just spewing your empty, pathetic labels framing everybody as ""racists"", Back to the original topic...

Let alone calling out other peoples abusing Whites. Which is a defenition of ""racism"" only applied to Whites. White people are denied the right to self-determination in a way that actually surpasses the degrading ideologies, narrative of the slave trade. At least slaves had the right to consider themselves separate, African rather than be scolded with framing buzzwords that link you to all kinds of irrelevant fictional and non-fictional crimes, supremacism. For Whites calling out abuse by other peoples is seen as a deviation of the delusional cult of extremist individualism, the demonization of Whites (they can't be a victim) and ""universalism"". Seeing abuse of Europeans as a pattern that derives from the racial, cultural background of another peoples is called ""racist"" these days. Let alone these Whites actually defending theimselves or their interests. People are atacked in the street for voting for someone that claims to represent them in a complete non-democracy when this person ran against someone representing a vicious anti-White regime and all associated.

Both front running candidates are thieves and liars, corrupt to their marrow figureheads willing to  represent their real constituency and sell America out to the central banks, and international financial consortium's who direct the network of corporations which constitute the military-industrial-tax-paying-consumer complex.                                   Trump was sold to the public as a man of the people who spoke his mind, like the common man if he were an imbecile with tourettes, who stood against the corrupt establishment, but all along he was their candidate which is proven by the fact that the election was hijacked for him.                              Trump sold the gullible and brainwashed World War 2 fantasies of American exceptionalism that he would return the nation to its former glory, which only existed in the delusional minds of those brainwashed by the propaganda of american ascendancy, of the” american century”. America's former glory is a legacy of  imperialism, racism, oppression of dissent, no better or worse than Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union or Chinese communism  and constant unrelenting war in which America was the aggressor.                                 Trump rambled on about winning, and being a winner with brilliance of Charlie Sheen during his public breakdown, which may also have been a staged publicity stunt, engineered to distract the publics' attention from the passage of the TPTA  but very few people asked how many contractors and building suppliers he robbed erecting the gaudy abominations sporting the Trump name and how many shady, business practices were involved in building the Trump empire.

One of the main reasons Trump was elected was that the ""powers that be"" have a sense of humor in their arrogance and confidence in their uncontested power and ability to manipulate and control the public who they know will blithely accept the ugly American, a boorish, uncouth imbecile as their figure-head representing the most powerful nation of the ""free"" first world to continue to enslave the third world and destroy their infrastructures so American companies can steal their resources to maintain America's imperialist dominance.                                                 Trump as the perfect embodiment of the ugly American is also the perfect representative of American foreign policy which is: “Fuck you, we can take whatever we want and there is nothing you can do about it because we have the most weapons of mass destruction and a military so advanced we can and will terrorize everyone into submission except for our closest competitors, the Russians and Chinese with whom we are afraid of provoking a Third World War, which unlike the first and second, may be the war to end all wars.                                                   Trumps' election was a profound insult to all Americans, who are too retarded to understand they have been deceived and insulted an affirmation of the world's opinion of “the ugly American” because your representative is what you are, an obnoxious, loud-mouthed, uncultured  braggart who lacks tact, subtlety and even basic manners who believes he can take anything he wants because he has the largest military budget and most dooms day weapons of mass destruction can terrorize anyone into submission.                               Trump's election was proof once again following George Bush Jr. That the real powers that be could put a suit on a shaved monkey, hijack an election and place him in the Whitehouse and no one would be the wiser.                                 Hell, the US even had a senile president in Regan, which is why they popularized the term Alzheimers because the idea of an American president with Alzheimers sounds alot less scary than a president with senile dementia.                                           I expect a shit-storm of bile from brainwashed idiots, so in advance, you should know that regardless of how vile and despicable your attacks, I will not dignify a response to your ignorance and stupidity.",8년 전,7,

I think he's a salesman who figured out what demographics to appeal to, to win the election (racists, conservatives, dumb people and Vladimir Putin) and simply played the role to get the power he desired. He's the type of person who doesn't give a shit about how he wins but ONLY that he wins. Trump only gives a shit about money and power and then women so kind of Tony Montana only seedier. I don't consider myself liberal or conservative as it's dangerous to constantly label people as one thing as every human beings inclinations are incredibly complex and diverse but that seems to be the constant in democratic countries with predominantly 2 political parties, it trains its citizens to think that a person is either one thing or the other which is a fundamentally flawed system",7년 전,1,

@formerhunter2,"He's a poster child for several mental tics allocated to the ""Disability"" category. His lack of an ability to differentiate truth from fact (or inability to tell the truth) could be blamed on pseudologia fantastica, or compulsive lying. Said ""Mythomania"" could also explain his approach to ISIS, thinking that bombing them would actually do anything in the long run, or that the global community would advocate war crimes.   While his sensitive nature rules out the more common form of sociopathy, his lack of consideration for the human lives he's already ruined with his businesses certainly would seem to indicate an emotionally stunted or developmental delay of some sort. This developmental delay, along with his other, less mature social behaviors, could stem from a lack of closeness with his family, as well as a lack of comradary with Anybody who didn't have rich parents and a f***ing Ivy League Degree.   It's clear, however, that the Trump Family's Allegations of involvement with the Klan didn't start with the current Trump. Donald Trump's Father and Grandfather have been sighted with prominent Klan members, his grandfather even being arrested at one of their rallies. The Trump Family has been hiding truth and operating behind shady doors since just after World War 1, claiming they were from Swedish Ancestry, due to the inherent Racism against German Descendants at the time.   As for the man himself, John Oliver does a damn good job of calling him out on his shit. His businesses are a mixed bag at best, and he would never have survived as a businessman up in Canada. Why? Because his Bankruptcies would have crippled him as a businessman, not just his business. America's bullshit allowed him to survive as a con artist.   The money he got from his father alone would all but guarantee someone be able to make a nice living with conservative estimates alone. How he went bankrupt at all is beyond me. Seriously, make some safe bets, get some income, and THEN once you have the backup plan, THEN you take some gambles. The man's ineptitude at business, life and diplomacy will be legendary by the time his term ends its' first year. Psychologically speaking, the man is a developmentally delayed, possibly sociopathic, living piece of half-melted cotton candy with a Candy Corn fetish  Or he could also just be a racist, sexist old white con artist with a shit-eating grin and the knowledge that America is full of idiots who don't know the difference between a scientific theory and an opinion, and who lack the mental capacity to be able to tell they're being used.",8년 전,11,

I am looking at the senate specifically. Yes some of them have served since the Cold War but they need to know when to not clench their fists as that seriously impedes whatever goals a president promised. Probably a reason why previous presidents can't do anything against the problems you mentioned.

Then the fact you count votes by electoral college means that the popular vote is meaningless... isn't the principle of democracy all about the majority and what most people want? Exactly how did this latest election reflect that?   Also yes I am a foreigner currently studying political science in university. I know I have no right to criticize the USA but do you even know the level of dismay some people showed after the election results were announced? Trump's actions aren't just affecting the US.

@BrokeredHeart,"I find it bleakly humurous reading this 5 months later. How do you feel now about the escalation of force, not only with Russia, but with North Korea as well? The attacks on Libya and the Syrian air field were absolute farces and accomplished nothing, and the crack down on Al Quaeda strongholds in Afghanistan took place without the advice of the President. It was carried out by a knowledgeable military general, who Trump claimed he was smarter than. They didn't even approach him for permission, they just announced what they were planning on doing, and he tried to take the praise for it.  They have stationed more troops on the ground in eastern Europe to boost support to the Lithuanian, Polish and Ukrainian militaries in the inevitability of Putin pushing his expansionist ideals further. North Korea is very close to bombing the shit out of their neighbours, South Korea and Japan, if they cannot develop an ICBM that can strike the US (and they are getting closer).  So all of this talk of Hillary leading the US into a 3rd world war before the end of her first term seems ludicrous now, knowing that the result would have been inevitable, given the fate of the country lies in the hands of an incompetent con man. At this stage, a broken toaster would be a better acting POTUS, because at least a toaster serves some function and makes goddamn breakfast.

@IggyTthunders,"I love how patronizing this goggle-eyed ponce is. 'I great why you like him: he's entertaining and he's unpredictable.' Yyyyyeah, and he's a billionaire, dude; so the evidence---his dozens and dozens of businesses and strings of world class hotels and so on---plainly attest to his economic savvy. Especially when compared to a college teacher in law who latched herself on to a charming personality just as opportunistic as her.    Oliver doesn't analyze Trump's policies or proposals, he just perpetuates the myth that Trump fans love him for his personality: most of us, frankly, don't. We like him for his politics, like building a wall, being anti mass amnesty, being anti mass refugee immigration, banning lobbyists on capital hill five years out of office, his plans against ISIS and radical Islam: and the fact that he SAYS radical Islam. Plus the fact he's not fucking subsidized by a foreign government that considers (under royal decree 44) atheism an act of terrorism and puts gays to the sword. I'm of course speaking of Saudi Arabia; who the Clinton campaign, in the Podesta leaks, concedes is funding ISIS.",9년 전(수정됨),0,

He's never done or said anything racist despite what liberal media would try to get you to believe. He has NEVER EVER been accused of being racist or hateful until the last few months. Hes not a megalomaniac like a certain Youtube claimed, who very obviously doesn't know the definition of that word. He doesn't fucking hate mexicans either, and has NEVER said a bad word against the Mexican people. Don't fall for this media shit people.  What does Donald Trump want? He wants YOU to either SUCCEED or FAIL based on YOUR MERITS NAD HARD WORK! He wants the American Dream for YOU. He doesn't want you to be forced to live on government scraps and stolen money. He wants YOU to have nice things and an amazing home, and a career you love!",9년 전,1,
@barvem851,"I will admit I don't like either candidates but since the pigeon on this page is Trump, might as well. I can't help but wonder why big news companies would try to lower Trump's appearance when they're the ones that will benefit if he becomes president. That makes no sense. People really should consider if it's popular opinion, it's probably popular for a reason. Just getting tired of ""Well your source argument is invalid because it's not some hipster rouge news that tells it like it is"" Look maybe he does do good I don't fucking know. All I do know is that kids arguing about source material, news feed on their personal life like it was Entertainment Tonight. I don't care about personal issues. In this instance, I'm just concerned about how the country's going to be run. I personally think Trump uses his knowledge that he acquired through his moderately lengthy time pushing his nose in the entertainment business. He knows what gets people's attention. That's it. And that's fine.   Everybody loves the ideas he uses to tickle right wing politicians interest but the things that slip out (some he knows and just blatantly throws out there once he knows it's out) people just sweep it under the rug like it didn't happen just because ""Well at least he nutted up and told us unlike Hillary""... if your best argument is that at least he doesn't hide things... that's really a weak argument. He's not nutting up, he's just really bad at hiding anything so he's like ""Fuck it, let's just see what happens, people love entertainment anyway"" that doesn't make anything better, it just means you're happy about this blatantly obvious asshole who's probably still trying to lie to you about what he's going to do once he becomes president so you don't focus on what he's not doing or if he's even going to own up to his ideas.. plus he says he never went bankrupt and...yes he has... more than once.",9년 전(수정됨),0,

@anneliesmariefrank714,"Dear Kitty…  I am genuinely in love with Donald Trump. He is a beautiful, witty, and strong young man deserves to be America’s next president.  I frequently fantasize about him being Peter van Pels hiding with me.  Oh god, just imagine being deflowered by him that on a lazy Amsterdam afternoon, lying and learn what each other's bodies were for.  Now imagine nine months later, I’ve got a massive bulging stomach from carrying your child inside of me and it seems like I’m gonna pop any moment now. My popped belly button makes it look like I’ve got a giant third boob where my stomach once was. I waddle around and can barely move half of the time. I’ve developed an insatiable craving for his Donald and he’s likewise developed a taste for my pussy. We’re both cooped up in an attic all day have nothing better to do besides fuck like an unsustainable third world population. He lies down on your back, I strip off my almost comically too small clothes and kneels on top of him. I grab a hold of his rock hard Hugh Mungus cock, insert it deep inside of myself, and begin to ride him like a stallion. He feels the pressure from her incredible weight and huge round belly bearing down on him but the indescribable pleasure of my tight pussy throbbing on his cock negates any discomfort. He sinks into my beautiful soul, into that secret place where no one dares to go. After 30 minutes, We are both moaning with ever greater intensity, I know it won't be long now. Suddenly, I feel his cock shaking like a V-2 rocket and the orgasm reaches it's climax as his cum literally explodes like an 88mm AT round inside my Sherman tank, blowing the turret right off. Donald and I both join as one, souls screaming from the sheer ecstasy. As the elation wears off, I lie next to him. Too exhausted to do anything else, he simply holds me in his warm embrace. In that moment, there is no family squabbles, no Nazis, no war. Just us, watching the sky turn pink with the setting sun.  I dream of the beautiful face I have found in this place. So soft and sweet.  One day we will both die and your ashes will fly from an Aeroplane over the sea.  But for now we are young and all we want is lay in the sun, and count every beautiful thing we can see. Love to be in the arms of all I’m keeping here with him.   What a beautiful dream that could flash on the screen in a blink of an eye  Suddenly, I awaken from my slumber, opening my eyes to darkness. It takes a split second for my vision to readjust. I feel lonely and cold. Suddenly, I feel a pressure gathering my midsection. As the pressure becomes stronger and stronger, I clutch my belly try to avoid screaming. I feel a splash on my legs and foul smelling fluid comes rushing out. The pain is finally too much and I start to scream. Our hot dirty fuckfest has brought on labor. I cry his name, begging for help, begging for him. The noise. I’m louder than a line of Louisiana Tigers giving the Rebel Yell right now. Through the tears, I can see Donald raise his finger to his lips, trying to tell me to be quiet. But the agony is too much for me to bear. I don’t care if I awaken the entire neighborhood and with it, the Nazis. Suddenly, Donald stands up, squats like a slav, using my belly as an impromptu stool, and I feel his still cum-crusted cock being shoved right inside my mouth. At first, I try to scream even louder in surprise, but his circumcised 12.5%% Kosher Donald blocks my windpipe, reducing my screams to a barely audible gurgle. Suffering from unbearable pain, I bites down on hard on his meat with each contraction. Now he’s in pain too. With each contraction, I bite down harder It must feel like I’m gonna tear his cock right off. Eventually, I feel the pain subsides and I don’t bite down as much. Now I’m actually starting to enjoy it. You can feel my child kicking on his testicles. Clearly it’s excited too. Suddenly, I feel his cock starting to shake like a V-2 again, he pulls it out of my mouth just in time. He bust his steaming hot and sticky load, blanketing me like an incendiary carpetbombing of Dresden. Semen stains my mountaintops (all three of them), along with my hair and most of my face. I quietly giggle from the ironic amusement of it all. he giggles too.  Then, I feel a sharp pain shoot across my body. I’m having his baby. Donald looks at me, wishing he could bear all the pain for me, but all he can do is sit and watch. I touch my vulva, still oozing with cum from that great fucking he gave me a few hours ago. I feel a head of hair poking out. I fear that I might start screaming again, but I’ve gotten better control of the pain, thanks to him. A feeling of indescribable pleasure flows through my body. I begin to moan softly. Instead of experiencing excruciating agony, I’m experiencing an orgasm. The greatest orgasm I’ve ever had. I can see that Donald can’t help but grin as I keep pushing. As more of the head emerges, my moaning intensifies. Finally, I feel the massive head emerges from my vagina. I look down at my midsection and can see a face wrapped in an umbilical cord.I reach down and weakly try to pull the head out. Suddenly, Donald puts his hands around the head and begin to help me pull. Desperately, I go into the next contraction with all of my energy, and push with everything inside of me. I feel everything. I feel the shoulders and hips and feet all slide down inside of me and pop out in one long push, with a rush of fluid behind it, and it feels amazing. I throw my head back with a rip-roaring orgasm that penetrates the very heart of my soul.  I look at the newborn now lying on the floor, it’s a boy. We have a son. Perfect, perfect in every way. He begins to stir and I realize he’s about to cry. After all that’s happened, I don’t to given away to the Germans from the wails of a newborn. Donald gently lifts him up and place him on my semen stained mountaintops. The baby quickly finds my breast is soon sucking happily. Semen, blood, amniotic fluid, breastmilk all mix and fill the air with a strange scent that while repulsive, is also extremely arousing. Donald can’t resist the urge anymore. His mouth lands right on top of my opposite breast, sucking first your own cum, but then her tasty milk. I look into his eyes, she’s somewhat annoyed, but I’m too exhausted to really care. A gust of wind coming from a hole in the wall blows through, cooling both of our sweat-drenched bodies, but also disturbing the little one. He’s afraid the baby start shivering. He looks around the dusty attic for something to keep the baby warm. You settle on my fur winter jacket, having sat unused for the past two years. I am definitely not be happy that he’s gonna ruin my favorite coat, but it’s for the best. I hasn’t been able to fit in it for the past nine months anyway. He carefully wraps the little one in the coat and hand him to me, I continue to quietly feed him. I notice the dead silence for the first time, not even the other occupants of the Annex, mere feet away in the next room, were roused. I feel a sense of relief. We’re safe, for the moment at least. Eventually Donalds curls up next to me quietly and begin to doze off. Our secret sleeps in winter clothes. Tomorrow, we can find a way to explain the night’s events to our parents and hope they don’t kill each other. We can somehow find a way to get our little bundle of joy to safety. But tonight, we just rest, our first night as a family.  Oh god, just thinking about this is making me wet. The wettest I’ve ever gotten. Oh, I think I’m gonna… I’m gonna-  Cums in Diary",9년 전,0,

@airplayn,"Once upon a time, Stephen Colbert coined a new word that caught on like wildfire, ""truthiness"". Well, I have my own jewel for Danial Webster that I would propose, ""TRUMPISH"". We now live in a TRUMPISH society, in a TRUMPISH world. A world where intolerance and greed outweigh civility and decency, where the base venality of a minority of ignorant and hateful ideologues have allowed, no encouraged, corporations and government to overrun that very society. The new found ability of a population of powerful special interests,  with not only too much power, but with a disgraceful villainous lust for yet more power. More power than any human could every wield, much less need ... or deserve. These are the heinous ""Cheneys and Kochs"" of the world, and their numerous vile spawn, such as their minions like Bill O'Reilly. Among this plethora of ever rapacious monstrosities, toothful gaping mouths of their slavering hunger grinning in an imagined victory of gluttony of hate, are found the Trumps of this TRUMPISH new wave of infection. This TRUMPISH  trash of our brave new TRUMPISH world (and their enthusiastic followers), are not just symptoms of America's fall from grace, its betrayal of our Enlightenment heritage, they are the disease and filthy vectors of contagion. The ability to ""admanage"" (noun: to manipulate or manage public opinion via media, syn; propaganda)* the population with Goebbels like efficiency has birthed an evil demon that gobbles up and destroys what little scraps of hope and dignity that might be left in us. Not only America, but the entire world.  Yes, we do live in a TRUMPISH world, don't we? (*and if TRUMPISH catches on, what about ""ad-manage?

@bryanguo7824,"Let's look at Donald with analytic eyes here? 1. Politics: Donald Drumpf will build better foreign relations with other countries, contenders are Russia, North Korea, and a few more. However, Donald Drumpf will also antagonize other countries based on his insults against China and Mexico, his wall, and the EU will be mad because he supported Brexit and will not contribute to the efforts to lower Europe's population density with all of the refugees that are flooding in. Conclusion: This is a bad idea because Drumpf will antagonize our three biggest trade partners collectively. While bring us closer to Russia and North Korea is important, it is not that important. 2. Immigration Wall: This will stem illegal immigration to an extent. However, this will antagonize Mexico as stated above. Keep in mind that he has called them rapists, and I doubt the Mexican President will be pleased with that. His policy to deport the illegal immigrants in America is also bad because this will cost billions to do. As a result, this is not efficient. Refugees: This will lower our own chances of getting terrorists that are hiding among the refugees. However, the EU will be antagonized because it seems like Drumpf does not want to support them in their refugee crisis. Conclusion: Downright bad, because while the issues they are meant to target are solved, this will only create larger problems, like using a rocket launcher to kill a fly. Sure, the fly is dead, but now there's a huge hole in the house 3. Economy He wants to create jobs be lowering taxes in the United States for the rich so that they move their jobs here. This could work, however, in our global society today, we should be encouraging people to move outward to obtain better relations with other countries and bolster the world economy with more international business. Not only this, but his plan also increases national debt because more people are paying lower taxes. Conclusion: Could work, but with the global economy and society, not necessarily the best solution. Final Conclusion: Donald J. Drumpf has some of the right ideas, but the problems created in the process and with the way the world works, his policies will not be beneficial. Note: I'm 15, so any political analysis advice one could give me would be great:)",9년 전,2,

@BroMikey55,American's sit in front of a TV everyday looking at LUST programs and TRUMP was part of that for years. This means LUST lived with TRUMP as part of the programming to excite the viewers. This LUSTFUL talk is part of the job of a sitcom cast. The soaps provide the AMERICAN public with evil entertainment where sex and dirty talk control the ratings of that show.  Trump has been tempted with big money and sexual desires just as others are tempted with drugs and alcohol. 2 years ago it was reported by LOU DOBBS  one of the nations leading preachers that TRUMP had a change of heart and gave his life to JESUS CHRIST. TRUMP has now become the messenger for the people of the USA who feel the same way. The USA is being called to repentance to turn from THEIR wicked ways so GOD may heal HIS people.  Remember how everyone in the USA has raved over TRUMP'S success in the past on Television and how that this is largely due to demonic spirits that work thru the cast. TRUMP is all done yielding to those spirits and the people who hate JESUS CHRIST and the plan GOD has made to get to him will come out and attack.  All men are set up from childhood to fail so they may be able to taste of the fruit of evil as well as the good fruits. You will fail.,9년 전,0,

@burrozion,Sander Sveen Paulsen What some people don't realise is trump is looking out for the best interest of his business not the people. Trump and American business  been manufacturing in China for a long time instead of having factories in America.  He complained thst China devalue their currency making it hard for them to compete with export.  I use to buy my stuff from America on top of that I paid duty on my items 20 percent when it arrived it's all made in China. so America is just a middle man.  That is why Trump bad mouthing them.  because if people start going straight to the source that would be a threat.  if you really want to hurt trump and the elite it's simple stop buying from them and that is what I'm doing.  you don't need to get angry or pick up a gun it's simple don't support them.  America started shale oil drove the price down to try and mess up Russia and Iran economy because Russia was in Ukraine and Iran was doing their nuclear program.He and some of his billionaire buddies probably don't like a policy Obama came out with so they decide to take it I  their own hands. So you all need to stop worry or fear the government.    Because who ever in power we ate going to be in the same situation.  yes he want to build a wall in Mexico because if you calculate all those illegal immigrants that cross the border that is a lot of revenue on visa application that shit is not cheap. if they are worried about people coming to their country they should close all their embassy that been generating so much income especially from poor countries .,8년 전,3,

With Hillary, she has been in politics her whole life and needs to move on. Whether intentional or not here derelict of duty is enough to disqualify her. So, between Gary and Trump I just don't know. Gary is pro-abortion which I strongly believe should not be endorsed by Government. To me it is an issue to be decided by the states not the federal government. I can't come to terms with the idea of saying ""okay, you can kill the baby as long as it is in your womb and we are cool with that"". I cannot fathom how a society with that kind of thinking can have any decent degree of morality. Secondly, he believes that legally as a business you must serve anyone with your services whether you want to or not. In other words, the government can force your business to sell to all customers whether you as the owner want to or not. As I have stated in other comments I would only agree with such a law only if it was enacted/enforced for life threatening circumstances. In other words, you can deny anybody you want (and your business will lose to competition), however, if the product/services you have can save someones life then you should be required by law to provide your services/goods.

What all of them actually are is fear/trauma based mind control & manipulation psyop operations(as was done in nazi Germany) & inflicted on the public to produce & promote fear,panic,anger hatred,race & religion conflict & war,take guns,start a police state,blame or frame non-existent attackers,collect money from phony ""victims funds""(theft,as they did at Sandy Hook fraud),create feelings of confusion,despair,sorrow,anxiety,worry,create divisions,promote violence,atrocities,be distractions from crimes committed elsewhere,create unrest,turmoil,feelings of helplessness & other negative,toxic & evil agendas. Fetzer & others should therefore be shouting from the rooftops demanding immediate repeal of the treasonous Patriot Act & also demand that charges of treason be filed on all who signed it,as they are indeed traitors to the constitution & now criminals themselves(Bush,congress & others). Why then does Fetzer not demand this? It is the right,patriotic, & needed thing to be done,as it cuts right to the heart of all of these planned,staged,fraud shootings,bombings,& other ""terror events"",& the criminals doing them. Again,why doesnt Fetzer demand this in order to bring justice & put an end to these crimes & criminals?
