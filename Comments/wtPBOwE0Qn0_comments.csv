@macropsychoanalysis,"1:05.  'Parade' ~ parade, assume at least 3 meanings + Time. 1) Freud: A DIFFICULTY IN THE PATH OF PSYCHO-ANALYSIS(1917) ""I will say at once that it is not an intellectual difficulty I am thinking of, not anything that makes psycho- analysis hard for the hearer or reader to understand, but an affective one - something that alienates the feelings of those who come into contact with it, so that they become lessinclined to believe in it or take an interest in it. As will be observed, the two kinds of difficulty amount to the same thing in the end.

@anastasiamurawski6179,"I've been making surreal digital collages and now that my work is starting to get a little attention, people are beginning to ask me that age old question about surrealism: What does it mean? or What am I looking at here? Often I don't know what to say, there really isn't any hidden meaning, usually I just put together elements that just seem to look right together, I like leaving room for interpretation , I like hearing what others think it's about, it may be something I never even thought about when making it. I love surrealism and I'm  not sure why , I guess it's like what what said in the video, it's a blend of the familiar and the strange. I find realism kind of boring, as an art professor once told me:""if you want realism , go take a photograph."" I like the dreamlike quality to it, I like searching for meaning in surreal work.

As a brief introduction to Surrealism, this is great. That said, what is missing from this lovely little video is, quite frankly, the recognition of women artists in the movement. Frida Kahlo (though she rejected the label), Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo, Leonor Fini, Kay Sage, Dorothea Tanning, Louise Bourgeois, and others should at the very least be mentioned. The art establishment, from museums to art history books, have neglected to recognize the importance and influence of women artists all the way through to this past century. We're only beginning to acknowledge just how substantive their contributions are and I find it more than a little disappointing that this video continues to perpetuate an androcentric narrative.

Art is today is very consensual and tend to follow propaganda. The people who talk about art make political commentary who pushe for socialism or any stuff that is mainstream.

@lvo3617,"Salvador Jurado Nice to see someone who’s educated on this topic :)! I think Frida cannot be seen as separate from Diego. They met in 1928, when Frida was only 21 years old.  Frida’s most mature works were created throughout her later life, in parallel with what happened to her in the course of that life (her relationship with Diego, her stay in the US, her miscarriages, her health struggles etc.). She painted without commercial purpose, purely as a way of coping with her life and herself. And what a funny way of you to say she “just so happened to marry Diego Riviera”: they had a very intense and turbulent relationship and their encounter wasn’t incidental. In a way, they were destined to be together (with similar backgrounds as Mexican artists and socialists). Also, an artist’s merit or quality isn’t necessarily proportionate to the artist’s fame as you seem to suggest (e.g. Van Gogh, early Picasso, ...). Anyways: I for sure keep my opinion: Khalo was a “true artist”, for she painted with authenticity as a way of coping with her difficult life. She didn’t bother about what people might think of her work. In her art, Rivièra is a motive and object of love, trust, or jealousy, as their relationship was intense and turbulent. Frida’s artistic life is connected to him almost from the very start (21 years old). And if she hadn’t ever met Rivièra, she would still have enough/other sorrows to base her art on.     Tbh I really don’t get your point, sorry :/",6년 전,20,
@SebbyNilsen,NARNIA!!!,5년 전,2,
@OlivierDuvergerHoupert,"​ @lvo3617  I'm sorry to come so late in this conversation but I don't think that being called an ""true artist"" should be associated with coping with a difficult life or reacting to what people think of their works. This whole video shows the impact the french surrealist males had on art in the XXth century, their impact only is enough to call them true artists.     Caravaggio, Michel-Angelo, Raphael, Boticcelli, Delacroix, even Picasso and Matisse, for examples, all of these true artists did react to the world surrounding them, they did bother about the reception of their works, because one has to be in the world to make an art revolution. They did bother, and yet they did change the standards of their time. To react to the world, to have interactions with other artists and the audience of your work does not take away your authenticity. Without any interactions nobody would even make art at all. Authenticity is for me an empty concept, it doesn't exist as an absence of any influence on one's mind. Absence of influence cannot exist, even if you claim it. Without any influence people wouldn't even talk or think. Dali and the others are not less authentic than Khalo. Of course they lived in an artistic sphere where influence was important, but does that make them less authentic ? If it does then let's get rid of most of artistic movements, without which Khalo wouldn't have painted the way she did...",5년 전(수정됨),9,
@lvo3617," @OlivierDuvergerHoupert  That’s very well put, thank you. I am revising my opinion ;) The discussion on what makes a “true artist"" is empty. However, I do still stand with my point that Kahlo didn’t want to be associated with the European surrealists.

@TheFreeM93,"lycheens I think because women before the movement they didn't have any role in society and they were repressed, and as a way of freeing one's own self and trying to be part of something other then their usual actions, they try to join the movement.

@surreabstractcreatives,"There are actually a number of women artist currently embracing the Surrealism movement in their art. I'm one of those artist and I pushed the envelope further to create my own movement called Surreabstract art which explores the coexistence of surreal and abstract elements in the same space while at the same time combining the world of dreams, people's subconscious reality and the use of music to inspire the creative process of developing art.

@UltimateBreloom,"​ @joebyron9  I thought Friday Kahlo was always more indifferent to the label of surrealism. She just made her art as true as she saw it, and didn't much care for the labels of it.   I certainly see similarities between her compositions and the broader surrealism movement, but from my understanding, she came into her style independent of those working in Europe. As such, I tend not to really consider her a surrealist, but I do think her art features certain similarities.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
