Though that’s not to say that a certain space agency shouldn’t be thanked for a certain attribute the C7 features. And that is a substance called Aerogel! Developed by NASA for use in space suits, Aerogel is considered to be one of the lightest materials in existence, composed of 99.8 percent air, and yet capable of retaining a solid form. At the same time, this substance insulates 39 times better than even the best fiberglass. It is with Aerogel that GM chose to line the C7’s transmission tunnel, with a 10-mm (0.4-inch) layer applied to its sides, and another 5 mm (0.2 inch) on the top. The goal is to keep the heat of the transmission tunnel from transferring into the cabin..",2년 전,0,

Being 99.8% air means the 10cm³ block would weight 0.01228g (air) plus the weight of the aerogel itself, so : 0.122 - 0.01228 = 0.1097/10 = 0.01097g/cm³ or 8.9 times the density of air !",2년 전(수정됨),0,

So yes its there, but you have 5 inches of PIR for pennies and it insulates MUCH better than 1/4"" aerogel.  In the end all these insulation materials do the same, insulate by having tiny airpockets. The smaller the air pockets, the better, aerogel is the best, but its not a game changing difference. Thickness always remains key to insulation.

I am not a scientist and my  question is sincere so if there's an obvious answer thanks in advance.

@mnxs,"It's basically useless for that purpose. For one thing, if you want to reduce blue light from your phone, you make your phone screen emit less blue light (which is super easy); it's completely silly to try to block out that light after the fact.  Second, aerogel would absolutely suck as a screen protector. On the one hand, it's cloudy; not completely transparent - so it'd distort and blur the screen image. On the other hand, it's horribly brittle. Ironically, since it is sort of ""brittle on the nanoscale"", it would actually make for a decent shock absorper - for one single drop, then it's crumbled and ruined.  Real-world screen protectors are instead made to be extremely tough and hard - so that they can take the hits and scratches and not get destroyed in the process.",11개월 전,1,

@maaingan,"My god, this is why people of a certain age have left such a mess behind for everyone else to clean up. You’re all well intentioned enough… but the education you received was on par with a modern grade school child and I, regrettably and sadly, am not exaggerating. Every chemical element (yes even Helium) has at least three states that varies depending on pressure, temperature, and volume. Not every element has a triple point, as you know CO2 passes from solid to gas without becoming liquid at atmospheric pressure. Anyone who has seen a fire extinguisher has witnessed stable liquid CO2, stored at 5x atmospheric pressure at which point it will remain in liquid state until the extinguisher is used, and the liquid freely changes state back to a gas upon exposure to atmospheric pressure. You can actually make liquid CO2 safely at home by maneuvering a small piece of dry ice into a cheap plastic pipette and then clamping it shut and holding it under water with forceps. This is one way to force an observable triple point onto captive CO2 molecules at room temperature, as the solid sublimates into a gas the pressure will build to five times that of the atmosphere, allowing the remaining solid to melt into a clear liquid. Eventually the pipette clamp will fly off or the pipette bulb will rupture and the CO2 will contact the water and cause the trademark bubbling effect for a few seconds.",3년 전,0,

That's mean they got more weight reduction and also cooling of the cockpit from the engine heat.  But still I think it's a bad idea to use 100% aurogel for the race car body. That would be like apaper plane with a engine...,3년 전,0,

@LucidDreamer54321,"Calling aerogel the world's lightest solid is very misleading.  It is true that aerogel is derived from a solid material. However, aerogel has a porous structure that is about 99.8% air by volume. Air is composed of gases, not solids. So aerogel is actually only 0.2% solid material. In order to find the true weight per volume of the solid material in aerogel, you would need to first form a volume of it such as one cubic inch. You would then weigh the aerogel and multiply the weight times 500. That will give you the weight of the solid material in one cubic inch of aerogel.",3년 전,1,

The reason Jesus Christ had to do this, is because the fall of mankind. Adam and Eve disobeyed God, bringing sin into the world from Satan; therefore, bringing death, pain, suffering, and all possible negative things you could ever think of in the world. In order to get cured from this sin, which causes Spiritual death, is to accept the Lord Jesus Christ and His sacrifice. Not only did Jesus Christ die for you, but He rose from the dead in victory on the 3rd day, so that we too will rise from the dead at the resurrection. He is the cure to your sin, and it's your choice to accept that cure or reject it.",3년 전,0,

@Square-Watermelon,"Jesus is God & He loves you  Jesus will soon be seen by all men, women, and children up in the clouds. Jesus is returning now! Believe and be saved.  Exodus 3:14 (God speaking) And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.  John 8:58 (Jesus speaking) Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.  John 10:30 (Jesus speaking). I and my Father are one.  Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.  Matthew 1:23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.  John 1:1 & 14 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 14 And the Word was made flesh (Lord Jesus), and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  John 8:24 (Jesus speaking). I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he ye shall die in your sins.  John 14:9 (Jesus speaking) Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?  Hebrews 1:1-3, & 8 (God calls His Son ""O God"" because Jesus IS God in the flesh) 1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets 2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; 3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high 8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.  1 John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.  Titus 2:13 Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;  Revelation 1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.  Isaiah 44:6 (God speaking) Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  Revelation 1:8 (Jesus speaking) I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.  Revelation 22:13 (Jesus speaking) I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.  ---  There Are None Righteous / How To Be Saved  Romans 3:10 & 23 10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  Luke 5:31-32 (Jesus speaking) 31 And Jesus answering said unto them They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.  1 Peter 3:18 (The word “quicken” means “to make alive”) For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:  Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Acts 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.  Ephesians 2:8-9 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.",4년 전,0,

@legendsof.africa654,"The Lord doesn't discriminate or show favoritism. We must all be transformed into the image of Christ, if we desire to inherit His everlasting kingdom. I find no pleasure in the death of sinners. It's not God's will that anyone perish, but all repent to recieve eternal life. Seek Jesus Christ before the doors of mercy close. He is coming to rapture His people. The Lord is about to judge the world. Those who walk with Him until the end will be protected from impending danger. They will be removed before the Great Tribulation. Those who haven't recieved the Covid-19 vaccine, and haven't prepared for the return of Jesus Christ, will be left behind. They will suffer unimaginably, and die for their faith.  Please seek Jesus Christ before the doors of mercy close. They close everyday for many people. Many people die and find themselves in the kingdom of darkness. They never prepared for eternity. We must always be found worthy to inherit God's everlasting kingdom. We must always walk in holiness and righteousness. Those who pickup their cross everyday, submit themselves to Jesus Christ, and follow after Him until the end, will not be disappointed. They will have the hope of eternal life. Jesus Christ transforms the willing into His image, and all for His Glory. They will not be disappointed at the rapture, if they follow Jesus Christ until the end.  If you're willing, now is the time to repent, and prepare for the return of the King. He is coming for a bride without spot,wrinkle, or blemish. They are a holy people, who are blameless in all their ways. They walk with The Lord, and follow Him daily. They have the hope of eternal life after death or at the rapture. Those left behind who haven't received the Covid-19 vaccine will suffer. This is the end, everything written in the book of revelation will be fulfilled. If you're willing, now is the time to repent, and prepare for the return of the King.",4년 전,0,

@joejava,You know what? Has this company ever thought about selling this super genius technology to the fire department for making fireproof jackets and suits that would be good enough to be flexible as well as durable if it's moved into the fabric in some way what do you think? It'd be no different than the police having body armor to preventing a bullet but only instead of a bullet it would be for the fire department to protect them from getting burned it will do a lot better than what they have now which can only last only a minute or so this gel would be super helpful and very beneficial to all fire departments around the whole world I mean just think about it of the real possibilities for the real use and it's huge potentials. I mean if they could some how Incorporated in fabric to make it wearable but yet light and comfortable where it can absorb heat up to 5-10 minutes as the ones that they use now for the fire departments those protective uniforms can only last up to only a minute and they're made out of Kevlar but they too can fail this stuff I can't believe it with this gel it's fascinating and seeing that guy put his hand on it with the flame on there that's the over 600 degrees that's insane LOL I mean think of the possibilities of this stuff the people who invented this and put their mind into it our geniuses I honor them greatly their number one in my book right beside Tesla the inventor.,4년 전,3,
@JesseLeeHumphry,"If the substance is easy to break, then it gets really expensive, really quickly. You need a good seal for the heat insulation to work as desired in the lining of clothes.  If it's easy to break, that means it's not flexible, which is what you want out of something you're lining clothes with.   So it seems like it'd take time to get to that point.",4년 전,1,
@joejava, @JesseLeeHumphry   Well I myself was watching a science show where they were experimenting with silica's with this same gel's and they managed to making it into a fiber that was flexible and they were experimenting with other forms of powders including carbons to as well this was a show that was being aired on the YouTube Asia channel CNA the show was called wizards of science I do believe that was the name of the show and yes its all was in the english language too even though it's a foreign Nation live stream youtube channel.

@perceive8159,"I remember a product named Starlite, invented back in the late 70’s by  amateur chemist Maurice Ward. Under tests, Starlite was claimed to be able to withstand attack by a laser beam that could produce a temperature of 10,000 Celsius. Live demonstrations on Tomorrow's World and BBC Radio 4 showed that an egg coated in Starlite could remain raw, and cold enough to be picked up with a bare hand, even after five minutes in the flame of a blowtorch. I did actually see the demonstration with the egg. Granted we are talking about two different  products here, but none the less the insulation factor of the Starlite was phenomenal considering it being applied as a thin coating and same said of the worlds lightest solid and it's insulation factors are indeed great.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

So there was a day l came across with a testimony from a friend, so l contacted this man on getting his herbal remedy for this infection, which l paid for and reaceived medicine after a week and some days with instruction on how to take medicine attacked. I take medicine for 2weeks before going to the hospital for test...l can show to you now that am herpes free! .

@rogerlundstrom6926,"I love your work.. but.. me personally.. I kind of want to look at the ""other"" things.. I have been thinking about sound insulation for some time, and.. I have thought that f.ex. a layered version between a gas, a soft/malleable thing, and something that is rigid .. you know; hard but frail (like glass).. and you have many layers of that.. ""pressure"" WILL push the ""heavy"" glass, BUT the actual softer plastic will prevent the glass from shattering.. and the layer of gas can be compressed WITHOUT neccesarily transmitting all the energy to the NEXT layer.. (possibly the ""softer"" material should be on both sides of the rigid one)..  ·.. and.. yes.. This product seems interesting from a heat-shielding point of view.. BUT.. Can it be used for other things?.. like..  I WOULD suspect it can kind of be a make-shift version of what I am thinking of; IF you try to play sounds through a wall where the insulation was this material.. would it be ""better"" at reducing sounds than ordinary glass-/rock-wool?.. .. and as I said it.. I ALSO wonder a bit about the price.. it did sound like it requires a bit of chemicals that might be pricey.. but.. if the SAME alcohol can be used more times then it doesn't have to be TOO expensive.. so.. can this be the ""perfect"" thing to insulate houses? or is it too expensive even if we imagine a huge scale-up?.. also; Even if it is expensive.. it STILL might be ""worth it"".. IF it can be used to reduce the energy requirement by any form of ""cooling structure"".. fair enough, freezers/refrigerators  pops to mind, but perhaps more importantly (and where people WILL be willing to invest if it really helps a lot).. what about boxes for the medical service (Intended to keep organs fresh for transplant while they might be transported from one end of a country to another, just because it happens to be the ONLY.. ""match"").. ???..  I love the information you share.. it's informative.. but.. I kind of also want the.. ""renegade"" answers.. (perhaps a ""Veritasium after dark"" channel)..",4년 전,0,

It doesn’t remove Co2 from our global warming problem, but uses it and stores it in a different state that could be to benefit of our planet.

@gazzaboo8461,I saw the refraction in that square of aerogel @ 7:39 and now I REALLY want to see an aerogel lens in action. I didn't think aerogel refracted! Call me shocked 🤯 I'm curious to know if it bends light as well as glass with almost none of the mass. Does light split into a spectrum? Its optical properties could be very interesting to physics.  I have so many questions.. Is the surface dense enough for vapor deposition? Can it be molded? Are there semi-elastic aerogels? Can it be machined? Is the stuff hydrophobic? Does it have any taste? How fine and course can the structure be? Have you tried combining materials for composite aerogel? What are its filtration abilities? I'll stop now 😁,5년 전,6,

@bean2992,"Hello, everyone! This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by the various other ""longest texts ever"" on the internet, and I wanted to make my own. So here it is! This is going to be a WORLD RECORD! This is actually my third attempt at doing this. The first time, I didn't save it. The second time, the Neocities editor crashed. Now I'm writing this in Notepad, then copying it into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid crashing. It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty long. Not the longest, but still pretty long. I hope this one won't get lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen Titans Go episode called ""Waffles"" where the word ""Waffles"" is said a hundred-something times. It's pretty annoying. There's also a Teen Titans Go episode about Pig Latin. Don't know what Pig Latin is? It's a language where you take all the consonants before the first vowel, move them to the end, and add '-ay' to the end. If the word begins with a vowel, you just add '-way' to the end. For example, ""Waffles"" becomes ""Afflesway"". I've been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the fourth grade, so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time. I speak Pig Latin with my sister sometimes. It's pretty fun. I like speaking it in public so that everyone around us gets confused. That's never actually happened before, but if it ever does, 'twill be pretty funny. By the way, ""'twill"" is a word I invented recently, and it's a contraction of ""it will"". I really hope it gains popularity in the near future, because ""'twill"" is WAY more fun than saying ""it'll"". ""It'll"" is too boring. Nobody likes boring. This is nowhere near being the longest text ever, but eventually it will be! I might still be writing this a decade later, who knows? But right now, it's not very long. But I'll just keep writing until it is the longest! Have you ever heard the song ""Dau Dau"" by Awesome Scampis? It's an amazing song. Look it up on YouTube! I play that song all the time around my sister! It drives her crazy, and I love it. Another way I like driving my sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She hates the languages I make! The only language that we both speak besides English is Pig Latin. I think you already knew that. Whatever. I think I'm gonna go for now. Bye! Hi, I'm back now. I'm gonna contribute more to this soon-to-be giant wall of text. I just realised I have a giant stuffed frog on my bed. I forgot his name. I'm pretty sure it was something stupid though. I think it was ""FROG"" in Morse Code or something. Morse Code is cool. I know a bit of it, but I'm not very good at it. I'm also not very good at French. I barely know anything in French, and my pronunciation probably sucks. But I'm learning it, at least. I'm also learning Esperanto. It's this language that was made up by some guy a long time ago to be the ""universal language"". A lot of people speak it. I am such a language nerd. Half of this text is probably gonna be about languages. But hey, as long as it's long! Ha, get it? As LONG as it's LONG? I'm so funny, right? No, I'm not. I should probably get some sleep. Goodnight! Hello, I'm back again. I basically have only two interests nowadays: languages and furries. What? Oh, sorry, I thought you knew I was a furry. Haha, oops. Anyway, yeah, I'm a furry, but since I'm a young furry, I can't really do as much as I would like to do in the fandom. When I'm older, I would like to have a fursuit, go to furry conventions, all that stuff. But for now I can only dream of that. Sorry you had to deal with me talking about furries, but I'm honestly very desperate for this to be the longest text ever. Last night I was watching nothing but fursuit unboxings. I think I need help. This one time, me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party, but we didn't end up going because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises, and that she didn't wanna have to be a mom dragging her son through a crowd of furries. Both of those reasons were understandable. Okay, hopefully I won't have to talk about furries anymore. I don't care if you're a furry reading this right now, I just don't wanna have to torture everyone else. I will no longer say the F word throughout the rest of this entire text. Of course, by the F word, I mean the one that I just used six times, not the one that you're probably thinking of which I have not used throughout this entire text. I just realised that next year will be 2020. That's crazy! It just feels so futuristic! It's also crazy that the 2010s decade is almost over. That decade brought be a lot of memories. In fact, it brought be almost all of my memories. It'll be sad to see it go. I'm gonna work on a series of video lessons for Toki Pona. I'll expain what Toki Pona is after I come back. Bye! I'm back now, and I decided not to do it on Toki Pona, since many other people have done Toki Pona video lessons already. I decided to do it on Viesa, my English code. Now, I shall explain what Toki Pona is. Toki Pona is a minimalist constructed language that has only ~120 words! That means you can learn it very quickly. I reccomend you learn it! It's pretty fun and easy!",5년 전,2,

But the equivalent glass would also still be hot at the top. It is a decent insulator, but being thicker wont help much here. Even so, the aerogel never even got hot on top, only warm, despite being burned at least twice as long.

@fatbrothers4700,"I got a problem, you said “99.8% is air, if all air is removed from the gel, it is even less dense than air”, so it means that the remaining 0.2% of material is less dense than air. But if 0.2% is less dense than air +99.8% air, the overall density should be less dense than air in theory. In the video, we can see that the aerogel didn’t flow up when under heating, so this means the aerogel has a density larger than air. In other words, the 0.2% material must be denser than air, which contradicts to what you said.",5년 전,0,

@malaalzhan1405," @nikosaarinen3258  True, but in the same way paper is opaque but light can shine through. The thicker it gets the better, but there is probably far better materials.   So you are correct that it can be used to block radiation, but its just not as efficient for that compared to heat, were its unique structure blocks convection.",5년 전(수정됨),2,
@judeaustin8346, @nikosaarinen3258  I'm an intellectual too. The molecular atom of the aerogel basically bond forming a fractal and the dodecahedron shape allows light to penetrate it. The nitrocellular atomic particles are ubiquitous and scientists are currently finding ways to reduce it. There was astudy in 2023 stating how Ted Bundy and Osama Bin Ladin managed to work around it.

I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'. First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm this might be alright. But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air' I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air",5년 전,0,

@JoshuaYXie,It wouldn’t make sense that it’s the lightest solid in the world when it’s 99.8% air; Because air is mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide and they aren’t the lightest elements/compound in the world Hydrogen is. So the lightest/least dense object in the world would be the solid form of Hydrogen which requires really low temperatures to get to. You can say that the object is lower density than air but definitely not the lightest in the world,5년 전(수정됨),5,

@majorsmoke1758,"Graphene aerogels are exteremely fascinating because the graphene itself is bullet proof. More of a afterthought, couple aerogels with vacuum chambers and you have achieved 100% thermal insulation. IMO could only be achieved with graphene because it would not implode under vacuum because thermal saturation of graphene is redundantly small and the molecular structure increases rigidity with pressure. However, graphene is also conductive, more so than gold. So if you house the vacuum graphene aerogel box in its bimetal counterpart it would produce electrical current when thermal energy is applied (thermocouple principle). So yes such a invention would produce power at room temperature. If you used liquid hydrogen the application would be deadly on earth but useful in space. Within our galaxy of course where micro atmosphere and micro gravity exist... heat energy exists, but not overwhelming to the point of critical thermal change of the hydrogen molecules (saturation point).

@John-iu8cv,"Haha! Funny comment! Would you like instructions for pizza rolls? Here you go: Keep frozen. Cook thoroughly. For food safety and quality, follow cooking directions. Cook thoroughly to at least 160 degrees F. Keep frozen until ready to cook. Refrigerate leftovers. Oven & toaster oven: Do not leave toaster oven unattended while cooking product. 1. Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Arrange rolls 1 inch apart in single layer on cookie sheet or toaster oven tray. Place on middle oven rack. 2. Bake 9 to 10 minutes in oven (10 to 11 minutes in toaster oven) or until crispy and sizzling. 3. Let stand 2 minutes to complete cooking. Filling will be very hot. Be cautious on first bite. Microwave: Do not leave microwave unattended while cooking product. 1. Arrange 6 rolls in circle on microwavable plate. 2. Microwave on high 55 seconds. If not thoroughly cooked, rotate plate 1/4 turn microwave up to 10 seconds longer. 3. Let stand 2 minutes to complete cooking. Filling will be very hot. Be cautious on first bite. Directions developed for 1000-watt microwave ovens. Due to differences in microwave ovens, cooking times may vary.",5년 전,12,

Yet if it is 99% air then air being a gas would have a very large ""optical depth"" and so just a small volume wouldnt show thermal radiation of significant intensity. Normally only solid or liquids are dense enough to give out thermal radiation. Or is it the 1% solid substrate which is thermally radiating? If so , and the gel is transparent there would be thermal radiation up through the material even though conduction and convection are absent. Interesting and important futuristic science. If tge gel substrate could be metallic or give the slab a coating like a vacuum flask has it could insulate even better. Is this done?",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Unfortunately, the inventor was paranoid about his idea being stolen, and never let samples out of his sight, and died without telling anyone how it was made. That would have revolutionised travel, especially space-travel, building safety, nuclear bunkers, basically the world. It literally makes me angry that instead of giving it to humanity, even as a patented product, or for free as Tim Berners Lee did with the language that made the World Wide Web possible, he protected his invention and died before doing anything with it. He could have saved billions of lives from fires or motor accidents involving fire, made homes with almost perfect insulation, and impervious to fire and a level of nuclear shielding, made spaceships that would be at less risk of burning up in re-entry, but chose not to because he wanted to get rich, and then died, leaving no clue of the contents of this miraculous material.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

They said that Sony was going to make 🔊 speakers of of it. I thought they could make UFO the size of Texas and since its lighter than air, a vacuum cleaner motor could zip it around like lighting through the sky.🤔 Just know that when we have our first so called invasion from outer space, it's all our own technology and humans inside dressed up or  Man-made cross DNA mutants to look like aliens.

You probably think you instantly go to heaven or hell ro when you die, when that is not the case as scripture says you are sleeping until Jesus comes back.

@wizard1117,"I don’t know about the chemistry behind replacing the air with helium, but I might as well do the math.  Arogell has a density of 1900 g/m^3 and air has a density of 1200 g/m^3, since air makes up 99.8% of the mass of arogell, replacing it with helium nets you arogell with a density of 623.2 g/m^3  So let’s say that aladans carpet was 10cm thick, then (1200-623.2)/10 tells us how many grams the carpet could support per square meter of carpet.  Yielding 57.68 g/m^2.  Let’s say that Aladan’s mass was 80 kg, he would need 1,386.96 square meters to just barely hover in the air.  A football field is of 5,351.215104 m^2.  So alaidian would need to have a 4th of a football field area, 10cm thick to pull this off.",6년 전,0,

As for superconductors, not all materials are superconductors, many don't become superconductors until they're very close to absolute zero, and in any case, turning bulk semiconductors into superconductors willy-nilly would probably not be good.

Then you also need to be able to clean it from debris that might accumulate; adapt it for construction to the rest of the house.

@shelliesman7552,"Back in 1983-1984,  at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories,  I became aware of Aerogel,  as some Parts were Made of it,  Super Accurately.  I will just say that I found it Fantastic!!!!!  I’m Surprised that Nobody mentioned that as you held it,  and even moved your Fingers,  in the Least way..... that it Squeaked,  as the little Silica Spheres,  rubbed against each other!!!!  Maybe what we were told,  wasn’t True?  We were told,  that Aerogel Comprised of a Bunch of Silica Spheres,  all being held together,  which isn’t at all what was being shown here!  I felt very Privileged to have taken part in Working with this Material,  and to have been able to just hold it,  and to not worry about Damaging the Material that I was given to Hold!!!!!  Now I have heard about it possibly being used to Insulate Jackets.... but as Someone mentioned,  it would have to be much more Tough than it’s Present Day Form,  Which is far too easily Marred or Destroyed,  Completely!  However,  there are plenty of uses that it would be quiet useful in Serving right now,  like for the Beautiful Stainless Steel Vacuum Thermos’!!!!!  The Aerogel wouldn’t get very Beaten Up at all!  Another use could be for Dewers!!!!!",6년 전,0,

@Knobulon,"You can buy this stuff in blanket form which is used for insulating buildings. Its EXTREMELY expensive and has the thermal resistance similar to that of PIR insulation (foiled foam stuff). I worked it out that it would cost about £800 per m2 to achieve the insulation level that is required in British building standards. Although it is more flexible and can prevent cold spots easier. The cost is not worth the practicality of it yet. The average semi detached house would cost in the region of £90,000 worth of insulation to achieve building regs. In my opinion this stuff is better suited for historic buildings or retrofitting existing pre-war houses.",6년 전,0,

This part is optional as you can toast the slices aswell, although it will not have a smokey Flavour effect. The eggs I cooked until thick, then seasoned it with garlic, and put a plate over them, to keep them warm. Another optional feature is that you can sugar the bacon. This is delicious but definitely adds a few calories. It's a very interesting destinction having sweet bacon on a sandwich. Quite pleasant.

Density of air is about 0.001225 g/cm^3,  or ~0.0129 g displaced by the block. So the block is... 1.239 g, call it 1.24 g. Guess it wasn't that big of a difference!

The true density only takes into account the solid, the gas volume in the (micro) pores is neglected. Based on the true volume, the airgel shown has a density like SiO2 - sand.

@sydisemma," @max10hoop  Oh I think I see the problem here so I should clarify. Clears throat I didn't mean it as a bad thing, and it was a reference to his previous video where he talked about his content and the youtube algorithm. In said video he talked about that he would have to use GASP clickbaity thumbnails or captions to attract viewers since it's hard for every creator to keep up with the ever changing youtube algorithm.  And to further clarity, I didn't use the word clickbait, I wrote bait; as in an excellent thumbnail which was vague enough to make me interested without really spoiling anything about the content. I think the word here is suspense, commonly used in audio-visual entertainment.   TL;dr: clickbait isn't  necessarily a bad thing, it's a tool in the youtube biz to make waves and attract viewers, which the whole game is about.   I hope this clears things up and that we can all do like Smash Mouth is singing in 'Why can't we be friends'",6년 전,0,

Current use insulators are heavy compared to this but it doesnt matter for a building. If anything youd kinda want your building to be heavy, durable, easy to produce, maintain and fix. This material is NONE of those. This is mostly experimental technology and it hasnt really gone anywhere in over 80 years since it was invented.

@cogoid,"Large volume of aerogel has been produced commercially since 1940s. Monsanto had an entire factory making silica aerogel -- the product was sold by the barrel under the brand name _Santocel_. It was used in cryogenic equipment as thermal insulation, and in many, many other applications:   “Significant and unusual applications for Santocel, outside the flatting and insulation fields, were developed for civilian and military use. Among these were the Department of Agriculture’s approval of Santocel as a thickening agent for screwworm salves for sheep, and its use as a thickening agent in the jelly of the fiery Napalm bomb. Santocel also has become an essential ingredient in the manufacture of silicone rubber.”",6년 전,1,

The Vatican used their newly created Jesuits to publish Heliocentricism where a stationary, unmovable Earth, as stated in their Bible scriptures was replaced by a spinning, orbiting, ""Heavenly Sphere""; as taught in the major Universities, where Faith replaced Theory. From birth, you are indoctrinated to worship the man-made constructs of Heaven and Space.   Vatican Jesuits invent the following:     1543 - Jesuits invent Theory Heliocentricism    1582 - Heliocentric calendar (Pope Gregorian calendar)   1651 - Theory Mapping Moon   (Selenography)   1763 - Theory Atomic Energy   1809 - Theory Transmutation of Species   1923 - Theory Missing Link   (bones lost, molds prove find   1931 - Theory Big Bang (another ejaculation into the virgin source)   Our history and science has been little more then a fictional story over the last 2000 years. It began, with obedience from the indoctrinated masses these illiterates who paid tithing for Faith based religion and war. Today, the indoctrinated masses are educated idiots who pay tax on their labor for Theory based science and war.  This is the reality propagated across the face of the Earth.   You defend one of these fictional stories:      Theory - SPACE (Big Bang)       ATOM, remove Electron create Explosion       Evolution, requires you an APE like creature to consume flesh and blood       Faith - HEAVEN (Holy Spirit)       ADAM, remove Rib create Women       Creationism, the HE God gave you the clean and unclean animals for food",6년 전,0,

The bulk of the weight is supported by the gel, and shifting forces are absorbed by the steel and the whole thing has concrete as a kind of backbone.  I actually imagine something like that being used to replace the steel/aluminum skeletons found in blimps and the like, we could see a new blimp that, instead of using gas, uses hard vacuum with a really light skeleton keeping it afloat.",6년 전,0,

@OytheGreat,"Hi Derek,  I've been a sub for years, so clearly I love the bulk of your content. My way of keeping up with your content is by bookmarking your 'latest videos' and frequently checking it out. This is my old school way of basically programming your channel on the 1-9 slots of my YouTube TV so I can quickly access it whenever I'm up for it (rather than the 'bell' as I can't just start watching youtube at any given time). I realise I must be an outlier of all your viewers, but I sincerely hope the watchtime, clicks etc. won't become your main parameter to judge your success on.  Look at the community, the feedback and perhaps the rate of clicks-to-watchtime (if such parameters exist) to see whether your content is loved as much as it now deserves to be.  One suggestion I have is to elaborate on some topics in separate longer videos. I often love the topics you address, but typically am left with a bunch of questions that send me on an online quest to quench my thirst of this topic I didn't know I cared for before you showed me. Some of those 10-15 minutes could be the start of a longer mini-documentary if possible. Your videos about little known but fascinating materials such as the ultra-light airogel are great and I'd love to see more about the topics. If I'd see the 12 minute video and love it, I would definitely take my time later that day to watch what could be an hour of more in-depth content.  All the best, may you never burn out :)",6년 전,0,

Amazon and Walmart and federal and IRS funded companies go research on Google or MSN or duck duck go. Trillions of taxpayers money wasted on wars but not on potholes and your taxes well keeps going up and up for schools and gasoline taxes to fix roads  bridges lol. Just only 10% out of war money can make America great again but greedy Zionist bankers says war in mush needed. And these Zionist bankers are living within different countries than America.

I remember reading about aerogel some 20 years ago in a magazine, which was then dedicated to science (ABC mladých techniků a přírodovědců // ABC of young technicians and nature scientists - R.I.P.), when they showed even aerogel platform holding WW Beatle...  However they mentioned hydrofilic properties, thus degradation even through breath and a hardship to make it stable...  ...and then there was internet and I struggled to find any mention, except about 5 years back...  And now, your video about it... Wow...",6년 전,0,

@LOLSpellsingerXD,"Being crushed would be based on the pressure, not necessairly the density. E.g. various things would get crushed deep underwater, but would be fine just a couple meters deep, as there is far less pressure. If it was less dense than air(while being able to resist the air pressure), it would simply float upwards until it reaches an equilibrium. Helium balloons would be an example for that.",6년 전,0,

When I was in high school back in 2009, one of the group projects I had to do for my principles of engineering class was to make an emergency portable shelter that could easily be carried around or dropped to a group of people. We had to come up with a way to insulate from extreme temperatures either to keep heat in or keep heat out. After a couple hours of searching I discovered Aerogel. I was able to find a company that would send a free sample to you if you were working for a legit company who would use it. I put in my school's info and used my address as the shipping location and they actually sent me a sample. Easily the coolest material I have ever seen and got us an A on the project simply for using it. The whole class was blown away by it.",6년 전,0,

@nathan1027Y,"I feel Aerogels can change the building industry when they figure out how to make them bigger and cheaper.   Buildings can simply have double glazing with Aerogels in the middle replacing the traditional double glazing, which would give very good insulation to the building, even better than triple glazing. It could lower the cost for climate control inside the building and environment impact for inhibiting it. I can imagine building using this kind of window from the South Pole to Any Dessert.    Let's hope we could see Aerogels to put in wider use in the near future and thacks for the scientists who develop it.",6년 전,0,

Unless your monitor was tested and calibrated at the factory (which isn't extremely common) or you have tested and calibrated it yourself, it's probably your monitor because the yellow tint caused by the aerogel isn't very intense.

@SathvickSatish,ZikAnims what does engrish mean?,6년 전,0,
@DanteYewToob," @SathvickSatish  Zik is incorrect. Engrish is a joke term made up originally to describe poor grammar and spelling that results in funny language on Chinese and other foreign instructions or descriptions.  For instance I once bought a cheap Chinese roll up silicone keyboard and it had a funny line about not taking baths with it, and not to bake it and try to eat it.  It isn't about typos, it has to do with bad translations from other languages, originally Chinese, hence ""EngRish"" since often oriental accents have no distinct L or R sounds and tend to combine or swap them, so when a person with a thick Chinese accent says ""English"" it sounds like ""Eeng-Rish"", look up South Park City Wok for a funny but offensive example of what I mean.  Most kids lately have just twisted reddit and its memes into whatever they want to make a joke, but r/engrish wouldn't apply here because it was just a simple typo.  A prime example is this ""Animal Under! There is a bitten thing! Do not put the finger!"" lol that is a sign at a zoo warning not to stick your hand in the cage. That is actually Engrish lol remember... do not put the finger. Happy Engrish-ing.",6년 전,0,

I grew up around Mormons, they’re super cultish and it is very much like them to feel like they’re gonna earn some extra planets in the afterlife if they only promote things produced by Mormons. You can see the same thing on other social media platforms aimed at women, where the blogger will only promote Mormon brands and ideals (like being a stay-at-home mom with 10 kids).

@Featinwe,"Derek, aerogel is already in use in consumer products. You can buy aerogel insulation for industrial purposes but it's very expensive. There is a company that makes aerogel footwear insoles: https://www.amazon.com/Safety-insoles-Infused-Aerogel-Insoles/dp/B01MFA1KFW, another one makes actual mouintaineering boots with aerogel insulation, there were trials in use of aerogel insulation in jackets. I got interested in the topic several years ago as I like fast and light trekking and hiking and I was searching for home-made, out-of-the-box solutions - my intention was to make an aerogel sleeping pad. There are however huge problems with that material and in current state is used as an additive rather than a base material due to fragility (is is used in form of powder combined with fiber matrix).",6년 전,0,

@MrKingdavis13,I have a question that might lead to an interesting video if someone can figure out a way to do the experiment.  I have to set the question up so bear with me for a minute here.  Space has an almost perfect vacuum that is actually caused from the gravitational forces drawing the gasses toward the planet so it is actually quite different than a vacuum chamber here on the planet so this makes me wonder.  If you were in low Earth orbit in this near perfect vacuum and exit the space station with a closed container full of air could you pour the air out of the container and watch it fall toward the planet? Then could you hold the container so that the micro gravity will keep some of the air inside the container?  I am tempted to say no it will all get evaporated out but there is a chance that the gravity could keep the air inside just like it is possible to keep boiling water from instantly flashing into steam with a container and gravity. Hope that someone at the channel actually reads this and not just a bunch of people that would rather call someone an idiot than think about it.  Peace,6년 전,0,

The walls are no big deal: Glass Wool, Stone Wool or even Neoprene are widely available and are good enough for the project. But what do you do for the windows? Houses loose a massive amount of heat through the windows. The only real solution I found was Aerogel. Is there some research on this topic? That would be amazing!

@Keavon,"Everyone expects aerogel to be a soft, somewhat waxy/jelly-like substance. It's actually extremely hard and solid, perhaps best comparable to a block of chalk (but, of course, way lighter). Blocks of styrofoam, or even solid plastic, are bad comparisons because both are softer. It's very tough yet brittle and crumbly, so you can easily scratch it and if you pinch it, solid chunks will break off just like chalk. The material has no ""give"" like a jelly, any attempt to squeeze or deform it whatsoever will either do nothing or it will just break entirely. It blew my mind the first time I held some, and then again the second time I held some because it's just so unexpected from how the material looks.",6년 전(수정됨),9,

@SaraBearRawr0312,"I mean, its not impossible. Say that you were somehow able to make some sort of carbon based aerogel. Carbon by itself is a lower mass than air but tends to be much denser. The point of aerogel is that it is 99% empty space meaning that its density is super low. Most of our atmosphere is comprised of Nitrogen and Oxygen which are more massive than carbon so i guess a carbon-nitrogen based aerogel could be of a low enough mass and density that it could float in denser atmospheric densities such as sea level.",6년 전,0,
@iabervon,"He said, ""If you removed all the air from them, they would be less dense than air."" That's also true of a rubber balloon inflated with air, in both cases assuming that the solid stayed in place and air didn't rush back in. Aerogels don't float in air because they're not air-tight and wouldn't be strong enough to handle the pressure if there was an air-tight coating on them and there was a 1 atm pressure different across the coating.",6년 전,0,

@LazyFairCrapital," @benshinsky7624  It's not about fall speed but momentum. The gel is light so it imparts very little force on the table. It would be similar to dropping a paper ball onto a metal table. The ball may move quickly but not with enough force to hear the table that loud. Also, weight does affect fall speed because the aerodynamic force affects light objects more than heavy objects. Heavy objects have more momentum relative to light ones at the same speed so the same amount of force slows light objects down more than heavy ones.",6년 전,1,

@Ogg13tube," @checkoutthatthing  The aerogel form of any material is going to exhibit behavior similar to that depicted in the video.  sooo, creating an aerogel of nitro cellulose shooould present similar shift in performance as an insulation material.   Short of having some cellulose aerogel, and a test setup to assess the relative effusivity of 'bulk' nitrocellulose as compared to its aerogel form, I cannot prove it.  But we can make reliable conjecture based on many analogous experiences.   That, and having worked for an organic aerogel manufacturer for a few years, holding a patent and 4 published works in aerogels, I have some education in the topic.",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@checkoutthatthing," @Ogg13tube  Rad dude. So, other than looking just like the aforementioned aerogel, would any of the explosive properties remain of the nitro? I'm just a welder, forming metals are more my thing, however all mediums fascinate me.",6년 전,0,
@Ogg13tube," @checkoutthatthing  If you've heard of flour mill explosions, consider nanoscale fuel intimately mixed with air.  I don't know much about nitro cellulose, but if it is quite flammable, then the aerogel form may be spontaneously pyrophoric, as in, as soon as you bring it into ambient air, it will burn from the outside in.  Though I would mention that the appearance would likely be as opaque as traditional NC, just have a fuzzy foam like appearance at the surface.   Some aerogel materials can be made pyrotechnic.  I once made an iron oxide aerogel.  If you were to bake that in argon, you could reduce it to magnetite.   If you were to bake it in a reducing atmosphere, ..,  hello Iron Aerogel.  But you'd have to keep it under inert atmosphere because you know what iron likes to do in air over time.",6년 전,0,

You can get about twice the r-rating with the polystyrene as with traditional fiberglass of the same thickness.

Using a suitable diffusion model for the infrared radiation the temperature-dependent radiative conductivity λr(T) is determined.

@ReluctantPost,I bought a customized cargo trailer that is designed for climate extremes (Nord Euro). They use an aerogel-infused tape as a thermal break between the steel frame and the insulation which makes it hard for outside temperatures to bypass and short-circuit the insulation via the frame (a problem in nearly all RV's in severe temperatures). It's amazing stuff even in low-percentage commercial applications.,6년 전,0,

@abelgerli,I always loved aerogel and because it's the best insulator. In Germany the was a time where you could buy vacuum aerogel sheets to insulate historical buildings. So you need only a small thickness. The problem was that they lost there vacuum over time and when water got in the heat insulating properties degraded a lot. I look forward for a great series about aerogel,6년 전,0,

@MichaelLloyd,"Seeing supercritical CO2 was very interesting. The company that I work for takes CO2 extracted from the effluent of a large coal fired power plant (near a large city in TX) via a very high pressure pipeline . We deliver it to an old oil field and use it to ""push"" oil in the reservoir toward a ""water curtain"". There are extraction wells between the two injection points. It's called a CO2 flood. It was interesting to watch the pressure along the pipeline as the line pressure neared and surpassed the triple point of CO2. However there really wasn't a signature that I could see that indicates the phase change(s) that had to be occurring in the pipeline. While not 100% perfect, we put CO2 that has been released from coal back into the ground to enhance the recovery of oil. In spite of all of the uninformed ""stuff"" that's out there, we need oil. The computer that I'm typing on, the internet that this signal travels on, clothes, fertilizer, medicines... aka petrochemicals, rule our lives (kind of scary considering we BURN a lot of it). Don't believe me? Look around you, research the origin of everything you can touch... most likely it has a basis in hydrocarbons. Carbon and Hydrogen... that's what oil and natural gas are comprised of. CnH2n+2... C1H4 = Methane, C2H6= Ethane... and so on... Split an ethane molecule and you get a pair of methyl groups. Methyl groups can be used to make a lot of very important things.",6년 전,0,

I did the process cryogenically as the high pressure vessels were unavailable. I had proved in concept that rice hulls were a very feasible option cost/efficiency-wise. Best internship ever.,6년 전,0,
