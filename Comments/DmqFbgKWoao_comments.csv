@rebeng3r,"—KIM JUNG GI: Lejos de instaurarlo como un ilustrador-dibujante-bocetista (repetidor ejercitador) de una forma de expresar su trabajo cerrado en un contexto de fondo que exige una resolusión narrativa, su trabajo reposa en un público adolescente y juvenil que capta la superficialidad de su trabajo como ARTE, cuando solamente es un ejercicio de memorización y agregados visuales proporcionados por la constante repetición de fenotipos sin narrativa concreta ni aporte creativo (reproduce aspectos reales en entornos imaginativos que delatan aprisionamiento de conceptos y propuestas)... por eso, al ver sus inicios en el cómic, él sacó cuenta que CREAR historias frenaba su desmedido manierismo en el dibujo, pero además, decidió abandonar el cómic para elaborar dibujos al calor neuronal que imprime las emociones superficiales del registro (un boli, papel, tinta y a ver qué pasa). Durante décadas este ritmo agotó su corazón y determinó su deceso... EL LEGADO; DIBUJA Y REPITE HASTA LA MUERTE.   —MOEBIUS: Empezó a pie firme con enfocar su trabajo en la resolusión de historias; por lo que sus cómics y su estilo gráfico marcaron una escuela europea de cómo trabajar un BD por medio de adosar viñetas siguiendo la secuencia de las escenas pero sin ningún aprecio por la simbolización, el anamorfismo, la sinestesia de lo visual a lo narrativo; que son, elementos estéticos y conceptuales para entrar al ámbito del ARTE a secas.  Pero él siguió apuntalando sus esfuerzos por generar trabajos más gráficos que narrativos hasta desfasarse, encasillarse, anquilosarse y terminar en los engranajes del negocio editorial, que al igual que Kim Jung, determinó su recta final en la industria... EL LEGADO; CREA UN ESTÁNDAR PARA ABRIRTE UN NICHO EN EL MERCADO, AÚN SI TU TRABAJO ES UN EMBLEMA DEL EGO ELEVADO A FIGURA COMERCIAL.  Ambos representan una actividad que se enfoca en sorprender y atarantar con PIRUETAS, VELOCIDAD, DESTREZAS Y DEMÁS AFEITES DEL EJERCICIO DIBUJESCO al público juvenil e inmaduro que demanda sus contenidos superficiales como una CURIOSIDAD NECESARIA para suplir los vicios aberrantes de la tan afectada etapa juvenil por la cultura, que HARÁ DE TU EGO...

""no eres inteligente, ni perspicaz, ni mucho menos te da la cabeza para proponer ARTE; pues, dedícate a dibujar... a ver qué sale"".",2개월 전,0,

@FeedMeSalt,"you guys should have touched on the fact that MILLIONS of humans cannot visualize in their heads. its not something you can learn, you are born with it or you aren't.",3년 전,1,
@KevinE03, @FeedMeSalt  Visualizing is a skill not an ability. Go watch movies or read books(books work especially well).,2년 전,5,
@FeedMeSalt," @KevinE03  No actually it's literally something you are born able too do or not. And you cannot ever change that. Its a litteral disability.  Called aphantasia.  I read constantly as a child, never realized people actually SAW what they were thinking until highschool art class. Teacher called it bullshitt until I got tested.   If you can't do it even a little you never will. Example, I have never seen a purple elephant in my life, I cannot create that image.  I can't see a new Christmas tree in my head I can't picture the tree then one by one add decorations, only memories of old ones as information. Rarely I'll have a general idea of the image but it's not something you can change.  I know my old family tree was white with blue decor.  But again, I can't picture that in some 3d space.  My dreams are almost always memories as well, never have I ever dreamed a place I haven't been.  Anyway, many people litteraly don't have a minds eye.",2년 전(수정됨),2,
@pinnappel713," @FeedMeSalt  Hi! If you are still interested in this, a quick search will lead you to this video, by Proko (with a host that has aphantasia) that gives insight and advice on how to go about drawing without being able to visualize in their heads ( link: https://youtu.be/LWgXSxxEjgs ). The reason they did not touch on this is probably because people who cannot visualize mentally are the outliers not the norm, so it probably wasn't on their radar at the time of recording. There are materials on Youtube that people with this affliction can use for free.",2년 전,3,

@sharkshimi5451," @KevinE03  pretty sure they were referring to aphantasia, in which case yes visualizing is something people can't do. Please don't just write people off when they say they can't visualize, it's not the same as someone saying ""oh this person is so talented too bad I don't have the talent"".  Some people really cant.That doesn't mean they cannot draw, but they definitely can't follow the same advice kim jung gi gives of having a mini you go around the scene.",1년 전,0,
@dorjedriftwood2731,"Anyone who writes a how to draw like Kim Jung gi on a thumbnail or title is making clickbait. You might as well be writing how to fight like Mike Tyson. Sometimes the answer is, don’t because you are not them. Trying to draw like someone who literally can visualize all of the construction stably within his imagination is dumb. Learn to draw like someone who shows their work. Learn to draw like someone who uses proper techniques to create structural basis for the detail. He is the Art equivalent of a teleporter, he just pops stuf into reality with no construction or even a hint that he has plans for anything he does.   Might as well do a course on how to draw like AI because you’re going to get just as much evidence of process in the work. Meaning zero.",10개월 전,0,
@dorjedriftwood2731," @sharkshimi5451 yeah he obviously has a level of visualization skill that is completely unmatched, he is the pinnacle of genius when it comes to visualizing. Even people that can visualize often need to make some form of construction and gesture to keep it fresh in there memory and that visualization is typically not stable but like a dream tends to morph and change over time. Being able to hold a single image in your head is something Tibetan Monks dedicate their lives to learning it is not normal for anyone to just be able to see Imagination as clearly as life.",10개월 전,0,
@dorjedriftwood2731," @sharkshimi5451  although I do wonder are you saying that some people have zero visual memory. That is a trip to imagine not being able to recall how anything looks at all. It sounds like a real handicap, is there memory solely narrative? Do they recognize people or so they have to talk to or get to know someone over again before they properly recognize someone from there past,   I have a bad memory for faces myself even though I am really good at visualization compared to most, but I do forget how people look after a few years of not seeing them if I am not shown pictures. It sounds really hard to think here are people who lose track of visual memory instantaneously.",10개월 전,0,
@ProkoTV," @dorjedriftwood2731  We disagree. Learning how someone works from their own conversation is vitally important for adding hteir skills to your own. That's not clickbait. It's literally how learning art works.   We stand on the shoulders of the giants that came before us, adding their skills and knowledge to our own. He was a profoun talent but there are many out there applying his approach to their own work. Seeign someone do something amazing just means that it's possible.  Mike Tyson got beat at different stages of his career too. Beginning, prime and later. Respect the talented people who come before you but don't put them on a pedestal  and limit yourself by saying what they do will never be possible for you. We don't believe that for you and neither should you. Learn and grow!",10개월 전,3,
@sharkshimi5451, @dorjedriftwood2731  I'm of the mind that Gi probably had some sort of savant syndrome. His ability to think in 3D at such a young age is genuinely insane and astonishing to me. Obviously a lot of his visual skill/library comes from the sheer amount he draws but I don't think it should be overlooked that he was able to understand 3D space from such a young age. He truly was a generational artist,10개월 전,0,
@sharkshimi5451," @dorjedriftwood2731  Some people have zero ability to visualize whatsoever. It's quite interesting. I'm not really sure how it works either, but a common sort of way that people with aphantasia describe it is conceptualizing rather than visualizing. They know what a horse is, they know what it looks like they know what it does conceptually, but they're unable to visualize it. They know what makes it up, but they can't see it. I myself am not too familiar still with the exact definition of visualization and mind's eye, etc, but it is a really interesting phenomenon.",10개월 전,0,
@obscuriguity4365," @sharkshimi5451  ""i think he was a savant"" followed by ""obviously he drew a lot"" like dude, he drew a lot. like, A LOT. and all the time he was drawing he was observing and pushing himself, experimenting and applying what he's learned. He's said he was drawing 12 hours a day in highschool, and when he was in college he would still spend most of his time drawing. This isnt a savant, this is a guy who absolutely loves drawing, spends most of their time drawing, and is constantly pushing himself to improve for thousands of hours a year for decades. obviously they'd get really good.",6개월 전(수정됨),0,

@ProkoTV,"​ @jafarr11 You can already look around and find other things that have been factory produced for examples. We don't have to wait.  Even though Wonderbread is on shelves, rustic handmade bread still exists and people pay a premium for it to exist that way. It's the bread you get when you want to impress somebody or that people learn to make themselves as a homemaking art.  Shooting photos or movies on film still exists in an age of digital cameras because people acknowledge is has character that they want when they have the means to pay for it.  And portrait art still exists even though cameras exist.   The hand of the creator is desired when the means exists to pay for it. It adds something that can't be algorithmically supplemented. AI will never really replace human creation. But people looking for a shortcut have always settled for something trashy. This is just another example of that.  Kin Jung Gi won't ever be ""replaced"" by a machine or even another person who does something similar to what he did. His voice was his own and that's what makes it special. A new artists will go and make something similar that will do it to the next level of proficiency, but that won't be AI. And they'll inject their own inspiration, story, and originality.",2주 전,1,

People cannot learn his ""technique"" because it's all done organically.  No guide lines, no perspective vanishing points, no breaking down figures to building blocks or anything like that.

@HiHi-oc3gh,"This comment is so funny. If you’ve seen some of his lectures you can see that he knows what he is talking about. He is a master in perspective not just because of his great visualization skills but also because he understands perspective on a technical level. “No guidelines, no perspective vanishing points, no breaking down figures” just because you don’t see it doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. When Peter Han used to have dinners with Kim Jung Gi and the other SuperAni members, Jung Gi would encourage Peter Han to draw more wireframes, understand form, etc. You don’t see it because they are doing it in their head, not because they have a talent and it cannot be learned but because they have spent years honing their craft to the point where it is natural and they don’t need guidelines anymore",8개월 전,2,

As time went on I became better and started buildinng an arsenal of techniques, shapes, scribbles, shortcuts, and patterns. I later learned what I was doing was a combination the Loomis method, contour drawing, and scribbling in guide lines. Playing...just drawing for the sake of drawing.

Blink as much as you can like youre using a shudder camera to take pictures. After wards try to recall as many details as possible before looking again. Its also a neat technique to teach situational awareness. Just keep tryng to see how many details you get right befor having to look back. As aa drawing exercise its great because you sometimes add in details that werent there leading to a whole new scene",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Started with pens in elementary & paint pens, Sharpies plus I always liked doing art on clothing,shoes, hell about anything that seemed cool or u know a different kinda challenge. Don't really draw much anymore & what skills I did have well obviously suffered. This guy just blew my mind with his knowledge on so many amazing angles & all the Fucking Crazy Great References on a lot of great things in the world around us & himself.

I couldn't be more happy, I told all my friend ""come ! Come to the gallery see his work, it might a once in a lifetime opportunity !"" If only we knew, he was there standing in front of all of us full of joy sympathy and sharing drawing advices and good jokes, an less than 72 hours later he was gone, still unable to realize. But what I can say today is an gigantic thank you to this awesome master that gave us (and will) so much inspiration, and on a more personal note, surely one of the most precious objects in my artist life, a drawing in his book that I will keep forever.

@FeedMeSalt," @KevinE03  No actually it's literally something you are born able too do or not. And you cannot ever change that. Its a litteral disability.  Called aphantasia.  I read constantly as a child, never realized people actually SAW what they were thinking until highschool art class. Teacher called it bullshitt until I got tested.   If you can't do it even a little you never will. Example, I have never seen a purple elephant in my life, I cannot create that image.  I can't see a new Christmas tree in my head I can't picture the tree then one by one add decorations, only memories of old ones as information. Rarely I'll have a general idea of the image but it's not something you can change.  I know my old family tree was white with blue decor.  But again, I can't picture that in some 3d space.  My dreams are almost always memories as well, never have I ever dreamed a place I haven't been.  Anyway, many people litteraly don't have a minds eye.",2년 전(수정됨),2,

The reason they did not touch on this is probably because people who cannot visualize mentally are the outliers not the norm, so it probably wasn't on their radar at the time of recording.

Sometimes the answer is, don’t because you are not them. Trying to draw like someone who literally can visualize all of the construction stably within his imagination is dumb. Learn to draw like someone who shows their work. Learn to draw like someone who uses proper techniques to create structural basis for the detail. He is the Art equivalent of a teleporter, he just pops stuf into reality with no construction or even a hint that he has plans for anything he does.

@dorjedriftwood2731," @sharkshimi5451 yeah he obviously has a level of visualization skill that is completely unmatched, he is the pinnacle of genius when it comes to visualizing. Even people that can visualize often need to make some form of construction and gesture to keep it fresh in there memory and that visualization is typically not stable but like a dream tends to morph and change over time. Being able to hold a single image in your head is something Tibetan Monks dedicate their lives to learning it is not normal for anyone to just be able to see Imagination as clearly as life.",10개월 전,0,
@dorjedriftwood2731," @sharkshimi5451  although I do wonder are you saying that some people have zero visual memory. That is a trip to imagine not being able to recall how anything looks at all. It sounds like a real handicap, is there memory solely narrative? Do they recognize people or so they have to talk to or get to know someone over again before they properly recognize someone from there past,   I have a bad memory for faces myself even though I am really good at visualization compared to most, but I do forget how people look after a few years of not seeing them if I am not shown pictures. It sounds really hard to think here are people who lose track of visual memory instantaneously.",10개월 전,0,

He was a profoun talent but there are many out there applying his approach to their own work. Seeign someone do something amazing just means that it's possible.  Mike Tyson got beat at different stages of his career too. Beginning, prime and later.

@sharkshimi5451," @dorjedriftwood2731  Some people have zero ability to visualize whatsoever. It's quite interesting. I'm not really sure how it works either, but a common sort of way that people with aphantasia describe it is conceptualizing rather than visualizing. They know what a horse is, they know what it looks like they know what it does conceptually, but they're unable to visualize it. They know what makes it up, but they can't see it. I myself am not too familiar still with the exact definition of visualization and mind's eye, etc, but it is a really interesting phenomenon.",10개월 전,0,

@rlzerocy," @salty_3k506  I feel like there's a difference between hyperphantasia and like, understanding how to draw.   Hyperphantasia is the ability to create very vivid mental images, I for example can only create faint images, it mostly looks black  I could be wrong but im pretty sure the hyperphantasia im talking about has deeper links with the brain's structure and not just something you can learn.  If I want to draw a car, I have to look at a car irl or an image of one, or at least understand what pieces are placed next to which, or sketch structures beneath it.  the way he describe's the ""mini-me's"". concept sounds like he has a distinct ability to create scenes in his head, that he can explore, which sounds like something akin to hyperphantasia.  but yeah, regardless, the practice is really what ties it together",3년 전,0,
@salty_3k506," @rlzerocy  Yeah, but this ability to memorize, visualize and think in 3D space is something that can be learned.   Every time I look at reference for a car, I remember its structure better afterwards. So naturally, the better I understand the car's struture and look at references, the better and more accurately I can draw it.   I'm sure that you could imagine your room and ""move around"" in it in your head because you have seen it a thousand times. But not with other objects because you don't know them as well.    Also, you don't need to visualize things perfectly in order to draw well. Almost no one can visualize things ""well"", mostly it's just a mash of ideas that has no concrete visualization. And here's a video on aphantasia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWgXSxxEjgs",3년 전,0,
@rlzerocy," @salty_3k506  yeah, definitely the 3d structure thing. The more you do it or the more rules/guideline you're aware of (perspective, volume, contours, etc. idk) you kinda get a feel for where the next lines or shapes, have to be, or at least know if something about the structure feels off, and why.  The way he describes the mini me's thing is just fascinating to me, I suppose If you've seen a certain place or thing before a multitude of times, youd have enough memories to simulate movement around it.  doing it with made up hypothetical objects sounds amazing and bizzare.   But I guess as you said, you can kinda mish mash things you have in your visual vocabulary and I guess make new hybrid objects or landscapes or something from those images and the base shapes that make them up.   anyway you know what, bottomline is, that's some cool ass shit.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

@aaronbazil,"When I was around 6 years old, I had a friend, who was my best friend at the time, named Marlon.   Him and I were best friends because we both loved drawing. His style was more on the anime style, and my forte was this sort of 'realistic' type. Family members would come over and my parents would brag how great I could draw someone pretty well for such a small age. And so people would naturally sit for me and I'd draw them. Afterwards, they would remark how precocious my abilities were. Looking back, I don't know if they were being nice to a kid or not because I barely remember my drawing ability at the time to accurately judge it now.  But I do recall this one exercise Marlon and I would both do. This little game, if you will.   We'd both challenge each other to look at an image or character for a few minutes, and then put the image away, and try to draw from memory that image as accurately as possible. And whoever got it the most would win for that particular character or image. We'd do it over and over. During classes, during lunches etc. Then We'd even watch cartoons at home and come to school and challenged each other to draw some of the characters we saw in a new episode, from memory.   Needless to say, we were pretty known throughout school as the two best artists in our school.   I never developed my drawing abilities beyond the age of 8 or 9. Lots of things happened around those times. I moved houses, and consequently, schools every 2 years because of either eviction, or parents getting new work.   I picked up different habits and hobbies. I could dance, or mimic entire scenes of cartoons so i could recite and perform them back at school to my new friends. Especially around the beginning of the South Park days, etc that led to theatre and other stuff.   I still wonder about my friend Marlon today. And in the last 3 years, I've been slowly getting back into drawing, and I can't help but imagine what it would have been like had I fostered that drawing ability until today. I would have been able to have the same or similar skill to draw anything from memory.   There's still hope, but there are so many other variables involved now as 30 year old man. But boy do I always wonder.",3년 전,4,

@mannybruce8950," @_Nyxus_  , I don't think it is mental illness but instead an indoctrination of the educational  grading system that all of us are subjected to . The grading system  forces us to see things that are relative to us being an  A , B , C , D , or F  as to how we measure up . The grading system that are instill in us from childhood makes us instinctively compare ourselves to others . When schools haves art contest and there are career art critics  these things only reinforces  the behavior to criticize or praise each others  work . It's the judgment of art work that pushes a person to progress their skills but the negative effect is that it can also discourage a person as well .  It would be nice that everyone can be considered an accomplished artist based on effort , but then it wouldn't be very interesting to read comic books or visit art museums where as  the art is of stick figures .",4년 전,17,
@_Nyxus_," @mannybruce8950  I do mostly agree with that, but my brain legit makes it hard to do anything most days, let alone fight my critical demons. Depression is a horrid thing and a real thing, so is ADHD. The inability to focus makes it very difficult to learn and comprehend. Aphantasia, even though there are artists with it, also makes it difficult to understand how others ""see."" There's a LOT that can contribute to many ways someone thinks. But that doesn't invalidate someone's struggles and mental illness and how it affects their artistic growth.  But I'm serious when I say I agree with your statement as well. The grading system sucks so bad, especially when the higher grades students get praised constantly while those struggling get yelled at or they're not shown proper care. Imagine if we were all free to learn without the worry for being better than others or ""don't be like that one kid making bad grades"" kinda comments.

You should certainly strive to be the best you can be, of course, and I do the same. But the sheer ability to draw anything, especially mechanical things without a reference, just off of the top of his head takes a special kind of brain – even if he says he doesn't have photographic memory. You can certainly learn how to draw as good as him, but that kind of off hand knowledge of images and how things look? I really don't think that can be taught. He is simply built different.   Now, I'm not saying that he shouldn't inspire you, or that you can't aspire to be like him, but the way he thinks is different than most people.",3년 전,7,

And I personally think that for me to reach this level, it'll take my whole life and dedication. I like art, yes, but I don't like just the drawing aspect, there are other things I want to use art for. So no, I can't be him, slight mope, but whatever, I'll focus on other aspects.

@CrniWuk," @blackbird8837  Well yes ... and no. When you take drawing classes you will see a lot of different approaches by different people. Some draw the outlines and then fill in the details. Other people start from the inside and work to the outside. But eventually if you draw/paint really a lot? It becomes like a second nature to you. As I have learned over the years the trick is to not work around your mistakes, so to speak, but to make it a part of your art. It is an illustration not a potrait or like a picture where it has to be as precise and close to the real thing as possible. Gi is impressive. But the method can be adobted by pretty much anyone. Just as how everyone can learn to play (good) soccer. But of course not everyone will be a world class champion. But you can still learn it and be decent with it. When I used to draw like every day, at some point certain positions, figures, etc. become like a second nature to you. Muscle memory if you so will. Of course not everyone can be exactly like Gi. But I would say a lot of people, if they are dedicated, can get somewhat close to the efficiency and quality. Takes only 15+ years of experience I assume XD.",4년 전,19,
@blackbird8837," @CrniWuk  No. He literally says that he uses parts of the drawing itself as guidelines, as @Georgia Rose already pointed out and on which I elaborated.  But yes, working your muscle memory will lead to accessing those skills more easily and with better outcome.",4년 전,20,

@sarroumarbeu6810,It's with no reference because his memory is so good that he remembers the proportions in his mind,3년 전,0,
@rr.studios," @sarroumarbeu6810  Kim Jung Gi said in an interview he doesn't need references because he'd already used so many references in his younger years persistently that he didn't need that anymore.   What I understand to be the inference behind this is that he'd subconsciously studied the rules behind the reality he was about to lay with his pen on paper and you don't need perfect memory to capture a scene nearly perfectly if you've seen very similar scenes (or small elements of this scene) previously quite frequently.   I think this is the power of delegating the strenuous task of computing an enormous amount of information to the subconscious by making it a habit. When you do something routinely with an expected reward/punishment, your brain adapts to it very quickly making it a habit.  For example, you get a dog from a shelter today and want to train it to recognize a bell ring as lunch time so for a couple of days, whenever you ring a bell, you give the dog lunch. Eventually, it reaches the point where the dog practically salivate when you only ring the bell (eventually it salivates when it's lunch time). In the same way, you could program your own brain to skip the difficult and time consuming task of intensely observing each element of an observed source eventually, whenever you draw, your subconscious takes up the brunt of the work, remembering the important details...blah blah blah I'm getting tired typing this damned YouTube comment at 2am im going to sleep now sorry for any grammatical errors but not rly sorry ;)",3년 전,1,

@TomeRodrigo,"You can't learn to draw like this guy simply because you are not a savant and your brain is not unlocked for you in your subconscious. Some people are born with (or will they acquire from brain damage in a later age) access to the subconscious part of the brain which is meant to be for real-time processing of reality, billions of countings in a matter of a second. Therefore they are able to use this part of subconscious processing power to draw, imagine, see the world in fractals, do great math, etc, to observe something in their mind which should be originally hidden from them. To learn consciously to draw like this would take you maybe 1000 years and you would need to memorize zillions of patterns from all angles and your drawing would be still memorized drawing. He paints and draws from his subconscious mind, he can't really explain why is that happening for him and you can't ever learn it. Only if you maybe had brain damage and your brain would make you access that part of the subconscious. It is not a talent and has nothing to do with talent. This guy only shows how miraculous our brain is and what it does for us in the background of our conscious mind so we can walk, speak, see things, keep balance, and millions of other things without a conscious understanding of how that happens for us. The same thing with his drawing. We can only observe it as a miracle of a lucky man.",5년 전,0,

@999a0s,"yep, you get it.  the thing people tend to miss with KJG is focusing on the nuts and bolts of ""how to draw"".  it's mostly not about how to draw...it's about the skill underneath drawing, and that's how to see - with and without your eyes.  this type of drawing is a (imo) spiritual practice of strengthening your focus, attention, and visual imagination, and you don't get there without a true love and interest in observing and visualizing everything you can imagine.  the funny thing is, ""daydreaming"" like this is a skill we all possess to perfection as kids, but we lose it as we grow up.  when he's talking about ""floating the image in your mind"", that's the type of stuff that requires daily practice.  at first, it's hard to even hold a simple, un-detailed object in your mind's eye, without it popping in and out of existence - it's less of an image, and more of a concept.  but as you train to ""see"" more and more, you can go from that fuzzy conceptual image to ""walking around"" a head or car in your mind, to placing yourself inside a cohesive, detailed scene, and observing it in all its detail.  this is the work that's going to get you where KJG is.  the drawing itself is a means to an end, but the true meat of the practice is strengthening that ability to imagine and understand form.  if you're drawing without really focusing on the form and substance of what you're drawing, it's not gonna help you.  thankfully, it's something you can practice all day, everyday, in any kind of situation, whether you have a pencil in your hand or not.",3년 전,14,

Beginners draw references based on what they're looking at directly. Professionals look at the reference and manipulate everything they want to about it to get what they want. A beginner sees a reference of a dragon and draws exactly what they see. A professional sees that picture and then draws the dragon from a completely different angle only using the basics of dragon anatomy to complete their drawing (if that's what they're going for). Which is quite impressive and scary to even approach imo. I certainly couldn't do that with confidence and I've been drawing for at least 2 hours a day since I was 15 years old.

Teachers are there to help you learn the skill of observation, which will help you as an artist no matter your style.   The process of copying images by drawing them solidifies those images in your mind, and the more you draw those images and new images, the more your drawing will change. If you don't draw new things, then you're stuck drawing the same old things.   What you consume by drawing is forwarded to your creative side when you start producing. For example, by pushing myself to draw different trees I now have a larger visual library to reference when I want to create a new drawing. So, it's like visual muscle memory -- you just gotta DO it.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@corujariousa,Just accept that Kim Jung Gi is a genius at his craft. He has the ability to create vivid and detailed images on his mind and project them on the paper. He just then starts covering the lines with ink. You find some great masters of sculpture have described a similar capability. They see the figure in front of them and just remove the excess stone surrounding it. One can get better at anything by practice but such talent is far more than just technique. The human mind has great capabilities. It is a pity our education system (everywhere) is so outdated and limited. Thanks for the video.,5년 전(수정됨),1,

I've drawn some pretty nice stuff using a blue papermate pen and a lined paper notebook, which I took a photo of and used a black and white filter on. Looks like some beautiful linework despite the limitations. If it weren't on lined paper, some of them would be among my best drawings.  Papermate handwriting pens are actually pretty good as far as stationary goes. They don't get smudged by erasers and have smooth lines. I'd recommend them if you want to do linework on a non-existent budget.",4년 전,0,

For me it would be a dream come true to somehow make a living off of art. But I know the likelihood of that happening is small, even if I become skilled.

Pen and ink, it's permanent and harder to fix while pencil can be erase easily.   At present time, there are fewer and fewer people that have hands on skills on artistry. Most people have joined the digital era like Photoshop. The bad thing is that these folks can't even do a pencil portrait.

In other words make the learning process itself fun and only look something up if you really can't wrap your head around it.,5년 전(수정됨),0,

@design-sketching,Proko thanks so much for creating and sharing this video! Hearing Kim Jung Gi talk about the importance of internalising all aspects of sketching (perspective/linework/shading/etc) and building an internal library resonates deeply with my own experience and the way I teach my students to do Design Sketching. It also greatly demistifies the 'magic' behind his skill and uncovers a path or journey that anyone can take to develop mastery in sketching (if you have enough stamina to stick with it long enough).

@volatilesky,"One critique is I'm not so sure that when he says ""I make mini me's and put them into the scene"" he is being metaphorical. He later references visualising objects in your mind and rotating it on any orientation. Unless he's said otherwise, I think he actually means that he is imagining the entire scene from other perspectives. I'm nowhere near his level, but I do visualise objects in a similar way - working with steel you often have dozens of parts that come together, starting out as flat cutouts, that them very bent, and then welded or bolted together, and I visualise the entire exploded diagram in my head.  I only wish I were as good at figure drawing, so I guess I should just start drawing more.",5년 전,0,

@Zaire82,"Animation is a completely different kind of art. An animator's mind should be a able to comprehend perspective and summarise the details of what they're making into a few dozen lines, easily. They can't spend an hour on every frame, that'd take months, and you'd only get an animation a little over a minute long.",5년 전,17,
@Zaire82," BronzeGod  Animators don't need to understand the same principles as drawers do.   Their objective is to churn out as many frames per second while still making them look fluid and attractive. If there's motion, you have to blend the frames together to make it smooth, which can result in some janky looking drawings. (Naruto Shippuden is famous for janky smears) Normal drawing needs you to understand exactly what you're wanting to draw and how to best convey it in a single motionless picture. If there's motion, you'd have to imply it through composition and perspective, etc. Doing that in the same way for an animation would ruin that animation.  Motion is the most obvious difference, but not the only one. Smears are highly unintuitive for normal artists, and are the hardest part of making a good animation. They're an art form in themselves, because of how weird they are.   I get the impression you have no personal experience on this matter, and are talking solely from observation. I am saying that's how it seems, by the way. Whether it's true or not doesn't matter.",5년 전,1,

@AnastasiaR,"What he says at 15:12 is KEY for anyone wanting to draw or paint more loosely and fluidly. He basically says that he used to draw very tightly and meticulously. Repetition of this technique is what led to an intuitive understanding of form until he no longer needed to have an iron grip on what he was drawing. The understanding was inside him so he could draw the lines as quickly and fluidly as he felt like and it would still turn out looking correct. If you feel like you draw too “tight” just keep practicing over and over and really try to internalize the form, without thinking too much about the tightness or looseness. Before you can draw loosely you draw tightly, even a savant like Kim Jung Gi.",5년 전,5,

@SpeedrunningExplainedd," @omdano6432  youre dead wrong.  Style is a huge way to determine the skill level of an artist even if you dont like it. A simplified style can tell you that an artist is just as skilled as one who does highly detailed anatomical drawings.   How? Well style doesnt pop out of nowhere for the artist. Style comes with tons of studying other pros and simplifying what you see. Although an ordinary person might think that a cartoon/chibi artist is worse than an industry-level illustrator just because the style is ""simpler"". for example, the arms might not have as much detail, but truth is that a lot of that is concious decision making from the chibi artist.  So yes, you can tell a persons skill level by just their style. There ARE good and bad art styles and a lot of it comes down to how the artist simplifies the forms from real life and how well the features on the drawing work together to make a coherent style for the viewer to experience.",5년 전,2,

@NeoOnyx,"Visualizing a scene in your mind with every detail in it in a certain perspective (let alone in a fish-eye perspective) is more about how your brain works than it is about practicing. Some people have a gift for math, others for visualizing images. Sure, you can practice it until you're blue in the face and you might get better than the majority, but reaching Kim Jung Gi's level is next to impossible for mere mortals like us. When he explains how he draws the fish-eye images, he says he draws what he sees on the left, then in the middle, then on the right, but that would not give you a fish-eye perspective. When a 'normal' person would draw it, the scene would be all horizontal, not curved as looking through a fish-eye lens. There's something in his brain that automatically converts the lines, shapes and perspective into fish-eye, if that's what he wants to draw. For me, watching this video, is as depressing as it is mind blowing because I'm awe-struck but at the same time know that I will never reach his brilliance. Heck, I'd be happy if I could just find my own personal style and not try to measure myself with geniuses like Kim Jung Gi, he's just amazing.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@Pupsleep," @usernamesmatter  that's how you become trending for a short period of time. Following trends is very limited in how long it gives you the spotlight. You have to have a voice for yourself that has been built up and nurtured for years, people will pick up on it and connect with you and stay with you.

His style and work came through him having genuine interest and vision that he loved and nurtured through years and years and years of work.

If you're doing something just to become famous, rich, or popular on instagram you will always be discouraged and afraid because you're relying on the opinions of others for your self-worth. Reading the comments on this video, I have a feeling a lot of people here watching don't actually like making art because they're quickly discouraged by the mere existence of someone like Kim Jung Gi.

Watching a MASTER like Gi with immeasurable amounts of talent and skill just kinda makes you feel small in comparison, and I think I speak for most people when I say that his skill makes people insecure about whether they'll ever be good enough to achieve their goal ESPECIALLY in the art world  Be it a comic, manga, graphic novel, painting  etc",5년 전,0,

Again: if you're doing something out of love, opinions or the existence of highly talented people shouldn't stop you. I forgot where I read it, but the question basically was ""if you were the last person on earth, would you still make art?"" if the answer is no or you're unsure, then you're not actually in love with it. You're just in love with the idea of being an artist. I feel this is a major problem nowadays because of instagram, patreon, youtube, etc. People just want to make quick money (all that ""side hustle"" bullshit) and become internet famous.

And like... should people not care about quality? Isn't the point to improve, get a job in whatever industry based on your quality to communicate, and the quality of your work? Do people who review portfolios look into your mind to see if you were blessed by Vincent Van Gogh or Sargent? Doesn't fulfillment often come when one makes a breakthrough in their work and notice improvement? Why does one have to become a second Gi in order to be valid, my dude? Don't talk about ""facts"" when the fact of the matter is that you shouldn't even be trying to compare yourself to Gi, because clearly it's halting your creative process. Carve out your craft and continue to learn and discover more about it. Get that mileage in. Write more, draw more, or paint more idfk. Stop trying to get neck to neck with Kim as if it's some kind of competition or race against time. If you wanna tell your story and you don't think it's good enough yet, keep writing, revising, and honing your craft? Learn more about graphic novel authors and find out more about their processes and learn from them. Your talk of ""talent being an engine"" is nonsense. It's motivation and creative inspo that's the engine, and the skill is what allows that engine to run better, letting you realize your visions better as you not only gain more fuel through time and mileage, but higher quality fuel too.

@RadicalVelvet," @popesuavecitoxii2379  W-what? I mean Kim himself mentions the kind of hollowing effect searching for notoriety with your art instead of self-fulfillment so idk where that came from? Also I assumed I wasn't strawmanning considering your pal Filip here seems like he's just ready to give up because he constantly compares his skills to a beloved master of the craft. Which like, I don't blame people for being jealous of his skill, but I don't get why his skill necessitates people to have such a discouraging mood about their own work to the extent you have other creators having an existential crisis over it? If anything it should be used to motivate you more but maybe I'm just one of those ""special few"" who doesn't care that much, and is just too naive to see the true, gifted, and blessed artistic supremacy of thou elder majesty, Kim Jung Gi. I apologize for exaggerating, but this went from me being saddened by people feeling beat down to being annoyed by people who seemingly want to stay beaten down, and using someone else's skills as a reason to say ""screw it, I can never be this guy"" when the initial point I made in the first comment was to not.. try... to be the dude, and instead become the best YOU. Sure, people can have certain aptitudes for it, larger than others, but that isn't an immediate indicator of someone being a god of something just because. Also, Kim Jung Gi is literally one person. Y'all really think all these beloved artists you love so much were just born with a natural aptitude for art? I guarantee you that quite a few of them either made a career change, started later in life, or possibly just wasn't ""that kid who drew really nice in elementary school."" Lot of these people genuinely worked their asses off.

@popesuavecitoxii2379,"​ @RadicalVelvet  I see what you're saying and agree for the most part.  The reason I hopped into this thread at all is that some people here were saying that ""talent isn't real"". That's a lie and (IMO) is just as bad as saying ""You should never do _ unless you have talent.""   I too also wish more creators would take a step back and really think about what how they want to make their own careers instead of trying to imitate others. This is a part of my rants about why a lot of so-called artists today care more about their personal image than actually making art.",5년 전,1,

@nine-vi7rw, @RadicalVelvet  No one told you to give up. Jesus Christ. We're just saying that saying shit like talent doesn't exist when there's clear scientific evidence that it does is bullshit and delusional. That's all.,5년 전,1,
@RadicalVelvet," @nine-vi7rw  I mean according to you and Filip's logic, if you aren't ""born talented"" then you should just give up. I was exaggerating obviously, but I never said that some artists do or don't have better aptitudes for the craft than others. My point is that the search and development of skill doesn't require some mystical gift or talent, and I grow irritated with people who say that without talent comparable to ""geniuses"" Then there's no point of doing anything. People treat this like some people are spiritually born inferior when it comes to the arts when that isn't the case like... at all.   ""Oh you will never become one of the greats without prestigious talent birthed as you came!"" ""Oh the madness! Is there any point to you honing your craft if you don't have a god given aptitude for it? "" ""You will never be as good as the almighty Kim Jung Gi. Tis' time to give up, dear boy."" ""You are inferior. A mess, a joke. A nothing, without god given talent. Your natural given talent is where your craft is born. Your skills are only accessories.""   I'm sick of it.     This idea that there'd be no such thing as ""greatness"" if people with particular aptitudes didn't exist is absurd, because it reinforces this idea that natural gifted talent supersedes all forms of skill no matter the dedication which is nonsense, and that searching for knowledge to improve is worthless if you don't have a special aptitude. You and other people in this thread cite specific and well-named individuals but fail to see others who are also very well-known for their craft that... probably weren't born ""geniuses"" as much as they developed into one... because they honed their craft and dedicated their entire lives to it. I never once even implied that people are always going to be born on the same exact footing considering there being a multitude of factors at play, because yeah, maybe there is a 7 year old boy who can recreate the Mona Lisa with cheap crayola paint, with their eyes closed, while playing Chopin with their other hand, however your dedication to the craft your passionate about plays in tandem with whatever your aptitudes are, and some people have different strengths within their craft, as well as outside it. Do you think Glenn Vilppu, Steve Huston, Stan Prokopenko, all your fav comic book artists,  animators, etc, were all just born naturally gifted for their craft? I guarantee you that isn't the case, and ""talent"" as I've made clear, isn't an immediate indicator of someone becoming ""great"" or ""a genius"". A person with no initial ""talent"" can develop their own way and become ""geniuses"" independent of whatever you deem ""talent"". That's the point I'm trying to make here, but everyone is seemingly making this out to be the upmost important variable when it comes to becoming ""one of the greats"" and I'm sorry, but there's just too many instances where that isn't the case for me to take that philosophy seriously. This whole ""Oh nobody respects hard work, they only care about talent"" crap is absolute bonkers to me.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

He had the disadvantage of not having the best resources growing up but he still learned from trial and error. The most important thing he had was an interest and drive to improve and make art. If you don't want to spend all your time drawing and observing and making art your lifestyle, it's probably not for you.

I have known on how to see an object from all sides and perspectives (Loomis method and some comic industry artist tips) but I definitely like how thorough Gi puts it down and the wisdom and knowledge of trial and error he explains. Mr. Proko, you are doing great work not only with your fantastic and superb skill of making art but that of being a truly wonderful and legendary educator that artists will be searching for generations from now.

Memory is faulty to begin with, and, of course, with the passage of time, it becomes more fallible. This is a problem (maybe not for Kim Jung Gi) when using only your memory as a guide, because when you're relying only on your memory to draw, you're recreating what you THINK you saw, what you THINK an object looks like, how you THINK light reflects off of that object, etc., and quite often, what you think is not accurate.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@aeonkwiz,"5:33 I have a question for you Stan, I think I have heard you mentioning ""the math behind perspective"", but I saw Marshall's videos, I've read enough of perspective books to understand the basic concepts like vanishing points, horizon line, etc. but I've never seen math used beyond the basic concepts of perpendicular, parallel, oblique and at most angle measurements. Is that all there is? or is there a point where you really get deep into trigonometry?  In computer graphics you have a view matrix, a projection matrix and a model matrix that map 3d coordinates to 2d coordinates in the projection plane, I understand enough of it to look deeper and find how it could be done on paper, there's a lot of sine and cosine calculations, angles to radians, vectors, matrices and even quaternions, which I get, but I still feel like I am missing the glue between human drawing and computer drawing, and ""the math behind perspective drawing"" just seems to be it, yet I am not able to find math past elementary school math in perspective drawing, just a lot of intuition.

@CallMeCamTV," @filipvadas7602   well what everyone was trying to say is that if someone wants to become good they only have to keep working at it. Talent decides someone's path of growth, but it is not an indicator of success. If talent was the reason that an artist is good or not good, then we would find art throughout history that matches the level of photo quality that some artists are able to achieve today. The thing is though, that you can see a chronological improvement over time as artists studied form, value, space, etc and shared their findings with other artists. The art of the past pales in comparison to what people can do today with traditional mediums.   Another way you can think about my point is like this - someone may be born with an aptitude for math. This will naturally help them be a better engineer, but just because they are born that way does not mean they can immediately build a car.   Chalking up good art to talent is pretty offensive because no matter who the person is when you see them in the present, they were worse in the past than they are today.

Those who have only one but not the other get nowhere. Whether you come out of your little bubble is no concern of mine. But I'm tired of people pretending like anything can be achieved through hard work, it CAN'T because thats not the world we live in.",5년 전,0,
@filipvadas7602," @ruchinese3742   ""Effort and time"", oh yeah how much effort and time? 10 years? 20?30?  Yoi spend all that time and effort and you get nowhere because there are 4 types of people in this world an only 3 achieve anything:  The rich The talented The thieves The worthless  If you don't have money you get money, talent or the cunning to steal the work of others effectively you are WORTHLESS in this world. You will never improve in any substantial way because you're not meant to.  And I HATE it when people with little talent or money talk about how everything that they're going to achieve, because its a LIE. A lie people tell themselves to feel better and to make it seem like they have a purpose.

@sociallyresponsiblexenomor7608," @mat43899  Constant study every day, it's not enough to be just drawing, it has to be for a specific purpose. Maybe it's perspective, one day, or maybe it's anatomy the second, I pick the fundamentals I seem to struggle with most and target them specifically. I have never gone to an art school or anything thing like that, nor have I paid a dime for any art courses online, everything I've gotten I've gotten for free; a lot of good resources on youtube. I did buy a few good books but that was all. Make sure to analyze artists and be real with yourself, study them and try and learn, and most importantly realize what they are doing that you are not, and then targetting that weak spot over and over and over until you feel it's less of a problem than something else. That's all it is, but I put in about 8--10 hours a day, and sleep like 5 or 6 hours a night, I gave up video games entirely. It's all day on the weekends pretty much. You have to sacrifice things for that precious time, it does not come easy I've gotten so frustrated I've literally torn up sketchbook pages. All this and it's only been one year!",5년 전(수정됨),2,

You could learn more about perspective from moderndayjames as well, he covers perspective very well also.

@shokujinki," @cacosapo9644  Basicamente, o cara disse para treinar desenhar com um, dois, três pontos de perspectiva, sempre antes de começar a desenhar algo, vc desenha um quadrado antes (ele faz isso so na imaginaçao dele), aí vc define onde vai estar o ponto de fuga, acima ou abaixo da linha do horizonte, mais para esquerda ou direita. Só depois disso, vc desenha realmente o negocio que vc queria. ESTUDE PERSPECTIVA  Ele usa MUITA referencia, mas tem o habito de pegar um objeto em uma posição e tentar girar ele em varias posicoes diferentes apenas com   o conhecimento de perspectiva, alem de ser um bom treino, serve para vc gravar aquele objeto (eu particularmente, ja fiz isso com tigres, leoes, lobos , gatos, anupreto, cobra e velociraptors, se vc for iniciante, recomendo começar com formas simples, como o proprio Kim fez usando o copo como exemplo). ESTUDE ANATOMIA Se vc aprende a desenhar , por exemplo humanos, Kim ensina que vc pode dar uma enrolada, como ele mesmo faz, quando não gravou muito bem um outro ""objeto"" , tipo o sapo, então ele mistura o pouco que sabe sobre sapos e coloca um monte de elementos humanos na figura :) Existem muitos videos de uns 4 anos atras que o proprio Kim errava  a anatomia de tigres e ele escondia isso misturando peças de carros e partes humanas e transformava uma arte com erros em ilustras FODONAS.",5년 전,3,
