@wip1664," @silverforest4682  predators are obliged to go where their preys go.  The preys go where food is most available...on the mountains.   As for nesting their young high on the cliff, the geese nest where predators are not around.  This also provide their offspring the opportunity to learn skills necessary throughout life at a time when their falls and/or injuries would either kill them or heal quickly.  As young birds, they can focus on learning and refining skills rather than on defending or other things that adult geese have to be concerned with.

It has nothing to do with anything else. The same science departments in Universities across the USA have all been getting paid billions to make these false claims as well.

@markokada7311,"So unutterably Awe-inspiring, Beautiful, & Captivating that it offers me the impression it seems to have gone beyond the bounds of possibility that any other snow leopard films like this one could arise again, superseding it for the superlative quality & that tantalizing sublime. Hence, I'm now convinced that tis is one of the best snow leopards doc. I've ever seen, & it is almost unrivaled, incomparable, & so unsurpassable to any others in the world--literally comparable only to NETFLIX nature doc.  Soundly appreciated this one & only nature doc. to the fullest from the luxury of my dwelling. Thus, my heartfelt gratitude to you all for that.,,,,(02/22/25)",7개월 전(수정됨),2,
@markokada7311,"I can't help doffing my hat to those photographers;  they endeavored & endured night & day w/ an interminable patience so as to gain access to these incredible, unmissable,& unforgettable momentous footages one after another, at times in close-ups & slow motions, in the face of some adverse environments. It simply exhibits us to discern their unyielding determination & devotion of the commitment to their own crafts on a scale perhaps most of us simply could dream of. The rest of the crews such as editors, scriptwriters in concert w/ their researchers, sound engineers in tandem w/ a background music composer, a narrator, etc., they all achieved a great job but they were able to do so from the comfort of their studio in their own country. And that is an immutable & pivotal disparity from the aforementioned cameramen.  Nonetheless, by virtue of them all concerned in the glory of production, we could enjoy this singular nature doc. to the core of my heart from the luxury of my cosy dwelling. Thus, I feel deeply indebted to you all for that.,,,,,(02/22/25, Sat.)",7개월 전(수정됨),1,

But I hope people will truly understand how difficult it is... changing even 1 degree of our planet temperature has  catastrophic consequences. We need to do a much better job in protecting our planet and its species from harm. Conservation of natural resources reduction of fossil fuels and use of plastics should be the focus to preserve our beautiful world and all who live here. We have pushed it towards the breaking point and only education and action can save our world 🌎,1년 전,0,

I checked the high temp for lower Yellowstone, 70-80 in July. The record at the park was 99° in 2002 at Mammoth Hot Springs, the record for the state was 103° in 1960 in Gardner Montana. I applaud bringing attention to the protection of animals but giving the impression that the temps are 100° in an area they aren't tends to make people not trust anything you say.  There are so many year round outdoor people in the states with the Rockies. We know what the weather is like.

The reverse application: Primarily visual metaphors and metonymies are fabricated and disseminated at such a frequency in multiple communicative contexts as to allow for the generation of a structural unconscious.

Frankly, it sounds ridiculous to hear in the narrative, announced with grave implications, that climate warming has increased by 1 degree per decade as though the mountain lion could feel that difference in the pursuit of his next meal.  He can not run because it is too hot due to climate warming. Give me a break.  The daily temperature variations, in the spring and summer, must be tens of degrees every day, so the climate warming will not make a difference in the lion's running capabilities.  The daily weather is another story, but that has nothing to do with global warming. Particularly not as far as the lion's ability is concerned to hunt at a particular moment in time.",2년 전,0,

It's cuz they can't. There's a puppet and I'm very disappointed,2년 전,1,
@dickfitswell3437,Now with the rising global temperatures it's so much harder.   ...... Except for up here where there's so much snow I can barely survive. Nat Geo stopped pushing your climate agenda and just show nature. Nobody believes that except for the weak minds. And the 70s they pushed the next ice age then the '80s was climate change acid rain then the 90s it was the ozone. 2000s it's CO2. Why is it always something we can't verify ourselves. Why does it always have to be something that we can't see but you can see just we can. Stop it you just embarrass yourselves,2년 전(수정됨),1,

@andrewfowlkes3838,"You’re very uneducated about this subject. Based on your comment, you don’t even understand the issue. The earth has naturally had cooler and warmer periods, nobody’s arguing that. The point is that this is a gradual process, and human activity is exponentially speeding up the natural warming process. This is a major issue because many species are unable to adapt and evolve fast enough to keep up with environmental stress factors (like those seen in this video). Species are adaptable and can evolve to continue to survive even when their environment changes, however evolution is not designed to keep up with the rate in which we are changing the climate. It’s rather egotistical to believe that Humans are the only creatures that are important on this planet. The Earth and it’s life have existed long before humanity, healthy ecosystems have very high biodiversity and we are actively destroying biodiversity at such a rate that it is considered to be the next mass extinction on Earth. That’s how many species are dying due to how rapidly we are changing the climate on an evolutionary time scale. Stop pretending like this isn’t an issue, it is.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@kingranches,"FYI,  2 miles high is only about 10k feet. Mt Evans Colorado is 14k ft (nearly a mile higher, and they're are 3 others 13k plus just in Colorado alone)  Also climbers don't begin using oxygen masks until about 26,000 ft, or over 5 miles up. My point is that I think you were a wee bit heavy on the drama here in describing what it feels like on top of  a relatively low altitude mountain top.  None of this takes away from the fact that I enjoyed the video very much, I just think that neither snow leopards nor the harsh environments that they live in need  any hyping and beginning the video with an attempt to do so, may have caused viewers in the know to be skeptical of everything else you said after that. Animals are crazy interesting in general, any that need any hyping probably aren't worth making a video about anyway, and that sure doesn't describe the snow leopard. Everything about them is mysterious and fascinating.",3년 전,1,

@mikehartman5326,"I watched a video long ago about song birds that were being driven to extinction because of human encroachment into their habitat and because other birds were laying their eggs in the nests that hatched before the song birds did.  The scientist knew of the song birds plight, but because of a non interference policy the few song birds would song vanish from that area.  They lifted the healthy massive chick not belonging to the parent song birds to see the starving baby song birds close to death and they did nothing to help.  It is this non intervention attitude to let nature take its' course that has a moral dilemma.  If humans are the cause of shrinking areas where nature can live and 97% of scientist claim humans are affecting the climate then this non intervention policy should not be adhered to in the strictest of fashion, because for those same scientist would then be at some fault in the extinction of a species they studied and did nothing directly save them.  I was on the side of the humans giving the burned Koala in Australia water.  The interference was a good thing.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

In the 80s it was acid rain in the 90s it was the ozone in the 2000s it's CO2. It's always something you can't see yourself but they can see it. The ocean hasn't risen hurricanes are not getting stronger that's been debunked a million times but they are pumping out the articles like the world is going to end and just hearing Houston the last two storms we've had have been doozies.

I think two of the most important aspects that have sped up the climate change is the use of the Jet engine aircrafts that have hot air exhaust (their numbers growing by the day) and the number of humans living in extremely cold regions of the world. These are directly warming up the colder air on the planet, changing air current patterns. Effectively driving climate change. Of course other factors like industrialization, fossil fuel burning etc cannot be ignored either. Human race must take this challenge personally and take requisite steps to improve.",3년 전,0,

@archangelliii2536,"This could've been an excellent documentary...if you hadn't mixed the POLITICS (and YES it is simply politics and nothing else!) of 'climate change' or 'global warming'. Those effects do exist...and have for BILLIONS of years obviously long before the 1st human or locomotive set foot on planet earth. But to you environmental nuts, it's all human industry's 'fault' which is the BS used by globalists to increase their political power, that's it.  Every actual SCIENTIFIC research has indicated that human activity is only marginal in affecting the environment (barring a Nuclear Holocaust of course). In fact, many of that activity has actually PRESERVED otherwise would be extinct or damaged elements in the environment. But regardless of the 'scientific research'  commissioned by globalists with their agenda claiming we are 'dying' because of the new variant propaganda of 'climate change' and the perennial propaganda of 'overpopulation', independent actual Scientific research conducted by Scientists NOT in the pocket of Globalists have indicated over and over again that is just a bunch of NONSENSE (BS if you will). Ironically those are the very same folks who are now pushing the poison of the so called 'vaccine' down our throats and who have promoted the other poison of contraceptives for so long, both of which are flooding our waters with CHEMICALS which are affecting the environment in a negative way.  Don't expect any research to be commissioned by Globalists/Pharmaceuticals on that one. That would threaten their Power and Wealth...no way Jose!!!!!!   'CLICK'.",3년 전,0,

Of the two the fall didn’t kill one of those was snatched up by a crow despite the struggle of the mother.   One of three did survive. Apparently this is their life course and they have developed to survive the impact of the fall. If that were not the case then none would have survived the fall. They all look very fat but in actuality that bulkiness has to actually be ‘fluff’ not real bulk.  The sound of the impact had to be dubbed in. No baby chick body, either fat or fluff, striking a cliff face or cliff shelf would make that kind of a “crashing” sound.  One does wonder at the efficacy of such a strategy for the survival of a species.",4년 전(수정됨),12,

Then I always make a comment in Japanese except being necessary.  Indeed I know  cubs(?) instinctively imitate  their parents, but it seems that it's not mature enough for them to do so . I wonder why they take risks  as far as they may be killed. I wonder why they can't wait till it is safe enough for them to do so. Don't you think that they will grow mature soon?  I'm living in Saitama prefecture. I live in Chiba prefecture. See you again. PS. If there are any mistakes in grammar or unnatural expressions for natives, please pardon me.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

These government agencies created it for their exclusive use, then share it with these other mass media corporations.

It's incredible to see that predators such as the snow leopard actually jump or attack their prey with some kind of disregard to the following moments, eg: they jump into the air to try catching a bird, and only then, when they realize they have missed, do they start wondering about how their fall is going to finish. That's the same with this 200ft long fall from the cliff. It tells us how determined, how desperate they are to catch their prey. I guess that the lesson from all that is that when you're starving, facing death, there are hidden resources that still can be used to avoid the ultimate fate.",4년 전,5,

@chrish4439,@Tyler Keehl No I don't think it is. When the leopard and goat or whatever stopped falling there was snow everywhere. Next scene all of a sudden the snow is all gone and the leopard is smaller.

BUT that is definitely not the leopard eating the same goat in the next shot. So it's probably a whole different leopard.,3년 전(수정됨),2,

@wip1664," @silverforest4682  predators are obliged to go where their preys go.  The preys go where food is most available...on the mountains.   As for nesting their young high on the cliff, the geese nest where predators are not around.  This also provide their offspring the opportunity to learn skills necessary throughout life at a time when their falls and/or injuries would either kill them or heal quickly.  As young birds, they can focus on learning and refining skills rather than on defending or other things that adult geese have to be concerned with. This is too sad, but our species need to know what it is like on earth for our other species.  They are unquestionably more remarkable than us, and have done nothing to be deserving of such punishing conditions.",4년 전,0,

So why did God or whatever higher power made the snow leopard a predator of mountain dwelling preys, instead of preys elsewhere, or made the snow leopard a herbivore/omnivore instead of a carnivore.

@silverforest4682,I don't think their mouths are made to hold a chick.  The beaks are smaller than American snow geese.  And they have webbed feet rather than clawed feet.   They should nest on the ground in the grass.  If the mom is sitting on  the eggs all that time she might as well b e closer to food.  Still risk being eaten.,4년 전,1,

@bluedevilg3542, @silverforest4682  don’t need a big beak to carry a light chick still think they need to try plus they’re just going to glide the chick down so they wouldn’t be using so much force or weight,4년 전,0,

@GroundBack, @bluedevilg3542  You're comparing a crow to a bird whose beak wasn't made for catching and lifting stuff but okay. Not like crows (a predator) specifically evolved to catch prey,4년 전,0,
