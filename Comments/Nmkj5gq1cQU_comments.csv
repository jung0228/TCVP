@Ilovewhatever,“You can’t help thinking of lunch” no I don’t really think of lunch. I just see a poor cow who’s been bred to the point where it can barely move. Selective breeding can cause inbred in animals and lead to genetic mutations. Female Belgian blues often have to have c- sections due to the size of their offspring. They can have hip and joint problems and live uncomfortably for probably the rest of their lives until they’re shipped off to be killed and put into the market. I’m not a vegan or a vegetarian what he said just disgusted me.,7년 전(수정됨),439,

@maleksaad1241,"Selective breeding is wrong is its done wrong. Mutations show severs effects over several generations when they accumulate which is not the case here since they dont mate relatives and its too early in the generation count for it to matter. Also the cow seems more healthy with muscles and it is clearly well fed. Honestly i think its living a better life than in the wild. Also think if it this way, at least the cow now has a specific use and that is to let us eat it. Whether you like it or not we evolved to eat meat and thats not going to change anytime soon. I respect your sympathy for the animal but like dont let that change you into becoming one of the crazy animal lovers like peta that break into research labs and let genetically modified rats free where they would die since lab mice and rats are made for lab use only",6년 전,0,

@tyynymyy7770," @blindeye-phone2068   There aren't anything inherently dangerous about GMO products, that is true. In fact genetic modification is safer than widely-spread mutation breeding with radiation or chemicals which also produces unwanted genetic mutations that could, in theory, be harmful and cause for example an allergic reaction. Not to mention mutation breeding can't be applied to animals for obvious reasons. Not by decent human being.  Selective breeding on the other hand relies mostly on existing genes. Genetic mutations do occur in nature, we wouldn't be here without them, but the rate is pretty low.   Some people are just ignorant and freak out when they hear words like 'chemical' (all matter is made of chemicals) or 'radiation' (transmission of energy  through space in form of waves or particles. Includes visible light.) GMO products tend to contain less harmful chemicals, because they don't require, for example, as much pesticides because they are more resistant to fungi, insects and weeds.

If we can selectively breed dogs and cows, then we can certainly selectively breed ourselves.  And some of us have tried to do that, but it is seen as immoral and/or taboo.

I can tell you from a naturalistic perspective, we humans are not meant to be living the way we currently are. That includes you, using a computer. It's unnatural. The truth of the matter is, most captive animals have a more secured and potentially longer lifespan (depending on the species) than a wild animal. Most cattle in their current state cannot live in the wild even if we were to release them all, and would suffer far more inhumane deaths than the ones we can give them.

That being said, I'd argue that human technology is natural (or at least, some of it is) due to our improved cognitive abilities, obviously a trait we evolved to inherit because it grants us an edge in natural selection; inherited traits and abilities are not coincidence. Would you call a beehive unnatural since the bees manipulated something to create it? I would also argue that the cows deaths would be a blessing at this point, we sexually, physically, and emotionally exploit these animals to the point where they routinely collapse and must be killed because they don't have the will to live. Also, most cow lifespans are 20-25 years, while the average in captivity is 4-5 years, but that's because that's when they're most ""ripe"".

@willyermm,"It would take going to the National Geographic channel to find the most unbelievably idiotic people, wouldn't it? Your diet choices are your own, but please stop making eating meat or not some kind of moral position. The fact is that humans have been using animals since the birth of our existence, and to stop now would be absolutely ridiculous. Whether you like it or not, we need these animals to survive. YOU might be able to live without meat, but the vast majority of the world CAN'T. And that is a fact. This isn't some stupid moral question as to whether the animal will feel anything, or if they have 'emotional intelligence' as some in the comments have been saying. No, this actually has a definitive answer. If we banned meat globally, the world would starve. Third-world countries can't just stop killing animals to survive because you think they should eat tofu instead of chicken. It doesn't work like that in a lot of parts of the world because they SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE OPTION.   Oh, and also? The amount of research and effort that has gone into making humane ways to process animals into meat and other essentials such as leather, etc. has clearly been pointless as some idiot will still come out and say that we shouldn't kill any living thing because there's a chance they'll feel even a millisecond of pain. Early humans hunted and killed TO SURVIVE. If they'd been those of you in the comments who call themselves 'vegan' and 'vegetarian' (when in reality they're actually making those groups infamous for being anti-meat, when it's actually a dietary choice and isn't supposed to be used as leverage for the anti-meat campaign) then I suspect we would have been wiped out long before the year 2015!",9년 전,17,

The fact some people don't agree to current farming techniques is no reason to starve populations by supporting stupid shit like organic farming.

It is a fact that organic-certified farming techniques produce less food per acre compared to normal farming. Thereby, promoting organic shit will decrease the efficiency of food-produced per acre, thus resulting in fewer food being produced. Didn't you just tell me the real culprit is overpopulation?

However, redtails has made some good points. I don't really see you pointing to any sources that say, with authority, that organic is any better than the regular way we farm. I'd like to believe that organic farming is better for you, but, without any proof, I cannot support organic farming. Plus, I don't see how looking at people in hospitals or supermarkets could tell you anything about how healthy they are. First of all, you don't know if they could be suffering from a disease from just looking at them. Unless you're a doctor maybe, but even then to know for sure you'd have to examine them to an extent. Second of all, how does that help you? They could be looking at organic foods, and even purchasing them, but what if they live a sedentary lifestyle? Or what if they binge on alcohol? You can't gain substantial information from just looking at a person. You also say that redtails was too trusting of the market, but he pointed out that you can find out who fund's the scientific papers.

@TheDemonFerretFursuits,"***** Just wanna throw my two cents in here: 1) IBS is not, nor ever can be, caused by eating a certain food. You are always born with it, but it usually shows up when you get older. IBS is when your intestines are moving food in the right direction, and then, further down, another section decides to push food back towards the stomach, because the nerves and muscles are confused. Certain foods make IBS symptoms happen because the harder the food is to digest, the easier it is to get trapped in the confusion. I have it myself. Fast foods are actually easier for me to eat because my body personally can break it down very well, while others can't eat meat at all. 2) The advantage to organic farming has NOTHING to do with health, food quality, or production. All of that is propaganda. Organic farming is to help the SOIL, so fields for crops and livestock can be used more effectively.",11년 전,0,

@redtails,"DemonFerret15 Besides that what you said about IBS is beyond the scope of what we were discussing, you're even wrong about the cause of IBS. No one knows the cause of IBS at this moment. Some research points towards genetics, others point towards brain-gut axis (neuronal), others point towards bacterial overgrowth. As always, IBS is multi-faceted and it's unfair and unjustified to claim genetics. What you said about organic farming is also wrong. Though I do not know why individuals purchase ""organic"" food, I do know organic farming does not help the soil, the fields, the crops or the animals be sued more effectively. I've already pointed out that organic farming techniques lead to less food produced per acre. The whole reason we use artificial fertilization, herbicides and pesticides is to increase the efficiency and decrease the costs of food produced. Using organic farming techniques undermines centuries of hard work that eventually led to out current status where we are somehow successful at feeding everyone on the planet and still being able to throw excess food at our pets and the pigeons in the park. Just because YOU are in a position of superfluous food, does not mean you should decrease the food supply for others by promoting organic farming. That's discrimination on SO many levels.",11년 전,0,

It is human interfearence propagating these genetic abnormalities and it is NOT NATURAL at all! There is no natural reason why this would exist.

You my well say it is ""safe to eat"" but if you think these things don't have wider effects on the health of the population you are very underinformed and should do some research.

Tanzania has the highest rate of albinism anywhere. And even in these countries all these traits are found a few towns and not homogeneously throughout the entire population.  The 3 examples are all Black countries and yet they have more genetic variation between each other, than they'd have been themselves and perhaps people of another race. And Blacks in the USA have on average 20% Caucasian genes so by your theory they should be less athletic than blacks from former slave colonies who are less mixed. ",10년 전,0,

Its quite easy to get two people to breed if both are subject to the same hardship and loneliness (not that I agree with this just my knowledge of psychology) how we get animals to breed is by exposure and repeating the process for quality.  With modern technology IVF methods and work towards gene therapy marks a new dawn to engineer humans...if we look at sperm bank they have strict rules around the doners plus women get to pick from a profile not just attraction.  There is another way and thats through extreme training all the technology exists within our genes.

Not necessarily, says Dr. Debby Demory-Luce, a research dietitian with the USDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine.  A diet consisting of French fries and bananas is vegetarian, but few people would consider such a diet very healthy.  On the other hand, a diet that includes plenty of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and a good source of calcium like low-fat dairy products is healthy whether it features moderate portions of lean meat or legumes, seeds and soy-based meat substitutes as the main protein source. It is true, however, that well-planned vegetarian diets tend to be higher in fiber and protective phytonutrients and lower in saturated fat than the typical American diet.  This healthier diet helps explain why vegetarians tend to have less cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and fewer weight problems than their meat-loving counterparts.",11년 전,0,

Nature has answered that need by providing myostatin. A specific gene, named growth and differentiation factor 8 (GDF-8), produces this protein, the function of which is to stop muscle stem cells or satellite cells from becoming larger. GDF -8 in effect controls the borders on how large muscles can become. Most people have a generous expression of this GDF-8 gene and therefore have a considerable amount of myostatin circulating through their bodies, which imposes a modest limit on how much muscle mass their bodies will produce"" Body By Science,pp.166-167, JohnLittle, Doug McGuff M.D., 2009",11년 전,0,

The same goes for the animal heavy diets we have now. What we need is a better balance of the consumption of both and less consumption of both.

What you say is also a disgrace to Plants and other non-Animal lifeforms, for science is proving now that they too have feelings, via electrical and chemical signals. It is nature's way and the circle of life as they say to eat meat, why else would all cultures do it, including the healthiest people in Asia (Japan) and Scandinavia? When you pluck a leaf you have removed an organ from a tree!

Fine, they go through unhealthy processing (like all cows, super and non super alike) that's a different issue from selective breeding. My point about the dogs is to shed light on the dissonance that many people may have.  How they say it's a travesty that such an animal exists. But it has been selectively bred (much like dogs, cats, horses etc) for specific traits. Traits that are visible on the outside, and people consider unnatural and healthy. The question is how much does it affect it's health and well being, do you actually know or are you assuming it has a poor lifestyle (poorer than other animals used for similar purposes)  I have two questions. Do you have a problem with the unhealthy lifestyle they are forced to have?( which from my limiting understanding of the industry are pretty terrible and should be better regulated, even at the cost of meat becoming more expensive) OR do you have problems with selective breeding.  If you have problems with Selective breeding, than I think the same problems you have should apply to cats , dogs, horses, etc. We have been selectively breeding those animals to run faster, jump high, have prettier coat, be more friendly,  keep sheep together, etc etc etc. the dogs we know are as unnatural(if not even MORE unnatural) than that cow. ",11년 전,1,

@chronicbuttercup,"Sheryl B No one is arguing that plants aren't important. Of course plants are important, and we should always be thinking about environmentally sustainable agriculture, but you should also keep in mind that eating meat for energy is terribly inefficient. When an animal eats a plant, only about 10% of the energy from the plant is used by the organism to gain mass. 90% of the energy is lost due to inefficiencies. So if you want...say... 1000J of energy from meat, the animal that the meat came from had to consume 10 000J worth of energy from a plant, 90% of which is lost. Alternatively a human could just consume 1000J worth of plants to get the same amount of energy. So this might seem counter-intuitive, but if you only eat plants, less plants have to be eaten. :)",11년 전,0,

@kingtebz,FalloutGod Selective breeding was done on humans during the times of slavery. Just sayin...,11년 전,3,
@FalloutGod,"kingtebz Yeah, many of the Eugenics programs started becoming popular in the U.S. and right before WWII a lot of prominent german scientists went to study Eugenics in the United States. Hitler put in practice forced Eugenics, that lead to extermination of humans seen to be unfit to procreate and a burden on society, as well as the experimentation on those deemed lesser humans based on purely arbitrary qualities. Ever since those dark days where Eugenics became synonymous with mad science it has been a rather controversial topic. However, selective breeding has been done on humans for longer than times of slavery. Arranged marriages or breeding within bloodlines is an ancient practice. Pure-blooded Jews have certain potential medical conditions and disorders unique to their lineage as a result of traditional inbreeding of the jewish communities throughout history. Many noble and royal families suffered from even worse genetic anomalies from inbreeding closer to the family roots of origin. It's widely established that diversity in the bloodline is likely to produce superior, healthier, and stronger offspring. Now we have the science to isolate specific genes and traits, to intentionally bring forth healthy humans, resistant to cancer, aging, and all around superior in every imaginable way that we can manage to isolate in the genome, thus improving the phenotypical traits as well as the overall genetic quality of our species. Imagine, a future where vaccination may become a thing of the past. Imagine, a future where climate change poses little threat to the continuation of our species as we will breed our offspring to be able to survive adverse climates that would kill us. Imagine, a future where pollution is of little concern because we are able to alter organism in way that not only filters the harmful substances but potentially thrives on or uses them. Do not fear the future, our time will end but we do a disservice to our species by holding back progress. They will look back on these naysayers just as we look back on those that shunned industrialization. ",11년 전,3,

As in if they just ate corn they would die of starvation. the antibiotics plus corn causes painful stomach ulcers that go untreated And the corn is grown using fertilizer made from oil Officials within the U.S. beef industry have admitted that 792,000 gallons of water are needed to raise a 1,000-pound steer, and that may be a low estimate. Researchers at Michigan State University found that 2,500 gallons are needed to grow a pound of flesh, which would mean the same steer actually necessitates 2.5 million gallons of water in its lifetime.2 Contrarily, only 25 gallons of water are required to produce one pound of wheat, 1 percent as much water as is needed for beef.  Intensive animal agriculture, a production model that is being steadily adopted throughout the world, is a vast user of fossil fuel, mainly for the production of feed.  In the U.S., one ton of oil (2000 pounds or 6.75 barrels) is required to produce one steer weighing 1250 pounds (Pollan, 2002). One acre of corn production in the U.S. requires approximately 140 gallons of oil (Pimentel, 2001), and if the corn goes to livestock, only about one-fifth of the protein is returned as food, and four-fifths of it is lost (McLaren et al, 1998).",11년 전,0,

@MaryTereseG,***** Any valid sources for your claims?  ,11년 전,1,
@MaryTereseG,"***** It's caused by a genetic defect that keeps them from creating myostatin. The double muscling is actually a mutation which represses myostatin proteins resulting in dramatically enhanced muscle tissue growth. Belgian Blue, Piedmontese and Parthenais would be the most common breeds of cattle to observe this.The gene basically limits the growth of muscle. If any animal/human lacks the gene, their muscles are much larger.  A quick look on Google images for 'myostatin' shows off some other creatures with the same characteristic of the cow.  This animal has a lot of muscle but its tendons are not any stronger than those of a normal cow. If it gets excited, it can rip its muscles free from the bones. Humans with this problem appear very strong from an early age but injuries build up until they're completely disabled. So, it's not a good thing for the cow but because they produce more meat, we keep breeding them (with this defect) unfortunately. :-(   It is Evolution through Artificial Selection. That's how we've come to have the bananas that we know today, among other feats of artificial selection.",11년 전,2,

As long as the animals are treated well when alive (which they are) and killed humanely (which this particular breeding place is), I think this is acceptable. In the wild, cattle aren't treated much better. I mean, how many wild calves ever make it into their full lifespan without boing slaughtered by wolves, puma, or disease? This is being fed to humans. It's being used. And anyway, Belgian Blue meat taste amazing. To be fair, these animals would never last very long in the wild on their own. And don't talk about me being horrendous and heartless.

He remarked one day that the inch-foot syatem was a lot easier to use than the metric system. Perhaps that was because 12 is divisible by 2,3,4 and 6, and 16 is divisible by 2, 4 and 8, whereas 10 is only divisible by 2 and 5.

@SAMSON12321,I can not believe how this so called doctor is LYING as he is. This/these cows are having their MYOSTATIN genes manipulated. Myostatin normally controls the amount of muscle an animal/human can develop even when working out. If this gene is turned off muscle growth will occur rapidly and without control or restriction. No amount of breeding will produce this effect...only gene manipulation. What will happen to people and their offspring over time who eat this genetically manipulated meat?,14년 전,0,

Of this is a natural way of feeding i should be able to  eat any animal i choose even if they are wearing a collar and a leech But its wrong to eat ""Lassie"" and rightfully so.",14년 전,0,

Do research. Find a reputable beef farmer through a farmersmarket, and buy direct from him.   Anyway, Belgian Blues are oftentimes bred to Holstein and they create a sort of middling-proportioned calf. You're not actually eating those huge monsters. Those are for breeding and 'show'.

It CAN be eaten, but so can any meat. Steer meat is delicious and plentiful. You castrate bulls at birth, creating steers so that the hormones aren't in the meat.

It may not be true natural selection but it does prove how evolution and natural selection has worked.  Man has done what he always does and has exploited this. This however is no different to how other domestic animals have developed such as the domestic dog.,14년 전,0,

Evolution is when ( supposedly)  there are mutations that were not genetically passed down from either parent that then changed the species somewhat. It's kind of silly though to say these changes make a species better though when in all recorded history mutations have always been negative and usually kill the mutated animal. ,15년 전,0,

No, I don't own a purebred and never will. They are an abomination and the product of generations of inbreeding.",15년 전,0,
@paulblackpb,@Devilock79 selective breeding is not genetic engineering. i know someone who suffer from this disease. they carry around natural weight with super sized muscles so believe me they dont notice it.

@Devilock79,"@paulblackpb   This doesn't occur naturally, at least not as severe as this. These cattle were genetically engineered to be like this. How do you know it doesn't cause pain? How about you carry around twice your body weight for the rest of your life and tell me if it starts to hurt.  By the way, I don't waste any of my food. I used to eat out of dumpsters when I was homeless years ago so I know how much we waste as a society.",15년 전,0,
@paulblackpb,"@Devilock79 this condition occours naturally in animals. in this case it is a genetic disorder opposite to muscular distrophy called muscular hypertrophy. humans see this as an oppertunity to get more meat. if one animal can produce 500kg of meat then why kill two animals for the same amount of meat. this is good lean meat too. However there is some problems for the animals with this disease but none which cause pain, moreso repoduction problems. Also why do you waste 40% of your food ???",15년 전,0,
@jfsabl,"Belgian blue muscle overgrowth is actually primarily due to a single mutation in the Myostatin (GDF*) gene.  Despite all the talk of careful breeding, this can just as easily be thought of as a natural, genetic metabolic disease in cows that happens to be useful for people. It leaves the cattle themselves open to heat stress, greater problems during pregnancy, problems with calf viability, and breeding problems, as you'd expect. ",15년 전,0,

For a more easily understood example, what most people normally think of as an 'apple' is actually abnormal! Modern day farmed apples have been selectively bred for their size and round shape. Most wild apples are small, somewhat bitter tasting and irregularly shaped. The round apple is technically 'unnatural' because it is a product of breeding.",15년 전,0,

@loravine,"@srgstgst  yes, I know there are a few species of animals that have forward pointing eyes that eat only plants, however what you must take into account is their habitat. Sloths as with some monkeys, have forward pointing eyes, but they mainly live in the tops of trees. Because of this they do not need the eyes on the side of their head. Animals that do have eyes on the sides of their heads need to be able to have that 360 vision. Humans are built for the hunt. ",15년 전,0,

@Eikinkloster,"So I think it boils down to the respect with which we treat the prey. But I think there is a hierarchy of species too and it is important to consider it. Primates and cetaceans are a big no no. Then we have carnivora, elephants, psitacidieans, corvideans, falconiformes, which are pretty much off limits too.

Bottom line is, my basic problem is not with people eating meat...So be it. But at least THAT should be done with a LOT more respect to animals.",15년 전,0,

My answer to the first part is no, because self defence (mosquitoes bite, flies can spread diseases,etc ) , and natural processes, such as predators hunting, are perfectly okay. Predators kill as much as they need.  Even if one must eat meat (which isn't really true), there is a BIG difference between industrial meat production, and raising an animal with care and love.",15년 전,0,

Such laws prohibit, for example in a number of cases, sexual contact with an animal (just to cite a social taboo, don't get offended), but it allows industrial meat production, sports (abusive sports), generally saying, that if it's required, and the economy dictates it, suffering can be caused to creatures.

@austenwack,"Well in todays world it wouldn't really matter if the person had good or bad genes that determine the body's muscle to fat ratio, the genes (in order for them to be superior as you're implying that is what these scientists are doing) would have to effect the intellectual processes of the human. So the body builder's child would do no better then the fat person except for maybe life length. But you also have to take into consideration diet at that point. It's a lot less cut&paste for humans. Sry!",16년 전,0,
@austenwack,"I doubt that actually. I think that this muscle growth is as ""Sistertree321"" said, ""Crippling"" they don't really tell you that in this, but they also don't have one of these cows running for its life. Sure, muscle is nice when you're fighting something and need a lot of power, but when running, THIS much muscle is indeed crippling most likely. Therefor, the slimmer, cow would be far more adept at running. Still, it's pretty cool. Just because I think it's wrong doesn't mean I can't appreciate it",16년 전,0,

The animal that is allowed to breed is the one that suits man's needs. the process is identical, the means vary.",16년 전,0,

@gmwwc,He does not mention: calf size; early growth rate; Feed conversion ratio; Carcass loss; or Breeding efficiency. Do they really use a cow of this quality to collect their bulls? They shave the bull and leave the dirty hair on his sheath then collect him? I do not think animals like this would be able to reproduce in free range conditions. This meat would cost $1K a pound. Selective breeding can and does produce highly specialized animals and humans are not excluded from this group.,16년 전,0,

@bladid,that's called evolution. the strongest right. problem about humans is that we're to many and many just don't have brains enough to think. for an example. about half or was it 3/4 of all the grain in the world is actually fed to cows to make meat for us. i we didn't give the cows grain and let cows eat grass like they're supposed to (also gives better meat and happier cows) we could feed all humans in the world. if we changed the grain with maize we could practically feed two planets,16년 전,0,
@bladid,"do anyone know why cows farts a lot? - because they are not a natural species. humans have been breeding them. anyone know how fast tese so-called super cows grows? - if I resemble this correct they live for about 4 months growing 4 kilos every day.  could keep like that forever. also the meat quality is close to zero. they say it's better because it's more meat and less fat, but that's only what they want us to know.",16년 전,0,

@crashb22,"Though selective breeding is ""natural"", it doesn't make it right.  Also, without fat to insulate your body, you cannot keep warm.  Muscle alone won't do the job...and it's not likely that something to this extent would occur ""naturally"", not only could the animal not stay warm in colder climates, the extent to which its muscles have been exploited renders it unable to flee or defend itself if it were to be attacked by predators.",16년 전,0,
