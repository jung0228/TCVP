I’m now 88, white retired with grandma here in Texas. When I was fresh out of the Marines in 1962 I went to the 1st Baptist Church here in Fort Worth. After a couple of months the preacher said to me “wow, with your voice you could make a lot of money preaching on the radio/tv.” I was so turned off by that that I quit that church. But here’s the fun, fun part. I did go to the radio stations around Dallas/Fort Worth to get a job on the air. I had no experience so I had to put in time in little Texas towns radio stations (think KMOO in Mineola, Texas). But after a few years I hit the big time in my hometown Fort Worth on WBAP (a 50,000 kw blaster) country gold radio. So, I did make a lot of money from my voice and my Texas accent, but I did it my way (thank you Frank Sinatra, lol). Too many of those people think of nothing but money and a new convert is just a new bank account to exploit.

We do that for free, etc. We do not use the parsonage, but the church rents it out to pay my husband's salary.   We pray with our people when they are sick or in trouble. We visit them in the hospital. We take them food if they need it. We don't ask for anything for ourselves.  If the churches are taxed, then these horrible mega churches, who can afford it, will continue to grow and buy themselves gifts...while little churches like ours...will be put out of business. Sad, but true.   The church was never intended for this. If people actually read their Bibles, they would clearly see the heresy in these horrible wolves.

@TerracottaWhirl,"Your most popular video ❤❤ John, we begin with the U.S. election – because both politics and computers run on spin. Politicians spin stories, and computers? They’ve got spintronics (yes, that’s a real thing where electrons do the cha-cha in your circuits). It’s the kind of wild, actually important tech that gets zero campaign ads. Meanwhile, every CEO won’t shut up about AI – apparently the magic buzzword they drop like it’s their firstborn child. AI can write poems, drive cars, and probably fold your laundry if you ask nicely. But for all that hype, we barely hear a peep about alternative computing ideas like spintronics or brain-inspired chips. Why? Maybe because you can’t slap a cute chatbot face on them for a demo, or because they won’t boost next quarter’s profits. In the tech world, if it doesn’t trend, it doesn’t exist, and that’s corporate influence doing its thing.  This is exactly the sort of oddly specific, nerdy nightmare that needs your spotlight. After all, who else will joke about electrons having a dance party and call out Big Tech’s double-think in the same breath? It’s a story about how real innovation gets overshadowed by boardroom buzzwords. It’s complex, a little crazy, but genuinely important – basically, prime John Oliver material. So please, consider giving spintronics and its fellow unsung computing heroes the Last Week Tonight treatment.

Monotheism has been a ""totalizing discourse"", often co-opting all aspects of a social belief system, resulting in the exclusion of ""others"".

That 'den of thieves' accusation; how true it rings to this day.  Edit: Matthew 7:15-20, too.

The people running these churches prayed on my father's disbelief that mental illnesses are real and he would threaten me with beatings if I didn't go with them just because. I'd been staying alone on my own for years at that point but I absolutely HAD to go to whatever crackpot church she thought would heal her bipolar disorder, kidney failure and multiple sclerosis because obviously prayer is the only thing that works, except it never does, ever.

@susanbailey7345,"MinistryWatch in the US has monitored these mega churches and top of the list for not giving enough to the poor is Benny Hinn, Creflo Dollar, Fred Price Jr., Kenneth Copeland and Kenneth Hagin Jr. They fall into the category ""Withhold Giving"". It's disgraceful! I'm a Born Again Christian and one day they will have to stand in front of Jesus, on judgement day and give an account for their behaviour. In fact every human will have to stand in front of Jesus and give an account of their behaviour. Jesus suffered on that Cross taking all the sins of the world away, He was marred more than any other man. God wants people to believe in what Jesus did for them, He made a way back to God, to have fellowship with God as it was once with Adam in the garden of Eden. Believe and accept Jesus into your hearts, and the Holy Spirit will be your helper.  Matthew 24:21 -  For there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. Those believers will be taken out of this world so they wont suffer God's wrath that will come upon the world. God sent out a life line in the form of Jesus, who is God incarnate. He has given people a chance to believe in Him. John 3:16 - For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,  that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For all that is happening in the world today, it's devastating, but I've read the ending in the Bible and that's all good.",1년 전,0,

He built His Church on what Peter said, which can be found in Matthew 16:18.  What He said was “And I say also unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock, I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” in response to what Peter said which was ""Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.""

Now we have to import from abroad over 40% of all professionals from nurses and Drs to engineers and architects et al). I don't feel that ALL churches should be taxed, just the other 99%. I mean, the Vatican alone rakes in billions tax-free each year from tithing, donations and profit from their plethora of businesses. Add to that the vast myriad of other Christian sects preaching the prosperity gospel and flaunting their wealth in a most un-Christian manner, raking in millions from their flocks all tax-free despite their obvious total failure to adhere to Christ's teachings including not getting involved in politics and giving one's wealth to help the poor, homeless, hungry, elderly and otherwise in-need and at-risk people. Instead, they preach a gospel of bias and ""It's OK to be greedy: God WANTS you to be wealthy and you can be if you believe hard enough and tithe regularly"" and involve themselves directly in politics ALWAYS in support of the most right-wing neo-Nazi GOP members. I mean, come on! It's a racket and at the very least, the openly greedy super-wealthy churches and their businesses absolutely should be taxed.",1년 전,2,

@alexalbuquerquerodriguesal108," @danny208YT  What's the percentage of those health insurances that cover cancer treatment? Do the providers for cancer treatment are anywhere near close to the patients? What's the premium of health insurances that actually cover cancer treatment? What's the debt that results from these treatments? It's easy to have cancer treatment if you and your children are willing to pay an extremely large bill.  Believe It or not, but merely pointing out ""people got health insurance"" isn't much of an answer, I for one thankful that my country (Brazil) have universal healthcare, otherwise I would be working to death to pay my father cancer treatment since virtually no affordable health insurance covers cancer treatment (they can cover exams, but chemotherapy or radiotherapy are extremely expensive to do and only the State actually provides them in a large enough quantity).  I would like to quote the summary of the article Inequality and the health-care system in the USA, It really shows how just pointing out the fact that ""92 percent of USA citizens have health insurance"" is meaningless: ""Widening economic inequality in the USA has been accompanied by increasing disparities in health outcomes. The life expectancy of the wealthiest Americans now exceeds that of the poorest by 10–15 years. This report, part of a Series on health and inequality in the USA, focuses on how the health-care system, which could reduce income-based disparities in health, instead often exacerbates them. Other articles in this Series address population health inequalities, and the health effects of racism, mass incarceration, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Poor Americans have worse access to care than do wealthy Americans, partly because many remain uninsured despite coverage expansions since 2010 due to the ACA. For individuals with private insurance, rising premiums and cost sharing have undermined wage gains and driven many households into debt and even bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the share of health-care resources devoted to care of the wealthy has risen. Additional reforms that move forward, rather than backward, from the ACA are sorely needed to mitigate health and health-care inequalities and reduce the financial burdens of medical care borne by non-wealthy Americans"".",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@Keningignoli-n6y,"Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has proposed to create a new civilian military force that he would control, instead of the federal government. He calls it the *Florida State Guard* and says it would help with state emergencies, such as hurricanes and pandemics. He wants the state legislature to give him $3.5 million to train and equip 200 volunteers for this force .  However, some critics have accused DeSantis of having authoritarian motives and creating his own private army. They fear that he could use the state guard for political purposes, such as interfering with elections or opposing federal policies. DeSantis has also proposed to create a special police force to investigate election fraud, which has alarmed voting rights advocates.  The Florida State Guard would be separate from the Florida National Guard, which is jointly funded by the state and the federal government and can be deployed by either authority. Florida had a state guard during World War II, but it was disbanded in 1947 . If DeSantis succeeds in reestablishing it, Florida would join 22 other states that have active state guards .",2년 전,0,

@mlayton1904,"The Bible is true and can be properly understood and these types of fraudsters avoided if, you understand ""rightly dividing the word of truth,"" taught in 1 Timothy 2:15 KJV.  What that means is there are divisions in the bible that one has to know about, such as ""the dispensation of grace"" given exclusively to Paul.  That is why Paul could say, 2 Timothy 2:7,  ""Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things."".    Today, all doctrines and promises including salvation from Jesus come from the writings of Paul; the books of Romans thru Philemon.  All the promises in Psalms, the old testament, and Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John belong to Jews exclusively. Jesus was not talking to Gentiles, read Matthew 10:5, and Matthew 15:22-24. Peter wasn't either, Acts 10:28 and Galatians 2:9.  (Cephas is Peter, per John 1:42). Once a person understands there are two different gospels in the bible, the gospel of the kingdom which Jesus and the 12 taught and the gospel of Christ, which Paul taught, they would NEVER fall for these fraudulent and confused people. Never.  There are no healing promises given to Paul, given to us today.  None. There are no giving requirements or amounts in Paul's writings either.  Therefore a believer who knew their bible, ""rightly divided"" would no these people are deceivers.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

God condemns those who ask for money to teach about Him and directs us to look at the prophets as examples: ""Say, 'If I had ever asked you for a reward, you could keep it. My reward is only from Allah. And He is a Witness over all things.'""  Our lives and communities would greatly benefit if we understood that faith should be based on evidence rather than blind belief. I assume you already practice this, but if you're not sure, please continue exploring the Quran. It encourages questioning when we have doubt and even provides falsification tests. For example:  1-Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies. 2-Or do they say, “He has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Produce ten fabricated sûrahs like it and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!” Also, the Quran disagrees with original sin: ""No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another"" (Quran.com).   I beg you to rethink about Trinity, Original sin, and bible contradiction.   Quran disagrees with original sin: ""No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another"" O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes regarding your faith; say nothing about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger of Allah and the fulfilment of His Word through Mary and a spirit ˹created by a command˺ from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say, “Trinity.” Stop!—for your own good. Allah is only One God. Glory be to Him! He is far above having a son! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.  ""Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah or claims, “I have received revelations!”—although nothing was revealed to them—or the one who says, “I can reveal the like of Allah’s revelations!”? If you ˹O Prophet˺ could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death while the angels are stretching out their hands ˹saying˺, “Give up your souls!

@H4GS," @sirubisan698  Wanted to quickly copy/paste 2 paragraphs concerning the quantitative data of the current relationship between Christianity and the American population.  “In all the scenarios, Christianity's share of the U.S. population declines. Depending on whether religious switching continues at recent rates, speeds up, or stops entirely, the report says, the Center's projections show Christians shrinking from 64% of Americans of all ages in 2020 to between 54% and 35% by 2070.”  “As recently as the early 1990s, about 90% of U.S. adults identified as Christians. But today, about two-thirds of adults are Christians. The change in America’s religious composition is largely the result of large numbers of adults switching out of the religion in which they were raised to become religiously unaffiliated. In other words, a steadily shrinking share of young adults who were raised Christian (in childhood) have retained their religious identity in adulthood over the past 30 years.”",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@H4GS," @sirubisan698  Regarding Christianity and education: “People who have become unaffiliated after a Christian upbringing are a little more likely to have graduated college than those who remain Christian, with 35% and 31%, respectively, holding college degrees. This reflects a broader pattern: In the U.S., people with higher levels of educational attainment tend to be less religious by some traditional measures, such as how often they pray or attend religious services.”  Regarding Christianity and politics: “Seven-in-ten adults who were raised Christian but are now unaffiliated are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, compared with 43% of those who remained Christian and 51% of U.S. adults overall. Some scholars argue that disaffiliation from Christianity is driven by an association between Christianity and political conservatism that has intensified in recent decades.”  Pretty ironic that one of the main reasons your own religion is dwindling is due to YOUR personal political beliefs 😂 Link to all of this data with time tables/charts breaking it all down is here - https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/how-u-s-religious-composition-has-changed-in-recent-decades/",1년 전(수정됨),0,

I suffer just thinking of how the supposedly “greatest country in the world” is such a failure when it comes to common sense, lack of welfare, living standard, health care, percentage of incarcerated, police brutality, corruption (spelled “lobbyist kickbacks), public shootings/mass killings,  ..do I need to continue?!..  Should (could) you not do better than Russian rural population?! Brainwashed..  The day that you hold your politicians accountable if the don’t serve you - the people instead of filling their pockets, that day you can turn a new leaf and start educating your citizens. That day you may take a first step towards being better than one of the worst countries in the world!

I can't believe  the money they have received  blows my mind !   I've personally  worked in church and lived in full time ministry  I've seen the other side I've  seen how the pastors prophet its something else  just to witness and live  in.   Sometimes we need help from others that's why I was in this ministry  but I was being helped  somewhat I was able to have shelter and I needed that then and we had to commit to full time ministry  for a year so I was getting help a return but to send these people money like this I do not and will not. I've  always have had a  feeling of doubt about these pastors so that alone is a warning  from God these preachers want your $ it's all about $ why don't they have shelters for homeless ect ect so them going and speaking is it I mean people have  tangible needs  that big mainson can house homeless women & children and or men I don't see nothing they are doing that TV mess is over its time  to venture out do some real ministry my opinion .

All that money these so-called Christians could be spreading around to the masses, simply by hiring many of them to do all sorts of at least menial tasks, and they don't even make the slightest attempt at that sort of thing! I'd like to see how preachy they would be with my foot pounding there nuts into pulp! Think that's a little extreme!? Tough! Look at the money these people keep out of circulation that would help the average citizen, instead of these rich airplane corporate executives, because you can bet none of that money trickles down to the technicians that actually do the work! It's like these m a g a people talking about returning America to its post World War II greatness. Yeah back when there were no filters on Factory Smoke Stacks and exhaust systems on vehicles have no catalytic converters to clean the extra pollution out of them! Yeah great going dumbasses! Not only that but your hero corporate executive types are anything but, and they're replacing your inefficient but with robots which do the job far more efficiently! These corporations, I've said this over and over again, are never going to return these jobs to this country, unless they're all manned by robots, since they can get this labor done for 1/10 the cost overseas, or down in Mexico! Wake up dummies, if you don't like being talked down to then you need to smarten up! Think about it these corporate people used to be called robber barons for a reason, there are thieves! Immigration into this country has nothing but played into their hands since the immigrants will work for a fraction of the price of American citizens! Look back at history, and quit wanting to go back in the history displayed more recently, like the 60s, when the Cuyahoga River actually caught on fire, several times! And that was just one of the poison rivers in this country! Almost all the rivers in this country near manufacturing facilities were undrinkable and poisoned, and are going to get that way again, the way the EPA is being suppressed! Of course since I am a sensible environmentalist, I cannot see why the brine mining of lithium and sodium in the Western Nevada and Southern California deserts is being hindered! The only water that you're seeing in those pretty blue brine ponds, is water that is in suspension in the ground and must be evaporated to ever be useful again! So there is little or no environmental impact there! There is environmental impact with any Hard Rock mining, so really scrutinize that sort of activity, but leave the brine extraction alone! You want to see something that is environmentally damaging, look at my area Northern Nevada, where the idiot gold miners, are busy pumping one of the most extensive aquifers in the world out at the rate of millions of gallons a minute, to extract a virtually worthless mineral, yes gold! You can't make a tool with it, you can't use it for electrical conductivity, or shouldn't, since it only rates 70% on a conductivity scale of 1 to 100! Copper is at 100%, and silver at 105%! So why pump out the most valuable substance on earth, water just to extract a nearly useless mineral!? But back to the evangelist, the idiots that listen to these people, are pretty much to blame too! What a bunch of pathetic losers! I see somebody in the following comments mention the fact that Christ himself went after the money lenders in the temple, which was highly commendable I agree, however never forget that Christ was alleged to have killed a boy in his youth with his mental acuity or telekinesis or whatever you'd like to call it! No one ever mentions that, however I could just attribute that to youthful immaturity, since he did talk more about peaceful coexistence after he turned 25 or so. But make no mistake all religions have subverted their original founders better intentions, sooner or later too further their own selfish ends! Look at the Catholic churches Spanish Inquisition! 500 years of the worst atrocities perpetrated on their fellow man, while their own priesthood had orgies with their female priesthood, or nuns, however you prefer! And look at the atrocities the Muslim priesthood perpetrates on their own people in this day and age, actually as far as I'm concerned we should use their own example, and exact punishment, in the eye for an eye type of Justice, and certainly kill at least the parents, and the priests, of their religions for inspiring and encouraging these bombing attacks! They complain about collateral damage, what would you call these cowardly attacks against civilians here!? Yeah, you need to turn their Villages and cities into dust! See I don't believe in any God or religion, and I don't worry about any afterlife, not that I don't believe in one, but I don't think the evil parts of our personalities or Souls or whatever you want to call what exists inside our minds will be allowed to cross over to this hopefully wonderful other side!

@G-K-X,"They misuse the bible to make false promises to exploit sick and poor christians in need! This is serious fraud and a shame for christianity and the name of Jesus! In my sight they are like parasites on the body of christ. All the bibleverses they misuse from the new testament to build their false ""donation-seed-faith"", their false ""give-to-receive""-teaching (Mt. 7,2, Lk. 6,38, Mk. 4,24-25, Mt. 13,8, Mt. 13,23, Mt. 19,29, Mk. 4,8, Mk. 4,20, Mk. 10,29-30, Lk. 8,8), all these verses have nothing to do with donating money to pastors or churches in order to receive something from God! There is 1 verse in the new testament that says something in this direction: 2 Cor. 9:6 - but as you can see in verse 9, it is about supporting poor (Christians).  And its also illegal to use the old testament promises on tithing, because tithing was old covenant (Jews) only, in the whole new testament tithing is not mentioned once as a duty to christians. And what they don't want you to know is, that in the old covenant it was not possible to tithe money, only animals that were born on the land of israel and food that grew on the land of israel - fishermen did tithe nothing! Servicemen did not tithe anything either! And they did not have to tithe money instead. Christians did not receive any tithes for serveral hunderd years after Jesus. But then the catholic church adapted tithing from the old testament in the 7th century in order to financially stabilize their new form of monologue-type church, when it were originally just personal meetings at peoples homes.  One of the oldest and deepest problems of christianity is, that many people want to live off the faith, to earn their money with it. This always brings negative consequences. For this reason, to be independant, Paul worked as a tentmaker. But as christians it is also not our call to produce or attend some kind of monologue spiritual entertainment. Our call is to believe and trust in Jesus, yes, and to live in mutual love with our christian friends (1 John 3,23), being there for one another (Gal. 6,2), entering more and more a satisfying life of togetherness (Phil. 2,1-4), and in this life of love together God will give real gifts to the people to mutually serve each other even better (Eph. 4,16, 1 Cor. 12,31, 1 Cor. 14,26).",2년 전(수정됨),2,

@alexaliennerd3990,"So to recap, the prosperity gospel goes as follows:  God is an omnipotent intangible being that created all life, but they need money - a form of material wealth they can't claim to have or use (and also something they technically created considering this stuff is measured by resources), because doing so means they can't be intangible anymore, but either way God has chosen Earth to fix the financial troubled instead of 16 Psyche, an asteroid that has enough gold on it to turn whoever mines it into quadrillionaires (split up evenly among all humanity would make everyone $93 billion richer)... For some reason, and despite God creating everyone as equals, some random guy in a suit screaming at the TV has leeway with God moreso than anyone else... For some reason, and despite God being so financially bad that they need millions of dollars... Somehow, doing so will make your financial woes go away too... For some reason.

I think anyone would be hard pressed to find any of these funds being used to help those people giving these scam artists their hard earned money.  Had a friend who became homeless and I told her she should call these mega churches that she donated to for years for some help.  She told me they don’t do those kind of things.  My husband and I payed her rent etc for over a year until she got her inheritance when her parents passed and yes she paid us back .  She went right back to donations because they kept calling her to make good on her pledge.  They need to pay taxes at these levels of wealth.,2년 전,0,

@MultiMolly21,"I left the Episcopal Church at the tender age of twelve, because during confirmation class, I challenged the theory that those who don't consciously accept Jesus Christ as their savior won't go to heaven, despite leading a perfectly ""Christian"" life. However; since then my life has been studded with little miracles, including one where this very guy was blathering about some lady with an inflamed hipjoint and in constant pain (which I was, and had gone into the bedroom to turn the TV off) so I flopped down to watch something I never had before, a TV Evangelist. My hip was in its usual painful state, and as I lay there prepared to be amused, the whole hip area exploded in heat, it subsided, and has never hurt since, which it had done since the birth of my son some twelve years earlier. I have to say, this world is filled with absurdity, and if several other events had not occurred to me over the years, I'd at least be an agnostic, if not an atheist. But they have, so I'm not. I have concluded that there is ""magic"", and I enjoy this quasi-religious existence I lead, despite all of the nonsense, sleaze, and bravado of this often disreputable side of the story.",2년 전,0,

They use it to terrorize people instead but they don't live in palaces laden with gold.

@holyravioli8648,"The thing is the burden of proof is one the one making the claim. You cannot disprove that there is a little black teapot orbiting mars, therefore there is a little black teapot orbiting mars does not follow. We have no reason to think sending your money to a conman will get you more money in return, it's not up to us to ""prove"" that is the case.  That being said I imagine it would be quite easy to compare the amount of people who have ""seeded"" money with these conmen and the amount they've lost/gained on average, with a completely random control group. I would guess this analysis would show people who seed lose as much as they spend seeding on average, with a consistent number of outliers in both groups gaining a lot, and many more people losing a lot from the scammed group due to selection bias (desperate people who are on the brink of losing everything tend to buy into these scams more often than financially stable people, after all).",3년 전,0,

@paulbrinkman5631,"Lib'rul Advertisement (please pass around):   “Freedom”  Resonating, In longer and longer Patience intervals The thought to be myself. Emotions arise, From the mish-mash forest Of a thousand voices past, Which our mind is still Sorting out, Or, just trying to get back.  We need to learn To hear them at last, For we haven’t yet figured Their spin, Much less who they are Or where they’ve been, The meaning of within-- Mother, father, Pastor, brother.  To get a handle, We need to place you away, Inside our inner eye, Ourselves as well, And be very still; To watch the play, Or change the stage… With a past-reaction update.  To find your strength, To find your strength, For the self-bestowed treasure Projects through the gate-- Or, just cancel it, And say good-bye. And with much practice fit, The forest will appear then, Without you having to try.     This poem has an interesting benefit -- of showing people how to get control of their own inner thought processes, by separating (“projecting”) present-based awareness imaginatively outward, away from the tumult of our usual, scattered thought processes.  And THEN, one’s suggestions have much greater focus and potency, for freeing oneself from limiting or negative thought patterns, attitudes, expectations.  It points to our inherent INNER FREEDOM, irrespective of physical limitations.   Suggested Readings:  *“Seth Speaks”, and “The Nature of Personal Reality”, *“Dreams, ‘Evolution,’ and Value fulfillment, Vol. 1 & 2”          (Chapters 1 and 2 ESPECIALLY)         by Jane Roberts; “Conversations With Seth, Vols. 1 & 2”,          by Susan Watkins; and,  *“Autobiography of a Yogi,” (to really UNDERSTAND the Bible) and	 “Man’s Eternal Quest”	          by Paramahansa Yogananda.   Most books are available in audio format on You Tube.   ""Dreams, 'Evolution, and Value Fulfillment"" --- ESPECIALLY Chapters 1 and 2 ---- HOOOOLLLLYYYY SHHHH....!",3년 전,0,

@williamwilson2270,"Evangelist Churches and religious BS artists, are all criminal false prophets and damned  by God! Okay that's a given, but 2,000 years ago Jesus was arisen and he sent out his brothers, his Apostles out to do as he did, to heal the sick, raise the dead, and driven out demons. The life-long Pagan Emperor Costantine, hijacked the teachings of Christ and Peter in Rome to bring peace to his city and finally his Empire and from that time on the Miracles of God and the Holy Spirit were turned away from the geopolitical New Holy Roman Empire. Even our English Church and Free Scottish Church is a little shy of true miracles as proclaimed by Christ. We need to rebuild our Churches in the Streets, helping the poor, vulnerable and sick with real faith and belief in the Holy Spirit. Yet, today all people do is attempt to mock the true teaching and to prove the story of Christ as a falsehood? However, the proofs are there, and real from the words of Christ, to the Ark of the Covenant and the very blood of Christ, which while Human does not follow the DNA pattern of Chromosomes we count as normal. Religion is truth, and most of all, it is love and living a good and righteous life. Not selling God's Favours like ""seeds"" of cash to devil worshipping demons who promise much but return only faithless lies. The USA is hoaching with false prophets like Loch Lomond is full and hoaching with Millions of Biting Midges, these TV crooks are like Scottish midges as they are both blood sucking insects in comparison,. Each American would be better being baptised at Luss in Loch Lomondside to be eaten alive by the fiends from Hell we call Midges. It wouldn't cost them so much and they could always watch the beautiful scenery of God's True Country, while they are here! Honestly how can they be so desperate that they buy into that paper trail of stolen cash and think it Holy. In Scotland my English enslaved country we have learned to call a thing by its true title and to all of us US Telly Evangelism is nothing but Male Bovine Excrement in a sandwich.
