@NauticalNightmareDeep,"Jordan Peterson has that look. Before you have time to blink hes already stripped you down to your soul. He has the makings of a formidable warrior which in essence is what hes doing. Being small and weak as a boy was a gift for him to channel his energy mentally. I really like Professor Peterson but all he does is manipulate with intellect as he sees fit. That's marvelous in the hands of a kind man which is what he is, put that into a malevolent person with the ability to conjure something from nothing and you have a nightmare. Artists have a gift for that. Namley an Austrian Artist,",12일 전,0,

@tommyfrans4478,The beginning of wisdom is the fear (reverence) of God. A good dose of God a day keeps the lunacy at bay. I noticed a comment below that a Peterson a day keeps the lunatics at bay. Jordan Peterson must have a healthy fear (reverence) of God. Seeking God with determination and perseverance delivers peace (sanity). A person who is Moon struck on themselves is said to be a Lunatic. God created the greater light for day and the lesser light for night. One in this physical Earth sees more clearly in the light of day and less clearly in the light of the moon at night but when one sees the Light of lights that Created the Heavens and Earth they are overshadowed by the LIGHT of CREATION. May I offer a book in the Bible that gives clarity to my statements. The book of Psalms Chapter 19. Werhner Von Braun had this reference on his grave marker. Old Wernher must have held wisdom that Hitler and the world did not know.,1년 전(수정됨),0,
@tommyfrans4478,"When I talk about the hierarchy it usually makes me uncomfortable. This discomfort results in the hierarchy being afflicted with a horrid curse which is power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. In God's Kingdom, the hierarchy has a servant's mindset but in the kingdom of mankind, the hierarchy has a mindset of a overlord. The first is based on love and the latter is based on self-conceit. King Solomon in the Tanakh asked for wisdom from God at his beginning reign but ended as a fool in his latter reign as he perverted wisdom based on his desire for power and prestige. As a result of this overreach, he earned God's Ire and was told by God that his kingdom would be destroyed as a result of relying on his own wisdom after his demise. The fallen state of man seems to always destroy the best and is replaced with the worst. The wisdom of man is folly to God. When we replace God's wisdom with our own wisdom.",1년 전,0,

@cbchang6200,"Dear Dr. Jordan Peterson, I was watching the talk that you gave at Oxford Union. I was extremely shocked at the statement you made. Here was your statement, “Life is essentially suffering. I believe that to be a fundamental truth.” This statement is the most FALSE STATEMENT I have ever heard in my entire life, and I am 62 years old. I am not sure if your ignorance comes from your advanced education or your personal life experience. I am not using the word “ignorance” as an insult. I am using the word for the definition of the word. Here is the definition: The condition of being ignorant; the lack of knowledge in general, or in relation to a particular subject; the state of being uneducated or uninformed. You are not uneducated; however, you are greatly lacking knowledge, unaware, and uninformed. I was also very shocked to see that you have millions of followers. Which from my viewpoint you are misleading millions of people. Let me tell you what suffering actually is, since obviously you do not know. In life, we all will experience pain. However, how we handle or deal with that pain is a choice, a personal choice. Many times that choice is made subconsciously or unconsciously. Some people will rise above the pain and others will choose to let the pain destroy them and put themselves in a state of suffering.  Pain and suffering are two very different things. Pain can be emotional, mental, and/or physical. However, the state of suffering is only a mental construct; suffering is only in the mind. I will be sharing this letter openly on my social media and website because I feel this is a very important topic. There are many people in the world putting themselves in a state of suffering unnecessarily. I want to help people come out of their self-imposed state of being. However, you as a professional psychologist seem to be doing the exact opposite with your false statement above.  I see that you have a YouTube channel with over 7 million subscribers. I would love to have a conversation with you about this topic on your channel or mine. I have been hosting a podcast for 9 years, Awake 2 Oneness Radio. You are invited to be my guest anytime. It has been my experience that whenever I send someone with a large following an open letter to have a conversation, they do not respond, and refuse to have the conversation with me. It will be interesting to see if you accept my invitation to have a conversation publicly.  I hope to receive a reply from you and have the opportunity to have a conversation with you on this important subject matter. Much Love & Appreciation, Caroline",1년 전,2,

@Kez-The-Pez,"“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” ― Friedrich Nietzsche This quote reminds me of an argument I made recently. If you don't want to read the whole thing, my conclusion is at the end: Porn is not an addiction. It's a compulsion. I advise everyone to stop lying and making it out to be uncontrollable. I had a compulsion towards it due to trauma I endured as a child but I worked hard and I make an effort everyday to see people as humans and not anything else. Men and women alike. We are dependent on something with addiction. But with compulsion, it is simply an overwhelming urge, fed by our weaknesses. If you want to fix a compulsion, you have to build up a tolerance. Strengthen your mind with self discipline and a clear reason as to why you should stop. Remember that reason, and build onto it. Whether it be out of respect of the body, or for your future family.

Which part of that do you think is the wrong conclusion",1년 전,1,
@comfortat," @emanuelephrem4307  No, that's NOT Darwinian natural selection. That's your revisionist history viewpoint of it, now that you know his theory of evolution is completely debunked.  The Cambrian explosion, The complexity of life at the molecular level, Mendel's Law, And many other observable truths make his book ""On The Origin of Species"" a very fine doorstop, or better yet, kindling for the fire.  God originated every species, and placed within them genetic codes that allow for variety and change. This question is already answered in a very simple way, and if ""scientists"" start from the truth of it, they just might find some other important answers.  Starting off with Darwin's moronic, sophomoric and vain premise that life started 800 kabillion years ago in some ooze somewhere puts them 800 kabillion years behind the curve.  God is the author of life, not random chance plus an infinite amount of time. If only true scientists would start from what we already know, rather than forcing Darwin into their calculations, they might actually help mankind.  Instead, they invent new ways to kill babies and profit off of gain of function research.  Here are two critical answers to the two most profound questions ever asked: how old is the universe, and what are humans made of? Until the advent of the modern telescope and satellites, and the modern microscope, ""science"" was unsure. Once these marvels were invented, we learned, empirically, that the universe has a starting point, and humans are made of the same molecular substances as the crust of the earth. Meanwhile...  Moses stated both of these things in the first chapter of the Bible, over 4,500 years ago. He had no microscope and no telescope. God told him these things. How else could he have known them? Moses wasn't hypothesizing, he was stating empirical fact. And he said, just as emphatically, that the Creator told him. Finally, in the 20th century A.D., science figured it out. Believers were like ""well duh, we already knew that."" Except you want to credit Darwin, and then call the beginning of the universe ""the big bang."" What a waste of 4,500 years of science. Imagine if you had just said, ""the universe is not eternal nor infinite, and life was created with a written code that determines its color and size, etc."" How far might science have advanced?

@GabrielConstantinides,"I would argue that Jordan spends too much time flopping his 'linguistical intellectual dick' when he speaks to audiences; I think that he uses too many unnecessary 'high-level' english terms which the 'average' human being is unlikely to know the meaning of. In all fairness in this video he is speaking at Oxford Union and so maybe in this case it is just down to my own lack of linguistical intellect, but I would argue that he does what I am calling 'linguistical intellectual dick flopping' with audiences of 'low' or 'average' linguistical intellect too. I think that his way of speaking inevitably leads to people losing track of what he is talking about, and that if he wants his audiences to gain more value from his 'average speech', he should lower the linguistical intellect required to understand his average speech.  I would possibly refer him to his own words after 13:16 ""and maybe there is a rule of thumb which is never use a high resolution theory when a low resolution theory will do"". I am not talking about theories here, but I think the meaning carries over. I would argue that he could use 'lower resolution' language at times while still containing the full essence of his arguments.

@albertSF,"0:55 opening remarks on HIERARCHY: 2:00 we move towards what we value, away from suffering 4:55 we compete in this pursuit, producing hierarchies of competence, and so inequality – minority [20%] of competitors gets majority [80%] of success, per Price's law (literature)/Pareto distribution (statistics)/Matthew principle (economics/Gospel)  6:40 [right] conservatives (high consientiousness, managerial types) sustain hierarchies to defend values; left [liberals] (high openness, creative types) attack hierarchies as corrupt tyrannies which block new values 9:40 ""a functioning economy and... democracy ...needs both types"" in free discussion, to maintain stability-change and hierarchy-equality in optimal balance  11:50 Q1: can POLITICAL CORRECTNESS ever be good?  12:35 we need a low-resolution description of the world to move through it effectively: a ""general existential theory"", an agreed-upon narrative of ourselves 14:00 one option is collectivist, dating back to monke (and again dominant in postmodern culture): a human is a tribe(s) member, reality a battleground for tribal power > mayhem 16:40 another option is [individualist], developed in Western (especially British) culture: a human is a sovereign individual, with rights & responsibilities > peace and (unequal) wealth 18:15 answer[?]: the effort of [political correctness in] universities to ""sacrifice the sovereign individual view for the collective tribal view ... is appalling beyond forgiveness"" [so, no?]  19:00 Q2: isn't Peterson's [Nietzschean] view of TRUTH as a value for life itself ""postmodern""? 19:20 postmodern view: in mid-60s, multiple disciplines realised there are ""infinite ways to perceive the world""; postmodern thinkers concluded that therefore ""there's no justifiable grand narrative"" for world-orientation, and ironically fled to a Marxist collectivist narrative 22:00 Peterson's (darwinist) view: scientific truth is (somehow) distinct from ethical truth, which evolves from animal behavior into ""the central axioms of civilized human behavior"", based on fixed patterns/rules governing functional interaction between organisms over time (e.g. to play, big rat has to let small rat win 30% of the time)  24:50 so yes there are infinite interpretations of the world, but only some are practically operational, all following a general pattern which is first acted out, then expressed in stories and images, and only then consciously articulated 26:35 the truth, despite postmodernism, is that ""there is something that approximates a universal human ethic built deeply into our biological and social structures""  Summary of the whole argument: A general ethical pattern governs the interactions between organisms most beneficial to their survival and flourishing (their pursuit of value) across the long term. This natural pattern is first implicit in behavior, then represented in mythology, and then articulated in philosophy and science. Western liberal democracy (and its narrative of sovereign individuality, itself preceded by the Biblical doctrine of man's creation in the image of God) is its highest expression, sustaining history's best-functioning societies by keeping the irreducible tension of hierarchy and equality in balance through free discussion. Postmodernism flees from the problem of competing values into Marxist collectivist narrative, masking it as political correctness, a misguided and malicious attempt to destroy this implicit and explicit ethic, which can result in nothing but destruction of life.  Question for discussion: Is it really so that of all cultural systems, only Judeo-Christian > Enlightenment 'individualism' succeeds in maintaining and perfecting the natural ethic, while all non-Western models are a blind and destructive 'collectivism'? Does this not contradict e.g. Peterson's own admiration for classical Chinese civilization? Can we envision a narrative beyond the individualist-collectivist dichotomy, which would still meet Peterson's standards for a practically life-sustaining general ethical theory?",2년 전(수정됨),2,

He said that very often the way we feel about something on a particular day could be influenced by something as trivial as what we had for dinner the day before, for example, and that rationality is merely an instrument of the unconscious. He also knew that the average person isn't capable of consciously creating values. His ""Superman"" concept is a new type of human with an integrated unconscious who is capable of generating values.

@eaglelovely9694,"dealworld father's Hello to my global thinker family. I want to break the culture of selfishness and individual decision-making that has no result but failure. I protest against the decision of a small group of Victory and his decision to put me in the box. How can I close my eyes to the misinformation and selfishness of politicians who think of pulling all the interests to one side and even one group. I want to break the culture where one person makes blind decisions for everyone.I am looking to build a culture where people in my family value thinkers and scientists and choose a path for themselves and a thinking society can win over selfish politics. Came. I want even a first year student to be able to decide for his world. I wish you knew that my goal is not to raise a particular group or country.My goal is to raise public information and the importance of public opinion, when the collective culture of the nations and scientists of the whole world is brought up freely together and the people make their own choices, it is far better than the choice of a small group that makes more selfish decisions. Or it is one person. I have a country. My whole world is the planetBut everywhere I go, only my country sees. How can I go on the path where I have the freedom to see and write and talk with my family and choose them and their opinion? I just know that a love of God is growing in the hearts of people to beautify themselves and The community is growing. If no one knows me and I am closed in a box.I don't even have permission to choose an application that is real and not owned by a specific person. I don't have my right in any country. I don't mean just money. My individual right is my public privilege.How can I trust a country in which I have only heard lies and been ridiculed and unfairly placed in Game and their brother Phil. It is time for me to understand who is a friend and who is not. When I am allowed to talk to I don't have a real group of people and public opinion. When I don't have any place in the society.When they have limited me so much that I don't know about the activity and the type of activity group and the history of my actions. Is it possible to choose with my eyes closed by seeing some numbers and figures for my family? This is the ultimate thoughtlessness of you thinkers. You make the nations fashionable.I'm sorry that you are still repeating the previous wrong thoughts. Each country only sees its own side. I fight for collective interests. Because I love the unity and friendship of nations. I haven't watched TV for about fifteen years, I don't even know where many countries are. I was in my closed environment and dark sky. And I'm still in your dark skyI still haven't seen justice anywhere. I haven't seen love. I haven't seen a stable union. Because thinking is dead. It's just the repetition of previous ideas that are fashionable in universities and books, which are not relevant today. I wish the law of thinking would come alive. And social thinking in the union of thinkers is far away from the tribal race of the country. Thinkers are separate from politicsNow you tell me how to choose that only in one country the level of work and social prosperity will be higher and the deprived will always remain deprived. I don't care about politics because I prefer others to selfishnesBut unfortunately, there is no right for it, because before they ask me, I do it myself with love, and because they get it for free, they see me as a slave. I do not stretch They have boxed my entire individual family and ignored my right. Curse this dirty thinking which is selfish and is still sported by the nations and no one has the right to write or announce it. To say that I follow this wrong thinking. I won't do it and from now on I won't be wrong in this direction.Everyone is satisfied with my kind of thinking, but not with me. Please tell me where I am in your story. Just a mouse under your microscope for information. If I were your laboratory mouse, you would have sported that mouse. A curse on the lack of understanding of humans who only claim to be thinkers.

The only reason for this false prophets popularity is the collapse of the very capitalist society in which BOTH SIDES in politics (ie the fake 'Left' and Right) are just bourgeoisie talking points designed to divide and conquer when no real opposition exists. People feel helpless and here is the sociopath telling them, nothing is wrong, reaction is everything. Just let corruption continue, don't rebel, don't organize and blame others.

Mon 11 Jul 2022 19.24 EDT  Nasa has released an image of far-flung galaxies as they were 13bn years ago, the first glimpse from the most powerful telescope ever launched into space, which promises to reshape our understanding of the dawn of the universe.   This  particular cluster as it was 4.6bn years ago, as well as the light from many different twinkling galaxies which are among the oldest in the universe.   It is “historic” and provided “a new window into the history of our universe”.  It’s an historic moment for science and technology, for USA and all of humanity.”  Bill Nelson, administrator of Nasa, said the image showed the light of galaxies bending around other galaxies, traveling for billions of years before reaching the telescope. “We are looking back more than 13 billion years,” he said, adding that more images to be released by the space agency would reach back further, to about 13.5 billion years, close to the estimated start point of the universe itself. “We are going back almost to the beginning,” he said. Experts have said the telescope, three decades in the making and launched last year, could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos by providing detailed infrared images of the universe.  The initial goal of the project was to see the first stars and galaxies formed following the big bang, watching “the universe turn the lights on for the first time”, as Eric Smith, Webb program scientist, put it. The telescope should be considered “one of humanity’s great engineering achievements”,   “It’s hard to take in how fantastic JWST has turned out to be. It is utterly amazing.”  Nasa said JWST has five initial cosmic targets for observation, including the Carina nebula, a sort of celestial nursery where stars form. The nebula is about 7,600 light years away and is home to many enormous stars, several times larger than the sun.  Other areas of focus include WASP-96 b, a giant planet outside our solar system that is made mainly of gas; the southern ring nebula, an expanding cloud of gas surrounding a dying star that’s 2,000 light years from Earth; and Stephan’s quintet, notable for being the first compact galaxy group discovered in 1877.

@laeequenadvi4746,"NASA'S COSMIC RESEARCHES  EXPLAINS THE FOLLOWINGS.   galaxy studied photo from the deep cosmos, Nasa on Tuesday released a luminous images captured by the largest and most powerful JWS telescope, with greater clarity to the dawn of the universe.  This telescope was launched on December 25,2022.It reached its destination in orbit langrage point 2 nearly 1.5 million miles from Earth a month later.  Scientists will embark on a competitively selected agenda exploring the evolution of galaxies, life cycle of stars,atmosphere of distant exoplanets and moons of  outer solar system.  These images Tuesday,was a "" deep field"" photo of distant galaxies cluster, revealing the most detailed glimpse of the early universe recorded to date.Among the four others Webb subjects getting their closeups on Tuesday were  two enormous clouds of gas and dust blasted into space by stellar explosions to form incubators for new stars-- the Carina Nebula and the Southern Ring Nebula, each thousands of light years away from Earth.  The collections also included fresh images of another galaxy cluster known as Stephen's Quintet,first discovered in 1877, which encompasses several, NASA described as "" locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters.   Apart from the imegary, NASA presented Webb's first spectrograhic analysis of a Jupiter- sized exoplanet more than 1,100 light years away -- revealing the molecular signature of filtered light passing through it's atmosphere, including the presence of  water vapour. The SMACS 0723 image showed a 4.6 bullion-year old galaxy cluster whose combined mass acts as a "" gravitational lens"", distorting space to greatly magnify the light coming from most distant glaxy-cluster whose combined mass acts as a "" gravitational lens"", distorting space to greatly magnifying the light coming from most distant galaxies behind it. At least one of the faint,older galaxy appearing in the "" background"" of the photo -- a composite of images of different wavelengths of light-- dates back about 13.1billioon years. That makes it less than 800 million younger than the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set the expansion of the known universe in motion some 13.8 bullion years ago. REUTERS",3년 전,0,

Europe was possibly 80pct of the way there when survivors of the Holocaust demanded and received reparations. That made a substantial change to their lives but its hard to argue it took European well being from 80 pct to 90 pct. So should the reparations not have been paid? Aren’t there some historical crimes that do not allow us to share the luxury of Conservatism of the kind Prof Peterson advocates?  And if thats so what does he suggest be done to compensate indigenous populations and children of enslaved Black Americans and to victims of Apartheid?

To be one of intellectual logic  In a world of so much nonsensical thinkers. Mr. Jordan Peterson must feel like a mouth versus a flame thrower in a small room.  You would think a person that is as intelligent as Mr. Peterson obviously is, would steer completely away from such odds. Away from a battle that can be compared to scaling a Smooth flat vertical rock wall with only a handful of chewing gum. I believe it is his compassion for the individual and all humanity , and to hopefully contribute to reverting the deadly direction society and world governments are heading that he endures such mental and spiritual stress in a battle of one against so many adversaries. All his adversaries combined do not add up even close to the size of this man's courage and heart. He understands what ever person should but does not or will not.  History tells us that all past governments that went down this path very quickly found there demise,  and completely feel into ruins and disappeared.  Romes demise is well documented as to the issues and events that spelled out its end. America and others world governments and there citizens are replaying Romes  play book on how to destroy you country in just a few selfish and moraly corrupt steps.

@ArdentPardy,"The section where dr. Peterson talks about fair play and rats is reflective of the mgtow/incel problem. After the rise of modern feminism, men began to feel like the playing field was not fair and we end up with a great many man refusing to play the game. I think what we will find in the next few Generations is that men and women both realize that the playing field has been tipped completely over and they need to re-establish this natural historical evolutionary equilibrium or the species is lost. Conservatives may very well be onto a very good solution to this problem by basing their attitudes and outlooks in Traditional Values because those values evolved for a reason.

Instead of using by hat as a blanket statement for all chimpanzees and how they behave, why not isolate it to just this individual chimp and not put it on all chinos from seeing the actions and behavior of this particular one? I probably see a lot more friendly chimps then I ever see angry ones anyways. Im just sayin this is how negative seeds are planted into people for life sentences sometimes more often then others especially if you hear things like this as a child. Then your negative conditioning you have on these chimps could turn into negative decisions made in the future. All stemming from that one time you heard about this one particular chimp that was being ferocious and had attacked another chimp that was out of his ethnicity group and everyone else that he saw that did not wear the same jersey as him and then going back to the little boy he then takes this info and then passes on to his friend who ends up becoming a passionate hunter in the future thinking he is ridding the world of ferocious creatures with every trigger pulled when in realty if he was fed incorrect information from his friend johnny who misunderstood what was said to him back in science class of ‘87 instead of hearing about their true traits which is they are known to be extremely friendly caring and loves humans compassionately.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@fozzy1004," Rainbow Chateau  Jordan Petersons 12 rules for life most certainly had the most impact on me. You have to start from the ground up and go through discomfort to move forward. Getting up early, making my bed every morning and keeping my personal space clean, tidy and organised was a good foundation.  I then started doing push ups every day as exercise, and then cold showers, cold showers had a massive impact on me after a few weeks, it taught me to go through discomfort, and then other little steps which became easier and easier.  It is very important to not just make little improvements but to remain consistent with them everyday after a while many good and positive habits will compound over weeks and months and will build into much bigger positive things in your life.  I now wake up at 6.30 am most mornings without an alarm, my home is spotless and organised, I wild swim every morning workout 3 times a week, read one book a week, with all this on point work and grinding towards my goals is easy, I do have short lapses where I put things off to the next day, but if I try and do that I have my own mental prosses to just do NOW, just don't put things off, just do them now.    12 rules for life helped me immensely on my journey and pointed me in the right direction but bottom line it's your journey and you have to take action yourself, if you can't help yourself then no one will.    Look in the mirror and ask your self is this a reason why I can't do something or just an excuse, bottom line you have to take action and be happy being uncomfortable at the start.

@theworstofallcreatures666,"23:00 Pretty sure it’s not about “fair play” which is a more sentient concept but rather the smaller rat being allowed to experience the basic Joy of victory by the larger rat who understands that concept having already experienced it themselves.   At the human level the deduction is that we cannot continue to experience Joy ourselves if we deny Joy to others. But that does not mean we should relax our standards so others may succeed. It’s probably more about fairness and imparting Wisdom.  34:50 Pretty sure this “orienting reflex” is the fear of the unknown, and the subsequent year spent trying to understand the event is the accumulation of knowledge from various sources to develop the Wisdom necessary to overcome that fear.   The deduction could be that human beings and other creatures appear to have an innate proclivity (because I don’t want to use the word desire) to overcome fear. The problem is that beings of lesser Wisdom will overcome fear through evil means.  39:10 The people that stand to benefit from a particular “system” being in place will always try to maintain that system for their own benefit. Question is really whether that system is beneficial for all of society and if not then how to implement the necessary changes.   For example, in some lands the existing systems of government favour the criminally incompetent who gain power by stimulating the evil within those who are inclined to agree with their “tribal” views. To change this would be no easy task but it all begins with imparting Wisdom.  1:00:00 The underlying causes of hate speech, and particularly group hate speech, needs to be addressed rather than hate speech itself. In addition to the usual such as some longstanding spiritual prejudice, the corrupt views of politicians who wish to gain or maintain political power etc. The legal restriction itself, of hate speech or any speech for that matter, can become a cause for hate speech amongst the lunatics who seek perverse freedom.  So let the corrupt say what they want, and let the righteous oppose them at each level. It is only if multiple social conditions deteriorate that the extremes will appear and grow in power until one prevails over the other. If that happens you just have to hope whoever has supreme military power is of Righteous Spiritual Principle. Because history has proved time and time again that is the only thing that can ultimately prevent hell on earth.   Also, I think it’s important understand that freedom of speech already exists in every Country, but you might be killed or imprisoned for exercising that freedom in some. But that might be the beginning of some positive social change.   1:10:00 The greatest danger associated with a left-wing leader is that their policies will push those in the centre to the right and they will be followed by a right-wing leader. This will go on back and forth until the centre disappears and the extremes grow in power in increasingly destructive ways.",3년 전(수정됨),1,

@theviewfinder8923,"values = hierarchy = inequality (giving rise to power), power that then 'manufactures itself upon the sole [value] of preserving itself,' this is done by insuring tribal difference based upon colour, sex.

@laeequenadvi4746,"Mike Hunt   Particles Physics in Holy Qur'an   The word "" ذرة "" used in this verse  means atom. Smaller than atom indicate that there are particles smaller than atom. Atom is not the smallest particle. Atom contains  neutron, electron and proton. The latest researches of atoms tells that the world of  atoms is very strangeful and astonishing.  Almighty Allah says:   و قال الذين كفروا لاتأتينا الساعة ، قل بلى وربى لتاتينكم علم الغيب لا يعزب عنه مثقال ذرة في السموات ولا في الأرض و لا اصغر من ذلك ولا أكبر إلا في كتب مبين  o  "" Those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come unto us. Say: Nay,  by my Lord, but it is coming unto you surely. (He is) the knower of the Unseen. Not an itom's weight, or less than that or greater, escapeth Him in the heavens or in the earth, but it is in a clear Record"".  If yon see meaning of atom in Arabic dictionaries you will come to know that atom means ذرة and particles.  In 1913 scientists came to know that there are particles other than atom. Electron and proton are smaller than atom.   Allah told in the Holy Qur'an 1500 years ago that He knows all particles smaller or bigger in the universe.  Your comment is useless. U could not understand the important point in my article. Who can tell us 1500 years ago that there are particles smaller than atom. Only a creator can tell us this fact in 7th century.   Modern science discovered this fact in 1913 only. Since Greek period till 1913 they believed that atom is the  smallest particle. Who is ahead? Almighty Allah or  modern science?  Hope you will try to understand.This verse is a clear evidence that there is a creator who created everything smaller and bigger in this universe.  Hope you will try to understand.It is in your broadest interests.   You don't know Arabic. Learn and study more. It is better and in your interests to believe in Almighty Allah and worship Him only and believe that prophet Muhammad is His last and final messenger.   Almighty Allah bless all of us.

""Swatting""   Subject: Hate crime ambush- Sheriff neighbor: RICO  -  Sheriff neighbor lies I get shot?  Cops peeking in my windows. The multiple lies on the police reports can be easily seen on body cam footage. Escalation, retaliation of neighbor,  putting cuffs on me for no reason other than I say investigate neighbor. Not announcing identifying police at my front door. lying about ringing my doorbell. Ambush I was awake for about 8 seconds when I was wondering why they really  wanted to shoot me.  Trying to break my left wrist with known hand cuffs set up; premeditated malicious felony, aggravated criminal assault, deformation of charter, intimidation, false arrest, no Miranda, battery, failure to follow professional standards and lying on police reports. Now Malicious prosecution. Justice delayed, obstruction of Justice by people in positions of trust. Destruction of evidence by DA .

Any co conspirators?     Sheriff Jeff has (2) surveillance systems: Ring door bell cam and a full surveillance system.   Abuse of police powers escalation/ Hate crime from neighbor. I like the one officer's written report of what he has learned from his training and throws his body cam on the ground ""RED Flag"".    Body cam footage. Took me SIX Months to get from the DA.  Police charged me with misdemeanor obstruction charges, meanwhile three police and sheriff Jeff are committing premeditated aggravated felony assault, abuse of power, co -conspiring aggravating stance, Intimidation, unlawful imprisonment as a hate crime. I was just listening to the Sheriff neighbor lying to Police dispatch on audio file next to the body cam file. Now I understand why the two officers were going to shoot me at my front door; with the police supervisor hiding around the corner as not to be a witness to the ambush. Sheriff on audio I picked up a rock in a threatening manner (LIE), why didn't the Sheriff get out of his car he has a gun. Premeditated for the M 1; premeditated psychiatric poisoning, took me two months to recover from pills and being woken up every hour. Intentional infliction - Mental anguish.  Invasion of privacy by intrusion upon seclusion. Malicious intent.  Officers making false police reports. Witness tampering, intimidation, aggravating circumstances Two years later and can't get door cam and full surveillance system from neighbor; proves false reports by neighbor Sheriff to police Dept. Audio from Police dispatch, if I am threatening Sheriff Jeff ""LIE"", he has a gun and I am in front of his house? Five hours of dispatch activity. Waste tax $$.  People in positions of trust aiding and abetting DA office. Deprivation of rights under the color of law. I was not even charged until the DA could ask me what I saw in the body cam and then they charged me six months after the incident.

Peterson doesn't have one, which makes him APPEAR as though he has one to ANYONE who does, which they naturally assume must be the opposite of theirs, because they don't see theirs represented... unfortunately that may be the majority of human beings. Most people avoid critical thinking by adopting an ideological perspective, whether that's religion, politics, identity... even in scientific truths. It's in most of our natures. It makes life simple.  You could see it on the ladies face... she could see he was making sense, that he was only quoting from scientific data not wishing for something to be so... but it conflicted with her ideological belief in what ""equality"" represented. ideologies are simple representations of things... hers was based on the notion that equality could only truly be measured if everything was somehow the SAME, which could only really be achieved under edict from an authoritarian state, with no choice for anyone on anything.   But I bet even you exhibit a residue of ideology, if you don't mind me saying so? You may still feel the tendrils of our current all-pervasive ideology whispering ""this isn't SUPPOSED to be how it works... he's ATTACKING equal rights... DON'T LISTEN...""

@MarcusHitch,"Happy awakening. What you are talking about is ideology. Most people avoid critical thinking by adopting an ideological perspective, whether that's religion, politics, identity... it's in (most of) our natures. You could see it on the ladies face... she could see he was making sense, that he was only quoting from scientific data not wishing for something to be so... but it conflicted with her ideological belief in what ""equality"" represented. ideologies are simple representations of things... hers was based on the notion that equality could only truly be measured if everything was somehow the SAME, which could only really be achieved under edict from an authoritarian state, with no choice for anyone on anything.  But even you exhibit a residue of ideology, if you don't mind me saying so? You admit he's working from logic... but that's only part of it. That logic is based on statistical analysis taken over decades... you reduce that to ""sentiments"" and say he's ""arguably incorrect""... about what exactly? The statistical data? That's the tendrils of our current all-pervasive ideology whispering ""This isn't SUPPOSED to be how it works... he's ATTACKING equal rights... "" (I hope that doesn't feel like an attack. I know that's how it feels, because I feel it too... ideology has an almost gravitational like effect... even those largely free of its grasp can feel its insistent pull).",3년 전(수정됨),1,
@mycommentpwnz," @MarcusHitch  Well, I don't mind if people are idealistic. It's when they violently reject ANYTHING/EVERYTHING which opposes their ideals.  That is fanatical.   When I mentioned his sentiments & being arguably incorrect, I was referring to the entire body of his interviews that I've seen, not this video specifically.   But, I was really just pointing-out that I'm not some Peterson ""fan boy,"" I DO disagree with some of his opinions.   Example: This is literally off the top of my head, so bear with me, but he strongly suggested he believes that a broad sense of responsibility is congruent with ""individual purpose"" and/or ""giving life meaning.""   For him (and people like him) this is absolutely true.   But, people who are ""free spirits"" (like me) are only ever BURDENED by responsibility. I've had corporate management jobs in which I was responsible for millions of dollars of equipment, dozens of employees, and the daily delivery of 4,000-10,000 parcels of mail.  I was NEVER so unhappy in my life.",3년 전,1,
@MarcusHitch,"​ @mycommentpwnz  If following an ideology was simply being a bit ""idealistic"" I'd concur, but I don't think being ideological and being idealistic are the same at all... I'd freely admit to being a bit idealistic at times. I'm autistic and the two can go hand in hand, in my opinion. But my idealism accepts it doesn't have the all the answers, and is still open to persuasion... It also admits it doesn't even fully understand what would be ""ideal"" and knows that my notion of ideal might not be the same as everyone else's in any case, and therefore seeks a rational, moral consensus.  Ideology doesn't work like that. It knows the answers. It's already decided what the goal is, and how we get there... anyone who doesn't agree with the ideological position MUST be therefore trying to oppose the stated aim, even if they share the stated aim but merely disagree with how it can be achieved. I don't think the ideological mind can imagine it is heading in the wrong direction tbh, because it always sees itself as ""working towards the goal"" even when it's actions are obviously counterproductive.  In fairness I'm not looking for a fight. I think we are broadly in agreement, and I freely cede that you didn't specifically state his arguments here (I don't agree with all his conclusions either. I see a certain bias towards a traditional nuclear family... for example, we cannot argue that marriage is necessarily best, because we cannot repeat the experiment with the same child if the parents who couldn't stand each other stayed together ""for the children"" - I come from such a home and it was emotionally crippling. I wouldn't wish it on anyone... ahem...)   Oh, and of course I clocked the ""arguably""... everything is arguably incorrect, so I certainly don't think you misspoke in any way... just a point on terminology... and I don't think your description of cult is all that far off tbh... 👍",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@tajammulsiddiq9880,"These type of discussions are necessary but majority of the viewers don't have intellectual ability to understand these discussions as very rightly pointed out by Elder Lady who asked question from audience.  Lot of topics have been discussed in this session.  What I have understood from this discussion and Mr Jordan Peterson point of view is that :  We need to make a ""Balanced Society"" not an Extreme Society.  Also Some people in the Western Countries are ignoring the Biology (Science) when it comes to defining themselves and inclined more towards their desires and wants. Ignoring the Biology is not a Progress rather this idea is pushing them backward when it comes to forming a society.  Regarding deregulating hate speech, I didn't understood it well but I think there are many situations in which hate speech resulted in creating a massive division in a society especially if it comes from an influential personalities. And that hate speech will give an opportunity to people to do more of it. And sometimes it creates a law and order situation in a society. I believe that in order to combat hate speech, awareness is needed to people but it's a long term effortfull process. But my question is that how can we or State control the damage in short run (protect people from the consequences of hate speech ) if regulating the hate speech isn't the solution?  From the given argument if we allow Hate speech and there are majority of people who are not wiser, and they don't oppose the hatespeech instead they fuel them, then how can we tackle consequences of hatespeech in this situation? Having faith in public here (assuming majority are wiser) would be appropriate ?   These concepts are very new to me and I would like to learn more about it.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Also as per the Sanatan Dharma it is not a choice between either tribalism or individuality but more like a sweet spot balance between both.  if you look at the Geeta it talks about dharma of each individual and postulate that to maintain balance in society it is necessary to perform dharma by individual.  Even moksha is also achieved by Individual and not at a tribal level.  At the same time Sanatan Dharma also includes teachings of Vedas, Ramayana and Mahabharata which encompasses the societal need for tribal affiliation for better functioning of the society like the need to have a proper hierarchy in society to enable better efficiency through varnas (nothing to do with caste)",3년 전,0,

@laeequenadvi4746,"WHO IS ALMIGHTY ALLAH  WHO PROTECTS HUMANS ON EARTH FROM SOLAR WINDS WHAT IF THERE IS NO PROTECTIVE SHIELD  Almighty Allah says:    و جعلنا السماء سقفا محفوظا و هم عن آياتها  معرضون     "" And We have made the sky as a roof withheld (from them),Yet they turn from its portents.                            (Qur'an,21:32) This verse indicates to that our life on Earth is  protected  from solar rediations  and atomic charged solar winds, meteors and other cosmic attacks, pose a threat to living things on Earth.  Asteroids and meteorites have penetrated the atmosphere and hit the earth throughout the course of history.   First of all let us make it clear that the word  ""  السماء"" (Sama) is  used in the above verse which is singular thus it refers to the complete known universe.  Space researches explains that the                                                       "" سقفا محفوظا""   (protecting roof)       has very vast meaning which refers to all  magnetic fields discoverd in space from original magnetic field to  the Earth's magnatic field to atmospheric layers around the earth.   1. Troposphere 2. Stratosphere 3. Ozone 4. Mesosphere  5. Thermosphere 6. Ionosphere 7. Exosphere  Functions of  these layere are to protect Earth from :  1. If these layers have not been existed, life could not be possible on earth.They protect life by providing weathers. Moreover most of Oxygen occurs in this region is responsible for the life of Aerobic organisms.  2. Ozone layer absorbs Ultra Voilet Radiations and thus protects life from hazardous radiations of the Sun.       Moreover it provides ""Green House Effect"" which is responsible for maintaining comfortable temperature on Earth.  3. Mesosphere burns up million of meteors striking the Earth and thus protects Earth from these meteors.   4. Exosphere absorbs harmful radiations from the sun protecting layers underneath.  Above discussion makes it clear that"" السما"" (sky)in the above verse  means the universe.It means that Almighty Allah has protected our life on earth form all kind of threats and attacks from space. Because the magnetic fields  have covered the universe including the earth like an umbrella.   بديع السموات والأرض إذا قضى أمرا فإنما يقول         له كن فيكون o            ( البقرة : ١١٧)   The Originator of the heavens and the earth!

@christopherkopperman8108,"Jordan seems to be making the same mistake that most liberals and probably many conservatives do in believing that hierarchies create inequality. This isn't accurate. The inequality already exists. Talent, resources, desire are already unequally distributed in the world. Even in a non-hierarchal structure you'd still see those with more talent performing better at those tasks. Hierarchies really just organize inequalities into a structure the exacerbates inequality and makes it more noticeable. Hierarchies are simply the best way to address that there are inequalities and get the most value from them. It is this added value that really highlights the inequality. After all when everyone is hungry and has very little it may be hard to see who is the poorest, but when the group is much richer it is easy to see who is the poorest.",3년 전,0,

If I stand up and start spinning to the left, then how can I be spinning to the right AT THE SAME TIME !?   The emergence of quantum physics allowed me to  gain a kind of understanding of Nietzsche’s core concept, but not through my logical brain.  That’s impossible.  It requires a leap of faith.  Now I find tremendous comfort in both Nietzsche’s views and quantum physics.  Seeing the world through those lenses is to be in constant motion.

@titteryenot4524," @stevemorse108  If you ‘attach little importance’ to what you wear, why did you need to point it out as an initial comment on Peterson? This implies you do attach importance to clothes. Or are you genuinely saying that you don’t care how you appear to yourself and others, but you do care about how others appear to you and everyone else? I’m confused. Can I suggest what I think is going on here and you can correct me if I’m wrong. I think you’re relieved that Peterson conforms in some way to your model of a ‘well-dressed’ man, however subjectively defined. You are glad that someone you dig in many ways, I would guess, is someone you can also dig on the sartorial level also. The mere fact of your mention of high-cost shoes when I challenged your opinion Peterson was well-dressed, suggests that like most other people you do care about personal appearance, in others and in yourself, too, I bet. This would only be natural, for as Shakespeare rightly said: the apparel oft proclaims the man.

@stevemorse108," @titteryenot4524  Lets agree to disagree because I imagine we both have more important things to do than waste time here.It is precisely because I don't attach importance to clothes that his turnout struck me. As stated above I think that spending too much time and money on clothes is superficial.. Your hypothesis about my motives is incorrect. You make a false assumption and as rules on direct vs circumstantial evidence teach; circumstantial evidence is of secondary value because it relies on making inferences which can turn out to be erroneous, Occam's Razor  also cautions us to avoid presenting explanations which rely on making assumptions.

@高橋拓哉-c6d,"※The most stupid one is a scholar of winning the Nobel Prize, and the first genius is Prince Shotoku of the medium of the wisdom that excelled in intuitive power.   We are delivered from it from brainwashing of the science (mathematics, physics) got by a lie, and let's regain true study in our hand.    The science is the fiction which I made because the devil denies God, and what is listed in a Japanese old legend and the Christian Bible is true. A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin's evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).   I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 ≠ 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, ∞ which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.  ※If 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, ∞ which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series Σ = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4π^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or ∞ and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f'(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 → 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.   All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.   Message from the spiritual world of Einstein   When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on ""universal truth to certainly say to call God"".    Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan  April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.  x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021  World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day  Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world.   An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea   The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024   Final note  The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

In mathemathical science we have a limited room for interpretation and an even more limited room for the interpretation of math itself. That is a mathematical proof leaves no room for interpretion. It is fundamental, while preserving the complexity of the object it describes. Moreover, the proof captures every aspect of the object proven. It is the most reoluted description of an object. This is basicly the opposite direction of the point Peterson is making. In science we have a way to deal with the complexity while avoiding the problem of clashes of interpretations, although they are still an important tool at the edge of reasoning.",3년 전,0,

@paulafortin3811,"To Jordan Peterson:  I was just rereading bits of Carlos Castaneda, the part about giving back to people who gave you something.   I can give you a little.  50 years of psychotherapy with drugs made me very sick, physically and weak mentally and emotionally. I was called disabled by someone who was a malpractitioner, plain and simple.  But I, knowing he was off base, still accepted the  whole 30 years of it.    That isn't what I have to offer.  I was religious, increasingly, and once a therapist, utterly unable to understand me, started to practice Hindu medicine, which she had spent 3 weekends learning (a 5,000 year old practice, as I  understand it) my spirit was wary, and then she did something extremely wrong and for the first time in my life I heard a voice, not standing there.  ""Get out and don't come back""  I was stupid, and I told her.  But I left and then kicked me out formally.  I got off the 30 something pills a day, opiates, antipsychotics,  muscle relaxers, three antidepressants, Gabapentin, ativan, etc... and within 3 months the excruciating pain caused by more and more drugs my body could never withstand from the  beginning, went away completely, along with the anxiety, the depression.  I went from walking hard breathing so bad E.R. physicians would throw me on a gurney thinking I was either having a stroke or a heart attack, walking bent over with a cane to walking 3 miles a day with no problem, no cane...no shortness of breath.  God  worked with me 24/7 for 8 months. I was troubled when I had started by being thrown out by a husband so his girlfriend could move in,  and then more troubled by the therapists  abuse for 30 years.   And the journey now is worthwhile.  I learned a little later complementing what God gave me, that I took a little of from Henry Cloud.   My parents had been extremely emotionally abusive.  And my mother became more so.  And I left that relationship.  But I went to school to a master's program, and they fought me, put obstacles, because I am religious.  The ""woke"" school.  I had never heard of it. But such cruelty.  I know  now, but didn't then, that they had really no power.  I made a mistake in thinking for a long time they did, and resenting it  for a long time.  When I left, the doors shut.  I couldn't go back.  I knew i wasn't supposed to.  But I didn't want to fail to finish.  I didn't know one can cut  anything off anytime, like Castaneda says, though I had read him in the 1970s.    When I left, God showed me scriptures, and as I pondered it, he showed me one more, especially.  One was he took me from ""hands too strong"" and at the time they were stronger than mine.  The other was as I prayed and meditated and as I had been for 30 years, wrote Morning pages, suggested in The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron, I found myself writing a Manual of Works, ways to write (I had been studying poetry in graduate school, but wanting to write plays, and I am also a visual artist.  I had undergraduate degrees in both art studio and English literature.  In school they said, we don't do plays here, but they let me  take an elective in Ceramics and I took 3) and paint and write not only poetry but plays, songs...And I found the other scripture....""The Messiah is the only  teacher.""  And I had seen the messiah, over 25 years  before in a church when as an atheist and a suicidal, drugged to stupor by the doctors woman, I had  gone  back to church (I had  been saved at age 20) for all the services during Holy Week just ""to see if something is there"".  And when I saw Him the gospel was being read, ""Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.""  I wasn't like them.  I always had to know or I would not believe anything.  What I am saying is, the  path leads a long way, and for me it is still very fruitful.  There is more to the universe than a mindset in psychology can know. Jesus said, ""the way is narrow and few there are who find it.""  Castaneda's Don Juan said, people who believe there own thoughts measure things enough, who are  mostly concerned with themselves and what they think, forget they are going to die and Castaneda's books, like Jesus fierce focus when he knew how close the end was, make it apparent, we have little time.    But inside people, they have their desires.  And outside people, they have a marvelous universe, well beyond their rooms, however clean they are. Jesus said that one woman, a  Mary, chose best to listen.  One wanted her to clean the room.  It is odd how things recur.  Take a look at the  gospels.  Maybe at Castaneda.  Break up your  psychology school inside.  You are helping certain people, but I get the impression you are helping them push back at the lies or the categories, or the whole culture they can't find a place in.  They might have some time.   Jesus said there is a single way.   Don Juan says there are millions, but you have to pick one ""with heart"" and stay on as long as it has ""heart"" then get  off  because anything else  will destroy you.  This is all I have for you.  I know pyschology.   My brother studied, I had those 50 years, I read all my mother's  graduate school psychology books as a teenager.  Psychology won't help you live beyond death.

@Meylan191083,"He completely ignores the reason why political correctness became a thing in the first place.   His description about collectivist/tribal approaches is absolutely right. BUT, political correctness was an attempt to ensure that an individual would be treated with respect and NOT denigrated on the basis of their belonging to a tribal group seen as 'other'.  Has political correctness gone too far? Yes it has and this is a common failing of the left (and I am of the left). We try to go too far, too fast, and end up alienating the majority of people who tend to agree with our basic premise.  Peterson is an extremely intelligent man and although I disagree with a lot of what he says I find him stimulating. My disagreement with him is that, as with political correctness, he has a tendency to skate over inconvenient points. His speaking/lecturing/debating style is highly effective and highly deliberate. He speaks very quickly and does so to make it harder for his opponent and/or his audience to spot the gaps in his argument.  Take the 'gender pay gap'. He makes a very convincing argument as to why it is overblown (and I think it is grossly over-simplified) but one of his key tenets (that women do not negotiate well) ignores (deliberately) the role of socialisation. Females are socialised to be feminine. Ask most little girls what they want to be when they grow up and 'a princess' will feature prominently. Females who attempt to be more like males in some respects tend to be criticised for it. They are accused of being 'aggressive', 'domineering' 'mannish'. Look at Thatcher, Merkel for example. Their femininity is denied and they are ridiculed for it. A woman who might have the confidence to negotiate successfully has to weigh up the possibility that her attempt will backfire in a way a man does not, and she will be taken LESS seriously for it.  That being the case, I think he summed up western political history extremely well and it was worth watching the video just for that.",3년 전,5,

The burden of the proof... So, there doesn't seem to be room for your opinion for socialization as a factor (also you might know if those studies about male being more interested in things, females in faces at the age of four. Months. Very predictably you'll find differences in different brain structures fed by very different hormones.  Again you might have social influence, but you don't need it to explain differences).  And after the facts, some opinions of mine: i see female prime ministers being attacked by the other parties, as usual, by whatever means; i noticed that the right usually is the one expressing women at the top first, and I think it's because they are usually less obsessed with this stuff; i see that a woman wanting a more traditional role is been despised as ""internalizing misogyny"" or something, not the other way around.

You understand about the steering wheel analogy (low resolution thinking) but if the car breaks down you have no understanding of what is wrong or how to fix it.  Your level of understanding is “this brand of car is bad”. His level of understanding is “the reason this car stopped working is because the ECU function controlling the fuel injector to no. 3 cylinder is faulty, consequently the engine is not running properly. A safety function within the ECU is to shut the ignition off if the fuel system, from the fuel pump to injectors is in any way faulty to prevent unregulated increases or decreases to the power output to the transmission which could result in an accident.”  It’s a starting point to realise how much you don’t know or understand. Then you can move on to improve you knowledge and understanding.  You are exhibiting the following :-“[The] Dunning-Kruger effect, in psychology, is a cognitive bias whereby people with limited knowledge or competence in a given intellectual or social domain greatly overestimate their own knowledge or competence in that domain relative to objective criteria or to the performance of their peers or of people in general.”   I’m sure Dr Peterson could explain it to you in great detail.

He was a lad of 12 years old when W.W. One began in 1914, and did not become 16 until November of 1918. __ When W.W. Two began in 1939 my Father was married with Two Children and in was 37 years old. __ He did not 'sign up' for W.W.Two. __ As former military I voted Conservative, understanding the sacrifice(s) made not only by My Grandfather - wounded in both the 'South African' and W.W. One. , plus serving with R.C.N. Veterans of W.W.Two and the War in Korea. _ However, the question asked of me in my Twenties, after the 5 Year commitment to the R.C.N. and at that time with Two Children, actually became inquisitive enough to know more about the Liberal Party & Conservative party. __ This included three times as an Alderman in a small population Ontario agricultural township alongside a couple of Liberal adherents. __ Fine people, but it was quite obvious becoming a Liberal Party member meant being closer to the control of the Tax-payer funding than actually finding solution(s) for the Citizens of the Township. __ Background of military experience was a significant assistance for this Urban raised family to be accepted into The Community. __ My commitment to Family, Church, and establishing a few small business employing between 12 & 18 Employees in the larger Communities centered around our rural home and community fitted well. But I did follow through and learned more about the Two Major political parties in Canada. __ The written record of Conservatism, at least in Canada, basically states: _. an inclination to keep things as they are; opposition to change; ---Liberalism a political philosophy that emphasizes belief in progress, individual freedom, a democratic form of government. __ might still be shown - below (?) __ completion of thought continues ____ 2. the quality or state of being liberal. 3. liberalism. the principles and practices of a liberal political party. __ I have listed two other statements in the 1983 Major Revision of the Gage Canadian Dictionary -- coincident -- with being published - One Year - after the connection for Individual Rights for Canadian Citizens & historical connection to British Common Law & Magna Charta were severed with the never - Ratified - Canadian constitution - CA 1982 - replaced - BNA 1867. _ When I became an Adult Student at Brock University in the 'Freshman' Classes of History and Politics; being a Highschool dropout as soon as my 17 Year Birthday met the minimum for Joining the Royal Canadian Navy; my access to a University Library expanded my understanding beyond the various Night School education of Business and Finance into what our two sons said was needed to complete my understanding. __ One other Brock University course was based on Canadian Journalism including Canadian Politics. -- it was probably then I came to fully understand concepts by using the descriptive word - ' sophism '- to as: a clever but misleading or specious* argument based on false or unsound reasoning. __ Such as the Fake Meme or Faux narrative has been presented to Canadian Citizens and obviously purposely directed at University Students when the Trudeau - Legacy became the fully-in-place China Communist Party Governemt's Manifasto base of Infiltration; was steadily in place: and the Bribery phase was picked up by the __ 2nd Prime Minister of Trudeau - Legacy __ P.M.

The intellectual dishonesty of that statement is astounding. Its like talking to a sectarian religious fundamentalist who is unable to be wrong and who is ever the only one in the room with the correct apprehension of reality and interpretation of their scriptures. First of all, how can the point be made the humans are incapable of making their own values. If we grant that god is real and that whatever is good comes from god and that the highest good is revelation (all things that Peterson argues) then by necessity isnt everything outside of that something humans made? Its an incoherent argument. If Peterson’s YWHW is responsible for all moral frameworks and apprehensions of reality and directly through the story telling of the Bible then where do the different go world views of Indians come from, or Chinese? What about cultural features or values absent of the Bible? Or viscera, why is it that the Bible explicitly lacks numerous universal values? Like the rejection of slavery, the equality of men and woman? Why wold it be that India and Greece were forming Democracies while Israel was busy making despotic Theocracies?

@CarterM54," differentpound5680  The first point, while I don't necessarily agree with - not because the Iranian government is not horrible; if I lived there I would most certainly be ""pushing for regime change"" -  but our government HAS been doing so, unsuccessfully. That doesn't make him a ""zionist"". As far as being criticized for the interview - he was also criticized for many other things, which were all cases where he was right. I just watched the start of the interview and, from the point of libertarian principles, IF Netanyahu's categorical proposition is correct, his conclusion is valid. That said, I will listen to the rest of the interview and update this.   However, one statement that he made is a historical fact, not a logical proposition: the Jewish people WERE in fact driven out. From Wikipedia: ""In 722 BCE, the Assyrians, under Sargon II, successor to Shalmaneser V, conquered the Kingdom of Israel, and many Israelites were deported to Mesopotamia. The Jewish proper diaspora began with the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BCE.""  So, under the argument by the Palestinians for the ""right of return"", that is simply what Jewish people are exercising today.   I am certain that neither Ben Shapiro nor anyone else could ""brainwash"" one of the strongest minds in the world today.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

He eventually got cancelled by leftist twitter, lost both his jobs, girlfriend left him, got doxxed and his mother was continuously harassed and eventually jailed.  Years later he would fall into the deep end of far right extremist and would soon become an omegle streamer where he would make super racist jokes and basically advocated Nazism and aryanism. But if we watched his streams closely there were some moments where his remaining humanity slipped through where he would be especially nice to kids and some people going through difficult times in their life.

Also, how can we expect that this won't then perpetuate a cycle of inequality when those who are outside the favored group inevitably feel the sting of being left out?   Another problem lies within how humans grow accustomed to these advantages as to form a new baseline of expectation to the point that when they are one day ceased, you then will leave the subsequent generation who by happenstance of arriving to the party too late, do not get enjoy the same benefit.

And impede the individual's ability to live lives as they seem fit within the law. Or to be allowed to challenge that law within the mechanism of that hierarchy without threat or harm.   Throwing out labels, insults & epiphets like ""Neo-Marxists and Leftists"" or conversely ""Nazis and right wingers"" is a very convenient tactical way for us to ignore the actual issues & practicalities of complex situations & problems.",3년 전,0,
@isaiahwelch8066," @moosic2i  : The problem becomes when people think hierarchy = government, when this is not the case.  Governments, while a function of society -- and thus a political collective -- also should only be involved when one individual trespasses against the rights of another individual. That's the function of government, which is the preservation of individual rights.  The collectives I'm talking about are more the types that think that the ""greater good"" is more important than the sovereignty or the autonomy of the individual, such as the Neo-Marxists and the Progressive Left, who are, without a doubt, trying to use identitarian intersectionalism to convert a society that is supposed to be about each individual being equally protected under the law, to one of a caste system, where a political intersection of sex or race determines one's worth, thus one's position within the society as part of a group identity or group community.  This is why, rather than talk about individuals who might be black, for example, or Hispanic, you never hear talk about individuals, but rather the ""black community"" or the ""Hispanic community,"" despite the fact up until recent years, those communities were first and foremost part of the American community. This is also why there is never talk about helping all those, irrespective of race, who are at a certain economic level in society. That would blur and destroy racial or gender differences for policy reasons, yet the Left doesn't want to let go of those differences, despite the fact that helping one group over another would be discrimination against a group not helped. For example, instead of having ""opportunity zones"" for black communities, how about making it easier for all people, groups and individuals alike, to have access to opportunity zones? This is why Trump actually did a couple of good things with the First Step Act and Music Modernization Act -- both things that, while taken advantage of by mostly blacks, is accessible to everyone meeting a situational condition: Being in prison (FSA), or being a singer-songwriter (MMA).   These are but a couple of examples where government did things right, despite the motivation being to help one group -- black people -- over others. This is why affirmative action failed as a policy, yet the First Step Act has been a resounding success.  In essence, always give an individual a set of conditions to meet, instead of biasing a policy for one group, and against another. Doing so always backfires.  And believe me, I'm always about questioning things like social hierarchy and challenging it -- but if I find it to work, after such an examination, then that's what I'm going to say and not question it further at that time. Besides, the first things I look at is the claim against something being a problem, and making sure it's a valid and sound claim. After that, I try and determine, in the case of hierarchies, why they might not be good, or might not be working. And then go from there.  However, I will give the major difference between men like JP and a Neo-Marxist or Progressive: JP, like me, believes in merit and choices an individual makes, which is something an individual can control -- thus outcomes are controllable. Neo-Marxists and Progressives want outcomes based on things a person has no control over, such as biological sex or race. This is why the Neo-Marxists and their allies are pushing for political identitarian intersectionalism. This is no different than a traditional Marxist thinking that because a person was a ""worker,"" that they were somehow a victim of the ""capitalist,"" who ""owned the means of production,"" and thus was stealing allegedly surplus labor from the worker. The point that classical or traditional Marxists miss is that first, an employment contract is one the worker agreed to, legally-speaking. Second is that the Marxist never takes into account the autonomy a worker can exercise and change economic positions. I also think that classical Marxists make the mistake of thinking that workers in 1840 are the equivalent of industrial serfs, which was not the case, as workers in both the UK and US were technically free to choose something other than what they ended up doing.",3년 전(수정됨),0,
@JohnDoe-zl6qw,"""Marxists want what never was, and never will be: A society without hierarchy.""  I beg to differ.  They most definitely want a society with a hierarchy; but one in which they're at the top of that hierarchy.  To achieve that goal, however, requires they destroy the existing hierarchy.  Their talk of utopia, egalitarianism, equality, and a class-less society are simply covers for their malicious designs as well as appeals to the well-meaning but naive members of society who are taken in by their rhetoric.  The thought leaders of post modernism and Neo-Marxism need cannon fodder for their ""glorious"" revolution; because they certainly aren't going to risk their own necks fighting for what they believe in.  Better to volunteer somebody else to do the killing and dying on their behalf.  Make no mistake: they want power and they consider no price too high nor anything too sacred to sacrifice in achieving it.  Thus must they always be guarded against; most especially in the universities where young, impressionable, and idealistic minds are easy prey for their corrupt ideology.",3년 전,0,
@isaiahwelch8066," @JohnDoe-zl6qw  : I can honestly say that I, and JP, would most certainly agree with everything you've said.  Interestingly enough, your reply is exactly what Orwell wrote in Animal Farm, about how the farm animals kicked out the farmers (destroying the existing hierarchy), but at the end of the book, the pigs basically became what they had destroyed. Therefore, I see no reason to even doubt, let alone refute, what you've stated. And you're also right that the leaders of Neo-Marxism and Post-Modernism, those who have picked up the mantle from the original thinkers, they are doing everything they can to basically train their officer cadre and NCOs for what they see as a militant revolution. And, no doubt, those leaders would never actually lead from the front. As Magneto said in the X-Men movie where Jean Grey died, ""Ah, ah, ah. In chess, the pawns always go first.""",3년 전,0,

@MonkeyKong21,"@Fabian Vasquez  I think there's a difference between the original quote about how deeply someone has thought about a topic vs. how simplified their explanation might be (which is the complaint you're making).  Peterson has thought about these things in about as much detail as a person can.  One can disagree with his thoughts, but he's put in so much more effort than people who take a cursory glance at a topic that I don't think he can be categorized with intellectual corner-cutters. Politics and religion aren't outside Peterson's wheelhouse either; Everything he's done along the lines of authoring books has been with the larger goal of correcting for political and spiritual problems he's learned about and thought about practically his whole life  What does Zizek have to say about the real world examples of failed attempts at redesigning societies by predecessors more qualified and intelligent than himself?  What does Harris have to say about the wisdom beyond rationality that comes from the development of myths through a darwinian process of story creation/propagation between an experienced generation of people (who received stories when they were young) and the new generation (who passes on worthy stories with mutations following a lifetime of experience and dreams); That went on for at least tens of thousands of years, and the resulting mythology is imprinted with wisdom beyond anything we would make rationally.

@werunthevoid,"I've expressed an opinion quite similar about allowing hate speech to happen - and a friend responded to that, saying that such a proposition would be simply utopic. And I believe there's an underlying dangerous idea regarding human nature running across Western society since the past few decades (maybe even more time than that), and it has something to do with the death of God as well. A diagnosis well putted by the writer Colin Wilson in the Age of Defeat, I believe that many years of mass media (even worse at our day) are the greatest threats to society's well-being, the spread of mass delusions that fuel our innate negativity bias are plaguing the minds of mankind, and there are those since always (like we can track from Machiavelli's time, even before but I can't remember any writer right now) - that profit on ruin, either it be something naturally eroded or manufactured like in many humanitarian crisis they speak about in the media. My point is if you don't put yourself together (there's a plethora of awesome philosophers, psychoanalysts, psychologists, and psychiatrists, and even novelists that can help you with that, Peterson being among that plethora of heroes), you gonna be prone to be infected by the plague of mass delusions, and the most damaging are the ones regarding human potentiality and life itself; which renders debate even for the overskunken among us really really difficult (they are fucking living examples, and despite that they have to face ridicule, and even ostracism for just literally showing that a man can overcome his condition; and it's not outward success I'm talking about, Diogenes of Sinope was the greatest man among all that has ever lived). WE are a mix of war and compassion, and my virtue is not your virtue; collectivist ideas proven to be damaging to societies in many many different times, like a blind man who passes his blindness onto the others; in our case his psychosis. An actually negative thing among human beings is the propensity for laziness, and regarding his neighbor as their God, in other words, laziness of thought; even at times when there was Christianity or any other form of philosophical suicide - that wasn't virtue the main ""regulator"" of man, but conformity. Herd behavior. WE borrowed to God characteristics that are ours, both good and bad - and it's our role now more than ever to discover God within, and become living gods, by constructing bridges to such outcome.

@ChannelFamily18,"Research presented at the ACM FAT 2020 conference in Barcelona today supports the notion that YouTube’s platform is playing a role in radicalizing users via exposure to far-right ideologies.  The study, carried out by researchers at Switzerland’s Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne and the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil, found evidence that users who engaged with a middle ground of extreme right-wing content migrated to commenting on the most fringe far-right content.  A March 2018 New York Times article by sociologist Zeynep Tufekci set out the now widely reported thesis that YouTube is a radicalization engine. Followup reporting by journalist Kevin Roose told a compelling tale of the personal experience of an individual, Caleb Cain, who described falling down an “alt right rabbit hole” on YouTube. But researcher Manoel Horta Ribeiro, who was presenting the paper today, said the team wanted to see if they could find auditable evidence to support such anecdotes.  Their paper, called “Auditing radicalization pathways on YouTube,” details a large-scale study of YouTube looking for traces of evidence — in likes, comments and views — that certain right-leaning YouTube communities are acting as gateways to fringe far-right ideologies.  Per the paper, they analyzed 330,925 videos posted on 349 channels — broadly classifying the videos into four types: Media, the Alt-lite, the Intellectual Dark Web (IDW) and the Alt-right — and using user comments as a “good enough” proxy for radicalization (their data set included 72 million comments).",4년 전,0,

@AryanSingh-fg3oc," @CirrusRoD  I find YouTube and Netflix far more educative as compared to any classroom learning institution, in almost all the fields of education, which requires physical presence of both teachers and students in a big or small room. Schools dont provide any real value, and when I say any I fkn mean it. 0 value. You think they give you tools so you can understand complex philosophers like JP? I highly doubt it. I dont need to spend 20 years at an institution just to know how to type JP’s name into the search bar. I couldnt even speak english properly until Youtube came around and I saw how different people from all over the world have different accents. I didnt even know Europeans didnt speak english. In India everyone believes all white people know english. Thats the standard of education. Everyone is just forced into a certain field and doggystyled with a bunch of theoretical nonsense that we dont need for a real job.  You know its interesting people say they learn more in class than through these digital platforms such as Zoom or Teams, when actually its kind of the opposite. When you’re in class there are n number of factors that distract you including the shyness and hesitation of being among 50-100 people. Add to that bullying and stuff and isnt life just fun after that? But say we take an ideal case where bullying and bad things do not exist. Somewhere in Sweden (cuz I live and study there). When you’re in class, your cortisol level rises to an unhealthy amount, causing unnecessary stress and in some cases even brain damage. This comes in the way of gaining pure knowledge. A lot of other non important stuff gets mixed with that knowledge and the whole process becomes ineffective. Thats why the attention span of an ideal human being is not more than 15-20 mins and the lecture is what 3 hours. Why? Just to make students suffer? The fact that no one raises their voice against this stuff is actually the main issue. I really feel like if schools were actually more serious to educate students instead of judging them with the fkn grading system that they still have (which is like the biggest joke of all times), we would be more happy and satisfied when it comes to finding meaning in life and doing what we love.",4년 전(수정됨),7,

@carledroto3935," @AryanSingh-fg3oc  You're not wrong. In a number of European countries, English is the main foreign language everybody has to learn. And by that I mean, that a student usually can't opt out/choose not to. In addition to that, schools do have, sort of, secondary, optional foreign languages students can choose from, like Russian, German, French, Spanish, Polish, Chinese and so on. Based on that, the vast majority of the educated population in Europe can speak/understand English on the basic school level. But that level isn't enough for serious lectures.  On topic of the attention span of a student being 15-20 minutes and the general distraction in the classroom - good point. I'd also partly agree. Personally, always found it much more helpful, if I could just revisit the entire lecture. Almost nobody can pick up and notice all the details, including important remarks, the first time they listen for 60-90 minutes to the information non-stop. On top of that, pausing and even rewinding last 5 minutes usually helps a lot, esp. if English isn't the native language of the student. And what I find most amusing about it all, is that people are willing to listen to something like a serious lecture or a complicated intellectual debate outside of the school, in their free time. Goes to show the real interest in good content and general hunger for knowledge of the human beings. Schools, sadly, usually fail terribly at that. Plus, yes, ofc, nobody can pay attention to and digest the new, serious, intellectualy challenging information for 8 hours a day.",4년 전(수정됨),4,

University changed my life, the peice of paper is worthless but the knowledge I gained under brutal curriculums that I don't have the will power to inflict on myself is invaluable. Not only are math and chemistry the keys to understand, but they open up creative pathways in the brain for problem solving in general. (A key moment in one's mathematical journey is the realization of what math is; chasing that light bulb moments in it's purest form for the sake of understanding. It's not the notation, although it helps; it's not the patterns, although they may be necessary (Northers Theorem and some assumptions about the necessity of invariants may prove that) it's just the joy of learning.   And chem was just super fun and makes for conversation more often.",3년 전,0,
@ironheadrondo5596," @AryanSingh-fg3oc  If you have the will power to truly learn (like watching dry lectures with more students than views when you get really into the weeds) whilst testing your knowledge (it's very easy to understand something on a surface level and think you you have it down, a mark of a good scientist in any field is the humility that they know nothing compared to what's our there. They don't try because they think they're the best, they try because they like be it and coincidentally that passion increases thier odds of being the best) then major kudos but you should recognize that most don't; uni is rough done right. Sleepless nights, hours and hours of studying to make sure you truly understand the lessons. My mania was a super power, but even with that alone I have trouble commiting day 3 hours a day to blender, dispute my love if learning and desire. I just get burnt out. But studying 3 days and nights straight the week of a big exam was not uncommon as a student.   Idk man, I find it hard to believe anyone has the willpower to do that. I guess you could get to a bachelor in like 12 years (that'd be really nice actually; be able to deep dive) but you'd have to constantly test yourself cumulatively and you need to find a source for those tests.

@AryanSingh-fg3oc," @ironheadrondo5596  yes and no for your first question. Yes I have studied some amount of gender studies, since we study buying habits of men and women and dig a bit on psychology of both sexes, how they think, what platform of social media they use and why they behave the way they do etc. then map out buying behavior depending on age and such. But thats only from a business perspective.   My point regarding schools and colleges was that not only does it not match with JPs eloquent narration, which is one of the major gaps they need to improve on, but also another major point that not just me but a lot of youngsters feel is that it is also most truly and with utmost respect - boring and bland. Its just bland knowledge that we cannot take in. We are not robots. We are humans. We feel things, we experience things, we learn from experience and through other senses. How many senses are being used when we’re in a classroom? Visual and auditory. When we read a book, only visual. And when we listen to our teachers, sometimes the visual goes away as well😜 But on a serious note, what we’re currently doing is producing a bunch of kids who are supposed to shut up and listen to a monologue for hours on end. We wrote learn everything and forget that shit the moment an exam is over and never think about it again. People say you recall these things later in life when you work. I’m pretty sure I’ll never recall any of this bs, neither would I come back to it. If I want to do something, I’ll ask a bunch of people, google it, watch videos on it. Why would I waste my time reading 1500 articles about it when one simple video or one simple click can do the trick. Its as simple as that. Plus this is only one aspect that I feel personally is wrong with the education system. There are plenty more that I can dive into detail if required. But I think you get the picture from this.  Btw whatever I’ve learnt I’ve mostly only self studied. I feel like schools are a waste of time. I still remember the helpless feeling of waking up and knowing that my next 6-7 hours are going right down the drain. I would still have no choice. I have to follow this crappy system. Like a robot. What could I do?   But anyway, I’m glad that period is over and I hope this stuff changes asap as its the biggest scam on earth and I feel like children fall victim to this without even knowing that they are falling victim to it.

@ironheadrondo5596," @AryanSingh-fg3oc  interesting view. I do agree non cumulative testing encourages the wrong kind of learning.   But, as for it being bland and seemingly useless is natural in a study as deep as CS or Mathematics (you have to grind a cirtian amount to be able to communicate and understand the creative and fun stuff. Also, I would argue it's not simply retention of facts or theorems, but the pathways in the brain that get enforced help with problem solving and objective thinking and abstraction (a powerful tool in any discipline, to be able to almost leave this world for one of ideas and models (we all have to come back to some pen and paper occasionally, less we lose track))  A huge problem with YouTube education is the confidence vs competence phenomenon (people with very little competence after a shallow 15 minute video on something feel very confident in their understanding. But, if tested you'd find that they really don't know the core derivation nor the correct application of this shallow knowledge)  I think the answer lies somewhere in between. A eutopian decentralized system where curriculum and testing are set up in a way that the students, teachers, and any people from the field we can get are satisfied with the curriculum.

@AryanSingh-fg3oc," @patriciafranco9313  If thats what you inquired from my comment then I’m sorry to say you have misunderstood the whole point of this entire thread.   I am open to new ways of learning. That is not the problem. The system is not open to give me new ways of learning. That is the problem. It fixes the methods of knowledge acquirement as well as testing. I have already talked about knowledge acquirement above. You can read it again for more clarity. Let me give you a quick tour of our examination system while we’re on the subject. If you actually believe that examinations are a correct method to test your knowledge and reflectivity skills in today’s day and age (or even the past decades that followed the internet boom), then I would say there is something wrong with you. Please enlighten me, in what way are they testing our knowledge by putting us in a room where we cant talk or use technology, cant even use books or notes, and in some extreme cases cant even use a basic piece of technology like a bloody calculator. We’re supposed to complete this task in 3-4 hours without any help and without making a single sound like we’ve been placed on a fkn time bomb that can explode at the slightest of mistake or if you take too long to diffuse it, its mission failed. Literally, thats the only situation I can think of, that this system might come to use (although even in a time bomb situation you’re allowed to use technology and you can talk to people). What are they preparing us for, by taking an exam? Like for real, wtf are they preparing us for? Literally no real life profession or scenario matches with that setting. Just think for a second. Take a second, pause and think what on earth has been going on with people for 20 years of their life, not for decades, for centuries and centuries. Forget about the subject or context. Take whatever subject. Doesn’t matter. Why this setting? Thats the question. Why cant we choose where we get our info from and use whatever we have or can find, during an exam. Why is there a time limit of 3 hours? Why cant we take as much time as we want, without panicking and give back some actual quality work that can be used by the world? (Ofc there has to be a limit but it can be days or even months or even a year). Whats the rush of 3 hours, I fail to understand the point of it. There’s no professional job that gets done in 3 hours. Why is it even called a fkn exam/test? What purpose does it serve? Is it a memory test? Is it a anxiety test? Is it a pressure test? What are they trying to test? It should be called “Knowledge Reflecting day” or “Knowledge Reflecting month/year”. There are so many things that can be done to make it exciting and produce better human beings who dont look like zombies as they march brainlessly to their 9-5 jobs, but yet its 2022 baby and we’re still using sticks and stones.  You may argue like some people do, “ooh at least exams teach you morality and respectfulness” to which my response would be- whats the first place where you learnt how to cheat? If your answer is not school, congratulations you are among the 1% who followed the retarded system perfectly. Go ahead give yourself a little pat on the back. Feel proud of it. Whatever. Who cares. For the rest of us 99%, of the earth’s population it was school and probably the only place where some of us would ever cheat in our entire lives. It has no correlation with cheating your parents or your partner or your country. It doesn’t work like that. Who are the most corrupt people on earth? Is it the people working 9-5 jobs, who pay their taxes on time while providing for and loving their partner and children. They probably cheated during some exams just to get by, doesnt make them a cheater for life. Probably some of the most innocent people in the world cheated in exams. Or is it the CEO’s of big companies like Facebook and Microsoft who got straight As during their school/college times? Never cared about cheating in school/college. Well, look at them now. Or Is it the businessmen with MBAs and lawyers with phds who climb up the corporate ladder just to push everyone down? Is it the teachers and professors who know all about this and yet decide to ignore all of it, like it doesnt exist, cuz why tf should they care? They get their salaries from the government. You’re not directly paying them. So you or your knowledge can go to hell and they can just produce more braindead zombies who wont question the system.  Great world we live in.",3년 전(수정됨),0,
@AryanSingh-fg3oc," @ironheadrondo5596  haha welcome back. Yea you covered all my points. Dont worry I wont fail you if you didnt😆  But yea coming back to one of your points about decentralization. Good point. I however dont think it should be a mix, it should be completely decentralized. Ofc it is up to the student to learn, but it doesnt hurt if the process itself boosts this process by making things more interesting and teachers more conscientious. Someone like JP who hooks your attention the moment you click on his videos. But this is still not enough. I’m not just talkin about hiring competent teachers. I’m talkin about revolution. Call it the educational revolution, where everything is changed, from methods of knowledge acquirement to methods of knowledge testing. By engaging both body and mind to learn through experiencing. Experiences we remember for life. Dude, how many people remember the contents of a subject after a class or an exam? Do you remember what you wrote for a particular question in grade 8 in a history test? Can you replicate it again rn? No. Then what did you learn from that? Wouldnt it be good if you and your friends actually visited that place, saw the massive structures with your own eyes, spent an entire day walking in the halls of a monument, while the locals tell you what had actually happened and what the history book wont tell you. Similarly, for mathematics or physics, if they could use real life objects and demonstrations instead of a marker and a board, wouldnt it be more fun?   The education system right now is killing students. Its quite literally taking away potential by not providing students enough brain stimulus. Look at gaming. Where it started and where it has reached. Now compare it with the educational system. Hasnt changed since god knows when. Clearly not enough to provide a 21st century kid enough brain stimulus. Then ofc there’s the fact that every subject has their own teacher, but only one student is expected to take everything in. 8-10 subject teachers vs 1 student. Fair?",3년 전,0,
@ironheadrondo5596," @AryanSingh-fg3oc  that's alot, I'll come back.    One note I'd like to make now; I am for total decentralization as well, but with teachers and industry personel included as participants (students can't know what they need to know to understand something new) maybe a system with graduate students helping guide the ones below could survive. But I fear students don't think that, idk solving polynomials for example, is important; as a computer can do it! However, the grinding to understanding is the only way we know of to breed success. I fear students will have ""music theory"" or something easy and fun carry more weight than it should. I also see mathematics (my major, my passion) being subjegated to a supplementary role for the ""cooler, more interesting"" sciences.

A man who counters Vegan extremism with his own insane carniverous diet. A man so insecure he wants to 'show who the boss is' on toddlers like my psychopathic father who became a convicted criminals and thought cruelty and cynicism was 'realism'. The only reason for this false prophets popularity is the collapse of the very capitalist society in which BOTH SIDES in politics (ie the fake 'Left' and Right) are just bourgeoisie talking points designed to divide and conquer when no real opposition exists. People feel helpless and here is the sociopath telling them, nothing is wrong, reaction is everything. Just let corruption continue, don't rebel, don't organize and blame others. I despise the 'woke' garbage as much as Peterson does but he is full of shit. Look at who he talks to. The naive and empty headed just like the 'lie berals' do (think Blair as a so called 'opposition' to Thatcher.) Blaming long dead socialism for the collapse of our society into a 1% oligarchy always at war. The 'woke' phenomenon is a fake opposition to conservatism.

But there are standards to ensure that unsubstantiated claims don't make it to print so that people who do not live without a standard of fact do not confuse fact with conjecture.

@Rubin_Schmidt,"Is this leaked info really Trudeau’s crazy COVID plan for 2021? You decide … Posted by canadian report on October 14, 2020 02:17 Tags: COVID-19 restrictions, LPC Strategic Committee Leak Categories: POLITICS RECENT POSTS I want to provide you some very important information. I’m a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning committee (which is steered by the PMO). I need to start off by saying that I’m not happy doing this but I have to. As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes. The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows: – Phase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020. – Rush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020. – Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020. – Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 – early January 2021 – Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021. – Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021. – Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 – Q2 2021. – Enhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021. – Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021. – Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021. – Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021. Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians. What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief. This is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program. In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever . The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada’s HealthPass) . Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told “the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details”. Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate. When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely. And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized . So as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I’ve ever witnessed before. In the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not. That it wont just be Canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas. That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone. The members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored. Our opinions and concerns were ignored. We were simply told to just do it. All I know is that I don’t like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future . Vancouver, Canada·Posted Today, October 14   !!!",4년 전,1,

@nagrajan777,"I started with a fairly negative bias against JP because I came to know about him from articles and videos that were critical of him. There is a great video series called the alt-right playbook (its pretty good work, and well presented) which avoids naming him but it has lots of criticisms of certain points of view, and a comment stated that some of the viewpoints were those of JP. Another was an article which vilified JP for defending James Damore - who i think seriously lacked foresight and made a staggering blunder. I mean, he stated in his posts that women were more susceptible/sensitive to negative feelings and emotions. That itself should have warned him how women and thereby google HR will see it. Also, he probably didn't have the eloquence or knowledge of JP to back himself (even if he had, he wouldn't be given the chance to defend himself anyway).  These sources had formed a very negative picture of JP in my head... However, I was curious about how JP did it!! I mean, the way his points of views had been presented to me - thy were almost indefensible to any sensible person. How did JP do it? What did he say that millions of people (who I had no reason to assume were malicious) had been so affected by his words that they had decided to side with these seriously flawed, seemingly extreme and possibly harmful points of views (as they had been portrayed to me)?  Once I had seen a few of his videos... I am completely blown away. I am appalled in the way the left leaning sources have tried to malign his message - its nowhere near how it has been portrayed. They are seriously doing themselves a disservice, and losing their credibility in the process. They might gain a little in the short term, but will lose big time in the long term, as people come to know the underhanded and malicioius ways they are operating.  Now that I have seen a few of JPs videos, I have a much better understanding of where James Damore was coming from. In JPs words (rephrasing), the world is very difficult to change - and James Damore's attempt of changing it (with best intentions) was well meaning, but was not well planned and thought out and thus, in a way, destined to fail.",4년 전(수정됨),30,

@lr2357,"I like most of what JP says. I hope that he is what some people (primarily young men probably) need to get by and make sense of life. I also don’t think he’s wrong or bad for saying that there are general differences between men and women, or his more controversial views like IQ differences or the sexual reasons behind the wearing of make-up. If his statements about these things are true, or if he personally believes them to be true based on cited evidence, he has every reason and right to make them. I think the issue I’m about to raise is probably a sense shared by many critics of JP, that has not yet been plainly or effectively articulated—probably because it could be seen as unfair, unprofessional, speculative, or ad hominem. But here’s the question: As I said, I do not have a problem with his views that men and women have on average different strengths, that different ethnic groups have different IQ’s, that some hierarchy is justified and capitalism isn’t the main problem, that having many female sexual partners can lead to psychopathy, that women wear lipstick at work to simulate sexual arousal. I have no explicit problem with these views because they may all be true even if it can look to liberals as though he is “attacking” (not just critiquing) these groups that liberals typically see as victims: black people, women, the poor, etc. My concern is not over the legitimacy or illegitimacy of his views. And whether you see a group  as victimized or not, victims can be fairly critiqued too. But my question is why is it that of all the issues he could focus on, and of all the positions he could take on them, he always ends up arguing that X group claiming to be oppressed, is actually not oppressed. I’m not saying that it influences JP’s views on these issues of oppression, but it’s true that by denying the oppression of say, women at work (by men), or blacks in society (by whites), or the poor in capitalism (by a mostly white, predominantly male upper class) Peterson—being a wealthy, white man—IS also relieving himself of guilt. Don’t get all up in arms about my repeated use of terms like “white men,” I am one, and don’t want to be stereotyped either. But let’s just admit that Jordan Peterson is human, and if he has any ego at all, then there’s part of him that would understandably be inclined (biased) to believe in arguments that exonerate him from guilt; such as the arguments he makes regularly. I’m sure that he thinks he believes in the views he puts forward. But is he more human than he’d like to admit, and is letting his personal feelings, emotions, and ego cloud his sense of objectivity without knowing he’s done so? I think even he would admit that this is possible. No level of understanding of human nature, frees us from having one. I think if Peterson were as rational and clinical as he pretends, would be of no use or interest to anyone; you must have emotional passion to do what he does, it can and will lead one astray, but it cannot and will not be completely eliminated.   Just a thought. Peace and love. Everybody keep thinking critically.",4년 전,3,

Though, her family must take a back seat, unfortunately, which many women are not ready (or do not want to) to do. About blacks, the only argument that you can make that blacks are opressed by whites is through how many people are in prison. Though, the key word is CAN, not that it is true. Since, if we look at asians they are....lets just say they are not part of the ""race"" (not the skin of someone) they are so far ahead more often than not that there need to be higher requirements for them.   Also, given that the parents of Peterson were a librarian and a school teacher, he wasnt always wealthy.

@haripetrov1289," @Zorooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  Socialism seems to be a period of time for a country being socialist where inevitable more often than not leads to communism. So, socialism can be simplified as soft communism. Communism is supposed to be stateless or whatever, but I am wondering, how or who will distribute to who needs what and who says that this person contributed that much and whatnot other than a government. The stateless part seems to be the most thing lots of people who say that there wasnt truly any communism. They are technically right, to an extend, though, the same people go on to say how wonderful communism is. Feminism, primerely 3rd wave Feminism is for women, period. 1st and 2nd wave were needed, yes, and one thing that feminists helped men is to redefine rape in the US, because in its wordering as law implies that men cant be raped, and that was about in the 60s, 70s. I am not sure what else feminists (1st and 2nd wave) have helped other than women, which was needed and still, it wasnt only women doing it to themselves, or some other minority (not ethnic in that sense) of women. Men also helped women quite a lot. Today feminism's great struggles in the West for a time was mansplaining.... meanwhile if we look at women in Africa, most Muslim countries (emphasis on most, not all), and in some East European countries, lets just say that they are actually opressed.   If really communism is supposed to be stateless. Can you explain how, in a simple (not way too simple) way? I even went on r/socialism on reddit aaaaand was banned for, and I quote: ""Liberalism"", that was interesting given that I am center-right or moderate conservative too. Hope you can explain it to me. When I have asked, lets say on reddit, most just say, place without borders, basically anarchy. And if you believe that is possible to be done. I would like to see it happen, but if we look at even the first human civilisations in Mesopotamia (I probably butchered the spelling, English is not my native language, I am from ex-commie state too) lets just say there were hierarchies. Hell, even animals have them.  China is supposed to be for the people, republic and chinese, 1 out of 3 is true.

You can easily take out a binary characterisation, add a million more details and groups, and yet virtually everything else Marx wrote would still stand. Peterson's simplistic analysis is unsurprising howevrr given, by his own admission, he's only read the communist manifesto and only or twice when he was but a young man many years ago.

Absolutely the defining feature of postmodernism is the rejection of narratives like absolute truth or moral truth and to be a feminist requires refusing this hypothesis by definition. Feminists need a moral standard for their claims such as ""patriarchy is wrong""; according to consistent post-modernism, patriarchy is just another equally valid cultural product because the epistemic standard is in merely holding such views to be true or valid.",4년 전,4,
@laeioun," @duxliberty7593  Well, Jordan Peterson himself says he doesn't get the alliance between post-modernists and marxists either. Yet, for whatever reason, they have aligned themselves with each other. The fact that feminists claim things like ""patriarchy is bad"" and ""the west is a patriarchy"" does not prove that they believe in objective truth, in fact, it shows quite the opposite. Just ask why they align themselves with the doctrines of Islam, which are objectively far more patriarchal than any western doctrine. I mean, a man's testimony, according to Islam, is worth twice that of a woman's. They believe that western culture is tyrannical and unjust. They blame patriarchy for most problems. Why? Is it because patriarchy is actually to blame for most of our problems? No, but it's a good claim to make for someone who wants more power and authority over how people live and think. If every idea is equally valid, then they don't care what ideas they use to get power, they just want power, so the postmodernists are happy to align themselves with neo-marxists and third-wave feminists in order to obtain power. Remember, they don't believe in hierarchies of competence. They don't believe in the inherent value of some ideas over others. They only believe in power.  EDIT: You've still not quoted him directly. You're trying to assert what he thinks by summarising it for him. Otherwise known as strawmanning. You've either neglected or refused to consider his real argument and are now inventing an argument that you wish he made that you can attack very easily. This implies that you're afraid to fight his real argument. If you're not afraid, then quote him, specifically, and argue against the actual quote. That would be a good start.",4년 전(수정됨),1,
@duxliberty7593," @laeioun  I'm afraid that's simply just internally contradictory. You cant admit theres something wrong with your analysis and then go on saying it. Many feminists literally oppose both relativism and the doctrines of Islam, so where's the alliance? It's make believe conspiracy theory. That's the thing about peterson, he's right to have an issue with post-modernist's attack on maths, science, evidence and reason, but then he goes on to commit the same mistakes himself. Not surprising from a religious conservative. His reason can only get him so far cause at some point he needs faith. In summary, Peterson is a case of ""what's true in it isn't new, and what's new isn't true."" His refutes of post-modernism are poor as well, the only argument I've heard is that ""there aren't infinitely equally viable responses to any problem"" which is true, but this won't satisfy the post-modernists or even address the core philosophical problem. They can merely say ""but what standard are you measuring 'viable response', you're presupposing a certain goal and all goals are merely personal value biases. Why should avoiding suffering and death be our goal? That's just your opinion."" and so on. The best philosophical refute to post-modernism has already been advanced by much greater thinkers than peterson, and that's to point out its self-refuting nature. It has to attack objective truth by using it themselves. Their epistemic standard validates all opposition to post-modernism itself",4년 전,3,
@laeioun," @duxliberty7593  ""I'm afraid that's simply just internally contradictory. You cant admit theres something wrong with your analysis and then go on saying it.""  You can't just call everything you disagree with ""internally contradictory"" or ""incoherent"" or ""inconsistent"" and then not have a concise argument for it. You're missing the point. I did not ""admit"" there's something wrong with Peterson's analysis. I stated a flaw in your thinking. You assume that feminists, marxists, and postmodernists are purely logical people. They aren't logical in the least. Pointing to a contradiction in their beliefs does not mean that they don't believe it. People believe contradictory things all the time. The fact that it wouldn't make sense if they believed that does not prove that they don't believe that. It just shows that, if they do believe it, then they are wrong for doing so.",4년 전(수정됨),3,
@laeioun," @duxliberty7593  ""Why should avoiding suffering and death be our goal? That's just your opinion.""  Suffering is not an opinion. Are you really going to argue that moving away from suffering is a bad goal/value? If you are, then don't call yourself human. People can easily use that thinking to justify genocide. It isn't correct. Peterson simply presupposes what we should all presuppose to be the case if we want to live in any kind of functional and humane society at all. Modern-day feminists think that everything comes down to social construction. Peterson argues, based on the most well-founded scientific research on the matter, that exactly the opposite trend is true. As cultures get more egalitarian, the differences in temperament (as a result of biology) magnify rather than shrink. A postmodernist is, by definition, anti-science and anti-objective. The feminists, postmodernists, and neo-marxists have now allied themselves in objection to these kinds of irrefutable scientific findings because it is now in their interest of their ideologies to change science itself. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. The original definition of feminism and the original movement it represented was pro-science. Now you have a bunch of subjectivist clowns running the show under the banner of feminism pretending that they're the same as real feminists. Ultimately, they're all incoherent, regardless of what they call themselves.",4년 전(수정됨),4,
@duxliberty7593," @laeioun  so, it's obvious I'm not going to get anywhere with you cause that's just a blatant misquote. You realise I was presenting what post-modernists would say themselves, right? As in, not my position. I'm a naturalist; morality is universal - and conservative values are universally maladaptive. Then I presented my own refute to it? Point being, I'd spend all day clarifying what I obviously mean to you... the rest of what you've said is more of the same drivel. Just asserting that feminists are now post-modernists (which we've both agreed that they can't be, by definition), and apparently marxists as well (???) in spite of the fact that feminists are rallying against pro-rape cultures in Islam right now, like literally right this instant, is not a falsifiable argument.",4년 전,2,
@duxliberty7593,"​ @laeioun  look. I'll give you this much since you at least admitted that ""it doesn't matter what they call themselves"" which is a start, of a kind - there are some people I've noticed who call themselves feminists; erroneously that is, because they're actually just cultural relativists, moral relativists - or if you like to be less specific, post-modernists. Feminism allows now relativism however, either you care about people's cultures and feelings, or you care about gender equality. Those are mutually exclusive of course. Anyone who stands up and supports FGM is not a feminist, regardless of what they call themselves. The word indeed has been hijacked to some degree by the politically correct, but the word has no meaning. The meaning is in the concept. The same also certainly couldn't be said for marxism. The most you could say without appearing insane, which apparently you or peterson don't mind, is that calling oneself a marxist is hip or chic at the moment :)",4년 전,2,

@Primus54," @SalmaPaz  One of his “broader points” is that, as much as we try to shape society to some imagined Utopia, there are certain natural  characteristics of human beings that are biologically and evolutionarily programmed (scientifically determined) that no amount of foot-stomping or denial is going to change.  I am an educated, well-read 67-year old with an IQ of 138.  I could take great offense at your generalization of those you believe most “vulnerable” to JP’s wisdom, however I’m sufficiently wise to know when it is a futile endeavor to attempt logical arguments with those ruled by their emotions.",4년 전,1,
@SalmaPaz,"​ @Primus54  JP literally tries to argue that women invite sexual harassment by wearing makeup and women and men cannot work together using oversimplified evolutionary arguments. He clearly tries to push a view that benefits and excuses unacceptable behaviour by men. If one cannot control themselves as a man from sexually harassing a woman when they see her wearing makeup, they are messed up. It's not some evolutionary trait that all men have, it's because they're a perv. Plus, I also said that his arguments are used by people who want to excuse misogyny, not just idiots. If anyone is ruled by emotions, it's you for defending someone who has on multiple occasions tried to argue that women and men cannot work together, based on illogical, over-simplified and outdated arguments. The original comment I replied to stated that they cannot understand why people hate this man. You as a self-proclaimed wise individual who uses logic, is siding with this comment trying to argue that JP makes sense and no one should hate him, despite the truckloads of illogical word vomit he has spewed over the years that CLEARLY tries to push for a misogynistic system that hurts women? Do you, but that's just dangerous and sad to me. PS, having a high IQ, being 67, and having an education do not automatically equate to someone being smart.",4년 전,1,
@Primus54, @SalmaPaz  Sure am glad you disabused me of the notion you are ruled by your emotions.  🙄,4년 전,1,
@barrytelesford5265," @SalmaPaz  . yes! as simple as you have stated it the response is simple as well. another comparison for you. bees are attracted to the flowers not the leaves.  the leaves are everywhere but the flower is pretty, has the aroma and what the bees wants. on a basic level makeup is for desirability and the response is attraction of the opposite sex.  the issue with that is the opposite sex come with various degrees of discretion. sexual harassment is one form on the spectrum of attraction. in this instance the man goes to far and breaks social rules whereas the social que would have been to have control and cede to the woman's acceptance of his advancement. You are not asking me whether or not it is right or wrong, whether i think it ought to be the case or not. you are asking me to state what is or what has been happening. from an objective observation standpoint I am answering you according to your question. but i do however understand that people don ask proper questions or the ask a questions but  in fact state their objection within it. if that is the case don't ask me a question just come out and state that you think it is otherwise and we could advance the conversation further along. however, if it is just an emotional venting session well that is another matter altogether.",4년 전,2,
@barrytelesford5265," @SalmaPaz  reading your response to others i see that you have been dealing with one false notions. that men arent advance beyond the biological gravitation to attack a women merely because we have lust for her. that is the plain point you have been repeating to others yet you forget that the majority of men do have discretion and hold other men in check. it is not women who controls men it is men. we set societal standards now, as we have always done. because when men gets out of line women dont have the physical power to stop us. they can only exercise such power through use of other men but not practically themselves. the fact that men are not grabbing women en masse and dragging you all to the cave for sex is not because of you women. it is because of men. so therefore we do know pretty well what the ideals and ""oughts' should be. And whats more we are in a better position to tell you what triggers our responses. not you. the sheep cant tell the wolves why the wolf is hungry. when the wolf is hungry, if the wolf is hungry. the sheep can only hope that the wolf is not hungry for the sheep when the sheep is wearing makeup and a big arrow sign saying 'I am right here' but its a difficult thing to ask the fish about the water it swims in so is it to try to make a woman understand the mindset outside of herself. I could understand how you think. victims have lots of things in common. even the passive aggressive counters to arguments with with reharshed narratives and terms. ""misogynist' toxic masculinity, patriarchy, etc. lol in a man's world when the weakest boy cant put up a fight he often put up words. the words is supposed to hurt in the place of his physical deficiency. Women adopt the same approach. but even in that regard. who are the top sociologist, psychologist, social scientist. still men. the mere fact that we are even discussing one man against a sea of feminist who not much people really care about or remembers just aligns how even in your own space a man will find a way to conquer.",4년 전,3,

I don't doubt for a second that he agrees with that, or that he is as conversely as shocked as I am by his meteoric rise to fame based upon some fairly apparent principles. But, I'm all for lending an ear to another mans wisdom, most especially in such desert like circumstances for would-be intellectuals. What can I say to make this worth replying to for you? Nothing. I'm devoid of cynicism today and albeit having read his books and listened to his lectures, I'm presently unable to think of anything that really annoys me about Peterson or his philosophy.

His position contradicts his idea of Logos and follows the Hegelian notion of dialectics, i.e., that truth derives from the conflict between thesis and anti-thesis.  This completely negates the concept of Logos not existing in the realm of discourse but in the realm of necessity.  If the Second Law of Thermodynamics is true at all then certainly it includes the realm of ideas.  In any transfer of energy there is loose, so why does this not include the process of discussion? And if it doesn't then the Hegelian dialectic is nothing more than the de-evolution of Human understanding.  Though I think Hegel was on to something (although rather simplistic if applied to Human understanding) as a process it may have value in the realm of engineering.  The error of Hegal is to assume this is a progressive process within philosophy when in fact all out scientific data suggests it is in fact subject to entropy to where the result of the process is less organized and less complex.  Anyone who follows history should at very least question whether our own culture is the product of progress or teetering on coherent collapse and materialism.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@elzahiaasadallah2343,"All together united children including let us turn to the Eternal Father !!! * Therapeutic indications * www.padreceleste.com * Dear brothers, instead of useless thoughts including other worthless projects, we optimize everything and therefore I take this opportunity to offer you a mutual and collective collaboration carried out through prayer. Let me explain immediately: together with some of you, I have formed a prayer group that I have baptized ""Trinity Network"", which consists of a communion of universal brotherhood based on the love of God the Father. Every evening after dinner or in any case before to go to sleep, we each carry out the prayers from our own home together with the other participants, scattered in different places around the world. The prayer takes place by kneeling and with hands joined, beginning with a moderate voice with the Our Father; Ave Maria; glory to the Father; (Important ... let us not separate our hands, since the Eternal communicates with the soul and we lose contact). As we begin to pray, we may be disturbed by external forces, such as thoughts, useless things, digressions and more. Through several repetitions of the prayers, the whole moves away, since even if we wanted to think something, it will be impossible to do so.   Later we will begin with a greeting addressed to God and with the phrase ""Hello Father Eternal.""; below, there is an account of the problems or problems that worry us, with a request for help from the Eternal. Our prayer group draws from the church the three main prayers, Our Father; Ave Maria; glory to the Father; (the easiest and most known to people) and enhances them with a familiar conversation with God, in which you can talk about everything with the Almighty, ranging from everyday trivialities to serious problems, in a word a real dialogue at 360 degrees . Between one anecdote and another and at the end of the conversation, it is necessary to repeat the Our Father once; Ave Maria; glory to the Father. For this reason, by praying together, the presence of God is simultaneous in all hearts and this facilitates his intervention. Having felt the benefit, it was decided to repeat the prayer in the morning and / or in the afternoon. Obviously, if the commitments of everyday life do not allow you to pray in the morning or in the afternoon, do not worry: you can move it to another time of the day, the Eternal understands and knows why you do it.   It is essential that the evening prayer be made without delay. I guarantee you the absolute benefit of the teaching used up to now and I assure you that dialogue with the Supreme frees the soul from impurities and brings peace and well-being. I enclose my most sincere greetings, in my name and in the name of the other brothers of the prayer group, hoping to be more and more numerous. A hug Elzahia! I received this prayer teaching in a social network from a girl, who advised me to read it carefully, not to delete it, to offer it to the family and give it to friends, because it will be appreciated better than any good food, since it is useful for improve the soul! he sent it to make God known I am attaching your prayers! The sign of the cross, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Come your kingdom, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Help us not to fall into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen Ave Maria full of grace, the Lord is with you. You are blessed among women and the blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of Jesus, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen Glory to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, now and forever and ever. Amen",4년 전,0,

Which is fine and good enough in some circumstances. Let A be ""tiger"" and you have a hunter gatherer who doesn't get eaten, and the fundamental non-identity of tigers be damned. On the other hand, let A be ""fuel"" and you have diesel in your petrol engine; let A be ""a black person"" and you have racist stereotyping.

@Chrius," @mrrandom132-x2n  One of the theories that I've seen is that the contents of the big bang were everything that was in the previous universe, that expanded like ours and eventually started shrinking again until everything was in a single place, then it exploded, ""restarting"" the universe. Another theory is that the universe as we know didn't exist before the big bang. That it literally started time, and anything before that is unmeasurable by any way that we could understand.  I also don't see how me knowing (or not knowing) what happened 13.8 billion years ago is somehow relevant to this conversation. Until scientists find a way to prove how it happened, all everyone will have is theories. And the generally accepted (scientific) theories follow all the other rules of the universe that have been proven already. Consistency is key. Just because science can't prove something yet, doesn't automatically mean it was magic.  And the answer to this question most likely is worth a whole lot more than a million dollars.",4년 전,0,

The possibilities outside that existing order and their potential outcomes are a far more vast and interesting territory to conquer.  So no one should assume the Liberally minded will only be interested in tearing down the existing order... there's far more spoils of war in bringing down the onslaught of bad ideas amassing at the gates of our existing order.  Likewise, I do not see why anyone would assume the enemies of our existing order would all be the Liberally minded when their own schools of thought have already become very structured and dogmatic, and have their own hierarchy and increasingly malignant order of their own.  It's foolish to not see the dogmatic cultural Marxist as a type of conservative who is just trying to force an old idea to work.

@friedmule5403," @janneglnd7633  I'll try to explain, please understand that English is not my first or even 3rd language:-) He starts by saying that ""biological creatures have to move forward and that it's the case for any creature that is mobile""... Why? What does he mean? ... Is he meaning literally? Does he know enough biology to state that, what about the creatures who only survive by staying still?? If he means in a philosophical way, why use abstract language that people have to interpret by themselves? If he has some useable knowledge, then please give it instead of delivering them in meaningless philosophical wording that he only knows the meaning of. Why is he right in that we have to move forward, would standing still, with our feet solid in the ground, not be better to stand against life? What about saying, walking backward would be better to soften the frontal blow? Lots of meaningless drivel. He then says ""the idea of approaching avoidance ARE the fundamental motivation... and seems to apply over fundamental analyses"" ... wait what?!! Why, how, where, who, and what does it even mean?? Where does he have that waste biological knowledge from? Does he mean ""reaching a state of avoidance"" then isn't it stupid to move? Or does he mean offensive mowing toward something that tries to avoid? If so, is that not an insane idea toward angler fish, among others?  How does any of it even give something a human can use?

@one-christianwarrior3014,"Free energy is in our Bibles and is so super simple that it should be positive proof of an extremely powerful spiritual warfare that is going on behind the scenes, in order to cover up the simplicity of this technology. This free energy technology is so old that it can be found in Ezekiel 1:16, where it is attempting to describe the workings of a UFO motor = ”a wheel in the middle of a wheel”. I used pulleys to imitate this technology, where you only input a few sparks of current for 1 rotation of a motor with a large 33 cm circumference, (about 10 cm diameter) pulley attached. This would freely gain your 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference-(about 0.33 cm diameter) with AC or DC motors/generators attached, by simply running the same belt-strap or even a tied piece of rope or string in a pinch, past these 3 or more mini-pulleys.  -  Want to know more about something that really matters, like the Truth about the true powers of this world, reality + what our lives are truly all about. Trump believes in our Father in Heaven, and by the way, the ARK of the COVENANT has been found in Jeremiah's Grotto, right under where YESHUA=Jesus was crucified. So HIS BLOOD + WATER that came out when He was stabbed by the spear could run down the crack in the bedrock, that happened when the earth quaked + landed on the correct side of the ARK, that was placed there many hundreds of years earlier. His dried BLOOD was still alive even, + tested as only having 24 CHROMOSOMES = Virgin Born + proving HIS DIVINITY.. (only had one parent= regular 46, which is 23 chromosomes each) + with 23 from His mother and only one male Y chromosome from His Father in Heaven. - -PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8TRoQk6WUE @ (41:41) = HIS Blood is STILL ALIVE + had only 24 chromosomes = 23 from his mother + only One from His Father (normal people have 46 = 23 from the mother + 23 from the father). If these videos have been taken down, then in YouTube search these words = ( ark of covenant blood Ron Wyatt ) - Sorry guys + gals, but the higher up elite of mankind has decided to believe + side with these aliens (fallen angels + Nephilim) = sons+daughters of the children of fallen angels + human females in building these particle colliders - which mess with our timelines + allow evil spirits into our reality.  - I cannot be sure if Trump was-is+will-be the best American President,,, but did you notice that the fake news of the very corrupt media does not mention all of the great things Trump did?.

Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on this earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of His-story and so little space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there are only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water. - WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don't try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years. - DO THE MATH FOR YOURSELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited every year is known too. I did the math in the early '90s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don't know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. -  TRUTH about COVID-19 = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc  + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzIWq_59MIY - This is so simple that it should be proof positive of the Battle between GOOD + EVIL. Proof of a most powerful war going on in the background, with REAL BAD FORCES that are controlling our lives. Please remember that Satan is called the ”god of this world” in our Scriptures = (2 Corinthians 4:4). You only need to input a few sparks of current, that rotates a large 33  cm circumference pulley once, to multiply you an output of 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity from 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference pulleys with AC or DC motors/generators attached. Do you see how super simple this is, and how powerful the evil forces are to keep this super simple technology from us for so long? Please don't  - FREE ENERGY = SIMPLICITY AT THE BEST (AC Electricity Multiplication using simply the geometry of pulleys to multiply AC rotations) (a DC motor only takes a few sparks of current, to rotate one full time) Please don't be fooled by the old false torque problem lie, because this torque only occurs when you are producing power. And no matter how much voltage you need, when you multiply it by the few sparks of current that you need, (practically nothing) it equals only the smallest amount of power, (requiring very little torque). - THIS AC ELECTRICITY MULTIPLIER WORKS, and it is so logical that it simply MUST WORK. This uses a few sparks of DC current to rotate one large pulley of 33 cm circumference = (about 10 cm in diameter) one single time. Then by rotating 1 to 3 mini-pulleys, of one-centimeter circumference, = 33 rotations each. If you attach AC or DC generators to each of these mini-pulleys, then you can get a return of 33 to 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity as an output. Which is far more electricity output than you would need for the few sparks of DC input, which is all the input drive motor needs to rotate once. - The only reason that this super simple technology has not been used earlier to create free energy for us, are the millions, if not billions of fallen angels + evil spirits, trying desperately to make sure, that mankind never discovers this super simple technology, which is God’s Gift to mankind, which He laid out for us way back in Ezekiel 1:16 http://free-energy.yolasite.com/ - (EZE 1:16) “The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.” - As in, a little wheel inside a big wheel, but I could not afford to buy a big wheel with threading on the inside, and a mini wheel with the same threading on its outside. So I did the next best thing, I connected a big wheel to a mini wheel through a belt, strap, rope, or even a piece of string in a pinch to connect the two pulleys with motors attached. - Have you ever heard of the MANDELA Effect?

The problem is, the longer you let him go on and build the structure the more confusing it is to break it down because the logic of the context becomes dependent on accepting the foundation. For example, the idea of value changes multiple times during one’s life. So values are always changing and the means and effort one exerts to achieve those values also changes. I just wish someone would stop him along the way and question him on certain propositions that his conclusions are built. It’s like arguing the validity of the Bible.

@RohbertWhite,"Love ought to be the driving force behind any political ideology. The problem with that, as the world sees it, is that love by its nature demands eradication of evil. Both evil and love are defined by scriptures of the Bible. The world doesn't agree with that definition and are tirelessly creating new hierarchies to battle against love. When one driven by love does bad things to those who are driven by evil, he or she is regarded as evil by the world. The sovereignty of the individual is only truly sovereign if motives and actions are ordained by the Lord. If outside of that parameter, then one is part of a greater collective of Satan himself. If one has even one sin that is not covered by the blood of Christ,  he is guilty of all sin. So the one, though he have many, many good qualities and gifts, ultimately uses all to the ultimate persecution and murder of Christ Himself. Thus all the good in and of that one will be counted as evil. Those motivated by love of Christ will be justified of all.",4년 전,0,

@stevelenores5637, @m.a4514  It is not necessary to make a long point.  I do understand how you feel and your feelings are valid because they are personal.  I'm not saying Jordan Peterson's intentions are bad.  He has very good intentions.  Let me make one more try to explain.  Think of history as peaks and valleys.  The valleys are the calm self stabilizing periods where deviation is pulled back away from the slopes of deviation.  Deviation is going uphill to higher and higher resistance.  The peaks are the unstable periods.  Deviation upsets the balance and a little bit of change can pull on the whole mass and move attitudes quickly in a radical direction.  Socially and politically we live on one of those peaks and being pulled by a relatively few towards madness.  Trying to sit on flag pole maintaining your balance during a wind storm is suicide.  In periods like these you have only two choices.  Total resistance or appeasement.  Jordan Peterson path is appeasement and in the short term seems less painful but there is a crash at the end.  Total resistance is harder and often times futile but if you survive you will be there to pick up the pieces of the train wreck that society is heading for.  You will be battered and bruised but you will have the ultimate victory.,4년 전,0,
@stevelenores5637, @m.a4514  I have no idea of your leanings are.  This is not about individuals but group behavior.  I'm sure Peterson uses fragments of the same ideas.  The difference is in what it means.  I'm coming from a perspective of the period of history between WW1 and WW2.  Other very smart people look at our times as being unique.  This is logical fallacy because you can't understand mass with respect to itself.  You have to have a reference point where similar patterns occurred before in history.  It won't transfer perfectly.  But analyzing a period of history within itself is like trying to get traction on ice with new shoes.,4년 전,0,

@rashaadprice4998,"When I look at Jordan Peterson these days ,he looks kinda tired,run down...he is a man blessed with great intellect....the truth and intellect  that flows from his tongue is something beautiful to listen to and to observe....but it's not just the truth that's presented with such eloquence that I see but a scientist.....wrestling within himself as old age seeks him out....there in his eyes I can see his search for meaning in all of the life that flows around him....as a scientist he has been spent his life surrounded by truth ....and yet to me he lacks the knowledge about that source or purpose of truth in creation... Perhaps it's because he failed to understand what Ramanujan the Indian mathematician knew when he said....without God none of my formulas are worth anything....a massive statement from a man who grew up in spiritual India..in the time of Queen Victoria...and went on to become the world's greatest mathematician....science in essence is proof of God's existence .. ... I am not a Roman Catholic ,nor do I have the great mind of the great Jordan Peterson...but even I can tell you that all men of God know this.... I will quote a Roman Catholic cardinal...whose name escapes me now ... But whose truth has not ....when asked what is a man..he simply said...a man is one who simply believes in God.... The Jews know it,the Muslims know it,the Christians know it... Now they argue between themselves about the constitution of God...but of the existence of God there is no doubt....those that don't believe in God are scientist but from bearing witness to God's creative majesty have sought to use God's creation to patent it as if it were there discoveries and that they discovered and have a right to own the mechanics of creation...a creation that was put there as a gift and a sign from God almighty ...and those who have alligned themselves with that cause have turned humankind into sheep... There's no way out for the flock...whose only true salvation lies with the most divine creator...who gifted us this life and who shielded us from the storms of real evil doers....like the men who sought to bring about this covid 19 virus....Jordan needs to know this...something tells me that his wrestling with trying to find this missing piece.....even a mere bricklayer like me ,with my bricklaying intellect knows this....and how do I come to know this...the answer is simple.....I am a man",4년 전,0,

@carlbumba57,"Peterson has incredible mental focus.  But I get the sense that he falls into some common traps for psychologists, like teleological thinking and anthropomorphizing (for instance, here, describing the primitive orienting reflex in terms of higher understanding, rather that just as a reaction to novel stimuli) or in wanting to use Darwinian evolution to make psychological phenomena more material and less ephemeral or epiphenominal. (Biologists are said to have physics-envy; psychologists seem to have biology-envy.)  The views of evolutionary psychologists (and anthropologists) often violate basic principles of evolution, genetics and developmental biology, frequently along lines of neo-Lamarkianism.  ""Extended manifestations of the orienting reflex"" might be very adaptive, but insofar as they aren't themselves heritable and the apparent capacity to have them is an unlikely target of selection they are probably off the radar of evolution.  And even if an embued sense of 'meaning' in a person might reflect an ""optimal"" negotiation between evolved, adaptive instincts and de novo functional reactions in a variable environment there would be no selection response for any particular solution (since it would not be heritable) and likely no movement of that individual's lineage across the fitness landscape of the population for this phenotypically ""noisy"" trait. Even Peterson, himself, says, ""The brain operates AS IF the most real thing is the meaning of something"".  Only in models is evolution omniscient.  Sub-optimality is reality.  Generalists often out-perform specialists... while going unnoticed by selection.  Even if evolution overlooks it life is pretty sloppy.",4년 전,0,

@LazyPetey,"So the premise is that 'if you're going to pursue something of value, then you have to move forwards' and that the pursuit of these 'things of value' is how we offset the 'suffering' that is life. Beyond that, the hierarchy is untenable without this pursuit. Sorry Jordan, but that's the the point at which you lost me. Its a fundamentally flawed tenet on which you've hung the entire balance of your argument. I suspect that this highly intelligent snake oil salesman is fully aware of, is that it's the very pursuit of what he refers to as 'value' that causes is us to be unhappy. The question Peterson acolytes refuse or are unable to ask, is what is this 'value' that to which he constantly refers?  The truth is that real wealth and happiness is somewhat simpler to derive if one is prepared to be open to the metrics by which such notions are assessed. Frankly, I'd also take Mr Peterson more seriously if he could discuss these 'principles' without the endless references to which of his books contain them.   In summary, I suppose the simpler truths would be less satisfying to those who can't find meaning in their life, for the most part part because like Peterson, they think there is some higher level or because they need some reason to justify their endless pursuit thereof. In reality, however, if you wish to find joy and happiness, the path is clear. Open your eyes and be as open to seeing what is wondrous in life just as often as you do to examine what you perceive as being missing. That singular process will offer more of a quantum leap to a higher understanding than any number of Mr Petersons expensive tomes.",4년 전,0,

@LazyPetey," @nuqwestr  I think if you read my comment again, then yours, you'll find you've actually reiterated, in some regards, the very point I made.

I do agree that we should 'make hay while the sun shines', as you put it, but that philosophy requires no 'pursuit', but rather a greater appreciation.   As in all things, it's a case of each to their own. By all means, my fellow 'organic cell-based friend', adopt and adhere to Mr Peterson's world view if it benefits you. That is after all preferable to to the alternative. My point was simply that there are valid alternatives that are less rooted in one's sense of self. I've simply offered one option that is rooted in being more open to allowing oneself to acknowledge wonder, love, enjoyment where we find it. Put simply, all those emotions and feelings that make life not just survivable, but joyous.   Thank you for your comment and interaction in any case.

@michaelsorensen7567," @nuqwestr  you don't cancel them, but the people with larger audiences have them for reasons. The flat earth society isn't banned, but neither do they have view counts in the millions, because most individuals find their model lacking. The ""we live in the Matrix"" perspective has even fewer adherents, and they don't need to be banned. And certainly there's no need to push ""we're all just figments of imagination"" as a perspective, so it's clear that merely ""having more perspectives"" isn't a good goal.  Jordan seems to agree with the questioner that having a multiplicity of viewpoints is virtuous unto its own self, and I'm of the opinion that it's not. Having the ability for new best ideas to rise naturally to prominence is different from seeking out more new ideas regardless of accuracy just for the sake of saying ""lookit all the diverse ideas!""",4년 전,0,

@michaelsorensen7567," @nuqwestr  to be clear, I'm not for officials limiting speech. It's just that the questioner seems to think that is everyone's obligation to entertain every harebrained idea the same way they do people who actually know what they're talking about. Jordan got the platform because people agreed with him, not because the government promoted it. I'm not advocating for the government to stop the harebrained ideas, but it'd be nice if the government weren't pushing them for ""equality"" either. Jordan mentions how ""we've done the experiment; the results are IN!"" So imo there's no need to keep entertaining that flawed idea. People who want to can keep looking into it I suppose, and I'd certainly not want the truth to be suppressed regardless of its popularity, but promoting flagrant falsehoods purely for sake of ideological diversity seems to me a flawed approach.  In essence, I'm arguing for a less regulated status quo, where a ""market of ideas"" allows good ideas to rise and bad ideas to sink. Only I'd prefer it if the government and traditional media/social media weren't pushing for certain narratives.",4년 전,0,
@nuqwestr," @michaelsorensen7567  I believe the ""questioner"" was in favor of ""safe places"" where free speech is regulated by the group, and that there should be a limit on ""privileged speech"". He asked Jordan to agree with him, and he did, but went on to qualify his answer, which was brilliant.   In 1987 I began research on a subject that was not well published, and I would wait weeks for a book to arrive on inter-library loan, which I then had to return in 2-weeks. That drove me in 1994 to become one of the first WWW publishers, and to promote services like Wiki and search algorithms. Hypertext was a revolution in publishing. Unfortunately, there have been many unintended consequences from that revolution yet to be rectified and corrected. In 1994, Al Gore officially commercialized the WWW, and in doing so, pushed an economic model of EYEBALLS for sale. This was not the only choice at the time, but one forced on us by both government officials and economic predators, neither would consider the consequences of their actions. We tried, there was a ""White Paper"" suggesting a ""public utility"" version for bandwidth delivery, and a model of commerce less driven by ""the mob"", but it was ignored. EYEBALLS, 30 years later, are the product, more's the pity.",4년 전,0,

@knowahnosenothing4862," @JeanQPublique  Hah, it's the complete opposite in my view. Why JP is so effective is because he only ever argues in the pursuit of archetypal truths, the type of truths that are based in psychological and social science born out across history and even in alignment with nature. The guy cares about getting to the foundations and asking you to look again, see what you've missed. (The logos) In my view he is more widely valued for some of the language he has given to common people to defend themselves against modern psychological warfare, the ability to point out gaslighting, ideological possession and cognitive dissonance.  I should add, advocating people taking up personal responsibility as a force for restoring meaning in their lives, the fact that it resonates with people tells us why he is so prominent because he tell us where the stable ground is when our cultures are being destroyed all over the world.  If it's not self evident, the social marxism crushing some of the foundations of traditions that are still useful in the modern world has disenfranchised a lot of people, and that hanging on to the idea of acting as if god exists even if you don't or can't believe it still has some noble side effects given you adjust for the things that don't hold up as useful in the modern world.  Edit: And then I realized sarcasm :) not gaslighting although they have a lot in common.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

Please tell me because I don't see it and if you have a real point against his ideas then I would love to hear it !

He prepares a premise, waives his hands around (metaphorically), and then states a conclusion with great confidence.  The problem is that he doesn't provide his reasoning to connect the premise and his conclusion.  I mention his charisma because that's what he uses to get away with this.

( Technically makes sense if you had no time, but if you think about it, most people would agree that that if you have something interesting to say , you wait till you have the time to say it instead of saying something completely irrelevant [ but hey it's the internet , people write compulsively ] ) 3rd - If the ""gibberish and nonsense""/""logical fallacies""/""logical leaps""/""strawmen""/""non sequiturs"" etc were so easy to spot then the explanation shouldn't be that long or that exhausting to put together. 4th - Even one simple example would be enough , and if the video was ""full of it"" , I'm sure you could have found one that doesn't take much time to explain.",4년 전,0,

@antoneogzewalla2040,"The conundrum he mentions about there being an infinite number of ways to see the world... is easy to resolve in a logical way when we recognize that there are two reciprocal types of truth. ABSOLUTE TRUTH is exactly what is, but we cannot know that truth. I step on a scale and it reads 160lb. But that's not what I actually weigh. That's just a RELATIVE REPRESENTATION of the [absolute truth]. The less accurate the representation the more relative it is. The more accurate the scale is that does the measuring, the closer to being [absolute truth] the measurement is... but no measure can ever express an actual [absolute truth]. Because even if we had such an infinitely accurate scale, it would take an infinitely long time to read the measurement. Thus absolute and relative truth are necessarily complementary (but incompatible and reciprocal) properties. Our goal is to express absolute truth, but the only way to do so is by using relative truths. And each of us mentally processes what that absolute truth is in a slightly different relative way. And that is the connection between the idea that the world should be a specific way and the reality that each of us sees the world in a unique way.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@santiagod.9679,"57:50 I remember that free speech was perceived as some kind of pride of the intellectuals, part because the achievement of it socially, I'm guessing came supported by cults, psychological cults, constructed and organized inside universities and other intellectual places. Defending freedom of speech was considered something cool, especially cool and close to stupid when defending it through stages where it was problematic for governments. Therefore, later when governments wanted to be cooler too, they eventually adopt it and made it part of the current civilization. It's a matter of pride, an extremely powerful cult that started from many writers who constantly end up defending the idea of freedom of speech and it's variants while doing analysis and profound philosophy in their books. In order to keep being a society able to profit to universities, or too have universities admired internationally, freedom of speech was essential. If for any temporal historical reason, freedom of speech was reduce, often the intellectual end up emigrating to other universities (sometimes of small countries, but freer), and many other students followed them, naturally. Goes against the nature of what societies are, and look for (stability), but it is a power cult, and we all know how cults overcome difficulties and proliferate, no matter if they are something sacro-right as freedom of speech, or simply a delusional cult instead.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

What do you think happens to someone after they die? 2. Do you think there is an afterlife?  3. If heaven exists, how do you get there?  4. Do you think you are good enough to get into heaven?   No one is good enough to get into heaven. Here are a few questions to test your goodness:    1. How many lies have you told in your whole life?  2. Have you ever stolen?  3. Have you ever used God's name in vain? 4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust?  5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day?  6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?   The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell?    2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us.    What you have to do is repent, or turn toward God, and believe in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus.    When are you going to do that?

@Penandsword.," @noblermind8782  Thank you for the reply! That was a great summary and I agree with all of it.   I guess I'm trying to figure out what to do about the inevitability of losers in the system. His response seems to be that as long as there are not enough people with nothing to lose to destabilize the whole system, the system will last. He goes on to say that they would not be resentful if the system is not rigged by the wealthy i.e. it's not tampered with to become unfair.  However, it seems like we are already in that situation, both with too many people having nothing to lose and with the system being rigged.   His response is that we should fix the rigging and corruption of the system. I agree with all of this. However, I do think those 'people with nothing to lose' now need assistance to rectify the failings of the past, regardless of their source, but especially because it results from a failure to keep the system fair and that they are destabilizing the system.  The area I am struggling with is that many of the people who have nothing to lose are in that position because they are naturally predisposed to ending up in that position, by no choice of their own (this can be linked to key indicators along the Perato distribution). So shouldn't the system be setup so that even the losers would have the basics of human decency (food, shelter, hygiene etc.) to not only stabilise the system, but also have the added benefits of a reduction in crime (which is driven by inequality), return order and cleanliness to shared areas etc.  This would not remove incentive as it is still the lowest tier in the hierarchy and fear of failure would still exist.  This leads me to believe that Welfare Capitalism is the only reasonable response to this. And since that is further left than our current political system, it seems reasonable to be more left oriented in our current system.  This is by no means an extremist left view, which I think  can also be attributed to the fact of a too large number of people with nothing to lose, not only being driven by universities as he claims. We are already further down the road than he seems to think we are in this regard and the extremist left viewpoint is the resulting instability which he talks about.  A moderate left stance has no other choice to affect political change but to side with the left, and with the right only seeming to respond to the vocal extreme left minority, it seems the right is attacking the strawman of this group  and not allowing the system to rectify by a moderate shift to the left (which would be the most likely outcome with our moderate government always being driven by the healthy left-right interchange which is being driven by democracy) and therefore involuntarily contributing to the destabilization of the system by maintaining the downward spiral and enabling the extreme left, who are the manifestation of predictable instability.  There's a lot to unpack there, but your thoughts would be welcomed, thanks!",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@michaelweil5192,"I think he is a brilliant man, but just as most intellectuals tend to think, there is an abstraction that takes place in the mind that allows for the argument to even be made. Like the concept of a frictionless plane; you will not find this anywhere in the world, but this concept can be used abstractly to understand certain theoretical properties of physics.  You can also, as he does, abstract the ideas of these motions and meaning towards a goal. But it really only works in abstraction. The reality and complexity of the human condition cannot be understood in these bilateral lines of position; conservative and liberal. These conditions have emerged in our recent history as human beings, but as far as we know that before large organized societies were on the scene there was no need for this dichotomy. So much of his argument makes sense as long as his base propositions are assumed true. And Well are they? I would argue no. Humans do not always work for goals that are about betterment of a persons individual position. He Rationalizes, ""why then would you do it?"" This is a failing in his imagination. And a failure to see reality beyond as it plays out beyond his abstractions. People sacrifice their lives and time and health for others. Soldiers fight wars and die. How is that moving toward a goal that is better? People risk their lives in all kind of ways. And yes, there are many people, individually and otherwise who do not make progress. They are content with the routine of their life. And yes, some do move ahead. But the real question is why, if it is not exclusively for improvement, for value? What other reasons could there be? Well we are quite malleable creatures as well. And first we also need to acknowledge the hierarchical regimes that emerged from distorted people who created or heavily influenced the hierarchy to the harm of many. The group did not establish value and create a hierarchy of competence. Not to mention social systems that promote incompetent people at the top. And furthermore, the very nature of hierarchical dominance is stubborn, but in a way he failed either to recognize or mention. In that supposed competent people get pushed to the top. But what of their children and other forms of nepotism? And inclusion of people with low competence. Just look as those who hold office today. Competent?  People can be motivated to move in all kinds of directions even toward things that have no value. And there is no consideration of wandering; not having any specific purpose at all, that could prove very dangerous and harmful or beneficial. This whole argument only works in the very oversimplified abstract notions that he proposed. Now what about the real world not this abstraction? Dr. Robert Sapolsky and he research on Baboons. I won't got into it here, but take a look at his findings. Also Richard Wilkinson and his team on social stratification and what he discovered. From the research literature that uses real world data the trend is seemingly toward equality. Things improve for the whole group the more equitable it is. Like how much more peaceful life was when you didn't have these large heavily populated social systems that need slavery to function. Who said that humans need to be organized in this way at all? The world is broad and complex and even for highly intelligent people this is true, the world is to big for a single individual to process and understand.  And therefore, as part and parcel to his work, he has to carve out an idea that ignores many real world pieces and full on spreads of data in order go anywhere. These abstractions only work in the imagination that strips away all of the noise and inconsistent incomprehensible data that we cannot wrap out singular heads around, effectively creating a notion that is only real when the very large body of incalculable data has been distilled into the fantasy of a narrow human imagination. It is not more than an idealistic middle ground that presupposes the permanence of dominate hierarchies that history itself does not attest to.",4년 전,0,

He has a bit of a cult following. Now, we MUST understand that through history there have always been ""Jordan Petersons"".  People who use their intellectual power to support and explain away the system of dominance. There were always people like him during colonial times, and slavery in various societies. People who used their intelligence to excuse and even justify the actions and unchecked wielding power of the social elite. There is a reason people like him get acclaim and are much more popular than scientist like Noam Chomsky. Noam's message challenges norms and provides real historical references as to the origin and intentions of certain political movements and stances. Libertarianism is NOT what you think. You think it is about a free society for ordinary people. But is not and that was not and still is not their intention. In fact, the highest ideal in such a society is to have as many slaves as one can.  The private sector is NOT accountable to the public. In truth, only a strong government can prevent large cooperations from abusing power against its workers, such as making them pay when people get injured for instance, prevent them from destroying the ecology, such as with Formosa in Texas. Only a strong government that is responsive to the people can do that. On the other hand if the government is weak, it is easily corrupted and cannot enforce its own laws and you get anarchy and various forms of violence at many levels. Libertarianism is about preventing you and me from telling the ownership class what to do with their power and influence. Again they are not responsible to the public. We get no say about wages, benefits or even the utility and consequences of large cooperations. But the do have to listen to the government. And we are supposed to have a say in that arena. More privatization, more concentration of power, you will have even less of a say. Can you negotiate with you employer? They will just tell you get lost. Just as Susan George stated that, ""capitalism is a good slave but a bad master."" Finally do not limit yourself  into a narrow debate of if not this then that. Have we reached the end of history? Is this all we can come up with? We can do better and much better with our technological abundance. We no longer live in a world of scarcity. And technology was supposed to free up work. Yet we are still working out the the egregious need to provide for ourselves because our system will not give up its greedy profit motive. There is no need for much of the work we engage in, but we must to buy food and other necessities that we over produce. Absurd to an extreme degree! What we need are people that are intellectually honest. Not just to follow ever purposed thinker cause there so smart and people are dumb. If you feel people are stupid then spend more time educating them then they won't be dumb anymore. rather than following a man to satiate your craving for intellectualism.

@lisashung9442,"A few thoughts from his speech.  1. If you have more power, you have more accesses to speech power. If your language is the dominant language in the world, you have more access to speech power. English is the most dominant social, economic and political language in the world, so English speaking countries have the overwhelming dominant speech power in this world. So the freedom of speech on the world stage is the freedom of English speech.......when the medias are mostly controlled by the power and rich in the English speaking countries, then the freedom of speech essentially become the freedom of the power and rich English speeches....... 2. According to his definition, the “Five Eyes” is a tribe. They are forming their collective thinking and label other countries as whatever they want, then go over their chimpanzees boarders to tear others up...... 3. Is freedom of speech the most important human rights? Or it is only one of many human rights which will be able to enjoyed after the other more fundamental human rights have been satisfied, such as the right to life, live without fear of war, crime etc, the right to have a place to stay, the right to have enough food to survive, the right to have clothes to keep body warm, the right to be educated, the right to access health care......all these need economic foundation. The freedom of expression only come as No. 10 in the Human Rights Act (UK). It have been exaggeratedly overweighted other basic human needs/rights when we try to promote human rights to the developing countries. Only these foundations provided, then will be possible to enable them to enjoy the freedom of speech, not the other way around because it doesn’t work.  4. In USA, there are two biggest tribes, “Democratic” and “Republican”, they both have their fixed narratives. The society is open but the mind is closed.",4년 전,0,

@mjohnson8157,"Sometimes the intentions of people who call for political correctness can be good and produce good things in an otherwise heartless society. It's not good to value sensitivity over truth. But it isn't good to undervalue an individual for the sake of truth either. One shouldn't value a truth more than the person that a truth was meant to value.  I see it like this; there are those who are concerned about whether to say ""Happy Holidays"" or ""Merry Christmas."" Well, if you have a problem with someone saying, ""Happy Holidays,"" then you don't know the meaning of Christmas. And if you have a problem with someone saying, ""Merry Christmas,"" you don't know the meaning of ""happiness.""  But if you have a concern about offending others, there's nothing wrong with wanting to say the right thing for the sake of another. There is nothing wrong with having a concern for offending people. What is wrong is when we become overly concerned with offending people. And who can judge the balance of that teeter totter accurately.  But, yes, we are, on the whole, too worried about saying the correct thing about many things. Still, I don't call a black person a negro. That doesn't mean I'm too politically correct. It means I have some character and sense, and yes, sensitivity. But what I find most interesting and ironic about the whole issue of political correctness is that the people who are so concerned about others being too easily offended, sure seem to be too easily offended.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@markmorley7938,"Hi I listened to your talk, on what I guess was about humanity and how man controls his reactions and behaviour in the real world? Although you came up with some fundamental issues in a complex way, I guess you would slot me into one of your categories and come up with an immediate resolve. This I believe, is because you are an intelligent man and are able to convince folk because of their behaviour, they then fall into a particular category? I appreciate you could back up your philosophy based upon the outcomes of a number of anomalies and then able to justify your assumptions? You may think that this is the contentious part of me, that epitomises the hate speech and thus render me to that category, or instead you could wait and listen to reason, before defining my box? Nevertheless, I do feel it important to render my thoughts and I hope it may be assumed, that I am more of a peaceable character. Although much of your defining of human nature, comes from men’s perspectives and less from the spiritual domain, I believe it is important, that I can support of another context that was given little recognition. Although you may have mentioned the concepts of spiritual aspects you failed in venturing further along those lines. Now it could be that Godly aspects don’t necessarily play a key role in your life, or that you wish to avoid the importance of such issues as to avoid religious contention. However firstly may I say although the God stuff may sometimes create contention, I have been taught by my faith, that God is not of contention and I would prefer to walk away, than be contentious. So my discussion is this, do you not believe that God has more power than man? (Omnipotent). Do you not believe that God has more knowledge than man? (Omniscient). That when God has both all power and all knowledge, that He also has the ability to be with each of us at the same time. (Omnipresent) Yet I fail to understand that such learned man has yourself, fail to bare witness of Gods ability? I find it quite astounding that you quote all manner of men and their writings and fail to acknowledge the Great I Am and His writings? Could it be that you have not read His works, which I would find very strange, from such an intellectual as yourself. Or perhaps you cannot bring yourself to testify of God because of what others may think of you? Then again perhaps in all of that academic learning, you failed to find God and therefore cannot expound of His presence? Whatever the reason may be, I will now give you a number of God’s works, that you can learn from a total different perspective and then I believe you will learn more of life that you have learnt previously. You will find that man do have a common factor in Christ and with these elements, I promise it will change the whole of your former concepts and reveal the truth to any of your ventures. So ultimately, I challenge you first to study the Book of Mormon. This book is regarded as a Second Testament to Jesus Christ and moreover if it is sincerely studied, truth of its validity will be revealed. Then if you wish to compare its teachings as described in the Old and New Testament, a further in depth understanding of God will reveal all that we as humans can become. What you will also realise is that the more you learn of these truths, the more you will become reliant on the Lord and not lean to the precepts of men. Surely a man of your knowledge and integrity deserve to know, that what I speak of, is in fact the truth to all of those answers. Except of course that you feel you are beyond Gods understandings? Even if you just take the first step and read the Book of Mormon and then get back to me, with what you have learnt, then perhaps I cannot ignore that you have not pursued all avenues before drawing conclusions about mankind? I think you will come up with a total different outlook, to what you purported initially and I also think you will also find the true resolve to your answers!",4년 전,0,

The electoral college, which allows for faithless electors, who can and do go against what the state voters want, the number of senators allocated to each state, and the allocation of electoral votes. I realize the United States opted for  a federal republic form of government (i.e. closer to France and Germany) or those in charge of making that decision at that point in history did so, not a parliamentary democracy (i.e. Canada and Great Britain).  I guess that's the gist of it.

This area needs to be maintained every couple of weeks for which there is an annual fee.  The area is covered in weeds, it has been half seeded half turfed and surrounding trees are dying.  I go to the housing development company and ask for it to be investigated.  Nothing happens.  I ask three times, no response.  I decide to put posters through neighbours houses asking how they feel about the negligence of the company.  The majority respond and agree with my sentiment and concern.  I forward the emails to the construction company and on this occasion I get a response.  They are now listening to me.

[Let's unpack this.   Did Peterson say anything your average middle schooler couldn't figure out on their own, and if not what is he doing expressing these simple minded ideas at a place like Oxford, or rather, what possessed Oxford to invite him, other than to gather views on the video?   I know we move towards things we value, I know moving towards things you value gives you meaning, I know that some people will be better at some things than others, I know that some people will rise to the top via both competence and power, and I know that having too many people stacking up at the bottom with practically nothing is bad for society and not justice.

@greatgouda4792,"I greatly appreciated Jordan's outlook on hate speech. ""how do you define hate?"" That question will perplex people for eternity because you cannot. If you're a politician speaking to a large crowd they may even be supporters there is an extremely high chance that something you say will offend someone and it will be on the media headlines the next day. It can happen talking to friends, random people even like minded people who normally agree with you. When you allow someone to define hate speech you are allowing the encroachment of tyranny.  To which, two years on in Britain we are slowly moving towards that and I feel incredibly bad for the scottish who are currently going through a rough patch with free speech vs hate speech and the frankly tyrannical laws being proposed by the SNP right now. We are allowing the government and radical elements of our society to define hate even our media outlets. Which is the worst possible outcome in this scenario. It is extremely dangerous to ever allow people to define it outside of their own individual perspective without applying to other people because what is born from defining hate is compelling peoples speech - In other words making people talk a very specific way and never straying from it without consequence.   We must protect our nations from people who would seek to subvert our ability to talk to each other properly. Arguments are healthy and necessary in fact we often learn from each other a lot more and appreciate each other a lot more after the fact unless it was a particularly nasty argument. People need to stop making conversation, opinions and view points so personal and debate them. Talk about them. Discuss them. We don't do this anymore, we just shout and scream and label people horrible things. It must stop, we were better than this and we ARE better than this.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@spencerwinston4334,"Jung revealed the distinguishing skill that catapulted Nietzsche into the league of Plato beyond perhaps even Schopenhauer, and Emerson. Nietzsche was highly trained as a classical philologist immersed in the original sources of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Hence, Nietzsche gained a profound knowledge of the greatest minds of antiquity and could read the source material in a direct first hand way and not rely on second hand accounts. Imagine being able to understand all the nuances of source material from the Bible in Hebrew or Plato in Greek to appreciate the nuances and meanings of texts directly rather than to accept second hand some other scholars interpretation of the passage. Nietzsche's devastating critique of the intellectual edifice of the times originated because he knew how the professors of the time masked the truth to push an agenda, protect an intellectual moat, or just hide the truth from themselves or others for either lack of courage, intellectual depth, or other sinister reasons. Nietzsche lived and breathed for the truth.   Just as a world class poker player has to live, breathe and sleep poker to be a world champion, a philosopher on the Olympian level of Nietzsche has to breathe the mountain air of truth every day in a way not possible for a man involved in a daily business or practice such as Jung. Sure, the business can keep the man ""grounded"", but to reach Nietzsche's Olympian level and full spectrum dominance philosophical level you need the foundational basics of classical philology combined with a passion and instinct for truth based off actual reading of ancient wisdom in the original. As German philosopher Schopenhauer observed, unless a man can read Latin and Greek in the original, there will always be a hole in the scholar's education that undermines the depth of his intellectual thought. This observation is a bitter pill for us all in a vapid age of mass media and hollow men. Nietzsche was just such an intellectual tour de force that we will probably never able to appreciate his greatness or sublime gifts to humanity. Greek and Latin are not emphasized in today's propaganda mills of liberal arts universities or even at the time of Jung when studying Latin and Greek required hard work most were not willing to endure.   Nietzsche was a sublime gift to humanity, and in fact his Navy Seal like attack on the soft, descendent Western philosophers and clergy of the time came with devastating force and mountain lightning speed. Ultimately though, Nietzsche's attack came out of a deep love for man and his no limit potential. Once the blinders came off and courageous, disciplined men were made aware of what the actual classical and Biblical texts meant free of some political or mercenary agenda, Nietzsche allows us all to share in the love for the search for truth. In this sense, Nietzsche, in exposing the agendas of many ""translations"" and university moat protecting ""degrees"" brings us all back to ourselves and our higher man potential once we breathe the mountain air of truth, and discover how the truth makes us all free from the agendas and deception of the establishment.",5년 전,0,

@abdullahsafi1012,"when Mr. Peterson talks about the liberal view of always questioning things and the conservative view of preserving hierarchies and how we need to balance these. the solution surprisingly comes with religious text from the largest monotheistic religions like Christianity and Islam. the reason I say this is because the liberal view of questioning has no end so to combat this we need certain principles that shouldn't be infringed upon these principals can be attributed to the ten commandments and the bill of rights in the U.S.A by doing this we still preserve the ability to change to our environmental circumstances and preserve value and meaning for us as humans. This can be evident by how much change was able to be brought forth even though Christianity, Judaism and Islam have been prevalent as religions, meaning they aren't restricting change but they are restricting changes that infringe upon those fundamental rights. which I think people will tend to agree with. This is evident in the most scientific views of the world as well because,  you always need foundational particles, numbers or ideas to bring about complexity for example the binary code or even quantum computers. we can use these foundational principles like the ten commandments or the bill of rights to anchor ourselves but still have the capacity for expansion and change.",5년 전,1,

Started out just like this caring sweet but it was simply an obsession.   Later this person would message and call blast my client around 12 times per day claiming they were “so worried about them”. After she explained she does not except calls and does not have to answer anyone’s messages the person went from sweet and kind to quite evil.   Just because she is a girl it does not make her intentions sweet or innocent. Also if you need help with typing fast like myself I suggest you get into copywriting.

@markandrew9,"The second question coming from the women who asked: If there is no God who is positioned to supremely determine value of meaning, and thus man is left to superimpose his particular structure of meaning thus defining value.. The reason man is facing the problem is because, man doesn't know what  he hasn't yet learned, that is from species level  a prior awareness which evolves into place from a past cultural or species level epiphany into the construction of the never ending narrative, of which only future generations can or will be able to benefit.  So in 400 BC mankinds staggering discoveries may only be a simple principle that even grade school children intuitively understand, partly due to cultural imbedding from birth. So the problem is, if any given civilization at any given time, or point in it's time line from emergence, there is no way of knowing what a comprehensive understanding of an advanced structural, or functional based hiearchy.   If we don't know what we don't know, then how could the prevailing hiearchy which is limited by those obstacles thus diagramed. How could we know how to move in the right direction to the more evolved position, when all that we have to navigate from is a faulty, and only partially constructed map that always confers upon itself absolute authority. Which is then used by the political and ecconomic power structure in any given cultural to manipulate, coerce and force the rest of the lower floors of the society to comply...  How does any given civilization, society or cultural get around this enigmaitic consignment to ever discover the next level of advancement... The only solution is determined by understand the comprensive nature of the problem and then review how human culturals throughout the world over world history managed to deal with this connundrum in a successful way...  The solution begins with suffering from the inferior approach will inspire life to seek out an approach that is not as painful or destructive.  From this phase, we then emerge into discovering something in nature or in space or in observing human interactions, new ideas will appear in the minds of those who are seeking that better way... They are open to receiving the new idea, which then leads to a discovery in which the discovery can then be used as a model for an application in which its place in the heiarchy of values becomes self evident and thus it also will demonstrate a property of self confirmation...  The heiarchy will evolve among those who study such things in some degree quicker than it will be included in the cultural narrative. Thus it will take several generations on average before the progeny of the discoverers and then architects of the structural actually begin to include the new understanding into the cultural conditioning process.  However,  the fact is clear that almost all major or primary discoveries, whether it be in the sciences, mathematics, philosophy, social and political development, have almost always come from a source by which man assumes he is superior to.. We learned collectivsm by studying ant colonies, we discovered galactic mechanisms by assuming that sky was empty and that the only real elements in space were astrological interpretations...  Man cannot face that he is actually inferior what learning source he has observed and thus learned. Otherwise the source were learning from would be learning from us!   In otherwords, the grasping of how we discover learn and integrate has only come from sources which by deffinition must be superior to us given it provides the model from which we observe and learn from...  In other words, the existence of superior intelligence is legion, everything from we depend on for learning is superior and cannot be otherwise.. So the totality of all learning processess, models and sources must precede man, and thus must present superior positioning, which it does, which is why we learn from it, and indeed, need it in order for us to learn in the first place...  If the spectrum of learning models is occupied by nothing but models which are the source of our learning.   And then if we agrate those total numbers of those specific models into one primary category, mainly being: That which is not derived from the domain of the human body or its actions, can be qualified and quantified as the source and means by which human civilization can progress...  Than we can actually define this relations as  (humanity)> (all else) = progression of civilization..  So if we then call humans the (learning ones) , and all the source points as (preminent teaching points or (PTP). There is no fundamental change of actual meaning or the nature of the actual relationship, Which for the sake of discussion we can also adjust the terms for the purpose of setting up an equation as follows:  The leaners will be termed""(DOG)"". And the preeminent source points will be termed ""(GOD)"".  Thus (DOG) > (GOD) ='s civilizations gradual evolution... That is the actual answer to the question, whether you understand the mathematical certainty of the principles by which this answer was arrived at or not... - MAS 927",5년 전,0,

Progress is necessary but for it to be beneficial it needs to be done taking great care for what was built before. I think his point is that it is truly better to do nothing than to do harm. Especially in social matters because there are no consequences for the people who develop or put forth such ideas that might end up completely destroying a society or set of people. First we must do no harm. But the leftist mentality doesn't usually consider the ramifications of their ideas because they are always in pursuit of change and end up doing more harm than good. Which is something we should never strive for. A lack of critical thinking in progressive ideas will always make them quite regressive and our society nowadays is a great example. For instance, in the name of social justice and racial ""equity"" colleges are now segregating students based on their race. There's no better example of a regressive progressive policy.

@sishrac,"I found Peterson's introduction touched on some core fundamental truths. It's remarkable how his two propositions are loaded with spiritual wisdom. His analysis shows how humanity's misguided values have evoked a perpetual political and social movement availing to no real solution to the human problem. I'll provide the context for the above statement further down.  I'll give a summary of his two basic propositions first. 1. he observes correctly that mobile creatures have to move forward in the world as a requirement to keep them alive or even for them to want to keep alive. We move forward towards things we value, which reveals that we always live in a framework of value and that this is out of necessity at a physiological and psychological level given that life is suffering. The way to transcend suffering is to pursue things of value.   2. he observes that if people being social creatures are going to pursue something of value in a social setting, they're going to compete and cooperate with people around in the pursuit of that value. That eventually will produce a hierarchy of competence in relationship to that pursuit. It's inevitable that only a minority will be superbly successful while a majority will merely stack up at the bottom, an iron law of 'distribution of success and hierarchy) based on Price's law reflecting the Matthew principle from the new Testament (""For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away."" - Matthew 13: 12). He concludes that from a left-wing perspective if we're going to have value and hierarchy, then we're going to have inequality, which would morph to a form of tyranny due to the subsequent power (that corrupts) gained through hierarchy. The inequality and tyranny would most certainly cause excess suffering at the bottom of the pyramid to those who have nothing to lose. These might just aggressively flip the hierarchy on its end and we'd have an unsustainable society. He points out that in a political and social landscape we should never allow it to go so far where people have nothing to lose but rather take precaution to strike a balance between the left and the right in their proper positions.  Peterson asserts that the conservative's need for hierarchy and the liberal's fight for equality will be permanently at odds with one another yet we need hierarchy for pursuing value although it will be inevitable that as a result we'll produce inequality. He backs the latter by quoting Jesus Christ that 'the poor will always be with you' hence we need the left to fight for their cause.   So, his description of our chaotic world is spot on accurate. But it is my opinion that if everyone (I mean everyone in a utopian sense) applied the spiritual wisdom at the spiritual level as originally intended by Christ, we'd actually achieve law and order at the secular realm even down to the existential level. No more need for conservatives nor liberals! I want to qualify that statement by saying it is not achievable by religion either as has been proven throughout history! Indeed Jesus didn't aspire to create a religion but to address the human problem in a most practical way only a creator of a system or species will do. Alas, He'd also given us free will to choose... ;)  So here below is my interpretation of Jesus' words. To understand what I mean you'll have to keep in mind Peterson's 2 propositions stated above in relation to the 2 passages referred below.  1. Matthew 6: 25-34 (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34&version=ESV) Jesus places the highest thing of value to pursue is Truth or rather God's design, which Jesus refers to as God's Kingdom and Righteousness. Suffering is a given in the fallen world but one overcomes or transcends suffering when seeking Truth above one's existential cares. God the Creator provides the necessities for those that love Truth. Therefore applying the principle of pursuing value in material goods leads to the anti-climax of life, which is death and suffering - the reality we see manifesting in this world. If we read other passages in the old and new testament it will be clear to the reader that those that love Truth are the ones also chosen for a calling to spread the good news to others who are also suffering and yet unaware of the Truth.   2. Matthew 13: 10-16 (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A+10+-+16&version=ESV) The Matthew principle (Price's Law) that Peterson applies to material possessions is actually in direct reference to possessing spiritual wealth in Matthew 13 (to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven). Since God is faithful as an overseer (the ultimate and incorruptible leader) He will provide the necessities for those that respond to His calling to facilitate their work in His Kingdom. So with a just God at the helm there will be no need for human hierarchy nor would there be a need to fight for equality. From a strictly utopian perspective IF everybody valued the secrets of God's Kingdom over their basic necessities, there won't be any more poverty!  So, just based on the 2 biblical passages above, I see that Peterson's analysis using the two propositions applied on the political and social levels is a flip-side of Jesus' ultimate teaching. Hence our reality is the opposite of Utopia that has led to the undesirable outcomes for humanity at large. One can almost hear in Jesus' words, 'the poor will always be with you' (John 12: 8) at work perpetually in Peterson's propositions: pursue misdirected values to transcend suffering and you'll have a need for human hierarchy and the fight for equality permanently at odds with each other, resulting in poverty for the majority.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@Saucerer6,"Note taking for myself as I watch this video. And also to see if what I managed to glean from his arguments was in fact what he meant. 1. Hierarchy The existence of humanity and of every living being is codependent, or rather, co-exists with a hierarchical structure that society revolves around. This is proven by the fact that for life to have meaning, it must have pursuit of a goal(?) and that in a species some members of the species will simply be better than others at this pursuit. Thus a hierarchy of ability and competence is born. The problem is, with a hierarchy, that it is not equal and in a hierarchy there are always those at the bottom (the poor and disenfranchised) this is a major flaw and must be fixed. Also the distribution of power and influence is affected most severely by a hierarchy in such that a great deal of power goes to those at the top(?). This becomes a serious problem when your hierarchy is too steep and there are too little people controlling the direction and purpose of humanity. On the matter or liberals and conservatives and how they fall into this system is the way that these two mindsets/ideologies are most prone to think in. Conservatives are good at construction of algorithmic solutions and systems and good at implementation of said systems into hierarchies and can climb hierarchies built under such a manner. Liberals are good at creating new hierarchies and covering new ground. We need a balance of both because in a hierarchy ruled by conservatives, the system stagnates and that is untenable because the state of the world is ever changing and we must similarly adapt. With a hierarchy dominated by liberals, many new systems and more new ground can be broken but it is inherently an unstable hierarchy prone to collapse.  A mix of both would be in the best interest of the continued functioning of human society.",5년 전,0,

@DekkarJr,"Blew my mind in the first 5 minutes. Everything I've been trying to say to my parents when they were alive about why I cant just sit around and be grateful  that I have what I have which is a lot because they are wealthy and worked very hard and spoiled me endlessly, but I did not value the excess and luxury of wealth - what others refer to as privelage I refer to as a psychological trap. We need purpose and in order to have that we have to be moving to something of value and moving to that value as a forward motion is fundamental biological principle that even unicellular life understands as necessary for survival. So that's why you have people in the streets fighting for some made up utopian ideal , because they are trapped in a political fantasy revolution that they have to keep believing in or else t hey have no underpinning reason to be alive at all - quite literally every day they get to riot and protest is another day they prolongate their existence - the day they break they will spiral into mental illness and suicide/.  This is why it is so concerning to me that our entire societies education system does not prepare us to tackle life in this step by step way that makes sense and is definable and fits well within what we understand about our own biological imperatives. I am one of those girls who's got that psychological complex of suddenly I've got a trust fund full of money and nothing of value to move forward to and thats just x + y = z and z =  baby craziness lol. It's like its DNA begging me to reproduce even tho I never before this point considered doing so because the life course I was on was fatalistic and my day to  reason to be alive was simply kept afloat by drugs and anti depressants.  The fact that a man like JBP has awakened so many of us to reality at an age where so much of the world has already passed us by and we are now scrambling to cling to a forward moving reason to be alive and to have value in society is insane to me. Why we don't teach kids, hey you dont just ""need to go get a job, and have responsibilities of an adult NOW GO PULL YOURSELF UP LIKE YOUR GRANDPA DID LOL"" the entire bootstraps thing is the same message but the wording needs to be YOU WILL NOT VALUE DAY TO DAY LIFE WITHOUT A REASON TO BE. There fore you have to have something to move forward to, a goal, a greater good - you have no choice now that God is Dead via the enlightenment   There's almost like a profoundly overwhelming depressive state that I get into when I listen to JBP say "" now that you understand reality you need to go and tackle it"" and im left almost speechless just forming arguments as to why he is absolutely correct but t hat this needs to be told to everyone by many many people in their lives and I don't understand how civilization reached such a technological and social apex point in the 20th century only to allow the generations of children who now had an economically secure bungee cord that the parents just never cut off. It didn't matter that they knew I was an addict, my dad would be so awash in confusion as to what to do to ""help me"" that I of course I had him shower me in alcohol and prescription drugs, that was the only thing I found worth justifying existence and its so much harder now existing without those  things and knowing my people in AA and NA are primarily okay with simply existing as day to day admitted addicts is somehow their own noble new purpose in society and thats just not good enough for me. I didn't choose that route, and many of them didn't either but man, is that the totality of my accomplishments do you guys think? It is a difficult thing to remain sober but that I am  of course I want for the things normal people have, relatiosnhips, marriage, kids, a future to move forward to... but had I ever understood that those things were the eventual goal and  that really we should never have ever had this idea that its okay to just go to college and party because the moment you start self medicating with sex or alcohol, you are sorted into the 25% of people who leave iwth a degree and problem that will more often than not gradient their entire life course with substance abuse. LIKE WHY DIDNT ANY ONE TELL ME - lol - ""just say no to drugs!"" and at the same time giving no real valid explanation as to why we could possibly find ourselves trapped in a cycle of bad choices should we ever say yes.... its just not a concept that I and many young people listened to or cared about - to millions of us , that was the point and the purpose and we just thought it all would fall into place later and we'd get our act together. No one ever considers they will be the one with brain damage and a variety of permenant disorders as a result of doing so many and for so long and at such high doses.  Plz if you think your kid is in college and is on drugs or alcohol - find out if they are or not and do something about it, my parents knew I was and they thought that they didnt keep enabling me that I wouldn't love them. The exact opposite is true, I was always without a way to say it suffering - we all are if we are trapped in that with no future, it doesn't matter what we say. Shake them by the shoulders and plz plz plz do not let them grow into their late 20s and 30s resentful and hopeless - death by overdose is a fate I wish I had befallen after finally getting sober - because now my fate is just the fact that after 34 years of being alive, all I have is a circle of folding chairs containing people who gather to keep each other from relapsing and dying and then being truly nothing, it's like come on what the fuck am I supposed to do with money, with property, with life when all I am now capable of feeling is reward is that I get to say I made it one more day to a group of people that if we congregated any where else but in the basement of a church we'd get people concerned for the safety of society because we are so adjacent to criminals, to the homeless :( how do I go from here doc. ?:( ... :(   Anyway besides all of my own personal issues - on another note: it's interesting  and makes even more sense as moving forward to value something It helps back up evolution as a constant need for increasingly necessary resources like food sources obviously must have driven fish to evolve into amphibians and repitiles right? They could sense the need for growing legs through their sense for the existence of a greater value of resources on the shore? That make sense?:) I like making little points on the internet tho, that could be my day to day value?:)",5년 전,3,

@cantLetYouGetClose,"I love how douchebags pop into the comment section of every JBP video and call into question his intellect and knowledge.   I mean disagree on the issues as much as you want (would be nice if you included an argument to back that up – weird idea, i know), but three things I noticed over the years since I first heard him speak on JRE in 2016:  - whenever I dug into a claim he made that I had a hunch could be oversimplified or cherry-picked to further his agenda, investing many hours over several days/weeks each time to form my own opinion, I had to come to the conclusion that JBP absolutely knew what he was talking about and was well aware of the relevant literature. he doesn't just seem like the kind of guy who does his homework, thinks shit through and chooses his words carefully, he really does. Again, feel free to challenge that, but if you don't back it up with some serious proof (not opinion), you're just making an ass out of yourself.   - I had to take a break from all things JBP some time in 2018 because I had just consumed so much of his content (both 2017 UofT Psych lecture series, most interviews I could find and a bunch of other talks/lectures, including most of the bible series, as well as reading both his books), and there being multiple universes of interesting topics to learn about, thinkers to listen to and books to read. Since then, this was the first JBP content I watched – and I just have to say that I don't know many thinkers that can claim to play in the same league when it comes to crafting cohesive arguments from such a broad background in response even to weirdly framed questions, on the fly. he was constantly debating people for years, in public, with many just salivating at the idea of him making a mistake and getting tripped up. what have YOU done proving YOUR intellect and knowledge?  90% of the ""JBP is the stupid person's intellectual"" haven't read a single book/research paper of the caliber that JBP casually cites, and integrating material to that point of mastery is a different ballgame all together (gnosis & epignosis).  - and maybe most importantly, JBP isn't afraid of admitting when he is wrong about something, judging from the very few examples I saw happen across roughly 120-160 hours of content. that really impresses me, as he knows very well that he will be attacked viciously by political enemies for the tiniest mistake.",5년 전,0,

@fkustaa,"Patterson is always heavily Eurocentric and more specifically a Canadian psychologist who likes to dwell in his theories while talking and considering himself to be a scientist and clinician. However, he always continues assuming that the world works according to his values and expectations when he says ""why should people not be allowed free speech to offend others."" But Patterson cannot go to a country like Germany and try to advocate the same free speech approach where it is illegal to hurl offensive and insulting comments to Jews and Holocaust survivors. The world everywhere doesn't work according to Patterson's theories. Also, contrary to his claim, the UK has not dealt with the issue of tribalism better than other countries where for centuries during its imperialist era that country manipulated the issues of tribalism for its benefit of colonialism control. The North American countries and the UK are still tribal. The only difference is that here the issue of tribalism is called race, ethnicity, or nationality where there are still divisions in these countries along ethnic and racial lines (boundaries). Above all, Patterson is so contradictory. He starts his presentation with a simplistic division of society into two main groups, namely what he calls conservatives and liberals that include leftists and postmodernists. He implies that the good guys in society are people like him who don't belong to those two groups. Then, in response to the second to the last question, he claims that he doesn't believe in labeling people and groups on ideological grounds. On the last question, he implies that Justin Trudeau as the leader of Canada, an astute and democratically elected politician whose constituencies that reach across all the Canadian groups, would be interested in being advised by Patterson on the issue of free speech and about their demands as voting members of Trudeau's political constituency. I don't think that Paterson's advice to Treadeau on those issues would be helpful to the Prime Minister of Canada. Paterson, a divisive character at Canadian universities, can disagree with Trudeau as the leader of the country all he wants, but he cannot claim or imply that Trudeau is dividing people in Canada according to their tribal groups just because he disagrees with him.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

If you are saying that his ""idea"" is simply that power structures are a reflection of human nature in some sort of way (and the ""way"" is the bit which would need to be elaborated on massively) then he is surely stating the obvious.  Of course power structures, as well as anything else built by humans, are a reflection of human nature.  It wouldn't be a reflection of lion nature or honey badger nature would it? This is obvious.  It's like somebody saying the present is a reflection of the past historical events and human nature.  This is all obvious.  So at this point I cannot give up my view that JP is a charlatan.

Peterson go ahead and answered the question as if it's a reasonable question -- but the logos guy's assumption that the quiet voices haven't been presented in toto more times than I can count and the majority continue to choose the other option.  It was an issue of reasonability, not volume, for God's sakes.  Peterson answered the woman's question about where truth comes from if god doesn't exist as if she asked a question re: meaning.  The obvious answer is 'truth comes from nature'.  Can't avoid it, ever, lol.  [Even the 'miracles' in the Bible are all just riddles about the earth's magic and processes -- water to wine describes a vineyard that takes water & grapeseeds to make wine -- the seeds they used to put in bread could be planted, tended, and harvested and make enough flour to feed thousands:  seeds from 5 loaves could feed 5,000, easily -- using mud on the eyes to heal blindness -- etc., etc. ...

The whole of western civilisation would be a far worse place without the foundation of Christianity as its basis, and He believes that to be true, as I do also.

I think that Peterson's tendencies are liberal to the extent that his proclivity is to oppose tyranny, and the inequalities that tyrannies inevitably bring. IN the end, it is the academia who are the conservatives, to the extent that they are upholding the current power structures of their ideology. In the end there is not any difference between a right wing tyranny, and a left wing one. It is his creative genius that he is reorganizing the myths of the past to align with the science of the body. He does draw inspiration from the past, so in that way he is a conservative. But for his ideas to take effect in the world would be a truly revolutionary thing. His is not a traditional Judeo-Christian understanding, not by a logn shot. Meaning does not come from God in his evolutionary model of psychology, but from the evolved mechanisms of the body itself. Meaning is a bodily phenomena and a bodily experience.

@MrDoomsdayBomb,"That's the one thing that seems to hold Peterson back the most. He forces this dichotomy between a free exchange of ideas and tyranny, when in fact the free exchange of ideas produces its own tyranny of normalization. His philosophy would work best in an ideal world without inherently discriminatory normalizations, but our world is one of rampant bias and irrationality, elements that do not befit at all a rational marketplace of ideas. He may even agree that doing away with ""arbitrary regulations"" would necessarily allow discriminatorily irrational persuasions because the alternative is war and death, but maybe that opposition is false - maybe the alternative is not a slippery slope to abject despair but a more dynamic route whereby we increase regulation so that we construct the material conditions in such a way as to increase the benefit:cost ratio of future deregulation more than otherwise.",5년 전,0,

@RudolfCickoMusic,"Summary: - By moving toward that value (by dedicating, studying, practising, investigating, whatever your want) you will build that value in your life.  And from this base, then: - Your social circle will be more likely to be related to that value (with people moving toward the same value), therefore there will be a pyramidal hierarchy (a minority of people that  is fantastically succesfull at the top, and a large number will stack up at the bottom)  - Hierarchies are dangerous because they can create inequality and tyranny. Because there will be people that use power to attain status in the hierarchy.  - If the hierarchy is too steep, people at the bottom will have excess suffering and nothing to lose, and he says that is not a good way to produce a sustainable society.  Then he starts to talk more about the political sides: - The right is basically that portion of the population who's temperamental proclivity is to admire and support hierarchies and work effectively within them (a conservative) and are low for trait openness (creativity).   - On the other side, the liberals, are very good generating hierarchies, high creativity, less consciousness, bad working within a hierarchy.  Therefore, a society needs both parts: - Liberals to build new value, new hierarchies. - Conservatives to actually implement them.  Without liberals, society would be too static and would not adapt to a environment transformations. Without conservatives, liberals would create new possibilities but they would not be able to build an actuality.  Finally, he concludes that we need a voice to make work in both parties in cooperation.",5년 전,1,

The mentioned values are so important to the left that they willing delegate astronomical authority to the state for absolute equality to be enforced in all social structures (work, school and in public) so they can penalize the defectors. today such authoritarianism is expressed in the forcing of people to use certain gender pronouns n.o.s in speech and if they dont they are penalized and publicly labeled a bigot. the left values the mentioned more than the individual citizen's rights; in contrast, conservatives value the individuals right as the most important and of more value than anything else (such rights as defense against bodily harm, to practice religion and for free speech.) it takes a hierarchical system for these values the be rated relative to the other. i also dint think these radicals truly understand complete equality; theyd have to sdo away with a president because everyone is equal, no one can be above to oppress, women would be forced to work in labor =ous jobs in a ration equivalent to men (like construction or mechanics) and men would get equal custody of children in divorce and the wife must pay him alimony (with situational variances.)",5년 전,0,

This would be true if war was about forcing your own ideas on others at gunpoint but if you read 1984 you will see that war is actually a tool used to consume resources so man must keep toiling, his time wasted on war production, if we didn't waste time and resources making bullets wed all own a supercar by now.

@Myrrhth,"Does Peterson ever anywhere explain what the problem with tribalism is beyond only that it leads to mayhem, or violence? He oftens says this, but I haven't found anywhere where he explains exactly how the one leads to the other. I can't help but wonder, if he does give an explanation for this assumption, that it might turn out that it isn't the tribalism itself which leads to violence, but tribalism in addition to some other factor, or factors, the interplay of which initiates and progresses a certain process and course of events which eventually leads to violence or mayhem. And if, being aware of and understanding the process, we can, perhaps, arrest its progress, making tribalism viable. After all, being, as he says, so deeply rooted in our nature, it would, if it is possible to do so, behoove us, I shouldn't wonder, to work in congruence with our natures where possible, rather than attempting to override them when doing so is unnecessary.

@hc8379-f4f,"90% of what he had to say to this audience was uncontroversial. Suffice it to say that hierarchies of competence are produced on the right and on the left of the political spectrum. They even arise in dictatorships and empires and universities. And hierarchies of competence atrophy into power seeking in every scenario, given the chance. And no traditional political party believes that hierarchies disappear, giving way to utopian peace and good will.  But it's presently on the right that one finds considerable skepticism (if not total rejection) of hierarchies of competence. Climate change is the latest such manifestation. In economics, it's the myth that tax cuts create more government revenue, or the concept of the righteousness of a flat tax -- both of which are really talking points of the very rich. As to freedom of speech, it's in the greatest republic the world has ever known that the words liberal, progressive, and socialist have all been trashed together and obliterated from political discourse -- without a single law having been passed outlawing them.  As to the last question about what he would ask the Canadian prime minister (who is supposedly a left winger), the point to note is that Mr Peterson would never even be able to ask the current American president (who is a declared right winger) about anything he should reconsider, because, as the former has openly proclaimed -- he has never been wrong about anything.",5년 전,0,

@Taylorkaraoke,"Jordan ""am not a yes or no questions man"" Peterson",5년 전,31,
@kensears5099,"Dr. Peterson,   When the woman in the balcony threw the curveball at you that you were blanketly categorizing people by classing them, and their motives/instincts, into such groups as ""conservatives"" and ""liberals"", in the same way you accuse identity politics of doing, I sensed you were slightly thrown back on your heels, though you did respond sufficiently weightily, if not piercingly (we can't all be piercing all the time).   But what occurred to me as I watched it--from the stress-free luxury of my armchair, where I was never under pressure to come up with anything to the questions tossed at you--was that her challenge was rooted in an egregiously specious confounding of the descriptive with the prescriptive.   If it walks and talks like a duck, it's a duck. That's descriptivist.   If a man wants to conserve things (like, for instance, the ""hierarchy""), he's a conservative.  That's a descriptivist assertion.  Nothing in the least like what identity politics does.   Identity politics prescribes, on the most factitious, contrived, politically self-seeking premises.   ""Ah, you're black. Therefore THIS is: what you think, want, strive for, feel, resent, who you vote for, what party you belong to, how you'll get ahead in the world, who you'll depend on to see that it happens, and, finally, OUR role by divine right in your life.""   The woman's challenge was a rank conceptual manipulation, not a serious intellectual query; a gotcha moment, no pursuit of understanding.   Possibly I judge her too harshly.  My ""gut"" seems to know othewise, though, because   the difference between your description of conservatives and liberals  (a very limited description of qualities that broadly represent them as such--whatever else, we confidently assume, they may be in addition to that) and the classifications of identity politics (based on nothing but wishful thinking and propaganda) is such an obvious difference that it really requires a sort of idiot not to get it. And my gut also tells me the woman wasn't an idiot. So...well, we'll leave that there.   We always describe. I'm sitting in a room. It ""walks and talks"" like a room, therefore, it's a room. Call that my prejudice, by bias, my Western linear thinking, whatever you like, but I won't apologize for calling it a room. That's not to say anything more about it. I haven't mentioned which room it is. Or how it's decorated. Or whether it's a well-defined self-enclosed room of the old-fashioned sort or opens out into others on an ""open concept"" plan. I've stated the very minimum. As you seem to have when giving us the observed and quantified behaviors/attitudes that go into the descriptions ""conservative"" and ""liberal.""   The woman in the balcony was scraping the bottom of the barrel in her attempt to turn that kind of minimalist, observation-based description into the equivalent of identity politics (with which, apparently, she is sympathetic).   The comical thing about it being, she was effectively saying, ""So you're just as BAD as WE are!""   Except you're not. But there she is, left high and dry, self-accused.*  We can't talk without describing.   But that, of course, would suit the Left just fine. They don't want any of us to describe. (Which is why ""That's such a pretty dress you have on"" is hate speech.)   Or even talk for that matter. (""Your identity excludes you from having anything to say on this issue."" )   ""Just leave us to prescribe, while you submit"" appears to be their driving agenda.   That's how it worked in the Soviet Union, which is where I happen to live, in a ""post-"" fashion, of course--Ukraine, to be precise. And one of the first jokes I heard from a Ukrainian after arriving here in 1995 was: ""Everybody was happy in the Soviet Union. You never heard anybody say otherwise.""    *I noticed this tactic many decades ago, before the fall of the USSR. Even in my early 20s, when Phil Donahue was on his Russian-Détente kick, hosting American-Soviet ""chats"", I noted with a vivid disgust that absolutely every single time a question about Soviet atrocities was posed, the well-trained Russian would reply with something about America's darkest historical dimensions, e.g., slavery, the extermination of Native Americans, modern poverty and civil injustice. I noted with equal disgust that no one, either in the audience or Mr. Donahue himself, ever had the guts to challenge that and say, ""Ah, so you're saying America has done wrong, even criminally, just as much as the Soviet Union has? Is that what you're saying? If so, here's how America is trying to make amends for these real wrongs.... Now, how (to get back to the QUESTION if we may) is the Soviet Union attempting to redress its real, historical wrongs? Shall we begin with the genocidal Ukrainian Starvation of the 1930s?"" Nobody had, it seemed, either the presence of mind, or the courage, or even a yen to challenge these guests, who smugly smirked and batted away inconvenient questions with their strictly prepared script. And a strictly prepared script is the polar opposite of genuine reflection, unless of course your own genuine reflection went into it and you're ready to honestly entertain feedback afterwards! The profound comfort I draw from subsequent history is this: you can hornswoggle an audience, but you can't dupe Reality. Whoever you are, wherever and ""whenever"" you are in history's perpetually reconfiguring schema, Reality's coming for you. Sooner or later. Absolutely. ""There is nothing hidden that shall not be known."" Truth will out. You can tell the difference between two types of people, by the way, from how they respond to the proposition that ""truth will out."" The one type gleefully whispers to himself, ""Good. So I'll be proven right in the end"" (as, I've no doubt, Donahue's Soviet guest-stars were certain...and certainly wrong.) The other type quietly reassures himself, ""Good. So then, it doesn't all depend on me. And wherever I was wrong, the Truth will be better."" The former mind is a hollow, brittle carapace of self-involved desperation--in the words of the prophet Jeremiah, ""a heart of stone;"" the latter mind is one, again in the prophet's terms, of flesh: feeling, growing, vulnerable but vital.",5년 전,0,

@dr.radiobooks,"Gender and Sexuality in Latin America - Cases and Decisions (Ius Gentium: Comparative Perspectives on Law & Justice  <<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT9RaJhqVCQ>>>  Translated and updated from the seminal Spanish text on legal decisions affecting gender and sexuality in Latin America, this English edition is the only law text to focus specifically on the rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and the transgender population in addition to women’s rights more broadly. The volume provides close analysis of some of the most important decisions made by Latin American national courts, as well as those made by international legal bodies, that affect the rights and interests of these groups. Specially selected for their depth of argument and value as exemplars, the studies of good legal practice chart the path of the region’s normative values of justice as they have evolved away from a partial, and patriarchal, exercise of the law. They show how cases with vastly differing contexts such as, property rights and domestic violence have resulted in a mixed body of Latin American law.  Some decisions are protective of women’s and minority rights. Some assess the wider social impacts of case law in which recognition of the discrete legal identities within households challenges established precepts, including religious ones. Other cases have been chosen as cautionary examples of bad decision-making and for the poverty of their legal debate. Updated to include the latest relevant jurisprudence from across the continent, this book is an informed, cohesive, and comprehensive guide to understanding women’s and gender-based rights in Latin America.​",5년 전,0,

But he focuses on simpler matters and speak in such a way one might speak to a patient to give them a few new perspectives to think about. However Majority of his talks is from him to people who are interested or read up on the subjects of the matter so anyone not read up on it will mostly just hear ""Blablablabla"" but if you are read up on the subjects at hand there is much to understand from what he says and how careful he is to make sure it's not something you can interpret in several ways.

During the absence of her husband, a wife is required to protect her chastity, her dignity, and her family's property. In Islam, a wife's proper place is usually at home. However, for the greater good of the family, to help her husband, to share the burden of the household, or for other chores of the family life, or to pursue an appropriate occupation or profession, she is allowed to come outside, provided that she guards her chastity, respect, and dignity. Women are required by Allah to cover their body and wear proper Islamic veil when in public. If one pays close attention and sincerely explores the consequences of immodesty and obscenity, one will reach the conclusion that eventually, in one way or another, immodesty and obscenity bring disastrous results to society and irreversible damage to the dignity of men and women.    Islam is the religion which for the very first time in the world has consoled and comforted miserable women. It has become affectionate to them. Instead of leaving them being oppressed Islam has made them a respectable member of the society. In short, Islam has closed the chapter of cruelties and injustice being done to women forever and has given them all the permissible rights which they deserve. Undoubtedly, it is such a great favor of Islam for women that humanity will remain proud of it until Judgement Day.",5년 전,0,

However, in the fields of religion, economics, and politics, he is not a figure of authority and some of his propositions are quite foolish. I agree with him on his stance on Canada's C-16 Bill, as well as his assessment of equality of opportunity vs. equality of outcome. However, he is not a particularly intelligent gentlement when it comes to the fields of Capitalism (which I support fully), Socialism, and Communism.

@nevokrien95, @Nikhil-zj3py   Depends what u want.   Byond good and evil is the most philosophical  But it has racisem. The bad ideas of the time made him a disservice.   U can kind of solve it via race=colture   The gay scince is more story like. It is lighter and more fun (for a philosophy book). It is slightly sexist. So u need to time translate whats possible.   If u want to understand religion anti crist has some cool parts.   Zaratostra is a big book about how u should live. It has loots of metafors and the third part isnt very good.

Yes of course.    But that does not mean you can simply dismiss en masse the huge amount of work and insight he has offered.,5년 전,204,

If Hitler was the one to discover and say that the Sun is the center of our solar system, it would still be true even though he was an evil bastard.  For what it's worth, i am acting in good faith, and have learned many interesting ideas from JP.

@Richard_is_cool," @tux1968  Well, in my view, he starts with things that are true (like ""clean your room"", an obviously correct albeit basic advice), but then slowly proceeds to utter untrue statements on philosophy, gender, and so on.

@tux1968," @Richard_is_cool  Well he has made a huge contribution of ideas to public discourse, I could barely begin to list the ideas that have struck me as interesting.   Here is just one: that the bible myths encode deep evolutionary knowledge that is critical to our survival, but do so in a way that precedes our ability to articulate what that knowledge is or how it is important.   Such  knowledge bubbles up and has a larval stage that exists before it could ever be spoken of in rational terms.   That humans often have to make decisions before a rational treatise can be formulated to help decide, and that we should be tapped into and respect this pre-rational process and not reject it just because some of its ideas have since been honed and better understood rationally.",5년 전,94,
@Richard_is_cool," @tux1968  Thank you. I would include this in the camp of basic true facts. Of course mythology is extremely important for a society. Of course the Bible (or Iliad or Odyssey) is the most important book. He definitely wasn't the first to notice the importance of myths for a society (most famously, there was Jung). Nor the fact that myths do contain literary truths. That is a given. Now, if this is what you take from Peterson, then he truly did not yet manage to sell you anything that is untrue. However, he definitely wasn't the first to say it (all the priests have been talking about the Bible, of course, since it was written), nor did he say it most eloquently and aesthetically (there you would have to go for Jung). He merely popularized it for present YouTube audience of 20 year old atheist males, basically. Which again, is good, just in my book it is on par with telling them they should clean their room. Basic. True. And obvious. If you dismiss the Bible, or Vedas, and so on, in you understanding of another culture, you're making a grave, yet for others obvious, error.",5년 전,8,
@tux1968," @Richard_is_cool  I am of course paraphrasing and summarizing what he has said, only to the best of my ability.  He goes into much more depth; he is a deep and honest thinker.   That doesn't make him infallible, but I don't think it makes him a bad faith actor.  If you can dismiss everything someone says that you agree with as ""obvious"" and anything they say you disagree with as proof of bad faith, there isn't a single person in this world who would avoid being burned at the stake.  You seem like a smart and honest person, I'll just offer you my own take.  Peterson is not a messiah, he is a flawed person like all of us.  But he is smart and has a valuable view of the world that is in short supply in our culture today.  Even if you end up disagreeing with most of what he says, you should value and defend his contribution to the ongoing public conversation we need more than ever.",5년 전,81,
@tux1968," @Richard_is_cool  Thanks, I will read your links.  I have no problem with challenging JP on any idea or statement.

Jordan Peterson wrote:  “People aren’t after happiness, they’re after not hurting.” Nathan J. Robinson answer is: I’m actually after happiness, thanks.... mmm ok This is something a 5 year old would say. This guy tries to critique something he doesn't understand. Why would anyone do that ? He doesn't even bother to understand what Peterson said there, he just wrote it off because he is unable to grasp it, so of course it must be a fallacy. I don't know what he is after but not the truth. As far as I can tell Peterson at least tries to put himself forward and he is willing to learn and listen to anyone being that a scientist,  religious person or any of his students. The next sentence shows the I am sorry to say, stupidity of this Robinson guy. Jordan Peterson wrote: “People do not care whether or not they succeed; they care about whether or not they fail.”  Nathan J. Robinson answer is: Which is apparently different... WOW How did this guy finish at Yale is beyond me, this now seems to be an incredible achievement. Apparently they let anyone in who probably pays well, what a shame.

@Richard_is_cool," @DmNetworks  The point is bringing up Robinson doesn't really invalidate his points against Peterson. And those articles aren't of course the only ones, there are three in the Jacobin: https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/02/jordan-peterson-enlightenment-nietzsche-alt-right https://jacobinmag.com/2020/06/jordan-peterson-jung-ideology https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/04/jordan-peterson-capitalism-postmodernism-ideology (I'm sure the author of those was also wrongly admitted to whatever school they attended).  I mean, the whole point of Peterson is pretty transparent to be invalid, right? How many years is it since the bill in Canada that made him famous? The one which supposedly puts you in prison if you don't use someone's preferred pronouns? How many people are actually in jail for that now?  And what of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory? It is literally listed on Wikipedia as a conspiracy theory. He is a conspiracy theorist. That is the mainstream view, not of some Mr. Robinson.",5년 전(수정됨),6,
@DmNetworks,"​ @Richard_is_cool  ""The point is bringing up Robinson doesn't really invalidate his points against Peterson. "" There is a contraction in your statement here, because yes it does  if his response doesn't make any sense with someone with  a little bit of logic between their ears.  He critics Peterson with what I wrote there. He wrote it. I didn't invent it, you just have to read it. Why would you bring up something else entirely if not to try to prove a point after your first try was disproven? Do you know what confirmation bias is? However, I don't agree with everything that Peterson says, but he is a good debater and a good teacher. He even states that he could be wrong many times and would be happy to learn something new from every debates he is in.  I don't really have time to look into your other links, sorry,  especially since the one in Jacobmag written by HARRISON FLUSS tries to attack him by referring to the  ""lobster comparison"" as pseudoscience. At this point I am sorry that I cannot take him seriously, why? because it's not pseudoscience , it's a perfectly valid point until disproven otherwise. Why would he say that? Is he a scientist to evaluate this?  I even looked in why would this Fluss say that the lobster comparison is pseudoscience. He refers to a paper from phys.org, which says this: ""Peterson, however, claims that the nervous systems of humans and lobsters are in fact so similar that antidepressants work on lobsters. One such drug, Prozac, has been shown to block serotonin uptake into serotonergic nerve terminals in lobsters. So yes, because the molecule is the same and the nerve terminals are very similar, the drug does what it was designed to do. But it did not make lobsters happier."" ok but Peterson NEVER said ANYWHERE that lobsters are happier because of the drug... It doesn't even refute Peterson's claim. So yes, if you really try to get to the bottom of things you many times find shallow objections that don't hold up. I am sure that if you try, you can find a fallacy in something that JP is saying, even I can point out some. That's why debates are for, and by the way if you live somewhere in the western world you might have an opportunity to ask questions yourself in meetings like this one above. Good luck!",5년 전,24,
@Richard_is_cool," @DmNetworks  I thought you were gonna say this. The point is nobody says that Robinson is a world class intellectual, the main philosopher of our age.

This section must be read in context to what precedes it. it refers to three people who receive a ""task"" to fulfill. E.g. a fund manager receives money to invest. One does well but the other Is slothful and sits around and does little. The bosses will obviously take away what they gave him and give it to those who invest well and he will lose his job. That accounts for every area of life. if you are a good athlete but do nothing with your gift you will lose your ability to be good at that gift whereas the one that practices hard will excel and receive even more.    So this whole concept of losing what you have is about not using what you were given and not about rich and poor and gifted and not gifted. it is all about using what you what you have or face the consequences of your slothfulness.",5년 전,0,

The Voting rights act of 1965 took place a long time ago (recently gutted by Robert´s court umpire ways), but people are flexible enough to revive racism not only against blacks, but now Muslims in genocidal ways. Another interesting question, worth attending to, and to push it in a direction that will not toilet-ize the possible exchanges with others is: does the left that carried out the gerrymandering to turn those societies into more peaceful, or, ""civilized"" (the sections against the campaigns of extermination in the middle east) are they the left he opposes? do they count as changes that put in danger western civilization? are the people behind the voting rights act, and other changes the left he opposes?

I think that there are moments when being less responsible does not necessarily mean you will be more free. So, that if I ground some ethics on nature, open ended evolutionary process with a degree of in-built uncertainty as to where it wants to go, I will be more free, because I have to think less about how it is that I will be responsible.

Why is it that by them organizing, and seeking not to become the object of somebody else´s incestual violence, not a case of them being responsible, rather than a case that shows that they forgo the concept of responsibility. The rights for which non-opportunistic politically correct people fight are individual rights. It concerns every individual. And the fight that took place since the beginning of the century with unions, and civil rights for minorities are exemplary cases of political correctness taking responsibility when it comes to some other not letting them rob them of their autonomy. So, here we have two attributes within the left that exist, or, existed at some point (less now in the case of the destruction of unions) in the shaping of themselves as a group that was not looking for the wiping out of the other. The other, fascists, or, racists, or xenophobic, etc can only be responsible as a fascist, or, be free as a fascist. Right-wingers refuse to be responsible as a leftist agent. They do not want to be responsible in such a manner. And this carries serious consequences for other people. They do not meet the same fate if a leftist is responsible for: weekends, vacations universal healthcare, control at the workplace, conditions at the workplace, etc. The two groups, hierarchies, and asymmetries are not the same.

He begins with biology, and reads history as an outcome of biology not allowing history to intervene in natural processes as it certailny does: ""raping women is outlawed"", etc. We do not let ourselves be exposed to the weather, but deny it such power by construting houses. Select the best lands upon which to  farm, and take responsability for deriving knowledge about itself (nature) that it refuses to provide us with (as Nietzsche pointed out).

Peterson needs to realize that Foucault is not the problem.  Foucault is not the problem.  You cannot understand the academic landscape without Foucault, at least in terms of how the organization and documentation of the European is a historical event in which, once understood can render the idea of 'participation' as a higher good than 'correctness' -- or that if we are to understand (to get the meaning right), we must look into the 'terms of participation'.

@Frosty-oj6hw,"And importantly this effect of wanting to get at the truth or validity of ideas is something that universities were set up to do in the first place, that there's an unwritten expectation that it's a battleground of ideas and you don't go there to win by having your argument come out on top. The winners are the people that learn something new and useful whether they agreed with it initially or not. I think this was displayed extremely well in the Peterson vs Harris 4 part debates. Sadly I think that it's something the universities and maybe not necessarily Oxford are losing extremely rapidly due to the onset of disciplines which are ideological in nature, and these are post modern ideas, things like social justice, feminism, which are sneaking marxism back into society through the back door. And the resulting fallout of this is students asserting to professors that Uni's must be a safe space, it's absolutely appalling.  Also to add to Peterson's reply on this specific issues one thing I think can also soften the blow of the problem that people feel excluded or too anxious to speak their ideas, is you can do assertiveness training, you can through practice and through therapy learn to overcome a lot of anxiety, and that can in theory ameliorate some of the suffering people feel when they put forward their ideas. It's also worth noting that sometimes when you do feel uncomfortable putting out counter ideas to someone else who has done the same, you can't just assume they put their ideas out without also feeling anxious about it, sometimes the people you're debating have also suffered but they put out their ideas anyway and took that suffering on the chin.",5년 전,1,
@Frosty-oj6hw," Al Garnier  I never said anything about opinion, please don't put words in my mouth. It should be about knowledge backed by data, but data is the end result of a long process where you start with a hypothesis and then design experiments and then go and perform them, write up the papers and then the papers are peer reviewed, published, and then discussed back and forth, attempted to be replicated or falsified. That whole process necessarily requires that people be able to stick up for ideas they believe are right and pursue those ideas even if those ideas are offensive to some people. And in the arena where these ideas battle each other the hope is that if any are correct that will come to the surface and we'll learn something new. And so shutting down research and ideas because you find them offensive and it makes the university no longer a ""safe space"" is corrupt to the very core. And these is not an accident, these people pushing these ideas are ideologues who have been trained by marxist professors to fight for these specific privileges because they know full well that their ideas of things like radical equality are not scientifically valid and so they're eventually going to lose the debate. So they must win through domination of law and policy and restricts on free speech, which is exactly what we see them going after.",5년 전,1,
@Frosty-oj6hw," Al Garnier  Ideas are opinions until they're validated by going through a process of evaluation after which they are elevated from opinion to fact, and that process of validation is necessarily a competitive one because people need to compete in the arena of ideas to promote what they think is right. You don't get from opinion all the way to fact without upsetting some people, and in that regards universities are set up to be a space in which debate is legitimate and can happen unimpeded so the total sum knowledge of humanity can be expanded. And radical lefists are attempting to shut that down by turning them into safe spaces where ideas they personally do not like are not allowed.

@danielrafferty4108,"​ Al Garnier  Dude, either your trolling this reply thread or you need to go watch that dialogue between the two again. Plus, your views on religion and myth are very narrow minded. How about this, instead of shitting on people's religious beliefs with banal indictments why don't you read some of these texts and figure out that beyond the premise of the question of whether god exists or not they can be termed as a broad form of cultural romanticism. I mean to broadly categorise everything as myths and legends may not be wrong in a purely objective fashion, but to say they can't hold value in the modern day or be re-contextualised just shows a lack of imagination. People's operating systems often thrive off of stories, far fetched or not and with time more and more people have been moving from a fundamentalist zeal for stories to more of a critical reverence for (at least in my eyes) a creative means of solving the problem of unifying people under a code of ethics and belief system to weather the storms of a cruel reality where unification is key. It's just like any rhetoric, it can be hijacked by those acting in bad faith, but that doesn't mean the belief system in itself is morally objectionable if one were to have the patience to figure out or at least posit what the original authors intent was. And even if it were, if you view it as a product of the context and times in which it was written (which in turn I'll grant you this point, not everyone does hence the issue of fundamentalism) then I think you'll be less intolerant of people's disposition to find meaning in god. I mean it's not for me but I can at least humour the idea of God without accepting it. The only problem with hate speech is that people use it to denote an aggressive ignorance that can escalate. It's hard not feel like in danger when some verbally accosts you as our brains are wired for fight or flight responses in times of stress but the metric for what constitutes hate speech is very anecdotal and changes from group to group. Jordan made that point much more eloquently than I could so I suggest you watch that part of the video if you didn't get that from what he was saying.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@danielrafferty4108," Al Garnier  To be fair, I'm actually parsing these arguments being laid out along with the counter arguments right now on the the big four part debate between Sam Harris and Jordan Petersen. I'm not my most cogent falling asleep to it at quarter to three where I hail so I'll refrain from actually raising any other issues till tomorrow if indeed I have any. Looking back, on some of what I wrote it's really just reactionary to what you said to other people in this reply thread. I need to remind myself that a lack of tact when dealing with other people is not a lack valid points. But I did offer a compromise I thought in my idea of cultural romanticism. it didn't track with actual feelings when thinking it out in other comments through youtube. Religion I feel back then was mechanism that cultures used to survive and proliferate while the stories these religions imbued themselves with is almost like a romanticism of past atrocities (at least in the Judaeo part of Judaeo christian belief, but this was born from the argument I made that from the precept of the idea that religion should be scrapped for the idea of individual belief.) It's my belief that religion is like a way for every culture to reconcile with past misdeeds. Sometimes this surprisingly comes out with ethical and moral precepts derived from or designed to combat these stories.  I guess what I'm saying is I'm more interested in the phenomenology behind the idea or belief that storied individuals who may or may not have had a real place in history had a view to some divine insight or being and the ethical frame works derived from this belief, the good and the bad (as there's a fair mix of both). I don't believe in any way that it should supersede 21st century thought however just that it should be respected as the hereditary backbone that made the perpetuation of certain cultures and societies to this day possible. I hope this clarifies my view on the matter a little more succinctly than my first comment which may have been framed as too much of an attack from the way I wrote it.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@danielrafferty4108," Al Garnier  Yep, I'll grant you some of these points for sure. I don't believe the actions of god stacks up well with the rhetoric in holy scriptures written by ""holy"" men. I think the idea of how certain religious and Hebraic scholars interpret the idea of ""Hashem Ish Milchama"" or ""Hashem is a man of war""  and how it is conflated with the reinterpretation ""Hashem Ish Mi Lechem"" of ""Hashem is a man of bread"" with the explanation given that god only sanctions war when his people are in need. I.e he only sanctions war from his people when they are in some of privation.  To me this distinction between one translation and another is only a way reiterating what the verse said with further context afforded to people thousands of years later to make the verse seem more forgiving which is why I agree with Sam Harris on the point that the more you reinterpret a holy text the further you stray away from the text itself and into a sort of quasi moral relativism that a detractor can make claim has nothing to really do with your religion.   I don't think any of this or your argument detracts from my wish that world religions be replaced by the notion of Cultural romanticism however, but perhaps that's my fault for not cogently stating what I mean by this. Essentially religious romanticise past misdeeds and use god as a vehicle to profess a moral or ethical lesson (I never once stated the morals directly correlated to the idea that the phenomenology of the prophets meeting with the actual literal reading that god actually exists, just that it was framed as such with the inception of each new idea derived from each story). To use the term cultural romanticism I simply mean how a culture uses God to reconcile with an ugly past to retain some form dignity for future generations.  Of course the editorial process of any top down structure in control of such texts perverts the texts with each translation or reinterpretation the further we divulge from the culture and initial instance in which it was written, which is why i think we should just shelve these books and go enough already! This is what you're book says and you can either like it or lump it.  In essence I'm suggesting that we should move to a tacit or implicit understanding that these books are fiction. It may be a fools errand to hope for as much but this is where I view the relevance of such books.   Unfortunately for us therein lies the problem that people who read and ascribe their life to what they've read in these books believe that deriving meaning is the same as deducing fact and use faith as coping mechanism when confronted on this fallacy. I have been a humanist myself ever since I decided that the works of Kurt Vonnegut at the age of twelve held more meaning to me personally than any one religious text and as a computing scientist and STEM ambassador I couldn't agree more that intelligence is the driving factor of humanity, but intelligence moulds itself to the times in which it was born in the past and the most intelligent people used religion to get what they want or to unite a people in times of strife. it's not an effective model for intelligent people in modern times as it flies in the face of scientific reasoning, but it definitely held more of a benefit then as it does now even if it still amounts to a mode of control. All this being said, I value your opinion on this with perhaps the exception of your interpretation of Jordan's intent with his arguments. If you could clarify on why you view his arguments as bigotry I would love to hear that. I wouldn't mind you delving into your religious upbringing if it's not too painful to do so as I have my own past with evangelism through certain friends of family which has it's good points and it's reprehensible parts which I in turn could go into in another post.

@danielrafferty4108," Al Garnier  I can grasp the concept of that from your post alone as I know in a general fashion that artificial intelligence is indeed modelled on this but it's not my primary field in computing science (far from it) so any further elucidation on the subject is much appreciated. I'm very interested to see what the scientist predict (if they do) when artificial consciousness becomes artificial sentience and where they think the model for AI will go once it's in part controlled by the AI itself.  I appreciate those last two sentences. It doesn't invalidate my own romantic notion to shelve religious texts as art or fiction but it does summarise your position really astutely and I don't really disagree. I guess I got emotive due to my misguided sense of duty to stand up for world views, though this is a form of empathy that can quickly devolve to delusions of grandeur on par with virtue signalling.

(I've just went through a workout and some cleaning of the house and had some faff on instead of the podcast (didn't want to be too busy for the podcast) but i'm eager to watch it now so if these points are further elaborated on there apologies) Consciousness is defined as the ability to have subjective awareness or experience of something while sentience is the ability to formulate introspective thoughts on these conscious experiences. While we only have the biological model for this, isn't the jury still out that such emergent properties can arise from other models of life such as machines and computers in the realms of artificial intelligence(I mean I wasn't necessarily meaning a simulation of the human mind in these regards). I mean in terms of the emotional baggage that comes with sentience maybe that's impossible or even ill advised, but then again I don't know if emotion is strictly a bottle neck as you say, just that it's easy for people to weaponize ideas that prey on it.

@presidentlouis-napoleonbon8889," @DylanZapf-dm4mh  Actually, Jordan Peterson disagrees. Jordan Peterson is using his tactic of agreement in a disagreement. By agreeing in something that the opponent might agree, you can grab the attention and open up the mind of the opponent not thinking ""This guy is just another 'hate speecher'"", but rather ""This guy actually is quite right!"". By doing this and you get the attention, then you go on the offensive (not in an agressive way). After you open the mind of the opponent, you start refuting at the opponent one by one, not doing it with any harsh tone, but seemingly agreeing, but actually he is changing his mind.

It was almost as if he was asking the stupid questions so I didn’t need to (or get frustrated that I couldn’t ask him or myself and get a decent answer). It is a bit of an indictment though. I’m not long in the game of computing science, still in Uni for one last year and just actively on the job market in the field while I’m doing my last but I realise the scientific vernacular and facts of my field (and perhaps many others) has maybe petulantly (or to spare more indictment on these fields and mine just dismissively) refused to partake in philosophy of thought (beyond the material, or the immateria of big data). I understand now why you think Jordan Petersen is bandied by old ideas. Until now I didn’t realise how much I have learned is just rote and not particularly applied to anything but the career paths my course makes possible. I think the closest we’ve got so far was a module on the efficacy of morals and ethics when it comes to how we implement our knowledge, and this is more within a legal framework (or model), mainly derived from older models of thought that can’t keep up. It never really occurred to me that while I knew that that computing gives a greater insight into the model of the human mind (“You are a machine that thinks it’s you.”) *Especially the idea that it’s just parsing all the way up (turtles all the way down),       Just by common sense derived from what I’ve learned I didn’t really realise that I wasn’t applying it the same way to that question. Like even though I had the tools that allowed for this the lack of need to do it compared to my need to conform to general norms among people has left me open to defending that which I generally don’t believe or know with a high degree of accuracy to be false. Holding science in reverence, but deifying culture. Thank god there’s people who understand culture is just a vehicle towards civilization like this guy and that to sustain civilisation you need to move your rhetoric to inspire the ideas necessary for this sustenance. I need to pay more attention to my attention as he would say. So right now, we think we’re optimal for the presupposed conditions around us or that through convention finely tuned that we can remain on an optimal trajectory but can’t quite agree what finely tuned convention that is. If I were younger, I may have argued that this is a pessimistic conclusion to come to but after listening to this podcast I wouldn’t want to come to that pepper that conclusion with superlatives. It’s Just a problem of how we understand our spatial and temporal place we’re in. The part about the end of the world and trees was insightful. Heard similar ideas from Paul Stamets but it was never really elaborated to that level. I think what really sold me on this podcast beyond the fun challenge to comprehend everything he was positing was the line ““So we’re a kind of simulation, running in an AI that’s trying to understand itself”. It shows that we can humour the same old ideas of living under the blue eye of giant, and thus the rhetoric from the science behind our discoveries and technology is as good a model to fertilise the imagination as well as further ours and humanities knowledge. It also placates the romantic in me who still wanted to reserve a bookshelf for religion.  there’s a hell of a lot more I could review but to be cogent about it I’d probably need to refer to lex’s timecodes and listen while I write. Let’s just say that between two dumb apes playing the game of simulation of the mind that you’ve managed to show me some new ways to model how to think or how I think of the world by referring me to this Joscha Bach. He really is quite an elucidating and insightful fellow and has helped grow my interest in artificial intelligence, and through that our own intelligence.  I’m currently listening to it again and can see myself listening again. When I started I was working on a piece of art to kind of creatively/emotionally map what I was learning and that was in no small part thanks to you. Just finished it. If you want to have a nosey gander at my piece “Shifting Models.” Here: https://www.deviantart.com/danielrafferty/art/The-Siren-Shifting-Models-846685298?ga_submit_new=10%3A1593115343 If you can help clear up any misconsception in this already long in tooth ramble or just want to correspond with further insights for me to keep in mind or other great thinkers in the field I’d be most appreciative. This really has piqued my interest and I look forward to delving into more of these podcasts and having a look at that other link you sent.

@danielrafferty4108," Al Garnier  Thanks for your kind words. I don't know what to say to that. But this in part may be the root of the issue. That you Just don't hear words of encouragement from figures of authority in the college and university system anymore. It's as I said, learning by rote to tailor fit you for specific amount of job titles or career paths (given my modules so far I could probably count those career paths on one hand)  and to tailor my mind to a set amount of terms of agreement with reality. This conversation and the information you led me to has definitely expanded both those terms of agreement and the scope of the ones I have already learned. I mean, I don't know if I have enough iterations of thought left to be the breakthrough artist but it has definitely primed me with an optimism that goes beyond the work ethic of study (Which is all I've been doing in university and work) that hopefully leads to acquisition of real knowledge. There will still be a flux in my operating system. It may still work of the Jungian archetypes for the sake of writing or reading fiction (a part time hobby), but the real world as pointed out in the podcast stresses the need for more rationalism. However it would be interesting to inform this predisposition in art and writing by pitching the new models of thought against the old games of control. It's like we've tailored new models to conform with old when it should be the other way round (or when conforming is not an option we don't have the courage to discard the old models).  Prophets for Profit is probably the best way to show how what people can believe is really manipulated for the sake monetisation exemplifying how this works. Even though I think Jordan Petersen's social intentions aren't to just stymie the pundits, that he's really trying to improve peoples lives it's just I've never thought about that from the other side. That he's an educator who had a stance that lost him the promise of a perpetual iterative rate of income (so you got to make the dough for the bread somehow). Whether his intentions and the outcomes of intentions are ultimately good or not is up for debate, however the debate seems like more of a negative feedback loop in the long run rather than a positive one (even if in the short run in terms of the laws and our rights to express ourselves without worrying about governance of our expression it seems and probably is good) and actually seems quite boring.  In all honesty I came back to a lot videos from the old army of atheists and critical thinkers to try and gleam some insight into how we talked about the issues that have blown out of proportion in 2020 and how these ""Outspoken"" individuals and academics (in so far as you can claim an identity or a subset of identity markers) warned of such endemic social stagnation. I never got the answer I needed, just the one I wanted but I was unaware of this until I scrolled through this chain of comments. Thanks again!",5년 전,0,

@tux1968,"​ Al Garnier  You sure sound filled with hate.  You hate those who express their orientation to the world through religious language.  But if you listen to JP you might come to respect religious language as the first step to articulate things that have been previously unnoticed, stated, or understood.  Often expressed in vague metaphorical language since they are providing a sense for something that is new and not well understood.  That many things first expressed by religion have since been intellectualized and much better articulated is not a surprise, it's a natural process.   But that does not mean that we have understood everything about our nature and that we no longer need the religious process.

@rikkiw8231, @MaximumWayne  Why does it matter whether people view you from your culture? It could be negative or positive depending on stereotypes of the culture.

That is impossible to control since you can't change how people perceive and is being perceived unless group culture changes by individual changes.,5년 전,0,
@MaximumWayne," @rikkiw8231  ​ Perception by stereotype is one of the most fundamental - though practically speaking... prevalent - cognitive biases that people engage in ... we are all guilty of it regardless of our heritage... but just because it exists doesn't meant that we shouldn't be cognizant of the negative impacts/inefficiency it creates in society and be conscious in correcting it...  Being viewed by stereotypes and/or predominantly defined as an extension member of a racial/cultural group does detriment to each individual and goes against the principal of individualism...   Nobody wants to be relegated to a statistical avatar no matter how justified the numbers actually ...because people are not things... No Asians wants to be automatically assumed to be good at math but bad at sports, just as no black people wants to be thought of as good at sports but bad at mental tasks. Nor do white people want to be defaulted to the presumption of being a racist but privileged ...  If we were contend with these constraints, then people would be confined to boxes and specific behaviors / conducts only agreeable to steretoypical/shallow perception of their origins. (you are black, go back to sports, not science. You are asians... what do you know about Western culture? You are white... what do you know know about black history or other cultures)  This is the opposites of what freedom is... and progress is often made when people break these barriers and redefine social norms in a progressive manner where the individual is allowed to freely be and express him/herself unshackled by their demographical origins   Stereotypes also don't exist in vaccum, and both positive and negative sterotypes are in fact perpetuated by repeated occurences. But when you are dealing with an actual individual in front of you... Your assessment of the individual on a human basis should take precedence over default stereotypical presumptions.. regardless of how statistically justified they are ... yet too often, people aren't open to new interpretation of the actual individual standing in front of them, but resort to think of the human being in front of them as nothing but a stereotypical cookie-cutter...

It doesn't matter whether the story is in the Bible, Ancient Greek Myths, Star Wars, Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. The model of telling a story, that contains some sort of a lesson is the same. It doesn't even matter, if the lesson is banal from a subjective point of view. They all, including the Religion, evolve and adapt themselves as the humanity in general accumulates more and more knowledge. And most of them don't have to be rewritten, because you can just interpret them in a new way. They all contain human experiences, which are a universal thing. But our understanding and knowledge aren't universal since it is impossible to know everything. What matters, is that all of it is human. All of it. And what is human is subjective. Religion had its time and its place. It is irrelevant whether all the Religions combined done more good or bad throughout the human the history, because that isn't the point.",5년 전,0,
@carledroto3935," Al Garnier  Religion actually condemns the limitless greed. It is one of the sins. In that regard, your personal morals, as evident by your post, do have at least some parallels with the ""religious moral"" as you call it, for some reason. Moral is subjective regardless of the source it is coming from. And human being are not perfect. As it goes, nobody is innocent in this world. There is no such thing. But that is beyond the point. Science, which I am personally a big fan of isn't the objective reality. What we call science, is our best, subjective attempt to describe the objective reality as we percieve it here and now. And I'm not talking about obvious "" force of gravity here on earth and on the moon are different, because of the mass, so ""our"" gravity is not a universal perception of the force, blah-blah"". What I'm saying is, and any good, credible scientist will tell you, is that we don't even know, if our ""scientific perception"" is the objective reality. A good example of it would be the current state of the particle physics in general/the quantum physics. Quantum physics raises a set of interesting paradoxes, or what we, based on our science percieve as paradoxes. Its an important proccess, indeed, the science itself. To simplify it all and make a point: We don't know at all, where the objective reality ends. or begins for that matter. And not figuratively, because as we go further and further we discover more and more things. Important things. People thought once, you know, that an atom is basicly THE smallest particle. We now know, that there are also, what we call, the subatomic particles. And way more interestingly, regarding even atoms, is that, we can't even predict the behavior of the atoms using our ""ole good scientific knowledge"". Because they don't behave according to that. This is why we have the quantum mechanics now. And so on. Sorry, I got a bit distracted here. Point is: Science is not the objective truth you want it to be atm, because science is an important endless process and not quite a limited, static set of FINAL rules you want it to be. Not quite yet, but there lies the beauty, it will never be. There is too much we simply don't know. Yes, you point is correct, science does blow all the religion away, makes it insignificant, debunks it. I'm now so far away from the initial argument and I stepped into the philosophy, physics, etc I'm not even sure anymore, if I made the point I wanted. Sorry. If you initial point is, that actual psychology aka the study of the human behavior doesn't reflect the reality completely just yet, but proves that there is no such thing as ""universal"" moral, because it is actually much more reliable and reflective of it, than any of the made stories throughout the human history.. then I'd agree with that.",5년 전,0,

The argument that ""if you don't like what we offer... don't come here"" is also not valid, US doesn't advertise ""human nature"" biases and Otherization of immigrants before they go there... They hope for the best, instead they often experience marginalization and biases that sidelines them...

Sorry, but someone needs to tell you to grow up and stop being an impetuous child... you should be solving much greater conundrums than calling someone who may have a genuine interest in where someone hails from on the planet, I always ask people where they are from, I have traveled a bit so I am always interested in where people were born, that way it opens up a plethora of conversational possibilities particularly if you can say you have been there and paid attention to life in a different part of the world by being able to discuss the good and bad points of the roundabout at the end of the yellow brick road!

@MaximumWayne," @alanw7060  you’ve completely misinterpreted what I said. And that’s a fault on your part. People like you are so ingrained in your cognitive bias that you attack without awareness...  No one asked where he was from... people already assumed that because he looks Asian, he must be “from” as in born and raised and identify with one of the Asian countries... even though he clearly speak without an accent.   And you know what? It’s been months since I made this comment, and I still get replies all the time... only triggered white people reply to me in mini essays. That says something...   You are saying this because you are tired of minority pointing fingers and saying “everything is racism”... again that’s NOT my point. My point is about cognitive unconscious bias....  For the longest time, Ethnicity/race and national identity are the same ALL OVER THE WORLD. So people identify you with your genetic race. The world is changing, and you have people of all colours and races migrating all over the world so the old paradigm of pegging someone’s cultural/national identity by their race/facial features is incorrect. Yet people do it all the time... this kind of outdated perception creates problem and ineffeicncy in society because in group members are often treated as outsiders. This also creates alienation and psychological dissonance in the people victimized by this kind of perception.  This is a kind of expericne completely unfathomable by white people... so you just don’t get it....  The day you or your white offsprings are born and raised and speak perfect Chinese and identify with being Chinese....but are treated as outsiders by their Chinese countrymen... is the day you’ll understand what I’m saying...  About jobs... You have no idea what I’ve been through.

@joyceclemons3916," @MaximumWayne  You are speaking of the social/culture element. The US isn't going to ""advertise"" anything but the liberty principles woven into the legal and political infrastructure, which have been coined into the Declaration of independence, and, by necessity, imperfectly actuate via both the federal and state constitutions. Nowhere in any of these public documents and the case law that has resulted, is the term ""a rose garden"" written, nor does any ordinary American claim that the nation is a ""rose garden"" for anyone. Even if it did, roses have thorns. Being geographically vast and highly diverse, there are gentle does and deadly scorpions and snakes, precipitous cliffs and cool grassy pastures with bubbling streams. Like the landscape, so the people. Gladly, all migration is based fundamentally on international law...you [should] have the right to quit your country, [the exceptions have been noted in history by the term ""defection"" [some countries with oppressive leftist or collectivist regimes would shoot you for trying to 'escape'] ...whereas the entry to a target for rehoming, is everywhere and always not a right but a privilege, because of the international norms of sovereignty. If there are [there has to be] other large nations that people consider when they apply for visas that permit work or study. Some of these countries have the same legal protections for foreign nationals that they have for native-born citizens. Some don't.  So, since the US does have these legal protections, and the law can't govern hearts, only hands, the rest involves more of less ""local"" adaptations of the extant populace and the foreign national lawfully present therein. America [US]  became America as we know it today by migration. That even includes the people we call indigenous, which has somewhat of an artbitrary definition in US culture, because one could argue that all children of a naturalized person are become indigenous. For example, for all intents and practical purposes, Americans no longer generally think of dandelions as ""invasive foreign species"". By some definitions, the dandelion is indeed an ""invasive foreign species."" No, we either kill them with glyphosate [bee killing shit too] because they pollute ""our"" blade grass lawns with beautiful yellow delicious edible flowers with medicinal value, or, we embrace them because all green everywhere is a crashing bore and the plant is actually a great blessing. For centuries, ""hillbillies"" , whom leftists in the US have targetted for scorn because they are considered ""white trash"", have lived harmoniously with dandelions, while the leftists blast them, and the bees, and butterflies, with chemical poisons.   ""If people knew what the States are really like...?"" It's said that billions of people would seek emigration to the US and it's fairly obvious that if everyone suceeded, with or without naive notions about human nature EVERYWHERE (to which they themselves have a natural dance ticket), their destination would by necessity change dramatically from the imagery, (however accurate or naive it was when first held in the mind.) The only NATURAL way to protect habitats is by the natural defensive behaviors of the regional or local species ( using the flora and fauna metaphor here again.) I know of no naturalist who proposes to defang scorpions to protect blundering humans from stings. Rather, they would protect the habitat and seek to punish humans who degrade that habitat.  Having said all that, the vast majority of Americans tend to not only favor orderly and lawful immigration, without any regard to race, age, gender, creed, or even political ideology, provided that the newcomer can accept that the legal framework of America is not based on collectivism or tribalism, but on the enbrace of the concept that THE SMALLEST MINORITY IS THE MINORITY OF ONE. Individualism is the US's  legal framework's ironclad underpinning, and the strongest individuals shall survive, due to natural adaptation to the ""soil"" and climate. Thereby becoming indigenous.

@byromtaylor6482, @robinsss  I dont know where he said that or in what context he actually meant so cant say for certain lots of people tend to mis-quote him or have it in for him it seems. They usually start by saying thing like ....he said this and meant this...when actually he did not.  ....So I agree with you on one hand its good to question ....there is nothing really finite really and there are always opposite views or perhaps 3 sides to any opinions to consider - there is a right a wrong and a (well maybe) ....However; that said I think questioning everything certainly may deprive us of a certain level of trust (faith)..we put faith in things from childhood its just human nature and this innocence learns from experience and is sometimes twisted or hurt by a experience ....a baby taking his or her first steps does not question why he should walk.... it just does it eventually and learns better through guidance and trust of a parent or from the experience of falling and taking those bumps along the way as is life so perhaps he was looking at this from this kind of viewpoint when making the statement.   Maybe you are right to question every concept but thats a lot to take on...so good luck with that -  I am not saying Peterson is right about everything but he certainly is about a lot of things and I personally greatly respect the man and I dont belong to any group....I am a Marxist (Groucho not Karl) so these are my principles and if you dont like them....well I have more.,4년 전,0,

I think we still have slavery actually...they just re-branded the concept and widened it out to include everyone - then they cut the chains free introduced these things called 'taxes' and 'bills' and 'interest  rates' and 'laws' then somehow made us all come back on Monday morning for minimun wage.  Many of us working hard 70pc of the time to pay for the house we get to live in 30pc of the time....as for your other point its paitently obvious a rich man certainly has more of a voice and access and influence in any government over the ordinary joe - so yes their is certainly an element of corruption avialable to suit thei interests and agenda if they are like this to begin with - (I dont believe the super rich are all like this) but some surely could be for they have accesss and you and I dont - One thing is true and I believe this with my heart. A rich man or a homeless man and you and I have the same thing the common we come into this world with nothing and we all go out the same way.

I’d say no, not enough of them. This success is directly dependent on universities (and even secondary schools) to hire and support the traits and concepts taught by teachers on the right, like Dr Peterson. And that requires the same humility of faculties above them. Do we have to wait for these generations to move through time? Wait for right leaning Gen X and the even more right leaning Gen Z? Most likely. I do not see anything inherently humble about being a push-the-envelope, holier-than-thou leftist today... but let’s hope I’m wrong, underestimating their abilities.",6년 전,0,

@fozzy1004," @jeshuaong5667  Agreed, most people think in a low resolution capacity and just take the easy option of labelling people in boxes like shooting Dr Peterson down rather than actually listening to him and putting forward a rational and well laid out counter argument or position.  Dr Peterson was bang on when he said he said most people think in a low resolution way as most people don't have an open minded approach to uncomfortable topics and are not willing to have an open mind or do the research necessary to think in a high resolution way before forming a conclusion.  I have met people with PHD's who actually thought Dr Peterson was a white supremacist-shocking levels of ignorance.     What makes Dr Peterson so special is he has gone through a 30 year journey of  successful study, research and clinical practice to get to where he is today and to formulate and construct his ideas, he has many published papers and two best selling books to his name, just calling him bad man and projecting insults and character attacks at him is not going to harm Dr Peterson, in fact it does the opposite.",5년 전,5,

His best selling books are popular books, not natural scientific or social scientific books. He says many things and it would be silly to just call him a ""bad man"" but being a ""white supremicist"" means different things to different people.

@fozzy1004," @johannesbakker4330  They had Phd's in science subjects and one in Archaeology from major red brick UK universities along with a handful of teachers and they thought JP was a racist, sexist and white supremacist and was against trans people also, this came out at a gathering with close friends and family, people I know very well when I mentioned I was going to watch JP live in London.   You can disagree with JP all you want, even disagree with his 30 years experience in his field, which is your right-I really don't care.  But to call someone like JP a white supremacist or a racist just shows how ignorant and corrupted people can be in there own bubbles and clicks.   Science is not a democracy as most people thought the earth was flat at one point, but to just spout out and push around unfounded and completely baseless character attacks is just boring and ridiculous to anyone who thinks for themselves or has followed even cliff notes of what JP talks about.     Character attacks often say far more about the person saying them than who they are actually attacking, and in my personal experience people who really push the racist narrative everywhere and identity politics are not very nice people or accepting to anyone who thinks even remotely differently to them and there doctrine.

[Let's analyze what is really going on here in the brain of the average JP fan.

I perceived the world today, did I accomplish the impossible? This guy is such self-absorbed junk every other sentence it just seems incomprehensible why he has a platform anywhere.] ‘Embodied cognition, perception isn't possible without situating the mind in a body that has a certain set of constraints.’ [JP is telling us that your brain must be housed in and connected to your body, and your body has constraints like not being able to fly?

@jerrygreene1493,"And in more depth:  Jordan Peterson, Full Address Oxford Union: “People can transcend suffering by pursuing things of value, people who have no purpose in life are resentful.  If you are going to pursue something of value and you are a social creature you will pursue that in a social space, you will produce a hierarchy of competence in relationship to that pursuit.  You and other people vary in your ability to manage that pursuit effectively.  If it is a valuable pursuit, there will be a hierarchy of people who are very good, of competence, a few people will be fantastic at that pursuit, and most of the people will stack up at the bottom, that is a manifestation of the Price’s Law, the Preedo distribution, the Matthew principle…if you are going to have value and you are going to have hierarchy you are going to have inequality.  You have to produce something of value, people can use power to attain status. If your hierarchy becomes too steep, too tiny a fraction at the top, it is unjust and unfair, that is not a good way to produce a sustainable society.”   Let’s look past the smoke and mirrors self-important delivery of JP to what he actually says here:    1.  You want value in your life – yeah, but what is your point?  2.   If you are trying to achieve things you work along with and in competition with other people – yeah, but what is your point?  3.  Some people are better at some things than other people – wait, isn’t Oxford University supposed to be a haven for smart people?  And they are inviting a guy to tell them that some people are better at some things than some other people?  What is wrong with this picture?  4.  JP has to cite three sources to validate his remarkable conclusion that competence is not equally distributed to everyone?  Help me Jesus.  5.  JP points out that if your hierarchy is too steep, e.g. the 500x income gap we have in the US, it is not good for a sustainable society.

""The post-modern ideology of the toxic Left characterizes the sociological landscape as an idiom of responsibility for protracting the hierarchy inequality and genocidal ideology of western civilization"".

Humans have not evolved biologically substantially in the last 20,000 or so years, but you are projecting some radical evolution in the next 100?

@adrianclarke6829," @jerrygreene1493  Firstly thanks for your polite reply and what sounds like genuine interest in the answers. If only everyone approached disagreement the same way; the world (and the internet especially) would be a better place.  Anyway, you raise a lot of interesting questions which I'll do my best to respond to (though it may have to be in installments as my steak is about to go in the pan!). 1) Your first point around who is saying that. Well, a lot of people who believe that hierarchy in the western world is a social construct (just like gender) rather than an evolutionary biological mechanism and necessity. This is based on the left's tendency to describe everything in terms of a power dynamic i.e. oppressed and oppressor. In this case the left states that hierarchy is not a natural state but a result of elites forcing a structure into society that then privileges them and supports their elevated status (or something like that). JPs response is that hierarchy serves many purposes in the animal kingdom and is very evident (even in Lobsters). That is not to say hierarchies don't get abused by the human animal (JP is open that they do tend towards tyranny and can cause problems for those at the bottom levels) but that is a different problem to ""man makes hierarchies to be self-serving"" which can be the claim. 2)  I think this relates to the first point that hierarchies and the related structures serve a purpose across the animal kingdom so inevitably you will encounter them wherever you look as they have utility and serve a purpose for the given species. In relation to man I think there may be a wider point here that some modern social activists on the left may even acknowledge hierarchy to be an evolutionary necessity (most don't)  but believe that we can and have evolved beyond these mechanisms that are millions of years old in a few generations. The fact we can understand and articulate what these mechanisms are is wonderful but it doesn't mean they no longer exist, they are embedded in our genetic and social coding.  3) I read that as JP highlighting that the far-left believe that the current social/cultural landscape of the west (e.g. capitalism) is responsible for sustaining  inequality and unfairness and basically all that is wrong in the world (e.g. wars etc.).   Jerry - I'll pick this up over the weekend as my good lady is telling me that dinner is ready - let me know what you think and if this is helpful at all.",6년 전,0,
@adrianclarke6829,"OK, Picking up after a good nights sleep - the steak was fabulous btw! :-) 4) I'm sure of the context as I couldn't find the quote but I don't for one second think that JP is saying we will evolve beyond recognition in the next 100 years. I think he is more likely making a more pessimistic point that the survival of our species is by no means a certainty given the current set of existential threats that exist (most of which are self-created). It could be that the ""too few"" element of his reply is predicated on this pessimistic view i.e. if we have a plague, thermo-nuclear war or the planet cooks us there will only be the pockets of survivors remaining. Not jolly but as JP often highlights existence is tough and over any significant period of time species survival is unlikely. 5) That one is straight-forward (I found that one) in that he is saying the right should pause before countering the left's fundamental move to identity politics as the foundation for their thinking and not fight fire with fire i.e. the right should not start to do the same thing and position things on the same group identity basis which just makes the problem more universal. JPs logic here is easy to understand i.e. how does it help create a Utopian world of one people one tribe one purpose if we are constantly separating out people and bundling them together in arbitrary groupings? All that does is make us more not less tribal which is obviously counter productive (and dangerous as he points out based on what history tells us) as that emphasizes difference rather than ignoring it.  That is the fundamental deceit in the whole identity politics game - that by focusing in and spotlighting on any group characteristic it will help the spotlight on that characteristic fade - illogical and divisive and only used to support the predictable oppressor/oppressed narrative that then supports the underpinning ideology.    Let me know if any of the above is useful or if I am making matters worse!",6년 전,0,

@milans2477,"Here's one thing I don't agree with: collectivism invariably leads to tribalism and chaotic violence. The LIMIT on collectivism that is imposed by ethnic, linguistic, racial, gender etc. boundaries is what leads to ""tribalism"". Collectivism can be extended to encompass the entire human race, even all of life on earth – something we need to cultivate if we want to change our economic tendency to destroy the planet).  Distance and isolation are the biggest factors today that lead to ""tribal"" mindsets. Those that have little to no contact with (or should I say, who have crudely/poorly mediated contact with or caricatured experiences with) Muslims, blacks, gays, natural ecosystems etc. tend to have the biggest problem with them. Another factor: righteousness about one's thumbnail sketch of reality and the assertion of its dominance over other cultures' sketches. When we do have continual contact and we breakdown the ""tribal"" barrier, we might come to argue over the best way to integrate and create a coherent vision of society that best serves everyone and their regimes of value. When we argue we are at risk of building up those barriers again if different cultures are unwilling to compromise on some of their values to resolve the conflict, if one asserts dominance (moral, scientific, philosophical, religious etc.) over the other.  So, we do need individualistic values, as he rightly proposes, but, we must not grasp at them whilst dropping collectivist values, for it is only collectivism that can ameliorate inequality, it is only collectivism that can make us transcend the boundaries of individual instrumentality to stand in solidarity with others in our society and around the world. And, in fact, individualism and complete collectivism are not at odds with each other, only individualism and partial collectivism. Once we all stand in solidarity with the entire human race (which is inescapably full of variation and very obvious (as well as subtle) differences) then we can come to appreciate each individual. The same goes in relation to other species. We simply must acknowledge that different ways of doing and thinking and seeing exist for our benefit, that compromise is the mother of cooperation, integration, and acceptance. We must come to understand that neither individualism nor collectivism, reason nor passion, creativity nor stability etc. are at fault, only various combinations of the two which we can address and adapt to our needs.   SECOND problem: The idea that hierarchies will automatically create inequality is too simplistic. For there exists hierarchies in competence, no doubt, but Peterson obviously takes strict individualism as an axiom here when he purports that this must lead to inequality (in the real world at least). He assumes that one only acquires that which is valuable to keep it for oneself. There is a choice to be made by every outstanding individual and group of them who manage to attain that which they find valuable, and that is whether to keep it all for themselves and use the power they get from keeping it to further advantage themselves over others or to share it with society. When the former is done, we reach our current state of affairs where wealthy elites are able to write 80% of the laws in the US to further benefit themselves and their ability to acquire more at the direct expense of those at the bottom. Peterson is a highly talented thinker and rhetorician, but I fear that he slides into the abstract-ual abyss sometimes, giving primacy to his logos and its two-dimensional congruence over the complex nature of its manifestation into the real, three-dimensional world, its splintering and interaction with other aspects of reality.    THIRDLY: hate speech. I find it difficult to believe that regulating just the most extreme forms of hate speech cannot be done effectively and won't better our society. I think that as a society, it is much easier to define the most extreme forms of hate speech than it is to resolve many of our issues that are more nuanced and that he says we will manage in the absence of hate speech regulation. There is always room for leniency in regulation based on reasonability and general consensus to weed out crude accusations resulting from someone being made uncomfortable. BUT, when we don't regulate it (and THIS is where he completely falls prey to the abstraction of his reasoning out of reality) we are at constant risk of the political mobilisation of hate speech (especially in big crowds, where people's better judgement is subjugated to the fervour of the group) to incite violence and hostile attitudes towards others based on a mere matter of race, religion, nationality etc. Peterson completely ignores the reality of powerful individuals using their public platforms to shape opinion and attitudes for their own personal gain, and therein lies the biggest fault in his argument against any kind of regulation on hate speech. But, of course, because he is articulate and his thought is nuanced, the crowd laps his words up (again, in the spirit of crowd mentality) without thinking through the downfalls of his abstract reasoning when faced with real world problems.   I respect him as an intellectual, I just take issue with some of his stances, and I hope we don't blindly accept all of his ideas just because the standards are currently so low in public media with regards to such reasoned debate. Go watch talks with Akala, Mehdi Hasan (something other than his head to head series though), and Yannis Varoufakis as preliminary checks just to see that there are others with this level of intellect espousing different ideas so that we don't treat him like a messiah. Because based on the crowd reactions, comment section and personal experiences, I'm starting to get the feeling that this is happening.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

That I believe is the equivalent of wisdom.  And the interesting thing is that your scope is largely dependent on knowledge...everything new you learn, whether academic, or just experiential, increases your scope that you can make your decision based on.  But no matter how large your knowledge base, you can still decide to have a small scope and make decisions based on what your best interest is now, and only taking yourself into account.

You can say to Camus for his philosophy of Absurdism  ""ya well where's your proof of that??? checkmate Frenchman science rules all no place for philosophy!"" Whether you like it or not, that's still a belief. Like Peterson or any other philosopher, his theories and views arent infallible.  Same can be said to Pascal, a mathematician who also had religious undertones and views in his philosophy. But I assume you're more knowledgable and full of wisdom and rAtIonAl than all those people that have actually contributed to human knowledge and philosophy and whose works are still used and regarded. I'm sure Kant, Hobbes, Locke and Dostoevsky can all pack up their shit and have their works disregarded because you know better. If you have to resort to insults and attacks like that, how can you expect anyone to ever take you seriously and not think you're just blindly hating on Peterson?  You act no differently than any 14 year old atheist edgelord who's just discovered the amazing atheist and sargon of akkad and the word rational and believes everyone who doesn't think exactly in the same way he does is just a dummy and deserves personal insults and attacks instead of actually having a discussion with.

And for some reason, insisting on deluding yourself that someone who is an atheist must secretly actually believe in God and ""fairytales"" because oh no he doesn't think and believe exactly the things I, a rational intellectual, does!!  Having a religious faith personal to yourself (yes, i do absolutely believe church and state should be separated)  can be mutually exclusive from how you interact with the rest of society and promoting equality. What, are people not allowed to practice their religion in their personal time according to you? What happened to freedom of religion? I don't see the issue in sharing religious values and theological philosophy as a way to personally live your life as an individual. (especially when someone directly asks you) Once you start then trying to apply that to society and government, then yes there is an issue and that should not be done.  But Peterson here wasn't doing that. He was offering a perspective or way of thinking that may or may not held and guide you navigating the world on an individual personal level. And if what you glean from such religious values manifests itself in your treatment of others in the form of ""do onto others as youd like others do onto you"" and generally showing respect and kindness to your neighbour (ie anyone you interact with on a day-today basis), then what exactly is the big problem ??  The way you continue to respond to this either makes you come across as if you are an arrogant, entitled bratty 14 year old 3dgelord that think he's """"rational"""" and therefore superior to others, or you're an actual man child with that same immature mentality.

So i feel both solutions are incomplete. Another thing is that he talks only about hate speech arising due to difference in stances and opinion. But what if due to this difference, the person using hate speech targets another who he/she doesn't know and there has been no discourse or disagreement. What if due to preconceived notions, someone starts their interaction with someone from another community on a note of hate speech.

@janderson2709," @ohwellwhateverr  'Morons don't get into Ox' ... Actually, I am afraid that they do. Since you only need exceptional grades to get in. I say 'only' meaning that there is no critical thinking test or minimum requirement for logical or rational thought---not that one could reasonably define that easily.  There is a difference between being truly intelligent and being able to score 3 As at A-Level, particularly when there are throw-away subjects like Travel and Tourism in which my dog could get an A. Or, on a similar point, subjects like Mathematics, where you can learn a method inside out, learn a few trigonometric identities inside out and get an A in that subject---and I say that as a mathematician myself that took A-Level maths. It was a memory test. The number of practice papers you did was essentially the single best predictor of how you would perform in that subject.  So enrolment into these institutions tells us nothing about the individual, rather it tells us that on a group-level, the intelligence of the populous will be high. Hence, there are many morons at these institutions---and they are particularly loud.",5년 전,0,
@kiwikiwi7375,"Jacob Anderson which university did you go to? Because you name mathematics as a somewhat easy subject option for oxbridge enrolment. Mathematics at Cambridge is arguably one of the hardest and most competitive courses in the world, especially if you are going for for one of the top colleges( trinity/ caius/kings etc). Additionally most oxbridge offers will be around the 1 A* 2 As or 2A* 1 A mark. These are pretty obtainable for any reasonably hard working, bridge student. However the hardest thing about getting into the universities is not the grades, it’s the application procedure prior to getting the offer at all, be it Step exams, interviews, personal statement etc. Getting the offer is the hardest part of the whole process, getting the grades is mostly a given. But yes I agree some uni degrees are much much easier naturally due to lesser competition and interest. However to get into sciences/econ/engineering/law/maths etc is an incredible achievement.",5년 전,1,

I said that the required A-Levels to get into these institutions are easily achievable for someone with a good memory for example, as opposed to someone that is genuinely very intelligent.   I’m talking about, let’s say, a history degree from Oxford/Cambridge. You could get 2 A*’s in travel and tourism (because it’s an easy A Level), then an A in mathematics (because said student has a good memory). Then the requirements for enrolment are met, without any genius level  intelligence at all. That’s my point, not that the degrees are easy, because clearly they aren’t.

Many respectfully disagree with him of specific concerns over a plethora of topics and that is frankly an excellent pursuit of expanded thought and truth in its many forms. Sam Harris, for example, agrees to disagree with Peterson on quite finite issues and yet are filled with mutual respect. The problem of saying ""shadow boxing"" is a vague judgement with no  source to support such an indictment. Whether agreeing or disagreeing with Dr Peterson, there is absolutely no doubt that he has been one of the most intellectually tested speakers on a world level. He also does grapple with several views of many subjects and is quite well read, especially of opposing views, before he presents a thesis. He does speak from considerable experience and research when presenting his point of view while heavily considering other views in any of his debates and lectures.",5년 전,6,

@Saoirse_don_Phalaistín,"Not really. Ideally a hierarchy should be navigates based on merit. You should be able to climb a hierarchy based on what you do within it that benefits society or either the operation of what it is you're working within. General comptenace and merit should drive where you are in said hierarchy. (and vice versa for falling down in the hierarchy based on incompetence or huge fuck ups)  I think what he was getting at is if yiu are in a position of power (ie in a hierarchy where you can exercise power while also have power enacted on you by people above you) and you grt to a better position in that hierarchy by exercise of your own power by either 'getting in bed' with people above you that you have contacts with BASED ON YOUR OWN POSITION WITHIN THE HIERARCHY ONLY, then it's a sign it's corrupt if that becomes a component in whether you move up or down the hierarchy.",5년 전,2,

The territory of greater power comes with greater resources, opportunities, and even softer benefits such as psychological effects such as implicit impressions, a different outlook of life and subsequent attitude and confidence, and more. Even without all the benefits that come with a higher position in any given hierarchy, the position itself probably lends credence to your words and actions, conferring a psychological benefit in any negotiation or command.

@blueorangeblossom,"For all the critics he may actually be a genius...I think some people who evade the term of genius are those with a high IQ with no charisma. Peterson elicits a kind of charisma that conflates many different kinds of themes. Yes he is educated, maybe his IQ doesn’t make him a genius but his persona does. It depends on how you define genius. An artist can be a genius without having a high IQ- and the root word is actually an idea of being possessed-by a force, a life force that makes one stand out in types of brilliance. I think I’m his own way he is a genius. Maybe he is a con, maybe out of his depth but to me plenty of genius are not exactly well rounded. I think it’s just an accusation and somewhat brought on by his own internal critic. Which he makes the point of using self deprecation and this constantly reminds us of his fallibility. And his personality is subdued, drugs have nothing to do with it. And going to Russia was bc he absolutely had to for a treatment that is not available in the US. To help him get off medication that was meant to help him while his wife fought cancer-his doctors increased the dose and it had a negative reaction. I was always surprised that he advocated antidepressants-for the very problems he is struggling with now, serious depression. Which he was obviously struggling and has struggled with...normal depression also is heavily weighted with not chemicals but the human condition. And his fundamental belief is life is suffering; which is not accurate. He has no joy, and part of it is that he believes God is a kind of metaphor. And without God, when your wife gets cancer-hope starts to fade. There are no atheists in foxholes they say, but that isn’t true. There are, they are confused and deceived.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@ezgi-el8yj,"​ @keithwilliams8342  ​ Keith Williams yes he did try to choose to find common ground, and it is ok. I can agree with some remarks JP does as well. But the problem with him is, he talks about subjects he doesn't know so much about-he is not a political scientist or sociologist or anthropologists - or understand.  Since he is an excellent speaker, most of his followers do not dare to question what he says; also, most of them never read the other philosophers. For instance, in discussion with Zizek, he used Communist Manifesto to criticise Marx, which is a Manifesto as in the title, it is not a philosophical book. In total it is maximum 30 page something.  If you want to discuss Marx, you need to talk about ` Capital `but I doubt he read it.",5년 전,1,

I listened to JP with very open-mind, and I made my assumptions based on his thinking and arguments which most of can be easily refuted if someone read a little bit sociology or philosophy. Marx is not a Soviet-era philosopher btw, that shows your knowledge about the subject. His ideas themselves led to Soviet Era.

@thatsterroristsbro7855,"Why is this psychologist blathering on about a social ethics. Isn't his field NOT ethics or analytical philosophy lol. Why is he appealing to his authority as a psychology professor to justify a sociopolitical theory. Science is not a moral or ethical theory. What there is, what is natural, what is true, what is logical, and what is just do not equate with 'the good'. This guy conflates them so often and casually that he is pretty much a cereal to me now. I......what is life. He advocates reducing us to our biology while at the same time rejecting tribalizing our thoughts and behaviors(reducing us).   Peterson argues that a thing is wrong because it is either a) not a perfect solution(does not eradicate harm), and b) it could result in circumstances that are worse than current circumstances. His solution is to rationalize everything and do nothing lol. How's that for consequentialism in a nutty cereal professor.   He insists women prefer people(Subjects) over things(Objects) and that is why there are more male engineers and fewer male nurses. However, if we follow through with this rationalization for why things are the way they are, we need to account for a things: firstly, his argument presupposes thoughts and behaviors are contingent with a fe/male essence, and he needs to justify his entitlement to think that there exists sexed essences. Secondly, if female persons prefer and are compelled to be interested(due to their sexed essence) in people more so than non-persons, how do we account for there being fewer women in politics, economics, and other disciplines/professions that center around people. He stated he had a problem with who decides what ""hate"" will constitute in the context of a hate crime, but who/what decides whether a person and labour is either centered on people or things. He decided that being care-oriented or people-centered meant that one either likes things or people, and this is determined by your sex. Later however, he rejected the opposition binary systems and dichotomies because of polarization, and emphasized the importance of nuance and consideration of the content of speech rather than the circumstances of the speaker.   And I only watched the Q&A portion at the end lol. It was like the death of reason. Thousands of times over, in a moment that spanned about 15 mins.

@johndempster2288,"What is you opinion on this issue please .  In the spirit of the Stockholm Declaration that states: “With humanity still scarred by …antisemitism and xenophobia the international community shares a solemn responsibility to fight those evils” the committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial called the IHRA Plenary in Budapest 2015 to adopt the following working definition of antisemitism.    On 26 May 2016, the Plenary in Bucharest decided to:    Adopt the following non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism:  “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”    To guide IHRA in its work, the following examples may serve as illustrations:   Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.   Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:  Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.   Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.   Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.   Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).   Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.   Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.   Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.   Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.   Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.   Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.   Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.   Antisemitic acts are criminal when they are so defined by law (for example, denial of the Holocaust or distribution of antisemitic materials in some countries).   Criminal acts are antisemitic when the targets of attacks, whether they are people or property – such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries – are selected because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews.   Antisemitic discrimination is the denial to Jews of opportunities or services available to others and is illegal in many countries.      Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial Share icon",6년 전,0,

It appears you missed the point about hierarchies being inevitable. Democracy cannot extinguish hierarchies because every single person in that democracy will be in pursuit of the things they value, and prioritize those things according to their own hierarchy, with the things they think are the most important at the top. So that's one hierarchy, a hierarchy of values. If a group of people either help each other to seek that thing, or even compete for the same thing, another type of hierarchy emerges, a hierarchy of competence.   In other words, if you think your family is more important than your job or vice versa, you have a hierarchy.

The typical scientific paper ends with the description and actual metrics of how the specific problems are solved. None of this follows. He tries to apply this model to left vs. right, which is kind' an ok step if he would have some problem to solve. Yet there is no actual problem is being solved.

@atwarwithdust,"Peterson follows Jean-François Lyotard in describing the postmodern condition as ‘the end of all grand meta-narratives’. Since, for Peterson, this loss necessarily results in nihilism, he accuses postmodern philosophers (Derrida specifically) and the universities in general of recycling defunct Marxist dogmas “to provide them with motive force in the world”. Yet doesn’t he commit exactly the same “intellectually untenable” mistake by praising British liberalism? Doesn’t this “forget about the complexity” of the postmodern problem and ignore an obvious contradiction? As the late great Richard Rorty wrote of Nietzsche:   “Nietzsche is notorious for his vacillations. He wavers between criticizing the very idea of objective truth and proclaiming that his own views are objectively true and everybody else's objectively false. On one page he tells us that ‘[w]e simply lack any organ for knowledge, for 'truth': we 'know' (or believe or imagine) just as much as may be useful in the interests of the human herd, the species’. But a few pages earlier he had said that ‘even we godless anti-metaphysicians still take our fire, too, from the flame lit by a faith that is thousands of years old, the faith of Plato that truth is divine’.”   https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5416   Despite claiming that no morality can be rationally vindicated, in ‘Thus Spake Zarathustra’, Nietzsche reverts to a philosophy of the sovereign individual just as naïve and simplistic as Ayn Rand’s Objectivism.

Give two human infants a task they must work on together to win some candy, and they will do so, then share the spoils. Chimps can’t accomplish this because they fight over the candy afterward. We needn’t resuscitate a Rousseauian ideal of ‘the noble savage’ to acknowledge that the better angels of human nature are often thwarted by competitive socialization.

Who today argues for sacrificing the sovereign individual to the group? Certainly not transgendered individuals, for example, who are merely asking for their civil rights, just as women, ethnic minorities, and gays before them. And conservative reactionaries, as with every previous emancipatory egalitarian movement, have framed their noble protest as a call for ‘special rights’ and as a threat to traditional hierarchies or even Western civilization itself.   Perhaps readers of Michel Foucault or Jacques Derrida may lack the nuance of the original authors, but by what leap in logic do we arrive from there to Stalinism and the Borg Collective? Like a high school student who sees a Nuremberg rally in every hometown football game, Peterson insistently exhibits a simple-minded phobia of any gathering of primates for a common cause.   Perhaps some ancient ethic of fair play, deeply embedded in our neurophysiology, is worth preserving and learning from, and perhaps there are cultural universals like language, music, and art which the social constructivists too readily dismiss and on which we can build better freer societies (as socialists have long maintained), but if various circles in literary criticism and the humanities submit this (Kantian-Marxist) optimism to criticism, why does this implicate all universities and why is this “appalling beyond forgiveness”?",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@NephilimFree,"Many of Jordan's arguments are in error because he bases them in something that is a myth - evolution, which has been disproved by modern science. By itself the discovery of DNA and the fact that it is information which is organized linguistically and operates algorithmically empirically demonstrates that life was not only designed but specially created. Information, most notably prescriptive information such as exists in the DNA, linguistics, and algorithms are non-physical, immaterial fundamental entities which are produced by intelligence. They are not comprised of nor are they a property of matter. They have no basis in the material world except that they are brought into existence here, and the material world has no potential to create them. Many have fallen for the secular philosophical narrative that life evolved and humans are a product of that process. They have bamboozleed much of the world, and our ignorance and laziness to investigate and compare the claims to actual science has allowed millions to come to believe something which is not only false but scientifically impossible. Evolution is a philosophy, but it is not science nor is it scientific. It is an endless false interpretation of data and materials according to a worldview. It does not qualify as science. In fact, any claim of evolution can be compared to the associated data, and this comparison will inevitably and invariably demonstrate that the claim is contrary to the data itself. One must apply endless assumptions which stem from a philosophy of evolution in order to ""see"" the evidence as supporting evolution. If one removes this presupposition, the data speaks for itself, and speaks of design and special creation.

After watching this I can confidently say that he is a pseudointellectual. He’s overrated. His interpretations of the world have no empirical backing, pretty ironic considering the stab he took at postmodernism, and a lot of it seems to be based on the pseudoscientific nonsense peddled in the 1920s - 1940s: freud, jung, psychoanalysis, scientific racism, social darwinism etc. His personal ideas too seem to fall in that time frame - he’s very conservative relative to 2019: the world needs to be hierarchical, we should not progress, liberalism is bad, our education is bad etc. He nicely wraps  all of this up in profound sounding bullshit made up of a word soup consisting of random terms from a philosophy dictionary. Worst of all he keeps on rambling on and on and on and on... like just get to the fucking point, fam. The amount of time it takes him to explain something that can be paraphrased in two lines is truly unbearable.   I must say I’m very disappointed with our education for not training our kids to be critical enough.. for not giving our students enough brain to see through this junk and to question him more thoroughly. I mean this is Oxford we’re talking about here!  I am also disappointed at a lot of the comments here…. Seems like a lot of educated peeps, “atheists” and “freethinkers” do need to be guided by religion… just like sheep.

We don’t always agree with what he has to say, but he really does have some well-thought-out ideas, and he seems to approach things from a standpoint that all ideas, and all people, have some merit to be considered. Your criticism of the man by saying his followers are MGTOW (a group of people he called pathetic weasels at least twice) is kind of telling. He’s not a saint, but calling a man who supports a universal basic income alt-right is just absolutely, blindingly ignorant of the facts. And if he hangs out with Kirk from TPUSA (someone who I like less and less the more I see of him) then he’s guilty by association, we’ll that’s also ignorant. I hang out with plenty of people I don’t agree with politically, and I do it because it broadens me as a person. It also results in some really great political conversation.   In short, the only person in this comment thread who comes across as either unreasonable or “butthurt” is you, and that’s a shame. Because we need more articulate disagreement so we can have more discussion. Your tactic, on the other hand, was to come into the comment thread and say something inflammatory, and characterize anyone who disagreed with you as a fanboy or MGTOW or an incel, thereby neutering their rebuttals, at least in your own mind. If you really disagree with everything the man preaches and really feel that it’s imperative to change minds, why not come in a little softer and start challenging the ideas, rather than the people behind them?

Even if 100% of the things the man said were completely useless, he would still be more intelligent than most people based simply on what he’s done with that useless garbage. Again, based on a premise I simply do not support.   And of course they got defensive! You started the whole conversation by mischaracterizing an entire fanbase. I’m subsequent posts you implied that anyone who is intelligent would not like JP and anyone who does is either an idiot, willfully ignorant, or an irritated virgin. If you had come in more softly, instead of immediately confrontational, it is likely there would still be people coming out of the woodwork to defend their deity, but I think you’d also have seen a lot more reasonable discussion about WHY Peterson might not be as worthy of universal praise as a subset of his fanbase believes.   Here’s all I’m saying: you have some good points that are being totally lost beneath the vitriol of both yourself and those against whom you’re railing.

The rioting started around the time Drumpf finished his speech. The lax security was Drumpf's fault. There was much tighter security during a protest months earlier. Drumpf is to blame for the mismanagement of the pandemic. He had to pay a fine for misappropriation of funds for his now disbanded charitable foundation, not to mention the fraud known as Trump University. His dog whistle politics and dumb comments about Charlottesville (there are good people on both sides). America Won when the results became certified.

The scary aspect isn't that it want to help others understand by teaching people what we are and how to fix it, but to find an advantage to the human condition to exploit it. As the institution of teaching has more value when the solution to the problem exists so that the allure of solving the problem has value vs actually giving people a means to understand what and who we are as a race.

Also, in my view, the fake liberals promote Islam, with its baggage of Islamic terrorism, to engage in cultural warfare against Western culture. I consider the terrorists wish to replace western culture with an Islamic caliphate. But in my chapter on Bangladesh I propose a solution.

I guess I'll try again another time when I'm not so tired.  No, just because you have some factoids and philosophy-ish sounding ""premises"" you are not able to prove that human life requires a value system (that you are about to lay out for us, and it will all be self-evident like standing up straight is). Proving life requires a value system is not even a proof, it's a definition that you have supposed. Organising life into value systems is great for academics (which Peterson pretends to be an outsider of, a bad boy radical) but it isn't really a requirement for life. Just like a book isn't actually a requirement for a religion. It may be a definition of a religion based on your perspective of your religion. But other people can do it differently and they also exist.  I can't wait for 10 or 20 years from now and his ridiculous pop-psychology is seen universally as the nonsense it is.

@critink,"Peterson claims: ”. . . as many great religious traditions have illustrated and proclaimed life is essentially suffering,"" which he regards as a consequence of humankind's innate limitations. He then says of the religious notion of existential suffering: ""I believe that to be a fundamental truth."" Peterson's reasoning leaves much to be desired. First, he offers no reasons for holding this belief. Indeed, compare his uncritical evaluation of these “great religious traditions” to his assessment of secular proclamations on society and human nature. Second, Peterson endorses the religious proclamations and description of a human essence. However, where are the data, which he often asks others to provide, supporting these traditions' proclamations and description? Is human life, in general, replete with suffering, or some lives? Do monarchs, Popes, political leaders, and corporate magnates through the ages lead lives of suffering? Of course not!! Third, Peterson's criticisms of injustice are extraordinarily selective. In his analyses of suffering in the Soviet Union, Maoist China, and North Korea, Peterson launches vitriolic, moral denunciations of its perpetrators. By contrast, he does not address the Gulags created by political leaders in Imperial Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, France and Britain in the Americas, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. The “great religious traditions” get a free pass. Peterson's ire is directed mainly at “Marxists,""  ""feminists,"" and egalitarians who, albeit often clumsily, express a passion for economic and political transformations. Fourth, Peterson's subsequent admission, in this presentation, that human beings are also impelled to value remedial changes betrays a significant inconsistency.  He does not recognise the fatalism implicit in his “fundamental truth.” In other words, given the ""fundamental truth"" of existential human suffering, surely endeavors toward its eradication are bound to fail. Jordan Peterson’s worldview promotes a religious conception of human nature that excuses the tsunami of violence, hunger, illiteracy, and physical maladies that plague human existence. It presents a cornerstone of the Abrahamic religions--an intrinsically impotent human species--to explain harmful consequences of actions taken by a minority of human beings. God and Jordan Peterson are on this minority’s side.",6년 전,0,

If he has been a tenured professor, lectured at Harvard, sold over 2 million books and been an author of academic papers that have attracted over 10,000 citations how can he be 'low intellectual' ? I mean there are all sorts of criticisms you might reasonably make of him but how can this one be taken seriously ? And you say he is a 'weak MALE!!!'. The weak part of me thought about saying 'men will decide who we consider weak and strong, what would you know about it?', but that would be a silly thing to say. Seriously though, since he's made intellectual statements that have seen him attacked in academia and in the mainstream press, controversial statements, and he has shown up to debate them, how can he be weak ?

@ddjay1363,"Good talk.  I am in my mid forties and over the last year or so I have met a few recent University grads (recent-ish) who are in their mid-20's to 30 years young. I am almost astounded at how indoctrinated by Neo-Marxism they are. They live and work in London, live good lives yet complain about 'capitalism' all the time. NONE of them seem to have read ANY history at all but regurgitate OTHER people's ideology endlessly. When I went to Uni nearly 20 years ago I studied a technical subject (audio engineering) and we had NONE of this Neo-Marxist and Post-Modern BULLSHIT rammed down our throats. We just studied and learned... and partied a little. ;-) As Dr Peterson has pointed out many times, we really must reform the way Universities are run, by whom and how. We have a generation of 'smart' young people who's brains are filled with ideology but couldn't tell you where or even when Freedom of Speech comes from (England, The Bill Of Rights 1689),  the significance of The Magna Carta and the historical impact of the English culture that created these things.... as well as Parliamentary Democracy, Integrated transport, computers, professional sports and an arts culture that is second to none. None of these 'young-uns' even have a clue as to why a character like Tommy Robinson is so popular or even that HE IS popular. They are unaware of the actual political feeling 'on the ground' , so-to-speak regarding the English working class and the horrible impact that mass-immigration has had upon them.  I think it's good for these students at the Oxford Union to be exposed to someone like Dr Peterson AND Tommy Robinson so that they can get the perspective of a Professor from a Canadian University of high esteem and a working class lad from Luton.  Well done Oxford Union.

And I've asked these people to name who they consider a serious intellectual, repeatedly Slavoj Zizek is mentioned. I don't even think Slavoj Zizek really thinks Slavoj Zizek is a deep thinker. I guess to fair a lot of this could be personality based, just different types of people.

@bennybenny55,"​ @samhQC  I actually quite like Jordan now, i didnt really get what he was about initially. But i do think he over simplifies things which is strange considering he considers himself to be in the political centre with slight right leanings. If he is talking hypothetically like saying a liberal culture could be like this and so would act like this then fine but i dont think it really says much. But if he is saying a entirely liberal society would be like this, i dont think thats possible. Humans are too complicated and chaotic to predict how exactly they would behave or evolve in those systems and to a certain extent it involves predicting what the system would be, which is obviously impossible as many societies add in bits that are not predictable. The 2nd amendment for example, how would you possibly predict that, no other democracy has it, and the effects of it on society was totally unforeseen.",6년 전,0,

@chrish2629,"Instantaneous labeling due to an individual’s “low resolution ideology that they’re trying to protect” in order to discredit another individual’s position is exactly what Jacques Ellul referred to in 1965 when he critiqued people’s inabilities to exercise their intelligence:  “People used to think that learning to read evidenced human progress; they still celebrate the decline of illiteracy as a great victory; they condemn countries with a large proportion of illiterates; they think that reading is a road to freedom. All this is debatable, for the important thing is not to be able to read, but to understand what one reads, to reflect on and judge what one reads. Outside of that, reading has no meaning (and even destroys certain automatic qualities of memory and observation). But to talk about critical faculties and discernment is to talk about something far above primary education and to consider a very small minority. The vast majority of people, perhaps go percent, know how to read, but do not exercise their intelligence beyond this. They attribute authority and eminent value to the printed word, or, conversely, reject it altogether. As these people do not possess enough knowledge to reflect and discern, they believe—or disbelieve—in toto[totalality] what they read. And as such people, moreover, will select the easiest, not the hardest, reading matter, they are precisely on the level at which the printed word can seize and convince them without opposition. They are perfectly adapted to propaganda.” -Jacques Ellul, Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes.",6년 전,0,

@morphd1329,"I very much appreciate Jordan Peterson but I do have one bone to pick with his reference to the ""Matthew Principle"" (start listening around 6:05). Presumably this comes from Matthew chapter 13 verse 12 where Jesus says ""Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.""  It's reasonable to assume Peterson - and the economists he refers to - consider this to mean material success. However if you go to the source, that's not at all what Jesus was referring to when after teaching the parable of the sower (seeds scattered in different places led to different outcomes) his disciples asked him why he spoke in parables https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13&version=NIV  10 The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”  11 He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. 12 Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 13 This is why I speak to them in parables:  “Though seeing, they do not see;     though hearing, they do not hear or understand. ___  Jesus was speaking about spiritual understanding, not material wealth. Context is important.   If you want further understanding of what the Bible says about excessive material wealth, I refer you to the commentaries for Isaiah 5:8  https://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/5-8.htm  That actually concurs with what Peterson says about hierarchies having a tendency to become corrupt and unfair.",6년 전,0,

A value requires a valuer. Only a living entity can be a valuer. So life is the fundamental value. The actions you perform either promote and or sustain your life, or the action threatens it. If you want to live, you must perform certain actions. But specifically philosophy is the science of man's relationship with existence.

@danopticon,"Peterson doesn’t seem to be too familiar with any social science more recent than Durkheim’s, though, and all of his psychology seems firmly stuck in turn-of-the-century — 19th century! — Vienna. If someone has never actually studied much science beyond remedial high school classes, or some very broad introductory college courses geared for humanities majors at z-tier universities, then maybe Peterson might sound science-y? to them? He does throw around a lot of Attic Greek … not from medicine, though, but from Aristotelian philosophy … and he even misuses that!  (Like in this talk Peterson uses telos several times … but Peterson doesn’t mean it the way Aristotle meant it. Aristotle meant it as the “final cause” — one of the several literal causes for which Aristotle posits the whole of the cosmos exists. But Peterson just means “self-actualization,” a very 1970s self-help term. And he could just say self-actualization! But no: this is just one of several times Peterson takes ordinary everyday anecdotal talk — the sorts of unverified claims and preconceptions that people carry around their whole lives and don’t bother questioning, because they’ve always kinda heard them somewhere or another, “Women should behave a certain way to become self-actualized as women! They must be caregivers and nurses!” — and then Peterson gussies it up with some fancy misused term, maybe in Attic Greek, and then regurgitates it back at his audience, and the believers among them think “Oh, I always sorta thought that was true, and he just said it in Greek, so it must be true, boy am I smart, I like this Peterson fellow!” That’s his whole act.)  And he doesn’t cite studies, at best he throws around raw data that he’s drawn very naïve conclusions from. Like when he throws telos at the young woman in the audience, he then says something like “Even after years of social engineering in the most Marxist countries in the world, the Scandinavian ones, there are more female nurses than male nurses!” What he doesn’t ask is: anything a real scientist would ask! Such as: “What are you aiming to prove and how would you prove it? For how long has the ‘social engineering’ taken place? If there isn’t perfect parity, has there been any change at all? Has there been more change in the Scandinavian countries than in the countries with no ‘social engineering?’ If there is greater change in Scandinavia than elsewhere, then how many generations of ‘engineering’ will it require for there to be parity? What would be effective vs. ineffective ‘engineering?’ Are other factors at play, such as wage considerations, time constraints? Could it be that social constraints are placed more rigidly on one gender than on the other? Has there been a greater move towards parity between genders in traditionally male occupations? Is the ratio of female police officers to male police officers in Scandinavian countries changing? Is it changing more quickly than the ratio of male nurses to female nurses? Again, is there more change in law enforcement occupations in Scandinavia than in countries with no ‘social engineering’ towards gender parity?” Etc. etc. etc. Nope, Peterson just yammers out anecdote after context-less anecdote, and then pathologizes everyone who disagrees with him.  Peterson doesn’t practice science, he practices rhetoric. He has a conclusion, it supports his audience’s preconceived bias, he finds one anecdote that he can twist into supporting his conclusion, and then he phrases his trivia, factoids, and warmed-over Viennese psychology in as Byzantine a manner as possible … preferably with some (misused) Aristotelian terms in Attic Greek borrowed and thrown in for added window dressing. He probably knows what he’s doing, is the cruelest part, and it’s effective towards his goal: not getting published in peer-reviewed journals, but instead selling mass paperbacks to a sad audience of outcasts who want to feel smart. In fact, that he’s so easily debunked and so outside the rigors of science actually contributes to his goal: when real scientists scoff at the nonsense he peddles to his audience, he can claim to be the victim of a “Marxist” academic conspiracy, and use that to … sell more mass paperbacks to the rubes!  But there’s about as much science to his jabber as there was to, oh, what was that book Oprah loved … The Gift? The Wish? … the one with the “science” of wishing things true. This is the same, only with incels wishing themselves girlfriends by thinking really really hard that women should be subordinate to men and that anyone who says otherwise is Stalin reincarnated.

@yorda5287,"I think the main problem is that Peterson tends to associate groups (Marxists, neo-Marxists, SJW, post-modernists, etc.) while, in fact, there isn't a real Marxist tradition in the US, and these groups can be very different, sometimes contradictory. I'm French and Marxist, and I can tell you I reject identity politics and the way SJWs operate. In fact I believe post-modernism is fundamentally anti-Marxist in nature, as it uses a smokescreen (""identity"") to avoid dealing with economic structures, the commodification of society, and the links between Capitalism and the rise of identity politics. If you truly want to dig the subject matter without the simplifications that even someone like Peterson give, go read Michel Clouscard : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Clouscard And for those for simply label Peterson as a white supremacist conservative, listen to his talks, and you will see that he is nothing of that extreme.  I listen to both Peterson and Marxist thinkers. But we will be able to have a constructive dialogue the day when ""conservatives"" will be able to not just take what they hear about Marxism in the US - which is pure propaganda and rarely understood, and consider the possibility to embrace some of these ideas, the same way they would want ""lefty liberals"" to be open-minded to their ideas and not as dogmatic as they (SJW) are.

My partner and fit the description of liberal, but have both been very successful at working within and maintaining such structures.

How often does this happen tho?  Then he circled back to doing what he says is unfairly being done to him.  I know for me as a nontheist, I now have my lack of belief protected under the law. That has made believers feel less threatened and see in real time, nontheists are not out to limit their right to believe in whatever deity, in their personal lives. It opens up the dialogue more.   It feels great to know our service men and women won't lose anything if they are LGBT and it is found out. It feels good we are finally trying to educate our youth about our true history towards First Nations. It feels good that I as a woman am getting closer to truly being equal.   Canada went through a major change with the legalization of same-sex marriage. All the fear of the unknown. Everyone focusing on the worst case scenario. None of the ""worst"" happened. If anything it made us stronger. It brought a lot of those that were living a lie come out. It made parents no longer seeing their children as freaks. Less youth are kicked out of their homes for being gay. The only worst came true for the few that are angry because they feel they lost a fight and someone has equality to them. We fought as a country to have same-sex laws. We also fought as a country to keep it in place. It legal terms hate speech is easily defined. As your average human being, it is pretty easily defined.

@leavesofdecember,"What an extraordinary man! I kept however thinking about his choice of expressing certain thoughts, that is very particularly aggressive, not in an intended way, but more like a somewhat tired parent would take a moment to disciplin their child. Now, given Peterson's intellect, I just assumed he has chosen this style consciously and purposefully, however, after having watched many of his videos, I now noticed a rather subtle detail, that made me wonder if he, by any chance, has a slight predisposition towards schizophrenia. This is not to discredit any of his work or arguments which were quite impeccable ! but rather as a worry, since he does seem to ""discipline"" his own immature emerging thoughts, rather than those of the audience. It seems to me that his mind is producing superficial implications which his superego then immediately corrects in a disciplinary fashion. Now this happens to any human with two neurons who happen to be educated, however it typically happens subconsciously, whereas Peterson gives me the impression that he's trying to correct an actual explicit voice in his mind. This hypothesis of mine would also explain the outcome of his philosophy, his almost excesive emphasis on structures and the underlying discipline required to orient oneself through them. Whatever the case may be, I could watch him debate himself for hours on end ! actually make that weeks and months ! He seems to foster enough depth and knowledge to keep him going forever, and that with ever so clearly articulated propositions.",6년 전,0,

With that said there are times when I need to break out the thesaurus to help me understand the meaning of some of what he means but I truly believe that's a great thing. I watched  sit down between Peterson, Shapiro and Rubin? They were speaking about how they had found fame and both Peterson and Shapiro pointed to their putting down of these lefty snowflakes as the beginning of it for them. Shapiro slapped that lefty fool on Gun Controls, his name escapes me ATM.. The point I was trying to make is what Shapiro said, he said that people saw his interview on CNN? and they came to his speeches thinking he was that way all the time only to find that he was far deeper than that and they stayed for hours to listen. It just shows that people are starving for real discussion across our world but we have a set or group of people? yes let's all call them people..haha! These so called ""people"" who pull the strings of humanity are not interested in the concept of real and verifiable free speech. They are only interested in wielding power and the best way to do that is tribalism and political correctness. These ideas have fundamentally shifted our thinking and have in turn caused us to think before we speak. There's nothing wrong with thinking before u speak until it's used as a way to stifle debate/discussion.. I love his thinking on tribalism and the way he speaks on successful societies, and also his views on sacrificing the sovereign rights of individuals for the right of the state..  I could speak all day and I'm sure I don't understand everything he speaks on but that's down to me to educate myself better. This man makes me want to be better as a human being. I'm pretty sure he has that effect on many millions who watch his lectures, etc.  Thank you for this brilliant video",6년 전,37,

@christopherbrookfield4785,"I love Jordan Peterson, and everything he, so eloquently, articulates. Sometimes I am concerned with the idea that he may be almost too clever, like a fairytale, possibly too good, almost completely faultless/seemless in his thinking/arguments to be true/for real. What exactly are his motivations? Obviously, he makes a great deal of money from what he does, and good for him, I suppose. No doubt he earns every penny of it, and certainly seems to feel that he is more than worth it. From a biblical point of view, is it possible, or feasible, he is in, fact, the anti-christ, hungry for power and dominance, masquerading as a charming man of peace? I certainly hope not. He does seem preoccupied with the theme/subject of power, 'tho. Also, if it is the case that all hierarchies are intrinsically unequal, and tilt towards, tyranny/corruption/violence, how come no-one ever seems to discuss a reasonable, functional alternative to them. Has this ever really been adequately attempted, an alternate substitute? No hierarchy equals no meaning, is his message. Across nature, all organisms. All cultures. Throughout our entire history. And long, long, long before us. Perhaps I am too much of an idealist. A utopian. A day-dreamer. Is that heaven? I would like to ask him if he believes in a heaven, a biblical one, or any other form of one. I know that he said that he behaves as though exists, which he points out is a very precise answer to the question: do you believe in God? Well, what do you mean by believe, he says, and what, exactly, do you mean by God? I feel the same way that he does about that question. I mean, I find that a very very difficult question to answer, simply. Put simply, yes. But it is I'd more complicated that a simple yes or no. I do not see faith as an insurance policy, just in case it it true, I will say I believe. I really do believe. But in what, exactly, is a bit more complicated to define. Sometimes I feel like this is fudging it. Anyway, food for thought. I always find him interesting to listen to. He is not God, 'tho.

@PITA-kd2jn," @christopherbrookfield4785  With all due respect, you're actually a cynic. I'm not a huge Peterson fan (I too am trying to pick apart some of his ideas), but he has articulated his motivations in a number of interviews; he wants to help people do better. Personally, I have no reason to believe he's being untruthful about that, and certainly not because he's making good money for what he does. I mean, I try to help people too, and I wouldn't mind making good money doing it. Seems like a win/win situation. I'm really interested in knowing why you think he feels he's ""more than worth"" his income. I can see where some would get the impression that he's pompous and egotistical, but that's totally subjective. For instance, I get the impression that he's passionate and egalitarian, but again, that's my subjective opinion. I can't speak to the religious stuff, but you really got me thinking about what a high functioning, non-hierarchical society might look like. Also, how could it stay that way, without reverting back to a hierarchy. Interesting stuff..",6년 전,0,
@christopherbrookfield4785," @PITA-kd2jn  Thank you for your courteous reply. I, personally, would be in favour of a non-hierarchical, high functioning society, more than anything, but Peterson has this thing about people organising their structures in to a pyramid type set up, whereby the strongest, fittest, most useful and dynamic individuals, naturally, inevitably, rise to the top of this, and almost all of the useless, unmotivated, lazy and stupid, uneducated ones remain at the moment, where Peterson seems to think they all belong. I am not sure if he is all he seems to be. I like him, and listening to him, but he consistently runs circles around people, less dynamic, less forceful, less articulate, and substantially less educated, and informed, than himself. Does this make him right? Well, probably, about some things. Certainly not about everything, though. Sometimes, I think, he falls in to the trap, or habit, of doing exactly what he accuses his critics of doing. That is, over simplifying things, for the sake of his own argument. I hesitate to say that his is conceited, or arrogant. Confident, yes. Where does confidence end, and arrogance begin? It can be a fine line. Easy to cross. Also, I am not convinced by his displays of emotion, when he starts to cry, publically, while talking about all the people who tell him how much they have helped them, and how much it means to him. I have nothing against grown men shedding a tear, publically or privately, but I have seen so it several times, now, and it just seems ever so slightly contrived. You know what I mean? Someone, I forget who, called him a fake. When you examine, in depth, what he is saying, it is not really all that profound. Just, relatively obvious, common sense, which a lot of the world seems to of done away with! One could say the same thing about Sam Harris. Lastly, I find it disturbing how much he talks about power, Does he secretly want to take over the world, and destroy everything, for his own ends? He might very well be the anti-christ!

However as per Jordan, the opposite worldview of that is where people view  and interact with each other through the prism of their group identity. And this can be on the right or left.  Thirdly, and to tie it to political correctness itself;  Jordan believes those predominately on the left aisle of  identity group politics view hierarchies as form of power and tyranny; not competence.

@VelMa-opinion,"Peterson is wrong: conservatives want to uphold a received, inherited hierarchy whereas the anarchist proposition is that hierarchy can and will emerge naturally out of equal opportunity, where people are actually rewarded on merit rather than based on ""natural order"" or racist/classist propositions. Conservatives are good at implementing algorithms because they are incapable of thinking outside given, inherited propositions. The monarchist thinks that the only alternative to monarchy is chaos. The authoritarian thinks that the only alternative to a de facto police state is chaos.   Now, Jordan Peterson seems to think that hierarchy is needed to produce value. I'm not sure what he means by that? Hierarchy doesn't produce value, it produces entrenched privileges that you'll find cuntservatives like Peterson defending.   As a professor, he's eloquent, a speaker with strong routine. That's a given.

Not giving back something will introduce imbalances.  Tendencies or Inclinations could be looked at as individuals, the way limited liability is a separate legal entity, for example the inclination to preserve humanity has many organs such as countries, universities, people, farmlands, etc. And the greatest of all inclinations is the inclination to incline.  So the idea of God isn't necessarily forced upon others, where there's conflict, just refer to the inclination to incline.  Now you want to give thanks too to the inclinations as sources of your mutual solutions.  And copying is a very good way of doing this. But piracy is not giving back to the human sources of solutions, and ip law limits copying it inhibits giving thanks to ""spiritual"" sources of solutions.  The middle ground is to introduce this add on: The golden sticker, which is a sticker you could give to anyone who give thanks to you. And that sticker could be posted at their profile page.

His work is extremely self absorbed and he really is full of himself. Anyone can swallow a book of theories to support ones argument.

He presents his arguments as fact by wheeling out statistics that support his common viewpoint but if we pressed him on the source we would find more people like him that have carried out research to support their own arguments and viewpoints which is very easy to do in social sciences. They are not statistically proven by any means, for example his argument that men and women have very different temperament is true only a small part of the time and is not worthy of warranting such huge discussion as JP does on such small issues and topics. He has basically found a field that has lots of holes in it and is easy to create controversy because feminists create backlash and clickbait.

There are unique structural issues that will keep China from progressing to the heights that other countries could attain more easily. One of them is the tribal mentality of nationalism, nepotism, xenophobic policies. Another is mobilizing the huge labour force they have without creating too great an inequity gradient.   Sure it's better than before, with the aid of capitalism, but there are some things very wrong to the extent that they are worse when compared to other countries.

@carmelpule6954,"Around the year 1950 -70, I spent my time in UK, working alone in the utmost silence, unseen by the public,  at Chatham Dockyard Kent, on Gun Control Systems, Radars, Gyros, Secret Coding machines and also on the computers controlling homing torpedoes in O and S class submarines. When I felt the fall of the British Empire,  around 1960, I moved North Durham and to the University of Newcastle upon Tyne to read Engineering.  At university I spent many enjoyable Saturdays  debating  at Newcatle and  even visited Cambridge and Oxford where at Cambridge I even punted on the river with the  resident students thinking that I would fall over into the water, but little did they think that in Malta, handling boats is second nature to a person  like me who comes from a family of traditional boat builders. The recent debaters over the world, with their individual style, all awakened my interest, as they themselves are following a very curious social  behaviour.  I often listened to Christopher Hitchens,  Richard Dawkins , Deepak Chopra, Bertrand Russel, Ludwig Wittgenstein, now Jordan Peterson.  I feel that they are very intelligent, in  not only for their articulated and fluent delivery of  ideas and  speeches, but for their  tacit, subtle, manner in which they ""sell themselves"" to the public , as that, in modern post industrial era , is the best way to make a  good living.  Let let explain.  As  human input ports to gain knowledge, we have eyes, ears, feelings and emotions. To output our thoughts and make a living  with, we have,  a pair of hands and feet, one  mouth,  a set of reproductive organs. If we look at the past and study the  methods how most people earned a living, we may summarise the situation as being:- * Use of hands and feet and associated muscles to make tools and shape all universal materials , to cultivate food and the comforts of our homes. * Use of the mouth was to eat and sustain ourselves, as its primary function. * Use of reproductive organs to bring forth children  in our family all done privately at home, through natural instincts.  A typical family man pre 1800 used his legs and feet to go to work, producing a tangible food product  or something he could sell to others, which needed to be guaranteed to work.  When he returned home, his mouth was used to eat his food and discuss the day with his loving wife and children. His reproductive organs were used discretely with his wife.   That  family style of living lasted thousands of years even as fast as 1900 even 1940.  Amongst the workers there were philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Christ, Muhammad, Simone de Beauvoir, Walter Benjamin, George Berkeley, Judith Butler, Albert Camus, Noam Chomsky, Hélène Cixous, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Rene Descartes, John Dewey  and many others, who talked their way through the society around them. It is interesting  to look at the fact that since 1950, the use of the hands to earn a living with, dwindled fast ,where the  shaping of tangible materials  and the production industries fell fast in Britain and in Europe, to be taken up by the East.  In UK and other developed countries, the  human  mouth  changed its primary eating role and became an important asset to earn a living with, through oration  and projecting opinions directly to the  public!  There was no need to produce any tangible products with guarantees to the public, but to use the mouth as a creator of emotions to  impress and intoxicate the public, and tickle their fancy, was taken up by a lot of men , in a related manner as  female including Madonna and other women who line up their lips with a conspicuous RED trajectory so that the mouth attracts attention at a distance, even when closed. Hitchens and Dawkins chose religion, Madonna used to sing,  Wittgenstein changed from mechanical engineering building tangible aircraft components  which he needed to guarantee, to being a great Philosopher projecting wonderful vociferous statements, without guarantees and  which we enjoy.  Peterson chose a more modern social anarchy  to  discuss with statements as "" In thinking and asking questions to find the truth, one  rides the risk of being offensive"".  That  wonderful statement elevated him to a high level. When it comes to earning a living using our reproductive organs one must be very subtle as being a hooker, a prostitute, a call girl or a pimp is not so socially attractive according to our laws, but a form of  euphemistic prostitution do occur, as  if one knows and is aware  that calling a brothel is not socially accepted and  not ""politically correct"", all one  needs to do is to build hotels with small rooms and cruise ships with small cabins where the  bed is the  most prominent piece of furniture, and no consierge at any  hotel or any captain of a cruise liner ever asks for marriage licence. And what is more, advertising  to the public, the comforts and location of a hotel and the wonderful cruise around the oceans is permitted by law. One tends to feel that the use of the  mouth in public  has become a form of selling oneself,  using a tacit form of euphemistic prostitution which is ""politically correct"" as it hides the  fact that a person using his mouth, is in fact euphemistically prostituting oneself.  If one looks at many professions it becomes clear that the hands, are never used to guarantee a tangible product for the comfort of society, the mouth  as in lawyers,  and humanitarian professions, including  respected religion which Hitchens and Dawkins is used for  his popularity has become the  most popular asset to earn a living with, where its primary role of a human mouth became a secondary role and its primary role became one related to using the reproductive organs with a contraception to avoid the birth of children and yet retain the pleasure associated  with  the intimacy between  two or more people!! I  made my point, not in a very tacit manner as that would have lost its debating effect of showing  and establishing what the truth is in this case.   I shall  conclude by quoting Jordan Peterson himself.   In me seeking the truth  as to the  real intention of the vociferous activities by Hitchens, Dawkins, Deepack, Wittgenstein, Peterson,  there is a possibility of risking   being offensive!""    Anyway, all one can say, is that we are lucky to have such intelligent and articulated people like Professor Jordan Peterson who knows  exactly how and when to use their mouth!. All students at the Oxford debating chamber take notice of the subtle, tacit use of "" political correctness"" in hiding what is in fact a compromise  in one's career in learning how to do what one likes, but  at the same time  to be a subtle prostitute and a tacit drug trafficer with  the software  projected through the mouth , ALL WITHOUT GUARANTEE . This is what the public loves and are prepared to pay a lot for emotions , verbal drug,  and wonderful permutations and combinations of words  rather than for their tangible home comforts which they want at the lowest price and longest guarantees. One hopes that what  hidden substance  is contained in  my comment would be taken up as a motion for debate at Oxford. It would be interesting to see how a  vociferous prostitute would present her own tacit operations in public! Well, that is what debating chambers hide under the euphemism of Political correctness.    Life is a game, and we all have to learn to play the game,  always knowing that around us there are those who UNDERSTAND THE GAME WE PLAY.

Perhaps the Oxford Union and Professor Peterson himself, would take a little walk through history to see what the vociferous people, as  those present in  this video  at the Oxford Debating chamber, contributed and implemented  through history, for the style and standard  of living, of the average modern family. Plato, Aristotle , Christ, Mohammed,  Politicians, Psychologists, and  many others like Peterson, never ever gave any tangible comforts to the family.  As Professor Peterson himself stated elsewhere, when  up to 1800 he described the condition of the average family as being very difficult with open sewers and a hard working life including slavery, where there was no soap and no running water  was available and London  and cities were infested with rats and horse manure  that many plagues came about, including  Tuberculosis and many other infectious diseases including venereal disease. Homes used incense to soften the awful odour in every home without indoor baths nor toilets.  All religious and vociferous people like Hitchens , Dawkins , Deepack,  Christ and Peterson only offered faith and hope for a better life  in the future and even after death. In the past,  all vociferous professions always existed in every country There were philosophers, poets, senators, culture, music,  traditions, religions,  law and I would even say that art was  offered as a   subconscious  cleaner, idealistic version of  the dirty awful world existing around those who lived in greatest misery, who could hang clean artistic portraits of the outside miserable world, in churches and homes .  It goes to say that all vociferous philosophers in every country including poets and artists,  as Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni  or just  Michelangelo, Christ and Muhammad, and other religions,  NEVER GAVE ANY TANGIBLE COMFORT TO SOCIETY.  Like professor Peterson, they gracefully all talked the tail off a donkey, and all they distributed to society , was pleasant vociferous  or written drug and emotions  to make people intoxicated and drunk with  music, faith and hope and a few rhythmic poetic lines  which people could read in the candle light, only  if they could afford it. A few idealistic  artistic statues were thrown in around the city by the authorities as Popes  to depict what was human perfection. All that artistic , philosophical, religious, political richness, while  the family life was  and remained in great misery even up to 1940.    So much was the "" love of those who did not like ""things"" but they liked ""people,"" yes, to exploit them in every  possible manner they could, all through emotional vociferous projections, as this video shows so clearly, the initiation of those  who clapped  who show such  great prospective vociferous potential to earn a living with  rather than  directly manufacturing things for the family comfort.  Now let us look at what those ""people who like things""  contributed in tangible form to the comfort of the average family.   I set 1650 as the date when ""things "" came to a higher complex combination where  no classical vociferous profession could ever understand it.  George Harrison , a silent woodworker  working all alone  produced the first wooden clock, accurate to one second  per month and with that came the Greenwich mean time and all the  safe navigation through  finding the longitude and the latitude.Sailors came back home, safe, to their wives and children.    After 100 years of young children  and new students as Ludwig Wittgenstein observing  complex "" mechanical things""  as George Harrison's clock, Scottish and English people near Newcastle upon Tyne  University which I attended,  Watt, Stephenson, Parsons and so many others  in Germany, they conceived  and idea and  changed the escapement wheel of a clock to a flywheel and the pendulum, to a connecting rod.  Steam  and fuel was harnessed to make the industrial revolution, where weaving  and other complex machines  resulted in producing  and guaranteeing all the attire that is  being worn by all the people shown in this Oxford debating chamber, including their shoes , socks, books, woods, building, musical instruments, hidden sewers and  ALL THE COMFORTS IN TOILETS, HOSPITALS AND WHAT THEY HAVE AT HOME INCLUDING THE TRANSPORT SYSTEM USED BY PETERSON TO TRAVEL FROM CANADA TO   OXFORD AND BACK FOR HIS NEXT VOCIFEROUS DEBATE. All that came and was synthesised for the TANGIBLE COMFORT OF PEOPLE.  I would wager my fortune and say that Professor Peterson cannot just say that an Engineer as Ludwig Wittgenstein  did not know that  he had more than ""things"" in his mind when Ludwig produced the the 75-page Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921) . I would say that the few statements as   1.The world is everything that is the case. 2. What is the case (a fact) is the existence of states of affairs. 3. A logical picture of facts is a thought. 4. A thought is a proposition with a sense. 5. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.) 6 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.  All the above, said by a German Engineer  is as rich as the statement made by Canadian Clinical Psychologist when he said, "" That in thinking and asking questions to find the truth, one risks the possibility of being offensive"" It goes to say that people who loves things do a lot to help society  with  having TANGIBLE COMFORTS  and wonderful philosophical statements in their homes  and not as those people who just ""like people"" and  exploit them with emotional drugs, which are also useful in whatever form they are projected from the speaker's mouth, including red lipstick additions of a woman, who claims equality to man.  If we consider the advancement of the human  mind to handle ""things"", by 1800, the world was advancing  in getting rid of plagues and dirt in cities. By 1900, with flying and  radio communications and in 1948 with the invention of the ""thing"" we call transistor ,  the digital age came to be, where hospitals, homes, EVERY OTHER VOCIFEROUS PROFESSION ,  carry their notes in portable computers, as Professor Peterson  carry to help him remember what to say and what to write and send it at the speed of light,  directly to be printed. There is such a lot in knowing things!  There is a great possibility that the people who like ""things"" may have a  consideration  and liking for people, much higher than those people  who laughed at  the Oxford debating chamber, can ever imagine.  The vociferous world can never appreciate the hidden majestic silent wonders of modern  engineering processes, as they prefer to  be conspicuous, living  close to public, projecting  the philosophies  through, the busy  mouth, generating  emotions, rather than the silent hidden beauty of reality and utility and comforts for the family. Professor Peterson certainly has an appreciation of a multi variable function, in a vociferous sense, but I wonder how far he can go to understanding the partial differentiation and integration  of  a multi-variable function, as that which brings about the inequality between men and women, which Cathy Newman, certainly  would never understand while clowning  to humiliate Professor Peterson in front of an engineered microphone  and a digital camera and shampoos for  her chosen  curly hairstyle, all  invented  and made possible by ""  those hidden and silent people who like things""",7년 전,1,

@carmelpule6954," @johannesakesson9982  That is true but while Jordan Peterson is brilliant at articulating in language symbols and images of reality, the behavior of the real truths outside his body, as he sees them, a mathematician and an engineer can summarise all that said in one large differential equation involving the combination of the internal states of a system being affected by another set of states contributed by other external systems which all boils down to the evolution which Peterson depicts in language form, which people thin that they can understand and are intoxicated by a man of words rather than a silent mathematician and an engineer who deals directly with reality and truth and not the symbolic version of the truth in language form, which is a drug effect but certainly not the truth...........but people love dealing with the inaccurate symbolic truth of a language especially if it is uttered as it has an entertainer factor as in most preached religions.    Truth and logic can take care of themselves but people need to use language to interpret the little logic of truth they think that they can understand.  Rather than understanding the concise symbols of a mathematical equation in the form of   A.d2F/d2t+ B.dF/dt+ C = other imputs from other functions  In language form, Jordan Peterson  at the Oxford Union uses language in the form,  ""The meaning is a case which seems to manifest itself when the system that is operating in explored territory and the system that is operating in the unexplored territory are operating optimally together to produce a solution and an understanding of the new state.

Rome was copying/improving on the Athenian model. And Athenian elites sent their brightest male children to study in Alexandria.

@sandhawke,"Two quotes from Wikipedia:  1. Alexandria was founded around a small, ancient Egyptian town c. 332 BC by Alexander the Great.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria  2. Athenian democracy developed around the fifth century BC in the Greek city-state (known as a polis) of Athens, comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica, and is often described as the first known democracy in the world. ... Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to a real democracy is debatable.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy  It also cites Pericles (c. 495-429 BCE) as ""longest-lasting democratic leader"", so that's 100+ years before Alexandria.  ===  In other words, democracy was developed in Athens long before Alexandria was founded.

@Poetic_Justice1962,"Dr. False Identity -- Despite all his ""intellectualism"" and ""objectivity"", Peterson still totally misses, or rather, and infinitely worse, fanatically denies the main cause of worldwide social and economic inequality, and all the conflict and suffering that this inequality causes, and that is patriarchy, which is the ancient irrational ideological construct that determines and limits all his thinking, writing and lecturing, thereby perpetuating all the problems he falsly claims to have the best answer or even best solution to, in other words, he's an educated idiot, an intellectual fraud, a fanatic cult leader, his cult being patriarchy, and his cult following never fails to prove my point. That Peterson has such a big following - to be identified as Alt-Rightist - only proves how badly society has failed and still fails women, because this academic demagogue is clearly a patriarchal regressive misogynist, and he can feel comfortable sharing his intellectual and ideological delusions, because the capitalist system within which we live, is intrinsically patriarchal and misogynist, and therefore gives false legitimacy to his demagoguery. It's the razzle dazzle of atavism, patriarchal, capitalist cultism, not the glaring truth of science that seemingly hold him up. To take him and his sort down, which is an inevitable necessity for the cause of human progress and evolution, society will have to change and progress radically, which is a prospect that he doesn't understand and at the same time fears and hates, for all before mentioned reasons. Deluded so-called intellectual Peterson is driven by delusions and emotions of superiority, contempt, irrational fear and hate, and in his public performances unwittingly betrays how strongly these delusions and emotions, these atavisms, live within the centuries old dominant societal construct of capitalism, which, because of its old age, is intrinsically patriarchal, and so intrinsically misogynist, and therefore regressive, and therefore before long will inevitably become obsolete, and logically, so will types like Peterson and their views, remaining merely as the stuff of farce and ridicule. He doesn't and won't ever rise above the level of a well-dressed, well-spoken Star Trek villain, but I'd watch him gladly and enjoy seeing him fail in more imaginitive settings than the austere lecture rooms and drab studios that in our confused, superficial times lend him a false aura of scientism, objectivism and academism: the unholy trinity of his sad and foolish demagoguery, the unholy ghost of his false identity, the home of his fake personality.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@anorderedhole2197,His insistence that world is governed by two forces of maintaining power structures and creating new ones with no particular content (for instance like making a power structure that provides universal healthcare when the current one does not) is paraphrasing Foucault. He's not rejecting post-modernism but following this trend where conservatives are now adapting post-modernism to their own agenda. The left took a hard turn after doing marxism. In the 70's they started to reject class struggle and just focus on 'struggle' and then apply it to all these personal categories that are endless.  Reading what polemicists claim support their thoughts rather than taking their word for it is much better. Jung and Nietzsche are much more polished than him and actually have a systematic dialectic to define something essential rather than just saying something is a fact because it's true. It's sobering that Peterson puts forth arguments that have premises and conclusions unlike a lot of talking heads. But when you dig in to them he says zany things. For instance his claim that we need to define what's normative about gender by using traits of extreme behavior. Also his examples that being an engineer or a nurse is a fringe thing was confusing rather than illustrative. It's not conspiracy theory hysteria but still bad reasoning.,7년 전(수정됨),0,

A huge part of the problem of ""offensive"" speech is the failure to hold the offended responsible for their free choice to amplify their own offendedness. We all have these choices, though they may not be immediately apparent. And when the drama-queen response becomes habitual, automatic, and unconscious, we can choose to change our mental and emotional habits. Anger management classes, AA, and cognitive therapy (Aaron Beck) are examples of consciously chosen programs of this sort. For many people, the stream of bad consequences of the drama-queen habit can cure it unconsciously over time.  -- But young people are encouraged and manipulated in very strong terms to be drama-queen snowflakes, and it's a difficult thing to turn all that bad social conditioning around.",6년 전,0,

@alphazulu5521," @tarnopol    Doug: first of all, good on you — for acquiring proper education. That is commendable.  Secondly, you must have noticed that your degrees and college majors, as handsome they are, do not qualify you as an arbiter in Jordan Peterson’s field. If you had a PhD in social psychology, you would still not be qualified to critique his work. If you had a post-doctoral degree in evolutionary psychology for instance, and you were well-credentialed, well-published, and well-regarded in your field, you would still be just a dilettante and an outsider, albeit entitled to their own opinion. Now, if you had an advanced degree in clinical psychology (Peterson’s field), that could qualify you as his peer and perhaps someone who can properly evaluate his work. I have personally viewed some of JP’s scientific works, and I’ve even sat in on some of his lectures at U of T (stunningly beautiful campus, by the way; reminds me of some of the better schools in the UK). In my limited knowledge of Peterson’s scientific works, I have yet to see an instance where he is basing his assertions on “pseudoscience”, as you so eloquently put it. His whole field, more than anything in psychology, demands proper scientific methodology. Those being (lengthy) clinical studies, (possibly) misc. statistical analyses, as well as complex pattern recognition techniques employed over multiple research facilities and time periods and/or specific cultural milieus, (an/or other frameworks). As far as his latest pop publication, 12 Rules for Life, AKA “the lobster book”,… ah, never mind, that’s a whole new discussion, and frankly, I’m pressed for time. People do those things for fun, for money, and most of all — to popularize their whole field of research. Richard Feynman used to do it, quite successfully too.

Data. (I hope that is self-explanatory enough, even for you. Just in case it isn’t, that would make his work the diametrically opposite of pseudoscience.)  1. Re: “... Your guru...” — Peterson is not my ‘guru’. Not even close.  2. Re: Whether or not I’m qualified — Qualified for what exactly?

Are elected officials the most competent in the areas assumed? The ""best"" always rise to the top of the pile? Not a fact. Many factors are involved, both conscious and unconscious, including various types of power lobbies (religious, commercial, intellectual, political, etc..)

Human beings are capable of altruistic behaviour, as are animals when they draw negative attention of foes towards themselves  and away from their young.  We generally call that ""instinct"" as opposed to ""conscious"" human behaviour, a point I don't entirely agree with. However, the large rat is in the example acting in self-interest. Peterson assumes all human beings are basally alike but socialists contend that isn't the fact and that a relative few power-oriented, unusually cruel and brutal people have determined the course of events for thousands of years that continues in the present ridiculously obscene disproportion in wealth and opportunity, which the lower economic classes produce with their sweat and blood.  Peterson sees himself as standing against ""the tribe""  on mandated pronouns for those who wish them: actually he is very much part of the tribal mentality that distrusts non-conformity and is hostile to change.

@garytyme9384,"@59:12 onwards J.B.P is talking shit!!!  For example:  Over the last 8 months I was supporting his elder brother with his B.Sc. dissertation – this was strictly on a consultancy and data analysis/interpretation basis. My brother was also recently asked to participate in a company project that essentially demanded the same methodologies, methods and procedures that were also used to compile the inferential data to support his exploratory hypothesis. More specifically, the dissertation and company project both needed a questionnaire to be constructed so that the project team could discover some of the unknown underlying issues that were driving the lack of compliance to HASAWA e.g. risk assessment and implementing any/all identified procedures on site. however, the questionnaire – and the utility – became a barrier that was compelled in to being by pride, indignation, social loafing and social influence i.e. 80 - 20 – interestingly my brother was 16.7% of a group (83.3%) that had fallen prey to group-think and confirmation bias. After many attempts at convincing the group with overwhelming scientific evidence and objective methodologies, the author(s brother had to, not only withdraw from the project, but also has now accepted another job – and this is after 18 years loyal service to the company.  Hence, even after overwhelming evidence humans will still chose to do what they think best, not what was actually best. So, J.B.P you talk shit sir!!! As a clinical psychologist (as he and I am) he should have known this...social psychology, look it up!

@wenaolong,"The fatal flaw in Dr. Peterson's worldview as exposed here on the resolution presented in that span of time and under those conditions is this:  What happens when one's optimism is in certain fundamental ways so in discord with a proper assessment of the world's corruption that one is simply at cross purposes with doing ANYTHING about it, including ""doing no harm"" or ""tapping lightly"", except that such maneuvers are implicitly in cognizance OF the sensitivity of the tyrant that lurks in the ""hierarchical"" structures of society (at whatever percentage of efficiency one may imagine, according to whatever standard, at whatever resolution), and one is in fact up against the ""hard case"" of such corruption, of such large scale and blatant racketeering of the sort which is IN ITSELF fundamentally demeaning to the value of life in its fundamental meaning THAT, when one looks even at a utilitarian analysis of the outcome, while most people will find that a sensible compromise is in order, they are in fact a mass of mentally and morally hobbled plebs, and the only thing to do is become one of them, ""pretend"" to do so, or stand out as an outlier who will be scapegoated by them because they are so damned WORMY of a ""tribe"" that it just isn't WORTH IT to survive as one of them?  THEN, in THOSE worlds (which I argue this one is a sadsack member world, maybe a sort of epitome), optimism becomes a crutch enabling some sort of coping at perhaps too great a cost, at least for those individuals who naturally resent that sort of vile ""tyranny of stone"" as if it were no better than the ""original condition"" of stone age chaos.  Hell, I'm probably in a subverted internet node in a covertly manipulated set of internet topologies in the NEVER HAS BEEN FREE ""world wide web""!  Peterson's approach is normatively GOOD, but not functionally relevant to GOOD people in worlds where GOODNESS is not the substance underlying stated norms, the substance being corruption and the norms being window dressing at their service. In those worlds, only contempt becomes palatable.   Sure, it may be that one can conceive a large number or worlds that are NOT this way, but it won't help out practically in worlds where IT IS this way.

So to speak in spite of such real dangers is a fundamental ""hard place"" in the human condition, and the ""rock"" must surely be the meaninglessness to the individual who capitulates to such an danger through expressions calculated first and foremost to be safe at the expense of meaning and personal evolution (combined as ""individuation"" in the Jungian sense, perhaps).  Diogenes answering Alexander must surely be a rare miracle in the long pantheon of the free and frank.  There is no escape from this problem, which Dr. Peterson correctly identifies.  An optimist after Rousseau's own heart.

My dad and I were driving home from lunch when I noted that one of his friends was outside speaking with the police. I suggested we stop and see what's going on. To which my dad did the exact opposite and took another route home. When I asked him why he did that. He said that his friend was an adult and could take care of his own situation but what would make it worse was if he knew we saw him in a compromising situation. It was a move to save face and dignity, which is important in our culture. Dad didn't ignore the situation but knew that interrupting would have caused more harm than good for his friend.

The worst I've experienced was in Albania where people in general had this every man for himself attitude and a general harshness to social interactions.

@DoctorCiaran,"I don't really buy into the idea that to be left you can't allow for hierarchies of competence, it's just that you believe those hierarchies should be sustained through non-material rewards so as not to create a class division - which Peterson agrees is destructive.  It's also pretty rare in modern society and history that you find a hierarchy that is truly competence or value based given how little, say, the financial world currently contributes to global progress and the general standard of politicians, or the mostly hereditary process by which hierarchies were (and in many cases still are through inheritance) maintained. He seems to be falling into the libertarian trap of drawing a very logical diagram on paper that just does not translate practically into the real world - although I accept the general concepts that he talks about, they obviously do feature in society just not so cleanly as he suggests here.  And as for the identity politics crusade I don't think they deserve the label of the left at all, for the most part they are privileged middle class kids with no knowledge or interest in class struggle or the history of left wing ideology. Their authoritarianism and hostility to free speech makes the term ""liberal"" totally useless in describing them, but more than ideologues they seem to basically be standard narcissists more concerned with their own immediate surroundings and their own image than the actual society around them. I see them more as a byproduct of the breakdown of political discourse, mainly in the US, than as an actual world view on either the left or the right.   Their lack of consistent values can be seen in the way in which they are used by the centre right social democratic establishment to desperately maintain relevance. A centre right social democratic candidate can be promoted by their movement if they happen to be a minority, whereas support for genuine left wing candidates (eg. Bernie Sanders) can be discredited on their identity (eg. ""Bernie Boys""). Of course when you find a left wing candidate who is a minority standing against an establishment candidate who is not, the issue of identity politics is of course quickly and quietly dropped.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@thehazarika,"40:13 That explains me.  I think I've found solution(that works for me) to the issue a person who is high in openness, low in conscientiousness and high in neuroticism has. The issue is that they question every structure that exists and they trace that path until they reach a point where they question meaning itself, which is just a step away from Nihilism itself.  So what can you do about it? You can't just suppress your questions you have and just accept whatever system there is that is to be implemented. That will lead to dissatisfaction and build resentment over time.  So what I do to solve it for me is this: whenever I see myself digging a question to a level of resolution of truth that is understood by and is evident to be true, I check to see if I am at a territory which is closer to a place where I can go to radical rejection of meaning withing few more steps. Then I trace my entire way back to where the question's been generated while checking all the assumption I made during the journey and then  I dig reverse to question the origin of the first question and dig deep to find all my presupposition and evaluate all of them.  After that I can find new path where I can dig deep to the original question that does not lead to Nihilism.  Let me know,  what you think about it?",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@trooppinen,"Peterson's assertion that hate speech should not be regulated is unconvincing. When asked whether hate speech is a bigger threat to free speech than regulating hate speech, Peterson cops out of the question and offers no support for his claim that regulating hate speech is always worse (51:46 and 56:10).   To summarise Peterson, 1. Free speech is valuable because it allows society to come up with solutions to difficult problems, is a facet of individual liberty, and can ensure communal/familial harmony.  2. Harmful hate speech is a very common problem and the world would be a better place without hate speech. The problem of hate speech is that it impedes free speech by making the targets of hate speech afraid to talk. (57:26, 58:18) 3. Regulating hate speech is dangerous because it will impede free speech.This is because if we define hate speech too broadly as speech that simply offends someone, people with dissenting views will be afraid to talk. (59:16) 4. The best solution is to let people utter hate speech freely. People are generally more wise than they are foolish, and they will ""by and large"" not be convinced or influenced by hate speech to act violently. (58:30)  So Peterson admits that hate speech can be a threat to free speech (#2). Yet he bases his opposition to regulating hate speech on the same harm, i.e. that regulation is a threat to free speech (#3). So if both hate speech and regulation are a threat to free speech, where is the justification for why regulation is always the bigger threat? This is exactly the conflict that the person asking questions was getting at, and instead of answering the question Peterson essentially restates its premises.   Regarding point #4, that people are more wise than foolish and will therefore not be convinced by hate speech... Well, you just have to look to Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa or modern-day Myanmar or Charlottesville to see that this is not always the case. Sure these massacres are rare, but I would argue that when they do happen their consequences are catastrophic compared to the small negative impact that limiting hate speech would have on the quality of societal discussion, individual liberty and (ironically enough) communal harmony (#1).",7년 전(수정됨),2,

@trooppinen,"According to a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, “.... it may  be  considered necessary in certain  democratic  societies to  sanction  or  even prevent  all  forms  of  expression  which  spread,  incite,  promote  or  justify  hatred  based  on intolerance ...,  ” (Erbakan v. Turkey judgment of 6 July 2006, § 56). https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Hate_speech_ENG.pdf   In general, the ECHR holds that some restrictions to free speech (protected by Article 10 in the European Human Rights Convention) are allowed in cases where the speech contradicts the values of the human rights convention itself. So your right to free speech is a human right, but if you speak in a way that obstructs the human rights of others, your right to free speech can be restricted.   Has this led to a massive restriction on political discussion or other important forms of free speech in Europe? I certainly don't think so. So in order for me to buy his claim that hate speech laws lead to disaster, Jordan Peterson would have to clearly tell me what that disaster is and why it is likely to happen.

@TheJamesRedwood,"The individual vs the collective, represents the conundrum facing the modern first-tattoo seeker. ""What symbolises me?"" Often becomes ""What tribal symbol do I want?"" which pales and blurs quicker than the ink. This necessitates the next tattoo, to update the tribal identity which also of course complicates and must decrease the potency of the chosen symbols already on their body. If the new symbol is also tribal, it will also rapidly or slowly lose significance to its owner, if they have any imagination and self-reflection. And so a driver towards ever-greater coverage is created. The normalcy of tattoo coverage is partially proof of Peterson's premise that intersectionality is a fatal flaw. If the modern first-tattoo seeker is aware of this fatal flaw, and works hard to determine a symbol of their true individual selves, this too will fade in significance - though probably slower than a tribal symbol, because of the individual paths we take.  I have specified the modern situation here to identify my exception - archaic tribal tattoos and their modern scion, authentic tribal tattoos. In other words, people whose tribal identity was a global identity as far as they were concerned, and their modern descendants, whose tribal identity forms a very large part of their individual identity because of its unbroken traditional lineage.  I have first-hand observational experience over my entire life of the resurgence of Tā-Moko over the last fifty years of Māori cultural development, as a fifth-generation pākeha New Zealander. Tā-Moko today represents what it always has: whakapapa, or tribal lineage itself. Its authentic form has grown into near-ubiquitous popularity today with Māori (though often not using traditional methods, which are usually only sought by those of high mana), in part as a reaction to the many and voluminous negative aspects of the colonial tribal invasion. If you wear Tā-Moko it identifies you as Māori, so therefore many things, but very importantly not a member of the invading tribe - or at least not identifying with the cultural extermination that was attempted, even if most Māori have pākeha ancestors these days. In my experience Tā-Moko is never regretted, the more traditional, the more treasured. Significant is the tribal support you get from wearing Tā-Moko, though I can only speculate here.

@highfunq2863,"Speaking only as an interested layman, I believe in evolution - a premise much of human psychology are founded, including some of what Dr. Peterson's conclusions, even if not made explicit at every juncture of discourse (e.g. his reference to Goodall's chimpanzee observation).  But from several books I've read (one being from John C. Lennox at Oxford and certain doubts raised by Francis Collins of HGP), Microevolution leading to variation within species has a substantial case for it and has been thoroughly developed: not much to dispute.   However, there still seems to be remaining unanswered questions, not only about the semiotic complexity of the genome (another huge rabbit hole in itself), but unavoidable gaps that must be filled to complete the macroevolutionary aspect of the overall theory: it seems to be especially lacking from the evidence of fossil records, surprisingly, which leads some to reasonably doubt or hold off judgement until further confirmation of this apparently unobservable and unverified transition from species to species is substantiated with stronger ""proofs"" or ""evidence"".  The general theory seems to be, from my perspective and little knowledge regarding the matter, overly reliant on postulations from comparisons between the physicality of existing creatures and correlations between their genetic make ups - and still has not yet answered the most cutting questions of biology such as the origins of life itself, though one can hold onto that faith. Obviously the theory is not on par with other scientific theories, in my mind, compared to say those in chemistry or physics, because under the traditional model of the scientific methodology - evolution lacks the key component of replicability (how can we reproduce evolution and manifest complex sentient biological life from subatomic particles in the lab is beyond my imagination). This sounds more akin to the methodologies engaged in history than the hard sciences.  Given this, since so much of our inferences and what are today commonly accepted paradigms (rampant in fields ranging from philosophy, psychology to the harder sciences especially) are so fundamentally based and entrenched in this basic premise that ""we MUST be directly descended from some other humanoid ape-like species"" it would seem appropriate to revisit this particular question (among many others) given the impasses in the Philosophy of Mind, Linguistics and other areas which seem to indicate something contrary to our existence simply being an miraculous emergent property of an accidental universe?  Perhaps evolution, both micro and macro, is most likely valid and perhaps one day will be absolutely undeniable to all, but on the off chance we're wrong...what if its NOT the case at all?   Hypothetically if in the future we find this premise to be false or unlikely: how much weight or credence should we give inferences made in the past and discoveries that are extrapolated from evidence gathered from other similar organisms alone. If it were not true, how do we even begin to restructure the foundations we've built the modern world on? We've built society and formed our minds to the point where our behaviour are shaped and formed as a direct result of this basic premise. If the foundations are faulty, then the building must crumble at some point.   So have we been building on faulty foundations (not necessarily just evolution specifically, but using that to illustrate a point) so much so that we're now at the crumbling point where we have to re-examine the foundations, the brute-facts of reality we have taken for granted or put out of mind? For example, we're largely indoctrinated into a secular anti-theist society in my generation. But if the tenants or model from which society is progressing and developed on, are possibly false premises or faulty yet-to-be-proven-beyond-reasonable-doubt theories - then how can we expect this tower of Babel built upon the pillars of subjectivist philosophy and the human might of modern industrial technologies to survive into the unforeseeable future?   Most if not all my friends and cohorts are naturalistically inclined philosophically and spiritually - which consciously or not, are aspects of our psyche that inform our values and thus our motivations and behaviour. But what if we're wrong? What if God is real? What if there is such things as objective good and evil? These things seem odd given our educational and social conditioning, but just entertaining the possibility that our premises are completely off-base, why have we not thought or made precautions in the event that opposing claims might be true?   It seems much of society has hedged their bets on a very narrow philosophy, riding on the coattails of a trend of thought reflective of the times and contemporary intellectual progression - but we do so without much thought about the possibility of us being in error about fundamental questions.   Anecdotally, people seem to be doubling down on their bets and inferred premises that anchor their entire world view, rather than - as is the philosophical and intellectual tradition - questioning not just others beliefs, but our very own too.  Should I believe in the validity of my worldview or belief-system prior to holding it to the fire and throwing every diametrically opposed concept at it?   Both naturalists and theists, the left, the right, or whatever -isms you are attached to, should be put through the same trial by fire I feel. If you really care about the truth beyond your own emotions and intellectual honesty to even just yourself. Undoubtedly some ideas will burn up in the fire of inconsistency or improbability given human experience. Some will emerge stronger and survive.   Why are we not taught this at high school or university? Why do I have to learn how to think from Youtube? Why have the very cognitive tools that are essential to autonomy and freedom been stripped from us, even in highly affluent first world countries? Are we intellectually regressing as a species, or being artificially regressed as a form of control by powers beyond our knowledge or understanding?

@Signal_20,"Saving Grace - You should read some of the studies of early child development to shed some light on the biological formations of hierarchies. Namely ""The Nurture Assumption"" by Judith Harris. It shows how children model and practice constructing hierarchies through play. They continually create societies with one another as a function of their biology.  JBP labels this drive, logos. As they grow up they use the constructed structures to make sense and build adult societies based on what they have learned. All this without being able to articulate how a functional society can be structured. It's inherent to our natural biological processes. Meaning or purpose is created as a function of the very same process of being social creatures. That bolsters his first answer to where meaning comes from.",7년 전,0,
@savinggrace8621,"Thanks, I do understand what he is saying, I just don't think it really answered the question.  I found it unsatisfying.  The questioner referenced God in her question which gave it a transcendent quality.  Example, you are on a boat in the middle of the ocean, with no fuel or sail, and there is a hole in the boat so its sinking slowly.  Not much you can do but you see the deck needs painting so you spend the rest of your time painting it before the boat sinks.  You have discovered (not created) some meaning / purpose in painting, but in the larger context it is utterly pointless and meaningless.  I think that gets to the heart of her question.  And this is why some well known atheists really struggles with it.  Peterson sometimes references Neitzche in the death of God and its terrible affects.  Or, Bertrand Russel who said he could not live like an atheist but lived as if God existed etc.  If death is the end so that your personal boat is sinking, and the universe ends in a heat death and so the overall contribution you make ultimately has no meaning, then you are left with a whole load of nothing.  The best you can do is bury your head in the sand, not think about it, and pretend that the little bubbles of meaning you are living in actually matter.  Listening to Peterson more generally, I think this is his conclusion as well and is one of the reasons he is a theist of sorts.  I fully understand that.",7년 전,1,
@Signal_20,"Saving Grace - I don't think staying nihilistic is the answer. To render it all meaningless doesn't serve truth or the metaphoric truth that JBP claims to exist. A very postmodern idea btw. Another idea is that meaning is not in the objects but the interactions with the environment and people based on our biological instincts. The ocean, boat and paint have no intrinsic meaning in and of themselves but the interaction of myself, the boat and ocean create the meaning of possible death. Because that meaning triggers a biological process of self preservation, I should take actions to avoid the harm. That would be a more rational choice, if we looked at the situation through semiotics. Painting the boat would seem to indicate there was a lack of meaning with the interaction between myself, the boat and ocean, relating to it possibly causing death. That or it could just be that I can swim to a shore nearby, the water is shallow and there's no danger of drowning, 'm OCD/schizo/delusional/suicidal or any other set of circumstances that don't affect my self preservation processes. That action of painting the boat also has meaning but may not be readily apparent at first glance. That's fine, descend into nihilism. But also get up and find a way to ascend into truth afterwards.   JBP is saying that meaning is developed with our interactions as evidenced by the child development example I cited earlier. Religions are things you act out, as he stated. The meaning derived from it are due to the interactions of it's components, like congregating in groups, performing rituals, formulating interpretations, etc... They all fill some biological process within us and is why every society in existence has had a religion. And as such JBP is not a theist as much as he is a religious apologist. No theist would talk about God the way that he does because of their intrinsic convictions about God. To be atheist doesn't mean you throw away meaning or morality. You just subscribe to a different set, as determined by you interactions with people in order to fulfill you own biological processes (dopamine/serotonin neurological pathways).",7년 전,1,
@savinggrace8621,"Signal 20, thanks for your thoughtful reply.  I am not sure it advances the issue though, and I don't think Nihilism is exclusively a post-modern issue, it also firmly sits in the modern era and the enlightenment, hence Neitzche and the death of God and Bertrand Russell etc.    The issue, for me, is the difference between subjective meaning, even when biology is involved, and cold, hard objective meaning.  The yacht analogy assumed there was no surviving the situation - just like life.  All the biological issues, the heirachal issues, the relationship between objects issues - are rendered ultimately meaningless in the light of no grand theme, e.g God.  If death is the end, and the universe will end in a heat death, then objectively there is no ultimate meaning to life.  It is all painting the deck of the yacht before it sinks.  I think that is inescapable.  Without God, Nihilism is the inescapable, ontological conclusion.  I am not a nihilist because I am a theist.  I was a nihilist prior to that, as having thought much about it, I believed that it was the only honest thing to be.    I realise that many atheists are not nihilists, but I believe that, as Jordan Peterson says, they live as if they were theists.  I think this is true with meaning and morality.  Intricate, biological and philisophical arguments to the contrary are, I think, coping mechanisms that shelter people from the truth.  Which does not negate the structure of 'subjective' meaning, it just renders it ultimatley pointless.  Of course, some like Dawkins has faced this and said that there is no meaning, no purpose, and that because it is an uncomfortable truth does not mean we shouldn't acknowledge it.  Not a Dawkins fan but I did appreciate his honesty here.",7년 전,0,
@Signal_20,"Saving Grace - A few things first off. I didn't imply nihilism was a postmodern idea. Metaphoric truth is because its based on axioms that rely on the subjectivity of the party within the environment rather than the absolute autonomy of the party. And my use of nihilistic was as a colloquial expression referring to the state of somebody who has thrown away their idealistic axioms. I wasn't referring to the actual philosophical ideology of nihilism. The colloquial phrase means a temporary fall into despair because all that you have known is no longer valid. This is how most people use the word, which is very loosely tied to the ideology. To remain in despair and not progress forward to a better understanding doesn't serve your own survival aka metaphoric truth. I probably should have stated it that way in the first place to avoid confusion. If the grand narrative that gives you your ethos or life meaning, has been taken away, to wallow in despair will achieve nothing but harm to yourself. You need to get up and build a new ethos or adopt another one.  Reductions to nihilistic tendencies are only temporary and are actually necessary for any kind of reform. I'm not gonna get into ideological nihilism because that has little to do with what we're talking about here.   Not a fan of Dawkins tbh. He's a theorist that makes a lot of value judgement errors. He conflates telonomy with intentionality all the time. That's to say his logic is valid but not sound in those arguments. And that can lead to some very serious ethical conundrums. One such argument is his ambiguous use of memes. Or rather his personification of genes in his book ""the selfish gene"". Genes do not have the capacity to enact their ""will"" but rather they are affected by coincidental interactions with the environment. It's a function of process structuralism that genes are able to copy themselves rather than any act of their own volition. He goes on to make some ethical statements based on reductive arguments/generalizations. Stripped of their context those arguments may not be sound. Like his example of a child's prayer before bed, reinforcing the behaviour into adulthood because the child doesn't comprehend the prayer and merely mimics the act. If the child was cognisant of what the act of praying means, he would stop because it's totally nonsensical. QED: So religion is bad. [paraphrasing] To which I say bollox. The mimicry of a child does not necessarily guarantee bias confirmation because reinforcing behaviour is a contextualized act. Every psychologist knows this. All that praying before bedtime does, is get us used to saying a prayer before bed. It doesn't mean you'll say a prayer at midday or while waiting at the bus stop. Dawkins has a bad habit of making specific claims from reductive generalizations like this. And you can't derive a specific claim from a general one and still be sound because you have lost the context. Anyways, enough about Dawkins.   It's good to see that you've pulled yourself out of the inherent nihilistic tendencies of losing faith and found something that works for you. Dillahunty and a lot of new atheists espouse aristotelian well being as the new life's purpose/meaning. If they wish to then good for them. But it doesn't work for everybody. As for me, my meaning is derived from the relationships I foster. I'm still holding onto JBP's theory for the origin of meaning because it has always worked for me. You do you, because we live by subjective truths not objective ones.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
@savinggrace8621,"Signal 20 - Thanks for the clarification.  Yeah, I haven't fully got to grips with what Peterson means by ""God.""  I love listening to him and can find a lot of common ground.  I am not a big fan of how he handles the Bible though, it reminds me of a Facebook meme I once saw of a man saying ""Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin?"" and Jesus saying ""No, I literally want you to follow me.""

@Signal_20,"Saving Grace - Being a theist, I'm sure you can see the difference between your position and JBP's. That's why I don't agree with a lot of other people when they say that he's Christian. Somebody who's intrinsically religious does not think or speak about the subject matter as JBP does. That's because they hold different presuppositions that don't allow them to. There is a reverence for the title of God and even to imply that we can know the limits or bounds of the almighty is heresy, depending on who you talk to. JBP's lack of reverence for the idea of God or the entity, indicates to me that he's not an intrinsic believer of said deity. Even Christian theologians are careful enough with their words that they at least maintain the facade of intrinsic belief.    But you can still act as if God exists and still be an ""atheist"" or in JBP's case, a religious apologist. He makes the case that belief is not a prerequisite. Because the ethos of western culture is so saturated with Judeo Christian ethics, if you were born in a western country, you would necessarily have adopted those ethics as your own presuppositions. JBP goes into great detail about this. Which is what draws the ire of many believers. How can you be a Christian but not subscribe to the doctrine? Well merely subscribing to the doctrine doesn't guarantee all the benefits of religiosity. In fact, extrinsic religiosity is negatively correlated with the recidivism. That's my experience and I tend to believe it was JBP's experience as well having been raised in a Christian household. He fell out of the faith but knew of it's importance to society.",7년 전,0,
@savinggrace8621,"Signal 20 - Yes, I agree with that.  But, I do think western society is currently experiencing a terrible demise because it did not appreciate how much of how it lives is based on its Christian heritage.  Confusion reigns.  It is not that you have to assume any kind of theism, but rather Christian theism to end up with the cultural benefits that we have enjoyed.  And in the end it will not be possible to live with the benefits, as if God exists, when generations grow up with the rejection of theism and the fading affects that theism has had.  There is a diminishing correlation that we are living with.",7년 전,0,
@Signal_20,"Saving Grace - There are breakdowns of societal structures in many areas without consideration as to the effects being produced. For instance, the breakdown of the nuclear family and all the structures that surround that idea. We're seeing a lot of discord as a result. The fact that we take these ideas as presuppositions, means we're not cognisant of them and therefore take them for granted. It's only when we break those structures down and run into trouble that we see why they were instituted in the first place. But by that time it's too late because many other things have shifted in society. Sad really because this is what JBP is railing against. When does the left go too far? When it starts destroying our society from the inside.   Don't worry about theism going away. It's stronger than ever. The largest religion by representation is still Christianity. Mostly because of mass conversions of ethnic Chinese. The problem is that growth is linked to birth and replacement rates. Muslims have more children and have them younger. Christians used to have larger families in agrarian societies but with advances in technology and social norms, we're not seeing the birthrates we've used to seeing. Atheism is the religion that's in trouble. It's incomplete, can't replace other religious systems and they have on average 1.6 kids. That is if they're not ""childfree"".",7년 전,0,
@savinggrace8621,"Yes I agree.  I think the danger is that society does not see the connection /  draw a line between cause and affect and therefore does not right what is wrong.  Example, the breakdown of the family is a contributor, in large part to my mind, of the gender identity issues.  Male role models, and normal relationships not being modelled etc.  But it becomes a liberation event instead of repairing what's broken.  The direction of travel is not encouraging.  I think a false sense of security can come from the idea that when things over reach / swing too far then there is a self correcting aspect to society.  History and the rest of the world does not validate it, I think.  We have lost a lot but still have a lot to lose.  We need people like Peterson.",7년 전,1,
@Sovtoshi_alt," @Signal_20  I am finding that Jordan Peterson tends to lean towards Christianity in his statements. He has said it's difficult not to as our western society is largely based on their values. He will say in many talks ""how does one define belief, your definition will be different than mine"" followed by ""I act as though God exists"" and further ""by their fruits you will know them"". He also states it's important to ask why the question is being asked. He is attempting to appeal to a broad audience and does not want to be put in a box. Nothing he says contradicts with my faith (Catholicism) and there are a few other Christian denominations that can say the same. If the Bible is read by a denomination that takes many of the old [not exclusively] biblical stories literally, there may be conflict but looking at the development of the Judean/Christian faith anthropologically or scientifically, taking the creation narrative literally for example would  be difficult to swallow. I hope he never fully divulges his views except from points that are irrefutable much like his careful articulations of his existing views.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@rationalthought9979," @Signal_20  I actually think JPB is a clear believer in god, and in Christianity to a certain extent.  On the Joe Rogan podcast with Ben Shapiro, they discuss religion and religious experiences at length, and it's clearly they both believe in something.    JPB doesn't want to come out and flatly say it, because he knows it will undermine his message with non-religious observers, particularly academics.  But his entire worldview appears to circle around the idea that there clearly is meaning in life, and that we perceive it, and that it comes from somewhere.  And that there are generally fairly universal truths out there.    You can argue that ""god"" (at minimum our sense of ethics, morality, and meaning) is purely created by evolution, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist, at least in that most basic state.  And if it's the ultimate expression of the life force that created all life, including us, than we have to acknowledge that it's connected to that life force, working through evolution, etc.    As far as atheism and nihilism goes -- it seems obvious to me that since we can't (as of yet) know the ultimate truth about god, the universe, and creation, it makes the most sense to think and believe in a way that gives our lives the most meaning and happiness.  For most people, that will mean believing in a loving, creative force in the universe that loves us and wants us to be happy.  This would appear the most rational and sensible approach to life given our inability to truly know the nature of existence and creation.  And it also jibes with most people's instinctual understanding -- that there's something else out there, even if don't necessarily understand it.    You can also choose to be a miserable nihilisist/atheist, but that wouldn't appear to make much sense.",6년 전,0,
@Signal_20," @rationalthought9979  - Clearly believing in something doesn't mean that you necessarily believe in one thing. In fact, we all believe in something, that's just part of our biology. Humans can't not believe because we need a way to conceptualize our environment. And the pinnacle of your value pyramid is your God, as JBP puts it. It could be the Abrahamic God or it could be a floating omnipotent pasta or something non mystic. But here you are making an assumption that JBP has put an Abrahamic God at the top of his value pyramid. That's not an assumption I'm ready to make because he hasn't displayed the necessary characteristics of having done that.    ""t since we can't (as of yet) know the ultimate truth about god, the universe, and creation, it makes the most sense to think and believe in a way that gives our lives the most meaning and happiness""    To which I would say true and be in full agreement, with a caveat. I would take happiness out because it has no place there. And I would also replace our with your. Our implies that we all must share the same beliefs. And by who's mandate are those beliefs determined? I happen to think we can have a society where individuals can determine their own beliefs to make sence of their own perception of the world.

My point in referring to his 'what's real' question is to claim that anything which cannot be proven or disproven may (and often is) be interpreted as a variable, even though it is probably a constant. So, what is 'real' can be objective or subjective 'real'. It seems to me that you stand for the need to look for the objective 'realily', and I fully back you up on that. But, only very tiny minority of people look for the objective real, cause a lot of it is not tangible, at least not yet. Thus, we often rely on our subjective 'reality', cause it is more tangible.

@theokirkley,"I don't know if I can respond to every point. But I will try to say a few things. When you experience something in your own reality, it is real. Your interpretation of what happened may be real or fake. Others may call your experience subjective but that isn't appropriate. It really happened and it is real.  For instance, a lot of people have experiences where they have seen ghosts or talk with spirits. Modern science would call that visual and auditory hallucination. They would diagnose such a person with schizophrenia. I would not. I would ask them about their experience with interest because I do believe what they saw or heard represents an actual interaction with a person who has passed on.  Calling a sighting of a spirit ""one's subjective reality"" is dismissive of the experience.  Jordan likes to talk about the myths we've created and what is real to the individual. I suggest people canvass the actual experiences of their lives and seek an answer to the question ""Is there a Creator and does He/She love us?"" earnestly, honestly, and sincerely even knowing you could be wrong. Too few people do that these days. Instead they gravitate to Jordan and ""rational""-minded people who dismiss spiritual phenomenon entirely.",7년 전,0,
@natashas.1566,"My way of looking at experiences have been so far that everything that we experience is solely our interpretation of things and events. The same type of experience is never the same one.  “No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.” [Heraclitus] Or, what I personaly experience as demanding or stressful, for example, can be a joy for someone else.   Or, once you can visit a new place and you may not like it, would it be for internal or external reasons. It may be only because you had a bad day. And you can say that the place is 'ugly', for example. So, that will be real for you. But, next time you visit it, you may end up liking it a lot. Your real changes. It is a variable. Therefore, I should not accept your real as my real, but I do not deny your experience by not accepting your reality.   So, it is a subjective reality, and it is an experience. Something being real (i.e. reality) is not the same as something happening (i.e. experience). I am not dismissing the experience, I just do not accept your reality of it it to be universally applicable as it is. It is an individualistic approach.

@redpill1178,"Yes God is easily proven, he has always been able to be proven. But you will not hear this fact from the churches, the secularists, the philosophers, the intellectuals, or the governments, because it doesn't serve any group's ability to control the people, or elevate the elite as something special (which they are not).  The whole point of the Bible is to turn people away from faith based delusions (including all man made gods, whether secular or religious) and towards objective reality, objective truth and objective universal morality. The enemy of objective truth, the source of all faith based delusions (whether secular or religious), is human nature. Human nature (sometimes called ""the flesh"" by the Bible) is just another way of saying animal bias, our natural biological desires and tendencies that cause us to prefer subjective delusions (emotion) over objective reality (logic and reason).  Thus the primary purpose of the Bible is to bear witness to the truth of human nature, and offer step-by-step instructions on how to compensate for the faults of human nature. Human nature hates objective truth, and would much rather cling to it's subjective emotional delusions. If it weren't so, there would be social unity in humanity. The fact that we have social discord is irrefutable logical proof that human nature hates truth. We even have a special term to describe when the human brain intentionally short-circuits itself in order to believe in a lie. It's called ""cognitive dissonance"". The contest between the lies we prefer to believe in, and objective reality, is the whole reason why we have a left/right sociopolitical spectrum.  It is a simple logical fact that due to the bias of human nature, it is impossible for a book to exist that was written by men, which records all of the faults of human nature with 100% accuracy. The only way such a book could exist is if it were written by an extra terrestrial intelligence not subject to human nature. A being that has no animal tendencies, a truly objective 3rd party observer.  But the catch is, just as with any scientific proof, you need to follow a logical methodology that will force us to avoid emotional conclusions, if we want to come to an objective conclusion. The Bible teaches that the path to compensating for corrupt human nature is embracing: 1) Individualism (personal responsibility, don't blindly trust or pass authority to church or government, read for yourself, learn to think for yourself, have a personal relationship with God. Relationships aren't built on blind faith, they are built on trust, which is substantiated with logic, reason and evidence) 2) Objectivism (""do not bear false witness"" only has meaning if your standard of truth is objective reality, just as it is with science) 3) Empathy (""do unto others as you would have done unto you"").   It is not an accident that those three characteristics are the prerequisites for appreciating the fact that the Bible is always 100% accurate about human nature. These characteristics are not intellectually demanding at all. But they are not popular because human nature hates each of them with a passion. And that is the whole problem. Just as people who refuse to employ the scientific method will never understand science, so likewise people who refuse to employ the methodology of objective morality will never appreciate the fact that the Bible is logical substantive objective proof of God, and hence contains the only social ideology on earth that is NOT faith based.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

His idea on the natural state of sovereignty is true, but only by historic standards. The problem with individual sovereignty in 2018, is that corporations own the world. Corporations are also legal individuals, who are sovereign and entitled to their liberties.

It hit me that the same is true with regard to food.  We can come up with an infinite number of dietary plans or ways of eating, but there truly are only a limited number of ones which will sustain human health generation after generation.  For instance, when human diets were researched almost 100 years ago, there was a wide variety, ranging from insects/nuts/fish on tropical islands to oil/fat/meat in the arctic, but all the diets still met certain narrow principles (A/D consumption from animal foods, fermenting grains/nuts/dairy, broth, salt, sea food, etc.).  No groups were vegan, for instance.  I suppose after hundreds of thousands of years, you sort of figure out what doesn't keep a population thriving long-term.    And (thinking aloud) we sort of threw it all out in the 20th century.  Progress at all costs, I guess.  Maybe there's wisdom in listening to the ""democracy of the past""?

@Signal_20," @rationalthought9979  - I think infinite is the wrong word to use. Countless would be a better term. For the sake of the thought experiment, we could use the example of throwing homosexuals off a rooftop. That differs from throwing them off a cliff and jettisening them into space. We can see 3 distinct societies, although the main idea of intolerance to homosexuality is shared. The question is how does that affect societal fitness. Will a society constructed in that way survive or necessarily thrive? And why? The structuralist may say no because our biological empathy would destabilize that kind of society. The post-structuralist may say yes because biological determinism isn't a thing and behaviours could be controlled in part by social conditioning. That society does not need to be totally stable to survive or even thrive.    Note in this way JBP is taking the poststructuralist position because he doesn't advocate for a grand unifying narrative but the interplay of 2 competing factions. That of chaos and order.

It is an absolutely fantastic means of eating and remaining healthy, at least through what I've experienced and seen in others that I know, that have been vegan even for far longer than me. But then again, everyone might have their own opinions on this and I respect this.  The only thing I can recommend is for everyone to listen deeply to their body and see what it wants - this will bring you to the optimal diet for your body. What the ultimate optimal diet for every body is, whether it is vegan or not, I cannot say, because I concede I do not know. However, through my personal experience, I would advocate mindful eating and deep body awareness above any other diet - it is this that has saved my life and brought me to the vegan diet.   However, if you do choose to continue eating meat and animal products, do think about the animals you are consuming and consider they too are living beings.

@peretzsucks,"Troy, Please predict the outcome of this scenario: young man in his early 20s arrives to a country with $24. He doesn't know the language. His mother and 5 siblings have been murdered. There are no social services to help him. He does have a father but the father is roughly in the same boat. Struggling? Yes. Does it predict the likelihood that he will become crushed by personal loss and anguish and poverty and cultural alienation? According to your theory, it might. But what if you were raised on the idea that hard work can pull you up and out of a situation?. That society won't help you and doesn't care and that proposition doesn't lead to despair and a sense of helplessness but the opposite: the nobility and axiomatic truth that a person can have sufficient drive and intellect to make something of himself. That is what my father was raised on, the person described above, who ended employing 60 people in a business he built from scratch. I never really saw him or knew him because he was always working and too consumed to do anything else. His example inspires me and pulls me through difficult situations. I believe that life is hard and that society should care enough to help you to some degree, and if society doesn't, then a person should have built around him/her enough of a personal caring community or family to help him.

@Turdsplosion,"Jordan Peterson has sound logic because he constantly forces the conversation into a tiny corner and removes all complexity and nuance. He talks about ""political correctness"" in a very specific way, in a very specific context, and does a good job sticking to his topic of expertise. The issue with this is that, as a result, his stance is actually very ineffectual in many other contexts where he must reframe the opposing argument to fit his narrative and perception. Which is actually very specific to his experience on campuses, and is quite far removed from the average persons experience. Just watch his Truthspeak debate alongside Stephen Fry. IMO, this is a great example of what I""m speaking about. The majority of the debate ends up coming across as nonsense because Peterson can't move away from his ultra-specific argument which has to do with campuses and Marxism, rather than reasonable discourse between adults.   He also becomes hyperbolic at times when he frames ideas he doesn't like or agree with as ""slippery slopes"" (a clear logical fallacy) into a dystopian Marxist nightmare. Unfortunately, many of us see this for what it is--- no different than the groups he criticizes and their attempts to frame the opposition as an ""evil force"" pushing the world into darkness.  Lastly, the ""figurehead"" worship Peterson receives makes many of us extra cautious. As with David Ike, Alex Jones, or anyone else who tackles very specific ""alternative"" subjects, figures that act as tent poles for ideology lose their objectivity once their career and their financial success become directly tied into their status as such a figure. Of course Peterson is consistent in his logic, and he holds a very clear and unwavering stance about certain things. But that's because at this point he MUST be unwavering in his ideology, his success counts on it. He isn't going to keep booking interviews paying him tens of thousands of dollars each if he starts to compromise and speak more a broader understanding, because that's not what people want from him.   Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the guy, and if he wasn't doing it, someone else would. But people need to take a step back and observe their own hero-worship of a man. He's just a guy, and if you watch enough of his content you WILL see flaws.",7년 전,7,
@peterm1240,"Everyone has flaws. What's your point.? Peterson talks a lot about many diverse things.  You don't have to agree with him about the situation on campuses to find his addresses compelling. Personally I couldn't care less about campus bullshit.  Lots of people find him interesting . The mistake you are making, and it is huge,  is  supposing  people who enjoy listening to Peterson agree with everything he says. ""You need both types...Liberals and conservatives.""   Liberals and conservatives both go ape-shit when they hear that truth. So yeah, go apeshit son.",7년 전,9,

The fact that you personally don't hero-worship Peterson doesn't really covey anything important or contrary to my previous post. I never claimed the ONLY people that like him idolize him. Though, looking at active MRA types online, many of them have adopted Peterson as a figurehead. And while it's great that you and many others can enjoy Peterson while remaining objective, you are forgetting about everyone else. A big percentage of his fan base stand behind Peterson as an intellectual authority while spewing nonintellectual garbage, like MRA shit as I mentioned above, Incel garbage, PC doomsday narrative etc. Actually, I'm going to say that the MAJORITY of people I've talked to who feel strongly enough about Peterson to say they are a ""Fan"" and not simply aware of him, do so as an extension of their political ideology as a means to shit on radical liberals.

@waterkingdavid," @Turdsplosion  Well said. I am wholeheartedly in agreement with you though I wouldn't be quite so kind. Also I don't find him very consistent. Here he plays the game of appearing to see liberals (what a vague term!) in a positive light as being needed in society. Of course he would play this game at at a talk given at Oxford where he was likely to be selling more books. The truth is he is usually scathing about anything vaguely left (whatever that means? Anyone who actually cares about others beyond themselves and their immediate family?!!) Regarding M. Powers original comment this is typical of a family first attitude. One can have such an attitude for sure  but why not extend this beyond one's immediate family to society at large?  In other words care for all instead of being purely focused on achieving one's own goals, often at the expense of others and the environment? I am highly skeptical of Adam Smith's unseen hand that is supposed to help everyone if everyone merely follows their own money making goals. How does this help the sick and the needy? How does it stop the endless extinction of species? How does it stop the depletion of the ocean's resources? How does it bring about more love? As for the hypocrisy of Peterson's criticism of the use of labels because of the way they reduce individuals while quite happily helping himself to such by referring to demonic ""postmodernists"" and ""Marxists,"" doesn't anyone else find that pretty contradictory??? Peterson is by his own admission on a ride. If others had more self knowledge they would see through his game.  I don't see him as someone deeply concerned with human issues at any real level. I think he's an opportunist par excellence. And a clever one at that, though not clever enough to fool people who really care about life on this little planet in the midst of an vast universe of infinite beauty. Peterson has never ever seen anything of this beauty so obsessed is he with what he perceives as his own brilliance and carving out his little niche in his middle class created haven where he is worshiped as a kind of god. There is more to life than middle class suburban bliss folks.  Pride cometh before fall. Open your eyes to the beauty that surrounds you each and every moment.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

I mean, the notion that the idea of the Marxist mind is in itself a contradiction of terms, that is presupposed to the very naïve idea of Marx's claim that the history of the world has always been that of the oppressors and the oppressed. It's like no, the hierarchical nature of our being is what it is to be a human. Like with Johanoff's study on the behaviour of amoebas has shown how the amoeba itself is and of itself an organic being, but the Marxist claim that everything is predicated by materialist needs totally brushes aside the spiritual nature of the amoeba as God itself, in a sense. But this goes to the whole question of values. As Nietzsche famously said “How lovely it is that there are words and sounds. Are not words and sounds rainbows and illusive bridges between things which are eternally apart?” I mean like, that's exactly like it is, the dicotomous nature of sound to word is the inherent problem of Marx's vision of world as value in and of itself, but without God. Did that answer your question?",7년 전,0,

@constantinderecas6662,"At a corporate training session I attended yesterday, the instructor berated some company poster he noticed plastered near our elevators because it contained the term ""rule of thumb""; a reference to an alleged law that made it illegal for a man to beat his wife with a stick that was thicker than his thumb.   Ironically JP uses this same term at the 13.17 mark when asked whether political correctness should be done away with.   At any rate, I retorted back to this same instructor that his criticism was an example of how political correctness can be used to berate others simply because they choose to use certain figure of speech terms. Should we condemn those who use the term ""kill two birds with one stone"" as apologists for animal cruelty? I told him to get over it as this clearly is simply a figure of speech, NOT covert misogyny.   Incidentally, the true etymological roots of the term have nothing to do with wife beating, according to wordorigins.com.

@TNM001,"hm, ok i only had a few minutes to think about this, but here is a question:  - he claims that individuality is paramount and leads to the most wealthy and prosperous societies, thus everyone should put his individuality first and not his group/tribe - he claims that hirarchies form naturally and have a purpose, and individuals are at first sorted by ""skill"" into the hirarchy (debateable of course, i would claim its blatantly wrong in the face of evidence).  so, if individuals put their well being in front of the well being of a group (=hirarchy), because thats what ""should"" be paramount as he claimes, than the position in the hirarchy is more important than the efficiency of the hirarchy for the individual as his personal outcome depends on it. on a second note, it can even be better to work against the efficiency of the hirarchy to further your position in it. if that is the case, corruption is the natural end of any hirarchy as ANY individual in it will fight for his/her position in it and not for the function of it.  thus, the conclusion would be that a quick turnover of hirarchies is necessary for a functioning society for them not to end in corruption, which is, by Petersons claim, not a strong suit of conservatives, but the left (they create quick turnover).  now, isn't what i observed above the definition of ""warfare"", just on an individual basis, the fight for positions in the hirarchy? its the same accusation he makes of ""tribal systems"", they also lead to warfare. also, how does that lead to ""prosperity and wealth"" as a natural consequence, as he claims?  what he describes is more of what we see in failed and corrupt states where the individual fights for his supremacy. wealth and prosperity arose in countries that freed themselves from that and put the functioning of society ABOVE the individual right, meaning  - the economy gets regulated, stops monopolies and powerful interests to subdue competition - civil rights stop the infringement on the rights of others, countering your interest to win over others - power gets restraint by moving it away from the individual into institutions that are regulated to serve society as a group/tribe (=police, military, firefighters).  i could go on but...its YT after all, and i said my piece. it is pretty clear that humans have to act on both, their individuality and their tribe, and find a BALANCE in it.  declairing that one is better than the other is not really an argument you can keep up, the obvious solution is: both, individuality on a small scale, tribe on a large scale.",7년 전(수정됨),2,

@Rellikan,I don't think he disagrees with saying both.  I've heard him talk about tribes before. Basically.  It's necessary for human development. Skipping it is detrimental to the pursuit of values.  You will have to eventually get out of the tribe for yourself and then reinvigorate or recalibrate the tribe's goals or values (because groups are made up of individuals; the better the individual the better the tribe.)  He takes issue with people who place the transcendent idea of the group first and never look at individuals.   Hierarchies are a little different. Becoming the best at something means you are at the top of the hierarchy. To obsess at your position in that hierarchy is always a positive good for that hierarchy. The hierarchy serves to facilitate people in relation to their skill.   I think you might have socio-economic status mixed up with hierarchy.,7년 전,0,
@Rellikan,"Government often produces monopolies in reality.  Government money lending often favours ""trusted"" companies and banks who have fallen into some kind of financial crisis.   Regulation pretty much harms emerging competition first so small businesses suffer the extra resources required to follow the regulations wheras big business already has the resources to comply.   When government creates economic policies the strongest influences are often the biggest companies because of a closer relationship with the politicians through large campaign donations.

@fredfarmer5952,"I love Peterson... even though he can be full of shyt sometimes... but he ups the level of thinking in the West today. He's one of the best clinicians I've seen .... but he unfortunately presents his Traditionalism as fact. (He also has a skewed idea of economics.) I notice in this lecture he's brilliantly shifted the emphasis of his discussion here. He's not discussing he ideas about repressing protests. On the contrary, he again talks out of both sides of his mouth by discussing how much we need liberals and the critiques they bring. Classic Peterson.   I WISH I had this guy as a teacher when I was in my 20s. But he's a bit of poison for those same people after the age of 45.  His idea that you must embody your culture ALL YOUR LIFE... is  not only a trap... but it sets you up to become a part of the wheel. As Joseph Campbell pointed out, we MUST go beyond culture. (... of course if you have your feet firmly in the cement of Right Wing Conservatism... going beyond culture means to kiss a rattlesnake... which shows you something about Peterson.)  His talk here is VERY different than many   I have no idea why people ever thought Peterson was a ""Post-Modernist.""  He's clearly a Traditional- Fundamentalist ... but he's also a psychologist ... and he is capable of a great deal of fairness.   BUT ... you do NOT have to be the most aggressive person out of a 100 to be in prison. BULLSHIT. Sadly, in many cases, all you have to be is black.   He also is full of it when he says there should be no more protests.  (NOTE: He didn't make the mistake of bringing that up in front of this audience...) He has said in the past that the protesters have no right because they are just as guilty as those they are protesting against.  WHATTT BULLSHIT !!!  So the people of the Congo should have never protested against old King Leopold II of Belgium because they cut off their hands after they'd offered him a glass of tea?  When he says this, he's engaging in, ""Comparing Mind""... which is totally wrong.  You don't get to fairness or what's right by saying you're as guilty as I am. No... if you're standing on my foot... then I damn well WILL not only tell you to get off  my foot... but if you refuse to, I will protest you doing it and eventually do every thing I can to push you off my foot.  Like a true Right Winger... he is horribly avers to being confronted for the wrongs of the past or present. WHY is there Hate Speech??? Because either: 1.)

In Finland we're one of the world's most educated people. We're HIGHLY individualistic and highly rational. And when hate speech started to ramp up massively in early 2000 , it resulted in a far-right ultranationalistic blatantly racist ""true finns"" party jumping from 0.7% support to 19% becoming second largest political party in Finland.  So that's the reality. In the world's most educated country, rampant hate speech resulted in catastrophic political shift in FAVOR of racism and hatred. So please stop with the retarded sunlight bullshit, please.  HOWEVER.  More and more I think about it, the more his latter half of the argument and the argument that gets used less is actually correct. That while hate speech does exist and it ABSOLUTELY breeds hate, actually limiting speech is such an egregious assault on the very essence of our existence that it'll do more harm than allowing even fifth of the nation to turn into racist bigots.  Now I'm not 100% sold on that yet, because I've not obviously seen where it would lead atm, but I'm being more and more pessimistic about people's ability to think rationally on things, therefore it's increasingly paramount that free expression and freedom of ideas are promoted, to train critical thinking.",7년 전,1,

Whenever Peterson waxes about Jung, it seems that he takes on Jung's pseudo-philosophical, New Age mystical woo woo and all that comes out is nonsensical word salad.  While it may be true that Jung's archetypes reflect things that once had survival value for humans, they're so broad as to be near meaningless or have been better articulated elsewhere.    Is Peterson trying to say that human beings can't decide on values from an evolutionary perspective?  That is, the drive to reproduce and pass on one's genes is intrinsic and cannot be ""chosen?""  As a population or species, that claim might be true.  As an individual?  We ignore that biological ""value"" every day as individuals, and some do so voluntarily and for life.  Since he never explains what he's actually talking about, who knows.  It's just a nonsensical assertion.  When he gets to freedom of speech... Jordan knocks it out of the park.  This is the one issue on which I continually find myself in agreement with him.  Yet, I'll note... he speaks clearly and decisively on the issue.  No need for word salad or references to philosophers and mystical notions (though there are ripe pickings for the subject).  On this subject (and when discussing the science inventorying the differences between women and men) , Peterson actually sounds like he knows what he's discussing.  I only wish that were the case with his other subjects.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@carmelpule6954,"Arthur Garwood Delahooke.  ""The  territory  of conceptual dispute..........""  hides many psychological characteristics in those who take part in it, especially those who  talk do it in public, rather than write their ideas in books.   IT EARNS THEM A GOOD LIVING, being so close to the public,    without ever producing anything tangible  that is guaranteed  and  disputes in public are a sort of euphemistic group prostitution and keeping people happy with emotions and a drug effect which could be intoxicating in many ways.    Please see how other people use it, including Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins and Deepak Chopra and others, including in the past with people like Plato, Aristotle, Christ , Muhammad and many other speakers.   Intimacy between people is a natural issue and it would appear that there is a form of intimacy when the mouth is used in conversation . The primary use of the mouth is to eat with and sustain ourselves, but through history there were always those who felt that the public needs a shoulder to rest their difficulties on and even more than that.  If you look deeply at the use of the mouth in relation to a form of intimacy between two or more people one would realise straight away that ""conceptual disputes"" is far far more than the contents of the subject being discussed.  I call it Euphemistic intimate prostitution or drug trafficking  which is allowed by the law.  Please think deeply about why public speakers do  what they do and the demand  by the public to have a hero , this happens all through history.  To earn a living one has two choices, either to  work  alone in silence and tap the knowledge of the universe  and its materials making tools to grow food and manufacture tangible products for the comfort of one's family , or else to tap the  weakness of society around you , and preach to it emotions and a drug that they want to listen to to give them faith and hope even if  one promises compensation after death. The public loves that. Just look at the Net Worth  of many people on Google and see how people who tap the silence of the Universe material  to form it into the comforts  for family  fare out and then look up those who entertain the public and see how much better  is their "" financial success through being popular"".   Just look at the professions who deal directly with people how they gain respect and a higher salary even what they give the public is NEVER GUARANTEED  and then study those silent and hidden people who give TANGIBLE COMFORTS WITH GUARANTEES  to the public. It is all a social game and like women we love the emotional trimmings of the make up of live through  a form of intimacy through the use of the mouth , as the manner it is done is legal euphemistic  group prostitution and drug trafficking.  Apologies for the vocabulary used,   but as Jordan Peterson says,  "" If one thinks and asks question to find the truth then one runs the risk of being offensive,""    Please think about this depiction of the truth  and while we enjoy the diction and the presentation we must not be blinded with the   drug contents of discussions.

This way you take away all the power from the ''hate speech'' and at the same time you contribute to a more tolerant society by showing the initial audience ,that the hate speecher was preaching to, that you can use freedom of speech to actually root out hate speech?

@oldnikonian343,"I'd like to ask two questions of the posters on this forum about the last questioners point (begins @ 1:09:10) regarding the Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau's apparent quest to be ""the most politically correct person in the world."" Peterson answers the question by pointing out that Trudeau is making a big mistake by trying all in his power to level out the playing field (equality of outcome) and that it will only turn out badly because historically it always has, as per the USSR, Cambodia, China etc... where it has cost millions their lives.   So here's my first question; what if Trudeau isn't making a mistake because it's his express intention for things to turn out badly, i.e. he already knows that the path he's trying to usher his people down will make things turn out badly for them, but soldiers on regardless because making things turn out badly is actually his end goal?   Before I ask my second question, I will answer that first question myself by saying that I'm convinced that those at the top of the Politically Correct (Cultural Marxist) tree like Trudeau know exactly what they are doing, that the potential dire consequences of the Marxist ideology they are trying to proliferate are intentional and a part of a wider agenda to cause chaos and seek to gain Marxist totalitarian control amid that orchestrated chaos. Tribes (collectivism) are easier to divide and conquer than sovereign individuals, hence the need to eradicate that latter and foment the former.  I also believe that most people on the far-left of the political spectrum who have been indoctrinated by Cultural Marxists like Trudeau are not necessarily aware of the potential consequences and genuinely see it as a force for good because it has been dressed up so well like the proverbial wolf in sheeps clothing. Peterson's sterling efforts to reach these people with solid reality and a liberal dose of common sense is a great and rather comforting thing to behold because we know that he has our backs, in that his timely appearance on the world stage with his voice of reason could well throw a giant spanner into the Marxist works and help turn the tide.  I strongly believe that Political Correctness (Cultural Marxism), which was formulated by Jewish scholars at Frankfurt School in the 1920's, is specifically designed to corrupt and destroy Western society from within and allow it's proponents to seize control, that's it's a quest for what some might call the ""New World Order,"" which I believe will be Communist, that Communism didn't fall with the USSR and the Berlin Wall, but that they merely paved the way for it's proliferation into the West, effectively becoming a gateway for it...  Mikhail Gorbachev - “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.”  ...and if anyone should know, it's Mikhail Gorbachev.  My second question is simply; what do you think about the answer to my first question? Agree? Disagree? Whichever you choose, on what basis do you agree or disagree?   In short...... debate?

It's really kind of fallacious to reject any and all criticism of someone by saying I don't understand. And, Peterson is intelligent and part of his job is literally to communicate to people who know less than him; if he can't distill something down without meandering and pontificating at every opportunity, perhaps it would be easier to understand and critique him. In short, I understood him, but if you don't, it's really not your fault. In fact, he probably does that on purpose.

@leebanyusuf1316,"Faz Naz123 I listened. Don't get me wrong, I think Peterson is an incredibly smart man (smarter than me, certainly), but I think he has devolved from where he started. When he started, he presented clear critiques of gender pronouns and free speech, and I think he's capitalising on the fame he gained from that. My main problem now with him now is (1) he is, at times, incredibly unclear and vague about what he means. This is a problem because it prevents criticism of his work, and when criticism is presented, he can easily backtrack or blame misunderstanding. And (2) he cherry-picks from a range of discrete philosophies so much so that it is, again, very difficult to understand what he means within the context of the broader philosophical backdrop. I think this is again about intellectual manoeuvrability to bypass criticism of his work/ideas. Also (3), I think Peterson's constant invocation of Darwinism to support his ideas on value and ethics is defunct, especially in relation to what he describes as successful societies (individualistic). First of all, if you're going to espouse Darwinism as an explanation of truth, value or ethics , you going to have to demonstrate how exactly those things are heritable. Secondly, you're going to have demonstrate some continuity or progression of ethic, whilst carefully considering the obvious; continuity of values may not be because of success but also/mainly heritage or cultural dominance or war or wealth or any number of factors. This isn't an exhaustive critique but just some of my thoughts about this video specifically.

@RLjumpers,"I'm not an english native but I have grown up basically behind my desktop. I could understand this lecture almost completely (sometimes I doze off) without any problems, It's your problem if you don't understand whatever he is talking about. When someone like Peterson is having a complex discussion like this one obviously he is going to tend to not simplify his dictionary. These were university students he was talking to and it seems they understood what he was talking about, even catching the small cheeky jokes he hid throughout his metaphors and examples so YOU finding it vague and unclear is your problem... So I'm not saying Peterson can't explain it on a level that would be understandable to college students but he simply did not have to here. In other interviews with more mainstream channels he never speaks like this and usually explains it quite well for the average viewer.  Also the fact that a bunch of (apparently angry white) working class people have been seriously struck by this man's lectures and way of putting things we already knew deep in our heart says a lot about the fact that we are probably way smarter than we think. Anyway I respect your opinion, just don't think it's a very strong argument against him. And I know I made a lot of mistakes in grammar but yeah.. :3",7년 전,3,

Reminds me of a proverb from the Bible: ""My son, fear the LORD and the king; Do not associate with those who are given to change.""  People in the west have everything that the poor of the east and south desire (hence they strive to leave those places and get to the west); but the people in the west are very rapidly dismantling their own society by desiring to change the way that has led to it's success (which took about a thousand years at least in Europe...).  Europe without the Gospel of Jesus Christ and obedience to it will be disaster. The whole continent will become like that which we see on the news: catastrophes, disasters, chaos, terror, famine, slaughter, threats and death.  But if the nations will regret their rebellious ways against God and His anointed king (Christ), and will humble themselves and seek His face, God will forgive and heal the land and give His blessing once again.  Things like suicide, despair, depression, anxiety, identity issues, loneliness, addictions, will all be replaced by the joy of the Lord, singing, fellowship, gentleness, humility, contentedness, peace of mind and body, health, self-control.

Groups are oppressed precisely because they are *not treated as having intrinsic value as individuals, and consequently it is necessary to organise to address this injustice.

I think he places too much emphasis on Marxist theory, because most of the SJW I run into don't look that deeply into the fuller context of cultural development, they just don't care. I think their views are much more degenerative than that, and go back before the Enlightenment, and to what we had in Medieval times, pure dominance of one peoples over another.  I live in a Condo in the US, and in 2016, a new HUD housing law came into effect that requires HOA boards to set up an ""Inquisition"" to police the rights of the ""9 protected"" classes of people.

Now in order to dance with God we must be happy with self. and confident of are ability to dance.So in this talk the people there were very encouraging and honorable of him hence he was uplifted in his spirit and his mind was really banging on all 12 cylinders. This could really be noticed when answering a question and his mind was triggerd back to a previous question and he spoke of his work with Russian colleges.This is where you can really see the orienting reflex working he was developing more insight on the spot and I think also a main ingredient was that there was a lot of love in that room the majority there are not interested in their truth their interested in the truth very cool talk .,7년 전,0,
@LavishPatchKid,"The only thing that really stood out as flawed to me is his assessment of liberalism vs conservatism, as to power structures. Right now liberals have full control of the west, and it is the conservatives who want something new. According to his definition - this would make the conservatives now liberals, and the liberals now conservatives. As liberals are vehemently defending the status quo, or current hierarchy, which is basically the out-of-control effects of old money/academia's monopoly of policy. I think that in itself renders his thoughts as to ""defining types as mere reflections of feelings towards hierarchy"" pointless.  I would say the tendencies of logical thinking (conservatives) vs emotional thinking (liberals) is by far the defining characteristic of the 2 value systems. And hierarchies are nothing more than who currently is winning the culture war of any given society.  But I did agree with a lot of his assessments.

Yes, i know he does offer some like his championing free speech and other such freedoms that allow for ideas to disseminate and mix and synthesize with others but that is already in the status quo. Anyway i still enjoy his videos and i learn so much from him and think hes largely on the side of truth. The main reason why i love his work is that he is bringing us back into an age of ideas, an enlightenment per say.  And I and many others see the value in that and have taken action to try to make the world a better place by uniting knowledge, meaning, and action.

It’s easy to settle for the side that reflects us but that’s precisely when we need to get out our comfort zone and try and understand the other point of view. Strongly held opinions are still opinions and they can be wrong. Personally, I felt JBP earlier on, before he had a global platform, said some valuable things to me as a man about personal responsibility but he has since felt empowered to make comments about many things that I just don’t believe he’s qualified to and he hasn’t the humility to realise it.

@michaelstanwick9690,"I am about a third of the way through studying his tome ""Maps of Meaning"" and have listened to most of his public lectures online and as Professor Peterson would say, ""the devil is in the details"". The details are embedded in a context which, in this case, is a room of what I assume to be mostly Oxford University students. I have listened to this 'lecture' twice and it is clear to me that he is tailoring his utterances to the audience. He is also engaged in various trains of thought that upon completion amount to rather complex arguments that, I admit, are sometimes difficult to understand. He does this much more completely in Maps of Meaning - the very detailed construction of an argument about a particular concept.  The details are also in what he means by 'belief' and 'god'. I cannot discern from your sentences what you mean by 'belief' and 'god'. Peterson's approach is from Psychology and I think one must view his statements in that context. I recommend this excerpt from a recent discussion in which his ideas about this subject are more fully realised and are indeed illuminating. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVVuZ_0PUTU",7년 전,2,

You are an individual, but you are also part of a society, or many societies; and beyond that you're part of the human species, and part of the universe. It's not a question of collectives vs individuals. It's a question of right and wrong, depending on certain circumstances and certain contexts.

This is what separates Christianity from Buddhism, since in Christianity alleviation can only come in the future after death, as something we can strive for by choosing the moral course of action in the world.

@EntertheFray1,"Olibranch - You claim that a lot more didn't vote for right wing parties. That is false. A lot more are voting right wing than left wing because they do perceive a crisis. Hence why the right wing governments are coming into power.   So no, we should exactly stick on topic about what's happening in Europe and how it is effecting the voting demographic.  To claim that it is just all in peoples heads is to ignore reality. To stick your head in the sand and close your eyes off to the world.  I don't think anybody is arguing about how an Indian neighbour is a threat to your job, security and culture. That would imply that immigration isn't happening en masse and base at an individual level. When hundreds of thousands of people are coming from a different culture, one which follows a theocratic state, or opportunist economic migrants, they have a valid point.   Countries do not have unlimited resources and space. When majority of immigrants come into a country, they start draining the resources and space. Most can barely speak english, have a different outlook on life due to the theocratic nature of the countries they come from, and majority do not integrate into the countries they come to. Most end up not working, and the ones that do, are usually working the cheap labour jobs. Which might not bother you if you're in some middle class job. But I assure you, the working class demographic notices. This isn't some ""Dey took our jobs"" spiel, it is simple basic economics of supply and demand. A surplus of cheap labour workers keeps the wages and competitive nature of these jobs low.   We've not even bothered to mention the religion of peace most of these migrants believe in. Do I need to even make mention of how all of these countries that have taken migrants in are experiencing terrorist threats? Notice what's NOT happening in the countries who are refusing to take migrants in? It's almost as if the two are somehow related.....hmmm.  As to the misinformation about the role of the EU, let's look at what Eu are imposing on Poland and Hungary, and how they are getting involved in italy? I never knew that a trade market deal between states has the power to rule over the sovereign state. But it appears they seem to think that's the case. Well they can get fucked. What are your views on article 13 and 11 by the way? Because I can tell you, I SURE AS HELL don't want any legislation like that passing. Who can I hold accountable to make sure this legislation doesn't pass? Can I vote out whatever retarded person thought this legislation was in any way sane? No? Oh, shit. It's almost like the EU is a bad idea.  But again, keep pretending that everybody who believes in right wing governments and tackling the immigrant crisis is somehow just a racist person who hates people with brown skin colour and it has no effect on peoples lives. Simplify it to that if you want. But it's not the truth, and sticking your head in the sand and yelling racist isn't winning any.

Far-right Catholic party uses scare tactics to motivate bigots to adopt the same preference for anti-gay, anti-feminist, pro-religious dogma as the 'so called religion of peace' you supposedly deride. Great, let's all be hypocrites, but more than 50% of the country, i.e not the thick as shit medieval peasants reject that ideology. The UK - stupidly narrow Brexit referendum, followed by May's call for a mandate, resulted in her losing her majority to one of the most aggressively targeted Labour leaders of any generation. Portugal - still socialist. Spain - just turned socialist.

There are many more European countries than the one's you listed, especially far eastern ones which I noticed you conveniently left out due to their stances on immigration.  Germany having the lowest crime incidents? BAHAHAHAHAHA. Is that why there are mass protests with people in the streets with people demanding Merkels resignation, and how she's currently on a knifes edge with retaining her position purely because of her views on immigration? Did you notice what crime statistics in the report are on the rise? Specifically the rise of rape statistics and murder? What about that female activist group that have been raped by migrants, which gets hush hushed in germany? Note also, that the statistics report fails to account for terrorist crime related activity. And also to that, that despite being at an all period low overall, the rape/murder statistics have still risen significantly as opposed to before the mass migration. The blunt version of this could be summarized as: While crime is overall decreasing, the seriousness of each crime has dramatically risen and the immigrants are proportionally are responsible for a high % of this in their demographic.  ""So in your opinion everyone on the planet should just remain where they are, even if they're bored, jobless, oppressed, restless or into the opportunities that emigration might offer.

If you look up the Home Office statistics for murder in the UK (quite easy it's on the web) you'll see that despite mass immigration, and taken proportionally, you're still most likely to be the victim of a white indigenous individual than an immigrant, or someone of non-European background. The vast majority of immigrants to the UK are still from India, part of our Commonwealth.  The illegal immigrants form a tiny percentage and do not drain resources because, as illegals, they can't claim benefits or use facilities open to those here legitimately. Again, look up the crime statistics for Germany. Bizarrely, falling despite the ""threat"" of mass migration. The incidences of rape apparently increasing, heralded by the likes of Farage has also been discredited. To the point he had to make an apology. Essentially, the same wankers that were complaining about immigrants in the 80's are still complaining even though everyone else in cities like London just get on with their lives. Social media, and the press have enabled those minority voices to appear more prevalent, but the reality of peaceful existence continues. No ? Let's compare the 60,000 who died in the UK during the few years of the Blitz (a consequence of an ideology that championed the myth of monoculturalism and racial segregation) to the 200 or so that have died at the hands of Islamic extremists bastards in the last 20 years.  Yes, slightly emotive, but this would seem to indicate that historically the British people have more to fear from people that share your outlook than Muslim extremists. No ?

@EntertheFray1,"Olibranch - Yes, and nothing has changed in regards to what I'm saying. Someone came up with a question as to why the right wing is increasing in Europe as . It's not difficult to see why given the immigration crisis Europe is facing currently.  You say people in the UK are more likely to be attacked by someone of white colour - I couldn't care about the colour of the skin. I care about the reason for the attack. If it's something like an ideological/cultural reason, and it's happening on a worldwide basis wherever this culture is found, then there is something wrong with the ideology/culture and citizens should not have to take it as an additional consideration into their lives. That's partly why democracy exists, so if the citizens are unhappy about something they can voice for the government to do something about it.  I have looked up the crime statistics for Germany. The recent 2018 ones. Rape/Murder is on the rise despite crime overall decreasing, and proportionally in Germany, migrants are responsible for more of that. What this means is that there is less petty crime being committed to offset the rise of more serious crime being committed. The recent 2018 crime statistics for germany do not account for crime incidents such as terrorist attacks either.  So to claim that ""crime has decreased in germany"" is disingenuous when you actually look at the statistics provided and also what they fail to cover. It's the equivalent of what the conservatives did - claim child poverty has decreased while changing the definition of what it is to be in poverty.  You're saying that people are just ""complaining about immigrants"" in London despite the knife crime that it's currently facing. Also, last I checked, London 20 years ago didn't need barriers placed along streets to stop truck of peace attacks. To act like this is somehow a normal part of culture for citizens across the world is completely disingenuous, because it's not.   Also, to declare that there isn't an issue with rape and say it's been discredit is a flat out lie. I'm not even caring about garage here. I'm going on statistics.  The majority of the EU general population would like to place a ban on Islamic migration. Factual. 55%. The EU have lost the fight, and the old tactic of claiming it's racist no longer works because of the sheer overwhelming evidence CONTINENTAL wide on the problems caused by Islamic migration. People have had enough.  ""Yes, slightly emotive, but this would seem to indicate that historically the British people have more to fear from people that share your outlook than Muslim extremists. No ?"" I also heard that Nazis drunk water and ate bread. Therefore, you're a Nazi if you do these things. Believing in closed or selective borders and protecting the citizens within those borders has nothing to do with the Nazi Ideology that you are implying here.

He's previously talked about how a person holding a new born baby would respond to the question ""what's the meaning of life"" and said that the appropriate response is probably ""why ask such foolish questions, can't you see what's right here"". I think he suggests that if you have the right balance of order and chaos / safety and risk / foundation and potential etc that your mind and body will be so engaged that you will experience meaning. He has talked about meaning as something you experience not something you intellectually identify.   It's easy to think of times of too much chaos that impose meaning. If you're in a plane that crashes and you have to hike across mountains to get help for your injured family then for that period of time you have a mission, you're experiencing emotions that drown out anything else, all your actions and all of the environment are very meaningful because they impact of your achievement of an important goal.  He may be saying that the orienting reflex will take your awareness and turn it towards something that needs your attention, it's telling you what matters.  Maybe the idea is that you should notice what is meaningful to you by observing yourself rather intellectualising. That the definition of meaning is that thing you experience when you are involved in an activity very suited to you in a time and place very suited to you.   Best I've got :)",7년 전,0,

It is a humanistic discipline that guides man and offers him the necessary prescriptions to cope with the challenges of life and existence for his well-being, that of others and for the nation at large, at least that's the understanding of philosophy as i know it or maybe having the subject as one of my majors in college influences my opinion, either way the  philosophical education of the mind on the consciousness and the clarity of the fundamental principles (nation’s philosophy) upon which the governance of the nation is constituted helps to inculcate sense of nationalism, patriotism, loyalty and objectivity in the minds of the members, while it empowers them to be non-dogmatic but rational, coherent and act accordingly. To this effect, Philosophers believe that knowledge is power (scientia est potentia) through which one can conquer existential barriers, promote authentic existence and sustainable development. Ignorance on the other hand is an ailment that demotes the standard of life and impedes quality development. It goes to buttress the biblical saying that, “my people perish for lack of knowledge” (Hos. 4:6).

Suffering is what happens when you, or those around you, LIVE WRONGLY, and throw the balance of the world we inhabit off to the point we are harmed rather than benefited by our interactions with it.",7년 전,0,
@XxMadermanxX,"Yes, thats one of his greatest errors, Life is NOT equal to suffering, thats a really stupid and small-minded conclusion or axiom, suffering only occurs when theres a wrong doing in ""life"", i think that hes subsconsciously infatuated with the ego-driven delusion that suffering gives you moral virtue (because apparently God is a sadic motherfucker or something). Jesus Christ said ""I am the Life"", so, according to Jordan, Christ equals to suffering. Lets take a look at it, what the fuck do we mean by suffering? Something unpleasant, right? Something transitional, some sort of sign of inadequacy that serves to show that something is wrong, right? So, is life unpleasant? i dont think so, only when we are stupid. Is life WRONG? wow, quite a satanic statement, Jordan. Is Jesus Christ unpleasant? hell no wtf, he made wine out of plain and boring water hes da best for parties. is Jesus Christ transitional in the sense that it lacks something in its transition until fusing with the Godhead/Father again? No, because Christ is transitional in the sense that it travels in a flux but that flux is ethernal and it is a flux in communion with the Godhead/Tao/Source/Primordial Chaos (not the chaos that jordan talks about) which means that in that flux theres a synthesis and therefore absortion, integration and finally obviation of all the opposites that conform duality. Which is a paradoxical existence which is existence in itself which is life which is Christ which is NOT suffering. Logic cannot operate in a non-dualistic way because of its inherent nature. Logic will never be direct, logic is always a detour from the real thing/substance which is beyond form. Therefore all logic and form will be always illusory, that doesnt mean it is bad, it isnt bad unless we forget that it is an illusion.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

OTOH, when you list a specific type of suffering.  Then something can be done about it, especially in the physical sense.  When you talk about suffering in the existential sense, then it becomes a whole lot more problematic.  What he is advocating is extremes on both sides is dangerous.  Hierarchies with no flexibility is deadly as the world changes (and it always will).  OTOH, flexibility with no hierarchies is just as dangerous.  We need the flexibility to adapt.

All Structures tend towards tyranny so it is up to the people to keep things balanced and free. Not having any structures results in anarchy and chaos which is terrible just as tyranny is terrible.  He also explains liberals tend to be really good at creating new things and Conservates are good at running those things well.  You need both types.  All structures inevitably cater to only a portion of the population meaning inequality. However, the structures have utility that provides or creates a means to provide things that society needs.  Creating a structure that caters to everyone equally is called utopia and it is impossible to create.  So the best possible solution is to create structures that help the most amount of people with the least amount of factors that tend towards tyranny.   Ultimately though all structures either collapse or become tyranny inevitably unless people through thought and discussion by utilization of their right to free speech will keep those structures moderate and away from tyranny.",7년 전,5,

In contrast, the move to communism and the left brought them a hundred million dead bodies and seas of political prison camps.

@lchpdmq,"timcritt there is no question capitalism can be corrupted like anything else inevitably well. But in the end, and to be simplistic about it for lack of room to explain, a capitalistic society is one built on choice, there is no one holding a gun to your head to buy a product that a company offers, you buy the product if it is worth more to you than it’s cost. It is largely self-correcting unless the corporations form an unholy union with the government into a corporate cleptocracy, which is a whole other discussion. Wealth is created on a massive scale by allowing the individual to invest freely in his/her private property, and in a free society this has resulted in more people pulled out of poverty than anything ever in history, there is nothing even close by multiple orders of magnitude. In every, and I do mean every, society with massive redistribution, regardless of the original intention, the corruption comes with the power to enforce with deadly force and imprisonment and hits the singular central entity that cannot be fixed with competition, etc. or self correct, this, in contrast, has pulled millions INTO poverty. Even mild interventions such as welfare or minimum wages, which seem great on their face, have strong indications that that do more harm than good for the poor, with the exception of perhaps those that completely have Galen through the cracks due to disease or drug addition or the like for which I believe you can make a special case.

@lchpdmq,"timcritt the “Nordic” model is always the one tiny perceived exception  that people in denial or that have been indoctrinated cling to despite the 5000 examples of failure of the left’s anti-human pipe dream, from the hellhole cities and states run by Democrats in the us to Venezuela to formerly communist China and Russia and Eastern Europe, to Zimbabwe, to Uganda, to Cuba, to leftist regimes that polluted many South American countries in the last 100 years, the people are more stratified in these places than anywhere else and the poor are poorer, but fine, there’s the crowning glory of Nordic socialism, and even that is a facade and isn’t sustainable: I could go on forever but a few examples- If you investigate it, you find several things. 1) the economies initially grew strong in very free market low tax strong private rights fashion like everywhere else that has prospered, they devolved into socialism in the 70’s and have been lagging in growth since 2) the dirty little secret is that they are not that stupid, it is not nearly as economically socially controlled as it is made out to be, these countries rank very high on economic freedoms indices because where they take from one hand with high taxes, they give with others so as not to collapse their economies, private ownership is very high actually, Finland doesn’t have a minimum wage for example, and there are many more examples just look up indices of economic freedom 3) they don’t have to support any serious military since their are under the us protection umbrella, no one will invade norway and Norway knows it4) until recently, they didn’t have to deal with any third world immigrants and their progeny, and support them on the welfare rolls, deal with the high costs of their crimes, etc now that they have had just a small taste of what others have had to deal with it even Sweden is suffering under the costs, crime, and discord and turning back toward the right 5) of you look at Nordic people who move to non-socialist societies, you’ll find that they are more prosperous than those living in their home countries, evidencing (though admittedly not proving since it could be a self selecting group) the drag that socialism rings to the country. Anyway, whatever people on the left aren’t that smart so I don’t know why i take all this time.

The idea is to make the market serve the people instesd of the other way around, and it works. I don't care how many times someone wants to bring up Venezuela; that's not what I'm advocating. The answer to any strawman based on Venezuela or Soviet Russia or China is: nope, let's not do that; I don't want that; let's copy Scandinavia. I wasn't the one that brought up socialism anyway.

@robwealer5416,"He's been called a ""herald"" of the traditionalism that always seem to precede seemingly innocent movements that eventually came to represent the last stand to protect democracy or a given republic, a kind of extremism, though he doesn't want anything in that type to be a result of what he's advocating and seems perfectly reasonable.  Umberto Eco observed (having grown up as a Mussolini Youth in Italy) that defenses of masculinity,  the individual ""hero"" or a call to individual responsibility,  and antagonism to demands made by lower social groups appeared some time before the essentially socialist manifesto of Fascism was written by Giovanni Gentile (Professor of History, Philosophy)  in Italy, which became the roadmap for Mussolini's takeover.  Fascism was the ""personal responsibility"" approach that could put idealism into a working reality that addressed disparate grievances. (called 'active idealism', driven by the ""spirit"" but easily corrupted by theory or ""thinking"".  Strikes me as a bit of a pre-cursor to Post-Modernists conundrum or ""aporia"". )   So it's a kind of a grand mess that is generationally hard to describe that can tip this way or that if the material circumstances become serious enough and there are some unpredictable historical items, events thrown in. The kind of thing, plasma, that defies description, has its own momentum of a seemingly pure or good type, grabs the attention of the reasonable majority but cannot be properly analysed historically due to it's disparate and numerous elements and therefore cannot be anticipated if it arrives in the present.  We can shame the past for their lack of vigilance but am starting to wonder if we are not seeing the indefinable, indiscernible mass of forces proceeding inexorably. Will this create political elements, founded on these ostensibly unobjectionable ideas, that attempts to rebuild traditional foundations and has carte blanche to execute them? What does this look like as a political party?  Will it actually bear any resemblance to these ideas due to the ineffable problems that always accompany political implementation? (ie. compromise, patronage, and corruption)  Will the paradigm translate seemlessly into some sort of applicable new ideology ? (Will have to be ""new"" though presented as traditional) Fascism was an almost purely intellectual idea, not a ""thug""  bludgeon, as is popularly thought in its beginnings.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

All dynasties/civilisations become more unequal the longer they exist and only war, famine and catastrophe reliably reduce inequality. See Scheidel's recent  book - The Great leveler.  Nevertheless, poverty is now the lowest it has ever been in human history. Have a look at Pinker, Rossling on the stats.",7년 전,0,
@santosavini,"First of, the experiment has been replicated, all with the same catastrophic results. Just a simple google search will lead you to the evidence. Second, the capitalist problem comes from far before these days, Thomas More made criticisms (circa 1515) that are exactly as those Marx made (circa 1900), also rooted in Platon's ""Republic"", hence, the problem will persist as long as we don't change the capitalist system, because it's inherited from one characteristic of human beings (selfishness) which can be modified from an epigenetic perspective (cooperativism). It's quite an easy patter to discern. There's evidence of this too, just a simple google search will also lead you to the evidence.  The poverty is in its lowest, not just because; it's in its lowest thanks to the action and perseverance of a group of people that fight continuously for the rights of those who don't have enough power to do so, and the people like Peterson or Rubin come with a clear agenda to try to dismiss and undo what so much effort and fighting has given us. There are plenty of documentaries that expose the terrible conditions in which people in south east Asia work, not to say South America, where I'm from. Are you trying to deny inequality? The system has morphed since the criticism of the authors I cited; apparently some people have short memory and an incapacity to read history books and extrapolate the analysis. You may read Ortega y Gasset's ""The Revolt of the Masses"" for more in depth analysis of the symptoms I mention (circa 1927).  The problem with these people is they measure reality within a very small sphere where they unfold; Peterson gives clear examples when he tries to justify his deterministic views using as example high class female patients he treated. It's ridiculous. The evidence is too empirical to dismiss, Chomsky is so articulated and eloquent in these matters it baffles me we even need to re-address them.  Nevertheless, capitalism is morphing into a more socialist system, which is a result of the effort cooperativists are making; for instance Universal Basic Income. The fail to redistribute comes from a mindset, which has to be deconstructed. Mark my words, we will eventually became a neo-socialist society. The only reason we don't achieve this faster is because of the ignorance of the mass of the agenda some people are pushing.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
@michellelouw309,"A quick google search showed me that me that were numerous additional problems with the Experiment. I find Petersen interesting  primarily because his claims are so wide-ranging that I have to do a lot of work to check how credible they are and I try to read across the ideological spectrum.  Of course I don't deny inequality but contemporary data on progress is fascinating. It's overturned a lot of my own scepticism . It's worth being open-minded on the issue.  The competing claims of equality and freedom/ right/left have always been part of modern political philosophy and development so I don't think it's accurate to attribute progress to one group at one specific time.  I live in Africa and I have firsthand experience of hierarchies that are not at in any way related to competence and that legitimate themselves by muddle-headed socialist projects that are always being revised and re-branded but never actually deliver. Redistribution alone cannot raise people out of poverty. Inefficient technologies and production methods have to be upgraded. Large capital inputs are thus required in order to meet the demands of growing populations. Personally, I believe it is unforgivable to sacrifice the potential to improve lives because one is unwilling to be pragmatic about how to achieve it.   Like it or not, we live in a global economy. Marx's socialist vision was originally based on the idea that socialism would be achieved internationally at the same time. Truly delusional, but it does highlight how even he realized that a state does not function in isolation and needs to be resourced through relations with other states. So it's all fine and well to foster an idealised vision of the socialist state but in the end, trade relations with other states and capital inflows are indispensable. And when a country has no exports to offer, and no lenders to call on, poverty accelerates. So I can't agree with you that the only impediment to socialism is because people are pushing the wrong agenda.  I also can't agree that selfishness can simply be modified. Human beings are both co-operative and selfish. It sounds like the kind of grand social project that is destined to become a totalitarian nightmare. It's hard for me to take it seriously.",7년 전,0,
@santosavini,"From the first paragraph; maybe you are not understanding the experiment because of your confirmation bias. The results, independently if the participants were predisposed to tyranny or not, demonstrates that with some validation (which actually exist in the real world, Chomsky exposes it quite accurately), people WILL abuse power. That is a fact in prisons, governments and cartels, something you seem to be completely unaware of due to your dismissive claims. You should visit a prison or two and see what happens. Guantanamo Bay proved to be the perfect example of abuse of power and torture. Invisibilizing the problem, as Peterson does, is part of the criticism, wide criticism, lot of intellectuals are making of him. Also, I believe the comparison is completely fair, and once again, literature proves it. Go back 100, 200 , 500, 1000 years... the claims still appear in literature from the most respected intellectuals and follow the same social patterns. You believe too much of the BS Peterson says, even when you are claiming to contrast what he says with the sources; I've seen him misinterpret Jung to fit his agenda and for a clinical psychologist, that's pretty sad. On another matter, you show a clear misconception of what socialism is. I believe that redistribution can make the world a better place as per indication of every paper about Universal Basic Income, which is been tested in Finland and talked about in the US (Sam Harris had a podcast about it with a new presidential candidate). How can that not be an obvious indication of the failure of capitalism and the rise of a neo-socialism? Just sit by and let it happen, whether you believe in it or not, there are plenty of patterns and indications Peterson fails to see and that once again, many intellectuals have already addressed. Don't get me started on his debate with Dillahunty; so many fallacies in one debate. I would thing thrice before talking serious anything he says. Even more, he criticizes post-modernism and is the first one to be a post-modernist in a debate, but in the least constructive way (or rules, and writing a book called ""12 rules for life""...).  By the way, where does it says that Marx wanted to ""impose socialism everywhere at he same time""? Hahaha, you should read some socialist intellectuals before speaking! It's not good to repeat what others say without informing yourself. ""Das Kapital"" is criticism of capitalism, nowhere in the text does it say anything about a global imposition; if the revolution happened, it happened for a very real reason. Marx is not free of criticism, but plenty of the things he points out are very accurate and have molded the society we live in , whether you like it or not. And I repeat, the criticisms made from intellectuals before him are so similar and accurate, it's pretty hard to dismiss.  You are very misinformed about what socialism is, you've been fear-mongered successfully. You should try to deconstruct the idea of capitalism and the extent to which it have constructed our way of seeing things.  On a final note, humans have shown to modify their behavior in relation to their environment and education. Selfishness can be modified with proper education, it has nothing to do with totalitarianism, what made you believe that? There's plenty of evidence in nature to understand how selfish/cooperative populations develop. Richard Dawkins in his ""The Selfish Gene"" explains how ""cooperative"" populations tend to grow bigger in the long period while ""selfish"" populations tend to grow fast in short periods and then decline. The ""prisoners dilemma"" has been tested with computational algorithms and also shown that the best scenario is cooperation. Species evolve, we won't be like this until our extinction. Just looking back 2000 years shows this very very easy to see evidence of social and economical evolution, which was almost always achieved thanks to cooperative ideas (woman rights, gay rights, abortion, legalization of drugs, legalization of euthanasia, legalization of prostitution, etc etc etc). The problem here is that these people pushing their selfish agenda are retaining our progress ability.  I may be wrong in some little details here or there, but the patters are obvious if you connect the dots correctly. I've successfully diagnosed some political/economical situations before, I'm pretty confident things are changing for the best thanks to the pressure of the left, and we'll see more of it.",7년 전,0,
@michellelouw309,"I'm not sure what your point is about people abusing power and how that proves JP wrong. Can you clarify? The Communist Manifesto - Predicts that world revolution will soon follow revolution in Europe.Global socialism is an ongoing theme in Marxism. Imposition was the wrong word, he believed it would be spontaneous. Nevertheless in his writings it's very clear that it was never intended to be restricted to single states.  I have no problem with encouraging co-operation  and well-designed social welfare measures but full scale socialism does require suppressing self-interest as a human impulse to the extent that it cannot fail to develop into authoritarianism. I won't argue that capitalism needs to be regulated in order to avoid the development of monopolies, and  I support measures such as progressive taxation, which is actually one of Marx's ideas and is a form of redistribution.  Personal context always informs how we use terms. I've been 'on the left' most of my life because I was active in the anti-apartheid struggle, but the debate in SA at the moment is in fact about going hard-core socialist and expropriating property without compensation. I've seen what happened in Zimbabwe where famine and terrible poverty was the outcome. So, in order to avoid me addressing my context in the mistaken belief that I'm addressing your views, do you regard yourself as a socialist and believe that the state should own all property?",7년 전,0,
@santosavini,"Jordan Peterson denies, in a way, this power problem. For example, in one of his videos he says psychopaths don't tend to get high on hierarchies which I highly doubt. He gives his explanations, but once again I believe he's measuring it from a very narrow social spectrum, and that's why I believe him as naive. His analysis is based on biological determinism (hence the lobster meme), which is absurd when proven that certain genes can be activated or deactivated given a certain context. This is tied to my ""instruct cooperativeness"" argument which I will explain later in order to address the totalitarian ""problem"".  If you've read ""Das Kapital"", then you would also know Marx doesn't speak about the government owning all property. Such other authors may speak ideally when saying, not the government, but ""the people"" to own everything; it's obviously utopian. I believe you are mistaking socialism; even communism wanted no State. Look, the State is a necessary-evil. Going back to the first paragraph, when you give too much power to a person or group of people (be it the market or the State), you'll have abuse of power. The State regulates the Market, and another force appears thanks to socialism which is unions. In theory, unions should regulate the State, so you basically have a push of powers in order to redistribute accumulating capital (Union, State, Market).   The other point, the idea of going from the left to the right because of some snowflakes is absurd. If you position yourself in that specter, you were never really on the left. The reasoning is basic: there also are snowflakes on the right, far far far worse than those on the left. They are closer to advocate to violence and totalitarianism; many philosophers speak about the weakness of the left, which is not being less tolerant, because their honesty makes them wanna fight the good fight; while the right ALWAYS fights dirty (selfishness argument as the right is tied to being more self-centered). The extreme is a consequence of the extreme right, not the other way.  You just have to be intellectually honest and accept your true beliefs. I cope it by knowing that the inertia of the left is inevitable and necessary, and that in some moment it will calm down and reason better, because they act out of emotions, anger and sadness, produced by the selfish, intolerant right. How many times do you have to whip a lion before it attacks you?  To end this, I will tell you why I don't believe this to be a totalitarianism; first, no one spoke about imposing socialism out of nowhere. The idea is to reason, read and contrast the present with the past, in order to understand that there's a pattern of accumulation of wealth perpetuated always by the same caste. Would you believe sex-education would lead to authoritarianism? No; so why would teaching and encouraging cooperativeness would? The problem is that there's plenty of people who actually believe selfishness is good, for instance Peterson, without understanding that if applied for material things, you are basically destructing the foundation of society. Selfishness is never good, and there are millions of explanations that would surpass any ""benefit"" being selfish would bring; starting from the basic point that today's society is the result of the work of thousands of slaves in the past; nobody even has the philosophical ""right"" to make the selfishness claim.  Am I a socialist? No, I don't label myself, and I'm pretty sure you can't impose an economic agenda without a democratic vote with it not being catastrophic. The point is to deconstruct these ideas, teach them from the perspective which is best for everyone, debate with selfish people and make them understand everyone FEELS, everyone SUFFERS. Not being able to discern suffering makes you, basically, a psychopath. What I want is to put the best, most rational, systematically proven cooperative ideas into play, the basic one being limiting the quantity of Capital a human can have.

@johndeighan2495,"Charles Lumia In the ""free speech vs hate speech"" debate, the first step is to acknowledge the things each side gets right. Free speech absolutists are right about the dangers of allowing the state (or indeed the ""victim"") to define what constitutes hate. And hate speech censors are right that certain forms of speech have no place in a civilised society.  See, I want to live in a society where you can voice your opinions, however eccentric they may be; and I also want to live in a society where racially insulting someone is not only impolite but illegal. The question is: is there some principle whereby I can have the former and not the latter?  Maybe there isn't. Incitement, libel and all the universally-accepted restrictions on speech are too little; hate speech laws as they are implemented today are too much. And there's no obvious intermediate step, in terms of legal/philosophical principle, between the minimalism of traditional restrictions and the excess of handing over the definition of hate speech to the ""victim"", the courts and/or the legislature.  My best stab at an intermediate step would be: only prosecute hate speech when it is actually directed at a specific individual or group - where there is at least one specific victim. Racially abusing someone on the subway or on Twitter would thus be illegal under hate speech laws. But generalised comments or opinions - such as posting ""I hate n*****s"" on YouTube, or having a loud conversation on your phone about how much you detest gay people - would not. This would ensure that unpopular and even downright unsavoury opinions are not censored in the attempt to protect individuals from abuse.",7년 전(수정됨),4,

Sure we can stop all murders and rapes if we kept people separate but that's unreasonable. The very thought is ridiculous.  The same idea applies to ""hate speech"" (although it's subjective and as such not a good comparison to rape and murder). You can prevent ""hate speech"" but to do it would require a great sacrifice to liberty. It isn't a worthy trade off.  So people should be free to do what they want to do. If they unreasonably take away another person's liberty then the law should be there to punish them. That's the best system by far. Liberty is paramount.  Considering ""hate speech"" specifically: I think it will sort itself out. There's no reason to be racist towards a group when you don't know a single bad person in that group for example.  Lots of what is considered ""hate speech"" is perfectly reasonable. It's a very subjective issue. Personally I've been called a nazi many times and I have absolutely nothing in common with nazis or nazi ideology.  If the people who called me such things were in power or had influence over those in power I would be unreasonably harmed.

@CharlesLumia,"Life Sense  There are definitely consequences for our actions, including our words. I haven't argued otherwise, in fact I've argued against such ideas.  We should all be free to say what we want to say but there will be consequences of course. Examples: if my employee calls me something that I dislike, I'm going to fire him. If a server at a restaurant says something rude to me, I'm not going to leave a tip, will likely complain, and I may not even stay in the restaurant or visit again in the future.  In both of those scenarios the person should be free to make their thoughts known if they so choose but they should not be shielded from the resulting consequences.  The same idea applies to your examples where violence is a consequence. I can't honestly say that words didn't lead to violence in my younger days. It happens. Words can lead to violence. But violence generally has consequences too: if you physically attack someone because they said something that you dislike there are likely going to be consequences for you because attacking a person is generally seen as a greater wrong than mean words.  Liberty is the most important aspect in the discussion. We should be free to do as we wish. Being free to do as we wish doesn't mean that there aren't consequences.

We have to have a simple, general way to categorise such hate speech so we can give people a fair trial in a court. Without a definition of hate speech we can't legally stop somebody calling for terrorist atrocities etc Hate speech is not speech which causes offense, it is speech which incites violence against a particular group. Both right wingers and left wingers generally agree that we shouldn't allow people to stand on a street corner and call for another 9 11 so I don't see what the problem is. If you want to stop people like that spreading hate in your community, then you need a definition. A definition that applies to EVERYBODY.",7년 전,0,
@Texas75023,"Miguerys, the leftist mob mentality is not positive.  It is another example of the individual vs. the state, the collective, the group and the mob.  That is the fundamental war within humanity . . . the individual versus the plurality.  Or more concisely expressed, Might makes Right.  The group will always overpower the individual.  This is the future of humanity and it is pounding on the door.  The winner will be the group that is MOST flexible at responding and eliminating the undsirable offenders.    Consider Maxine Waters advocating violence against her opponents.  The RESPONSE was immediate and effectively shut down her advocating violence.  Threats upon her are the most logical and effective response, and they worked.  The left CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND when the stupidity they advocate is brought immediately, and directly back into their own sphere of experience.  This does not bode well for civilization.",7년 전,0,
@Scoring57,"Charles Lumia  Bullsh*t. Everyone's opinion on everything is going to be different, and sometimes people are contrarian on purpose as to not come to a consensus or agreement on something.

You make no law against a free person unless that person is causing non-trivial harm to others.  All laws should apply to all at all times.  You do not need leaders who control by law/power/coercion.  The best/better/preferred will tend to rise to the top because people tend to prefer to deal with the best/better/preferred naturally. The U.K. is no example -- they still pretend that a hereditary monarchy exists, the height of absurdity and the antithesis to intelligence, liberty and equal protection under the law. Lastly, human intelligence allows us to surpass the limitations of the raw natural state; so while biology and psychology may have built-in ""wisdom,"" there is no real reason to claim we need to be limited by it; hence the smart seeking liberty and equal protection under the law over any ""good ideas"" a person or party claims to have that requires it be imposed by others to enslave all who prefer otherwise.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Since all society change over time, why is the present change so detrimental to proper free speech.  The problem is that today's «  basic moral guide », has rapidly changed. But the problem is not the speed part, it's how it changed. The change was not organic but artificial, not by natural means but born of ideology, not by general consensus, but driven by the few. In fact it was changed by small interest groups with the help of mass media giving them a voice they would normally not have. The same media permits the re-enforcement of this new moral guide lines thought the « politically correct » framework limiting free speech to the point where nothing meaningful maybe discussed.

Peterson answers the question by pointing out that Trudeau is making a big mistake by trying all in his power to level out the playing field (equality of outcome) and that it will only turn out badly because historically it always has, as per the USSR, Cambodia, China etc... where it has cost millions their lives.   So here's my first question; what if Trudeau isn't making a mistake because it's his express intention for things to turn out badly, i.e. he already knows that the path he's trying to usher his people down will make things turn out badly for them, but soldiers on regardless because making things turn out badly is actually his end goal?   Before I ask my second question, I will answer that first question myself by saying that I'm convinced that those at the top of the Politically Correct (Cultural Marxist) tree like Trudeau know exactly what they are doing, that the potential dire consequences of the Marxist ideology they are trying to proliferate are intentional and a part of a wider agenda to cause chaos and seek to gain Marxist totalitarian control amid that orchestrated chaos. Tribes (collectivism) are easier to divide and conquer than sovereign individuals, hence the need to eradicate that latter and foment the former.  I also believe that most people on the far-left of the political spectrum who have been indoctrinated by Cultural Marxists like Trudeau are not necessarily aware of the potential consequences and genuinely see it as a force for good because it has been dressed up so well like the proverbial wolf in sheeps clothing. Peterson's sterling efforts to reach these people with solid reality and a liberal dose of common sense is a great and rather comforting thing to behold because we know that he has our backs, in that his timely appearance on the world stage with his voice of reason could well throw a giant spanner into the Marxist works and help turn the tide.  I strongly believe that Political Correctness (Cultural Marxism), which was formulated by Jewish scholars at Frankfurt School in the 1920's, is specifically designed to corrupt and destroy Western society from within and allow it's proponents to seize control, that's it's a quest for what some might call the ""New World Order,"" which I believe will be Communist, that Communism didn't fall with the USSR and the Berlin Wall, but that they merely paved the way for it's proliferation into the West, effectively becoming a gateway for it...  Mikhail Gorbachev - “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.”  ...and if anyone should know, it's Mikhail Gorbachev.  My second question is simply; what do you think about the answer to my first question? Agree? Disagree? Whichever you choose, on what basis do you agree or disagree?   In short...... debate?  I'm interested in the opinion of ""Travis in Canada"" who started this thread for rather obvious reasons.  Thank you.",7년 전,0,

Devolves into another discussion about 'muh zionists and jews running the MSM'. Arguing with these people seems to be getting tiring, but alas, the consequence of the bad logic will always be too important not to say anything to.  First: No, ""ZIONISTS"" do not control the MSM. If you see 'Jew here', as you're proof because high position, do some consistency, and see if you are using Jews by the same metric, some by blood, some by religion - and others my miscellaneous mixed affiliation, all three of them are commonly used as 'proof' this guy X is some evil Zionist Jew bigot that must be in on it - but the actual differences are FUCKING MASSIVE, and in no way proves any relation to most all of the other ones... Let alone it is like saying 'but black people don't have remotely close to 13% natural numbers of CEO leadership for the population norm"" - no shit, we would all criticize the SJW for leaving out many an important detail, and nothing about racism of malice would be involved. But now you are being just like them every time and ASSUMING simply because X demographic, it must be a plot and conspiracy. And no, 'but these jews over here said this bad statement - is not going to change that (and even then it is very, very often out of context, but sometimes rarely not).  When you start looking at how you approach how you structure things from a top-down level on HOW to look at it fairly, then the whole notion of ""but they own 75% of the media"" - ends up falling completely inaccurate, because it simply does not add up. Let alone ""ceo or leader here in very secular company"" =/= complete ""zionist"" or ""jewish"" interest or control, let alone with the operation consistency to be pulling off all this conspiracy shit and not the VAST MAJORITY OF EVERYONE THEY WORK WITH WHO IS NOT - not you know, not giving a fuck about it?

Bring them back to Colonial status."" The British Government launched the War of 1812 against the United States. Rothschild’s plan was to impoverish the United States through this war to such an extent that the legislators would have to seek financial aid... which, of course, would be forthcoming only in return for the renewal of the charter for the Bank of the United States.

We knew it was a stitch up, so without wanting to be pedantic, or get into a debate about semantics, it was hardly a 'conspiracy'.  If you look at previous replies to others on this thread I've also drawn attention to the CIA's covert operations in Iran, before the fall of the Shah, and in Afghanistan before and during the Soviet intervention.  Again, many people were aware of the funding for Islamic militants by the US neo-cons, but they preferred to turn a blind eye. I'm not disputing, or supporting, covert actions by the US, UK and other states. I have, however, looked into the history of Holocaust revisionism, and denial, and find the lack of supported evidence for their claims to be indicative of an attempt to rehabilitate the Nazi regime.

Anyway, I said 10 words and from that it seems you guys know everything about me ... lol  I can understand this Jordan character just fine.  I found that he needlessly used an excessive amount of words to get to his point, a point that was seldom even clear. The items he gave us conclusions on was just common sense in my opinion but he took us through the log scenic route fluffed up by the WAY over use of complicated words.  This to me is not genuine, it's over compensation for his ego which he clearly feels the need to prop up by projecting to everybody about how intelligence he is just because he has a vast library of sophisticated words at the ready (the one true impressive thing about him - but at the same time that's his whole stick!)   I didn't think anything he said was down right bad in any way, in fact I generally agree with most of his conclusions.  So he referenced a half dozen great books (so what), he referenced a bunch of great people throughout history (so what), he did a LOT of talking  and way over did it with a truck load of complicated words... but nothing this man actually communicated was anything truly ground breaking,  but he sure sold it to you guys  who he convinced because he's mastered the art of sounding intelligent.  I was skimming his Wiki page trying to see if he has actually contributed anything of substance to the world...  I find the very last sentence in it to be most telling:  [After he became famous in 2016, he changed his manner of speech and his style of dress to a more old-fashioned style, which he calls ""prairie populism"".]  Why would he drastically alter something as superficial as his look??  This guy isn't anything but a show man and all you college boys are too dumbed down by your indoctrination system to think on your own and to be able to look outside the box.

@Eleolius,"Karrlo SmithI think that's a false ideal of it's own, though I'm very much on board with the sentiment. Every individual need not be moderate. But as a group we must be moderate. There are things that being very liberal or very conservative benefit individuals and society by being, that if we were ALL moderates, our society would lack. Moderates often lack the certainty of their ideals to ACT decisively for change, and at the same time, lack the conviction of their societal foundations to STAND FIRM when some aspect of society is under assault, but is critical to NOT be changed. We need the structural strength of the very conservative at the same time as we need the fluidity and forward lookingness of the ultra liberal... the outcome of either position in extremis without the balance of the other, and the glue between them (the bridge) of the moderates, is ALWAYS catastrophe, regression, and disaster for a society. And also, conservatives RARELY bury themselves in a coffin of hatred. Hatred tends to come from your ultra Liberal types, who see how utterly pathetic Reality is compared to their lofty ideals. Conservatives usually express DISDAIN, not hatred. Hatred is typically the realm of the Reformers, the Revolutionaries, the Socialists, etc. Conservatives mostly just want you to not shout so loud, and get the hell off their proverbial lawn. I do believe the most WISE position is as the moderate, however, as there is a certain humility intrinsic to recognizing that picking a side based on any individual's fundamentally tiny intellect and breadth of experience is certain to induce error.  I believe it is the Moderate's role, and moral obligation to ensure that the Conservative and the Liberal have us as a mediator and a go between, who can validate the virtues of both, and repudiate the vices of both, while ensuring we do not fall into the trap of hubris, and thinking that we are superior to them, simply because we have but one virtue, the virtue of moderation in belief-... they have their virtues that are equally important to ours. I also think it's nigh impossible to truly ""understand"" the position of a true conservative without being one, nor a radical liberal, in the same vein. Sympathy is a start, but you only get empathy from similarity and co-aligment of yourself on the spectrum. And Empathy is the only doorway to true psycho-social-emotional understanding between people.",7년 전,0,

@bofbob1,"I don't really get why this man has so much appeal. None of his ideas seem particularly novel. Timing perhaps? Dunno. But if he's getting interesting ideas out to people who hadn't heard them yet, then more power to him.  I found the first part of his speech interesting, in that it almost perfectly illustrated why, from the perspective of Eastern philosophy, Western philosophy is limited in scope. His views highlight the most fundamental difference between the two.  This idea of ""approach and avoidance"" is now well anchored in Western thought, and is finding more and more support from the sciences. This maps on nicely with the Buddhist notions of raga and dvesha (basically desire and aversion). Interestingly the Buddhist tradition adds a third component, moha (confusion, delusion).  But here's the fundamental difference. Peterson argues that there is no escaping this. That if there is any way to transcend this, it is by searching for more value (more raga…). It is a strange use of the term ""transcend"", since he isn't saying that we can get out of this system, merely that we can make the best of it by going in one particular direction (that of value). Eastern philosophy (and since I used Buddhism as an example, I'll just stick with that) proposes that we can actually transcend this duality of approach and avoidance, including ""approach"" as meaning not just want but need. In that sense, it is far more ambitious than anything Western thought has to propose.

But not so much that you prevent anyone from having any freedom to succeed.   If the left went to its emotional extreme, you’d pay your entire income in tax, and then get paid from the welfare state that was expanded to include everyone. From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.   When the right goes to its emotional extreme, any regulations, protections and safety nets are scrapped and we are left to the mercies of the market, our employers, and the businesses we patronize.

The right’s extreme as far as civil rights is eugenics to cleanse the unworthy from the population, and the left’s is to outlaw any form of discrimination so that you can’t even choose who you sleep with.

@bofbob1,"+sallyfieldrequired I do. I remember being fascinated as a teen by the picture of Thích Quảng Đức, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who immolated himself in 1967. He sat in the lotus position, didn't move a muscle nor utter a sound while his flesh burned away. I think at that point you can say that he had transcended at least avoidance of physical pain. That picture still blows my mind today.  I think that the concept of liberation, the end game of Buddhism, can in certain ways be summed up as the transcendence of approach/avoidance. I should add the disclaimer that by believing that actual liberation is possible, I'm putting myself in the camp of the slightly woo-prone not-entirely-secular Buddhist practitioners. I suspect a secular Buddhist would say that we can just get really really good at detaching ourselves from approach/avoidance, but may never be able to transcend it entirely.  Peterson mentioned that this was hardwired into our biology. It's interesting because I just finished reading  the book ""Why Buddhism is true"" by Robert Wright (who I suspect won't get much love from the Peterson crowd because of his political views: he's quite the lefty!). He put a spin on Buddhism that I had never thought of before. Basically, he argues that we are deluded because it is in the best interest of our genes that we be deluded in certain ways. The mechanism of approach/aversion is at the heart of this delusion. So, for instance, the fact that pleasure is short-lived can be seen as a way to entice us, the vehicles or our genes, to keep going for more and ensure the replication of our genes. To take the simple example, if you have sex once, it's nice but that pleasure is short lived. You'll want more. From the perspective of the genes, it makes sense. It pushes us to do everything to keep them going and bring on the next generation of genes. So he says that Buddhism is true in the sense that we are all deluded about the nature of reality (our view of reality is distorted by approach/aversion), and the reason we are deluded about the nature of reality is because it is in the interest of our genes that we be deluded. In that framework, the insight of Buddhism is that what is good for our genes is not necessarily what is good for us and ""awakening"" is what allows us to transcend the chains of evolution.

The idea is that there never was a self to begin with, and what you perceive as a self is only an illusion. So, if that's true, everything you say makes sense but will be seen just as an attempt to consolidate the illusion instead of turning on the lights and trying to see the truth. Before the phrase was used for politics, ""taking the red pill"" was used in certain Buddhist circles. The Matrix was seen as a ""dharma movie"" because it reflected many ideas that permeate this school of thought. From a Buddhist perspective, what you're saying is basically what that guy who wants to stay in the matrix says, the guy with his steak (I forget his name).

@mirjamheijn5214,"PeRK, great post! I think I could add something to this as someone who followed Peterson before his recent fame. I'll start with an assumption: I'm guessing you're either over 40 or had a really well educated life, something that is rather rare nowadays. Peterson's main appeal is how he can articulate a good defense of something that a lot people, particularly students agree with, but were unable to articulate. Particularly in regards to postmodernism/neomarxism, because despite how things are looking today, they had been winning the verbal battles for the last couple of decades, broadly speaking. The result is that more women are being educated in practically every western country, with most countries having 20-30% more female higher education graduates, yet the focus is still on how to get women to do better.  I agree that a lot his ideas aren't new, but he is breathing new life into them, causing new people to discover Carl Yung and Solzhenitsyen. He's also reinvigorating thought about IQ. IQ studies are very robust but have been shoved into the corner and you see it frequently maligned as being completely without value. This while it's the single strongest predictor in the psychological arsenal of a complete suite of lifetime effects, stronger than male/female even. Critics may say it's not perfect, but what tool is? It's a better diagnosis tool than any other tool psychology has.  Lastly the one new idea that Peterson brings is one of recent discovery, which is the fact that certain big five traits predict political leaning to a moderately strong degree. This tells us that it's inescapable to some degree that we won't all agree on politics. It could tell us a host of other things that we haven't figured out yet. It's what informing Peterson's view of that you need both the left and the right and it's one of the reason he has been more conillatory to the left and thus got media attention, while also being right and thus riding the current wave of politics moving towards the right across the west. I think that's a couple of the reasons that he grew so far. And on top of that he's ambitious and started to aim and work for it.  He might well have ended up fired/disparaged like Tim Hunt or James Watson, but he bet his job and fought tooth and nail and he came out on top, something that frankly, few people expected at the time.  I do agree that he collides with eastern thought and it's an interesting idea; though if merely aiming higher would be sufficient reason for another type of thought to be considered better, then marxism would be a better mode of thought, as it aims to create a society of full equality, a kind of utopia. It's aiming higher, but sometimes when you aim higher the results are more catastrophic. Like trying to jump into the deep side of the pool when you haven't learned how to swim yet. And to abuse this metaphor further; we might not even be able to learn how to swim fully, so until it's proven, it might even be safer to just try to learn how to not drown better.",7년 전(수정됨),3,

At the time (late 90s), 3rd-wave cognitive-behavioral therapy had not really spread all that much. A lot of what was being proposed for patients seemed to me either irrelevant or ineffective. This isn't a global statement, just a personal one based on my own experience of trying to navigate the different types of options that were available to me at the time. After a few years of running into the same ineffective options, I found an age-old tradition based on an empirical discovery of the mind with a promise of liberation from suffering. So I gave it a try. And it worked for me. So what did it do for me? It changed my life! I'll leave it at that because if I really express how important that change was for me it'll get all mushy real quick ^^ I'm obviously not saying that that was the only way or whatnot (in Western traditions, we have Stoicism that presents a lot of similarities with Buddhism, including its focus on an empirical discovery of your own mind).

@roar91328,oh you mean psychology explains a psychologists statements? um duh... the way he puts things in perspective is why he is popular most psychologists ive met in the states dont even talk about psychology they tend to just prescribe medication  and never actually solve anything. the psychology he puts forward comes from people who actually want to study  the psyche and use it to help people and the way he explains it and in detail brings it to life is why i think he is so popular.  also he gives  justification to people who simply want to be seen as individuals while also giving credence to the idea of a collective  which for most people nowadays its one or another and anyone who usually says other wise gets shot down or screamed at until silent.  so imo its not the ideas he puts forward but his ability to do so moderately  and concisely so its palatable while also standing up for himself  while remaining respectful to a degree. also maybe more people would respect and study philosophy psychology and anthropology if your community didnt let ideologues overwhelm it and change its presentation to the world.....just a thought.  which btw is exactly what jordan peterson does.,7년 전,1,
@bofbob1,"+Mirjam Heijn Interesting. I can see his appeal as a sort of ""popularizer"". He is after a very eloquent man. There's value to popularization but I can't help but see the potential downsides. In this video he gives the example of a person who thinks he knows what there is to know about his car because he knows how to drive, but as soon as it breaks down he realizes that he has no clue how the car works. I think there's a very real risk of that with popularization. It gives a wide number of people access to important ideas. But more often than not that knowledge remains superficial. And personally I think the discussion about postmodernism and its effects have remained at a fairly superficial level. If you go down to the root of it, it gets really messy and hard to parse.   On the idea of certain studies having been shoved to the side, I agree with you. But I also think there's a tendency to misunderstand how science works, even outside of any influence of postmodernism (this ties back to what I was saying about the discussion about postmodernism remaining superficial. because many would say that if IQ is being dismissed, it's because of postmodernism, end of story but I doubt that's true). Max Planck famously said that science didn't progress by convincing your opponents, but by letting your opponents die off. Science advances one funeral at a time. I think that's much closer to the truth. It may be the case that IQ studies are being dismissed by a generation of researchers. But that would be just one example among countless other theories and empirical studies that are dismissed out of hand today, not on their merit or lack thereof, but because they don't fit in the particular model that current researchers have. Those researchers will die off, and the next generation will be more open to those theories. It's how it's always been in the sciences. So I don't know how effective it is for Peterson to try to make the case for IQ studies to a lay audience. The real change will occur later on, just as a natural result of generational renewal. He might be wasting a lot of energy on something that will just occur naturally, in due time.  On the swimming metaphor, I hear you. I find it to be an interesting topic for discussion, but in the end, what really matters is whether it helps people lead better lives. If the model that Peterson proposes is getting all these people to ""sort themselves out"" as they all say, then more power to them! The theoretical discussions, although fascinating, really don't matter in comparison to that.",7년 전,1,

@bofbob1,"+Robert Johnson If you want a very specific criticism of one point he makes, I think his comparison between human beings and lobsters is misguided. I would put it in the category of partial truths that omit important scientific facts. For instance, when he points out that if you give a lobster an intake in serotonin, it will get back up and fight. Serotonin does play a role in agressive behavior, including in humans. That's the ""true"" part. But if we're just going to take partial truths, then we could also make the exact opposite claim than Peterson, i.e. that increased serotonin levels cause a subject to be less agressive (in humans, not in lobsters because they don't have the complex neurological structure for this to work). Because it turns out that it is also true that low serotonin levels cause the communication between the frontal lobes of the brain and the amygdala do breakdown, thereby impairing a subject's ability to control basic emotions like anger, leading to higher agressive behavior. So, he's not wrong per se, he's just taking an extremely limited view of the topic because it suits his argument of the omnipresence of hierarchy in living systems. And I could take the other partial truth I described here and use it as an argument for the exact opposite of what Peterson is saying… Neither of us would be wrong. But neither us would be right either. The views I've heard him express about postmodernism suffer the same flaw. They are based on a very selective truth and other aspects are conveniently left out because it suits his narrative.",7년 전,0,
@robertjohnson9565,"PeRK: Thanks for laying that out. The question that comes to mind is: What happens to a human being upon the very moment that they realize that the self is an illusion? Is it one instantaneous flash of insight? Or a series of partial insights that build over time? And what is ""the self""? What do you mean by it? Is the self a conglomeration of sociocultural conditionings and responses to that? What else is it? What is not an illusion? What is reality? What is real? I'm not overly familiar with Buddhist thought. Send me a good link if you can. You talk of Buddhism and postmodernism. I didn't know there was a link. What is it? Does it put you into conflict with Peterson?",7년 전,1,
@bofbob1,"+Robert Johnson That's a lot of questions! ^^ I'll do my best.  So, first off I should say that you'll find a variety of answers to these questions depending on who you talk to. Buddhism is a long and rich tradition so I guess it's no surprise. In the same way, if you asked a Christian how salvation works you'll get a different answer depending on the denomination of who you ask.  The second thing I should say is that some of your questions aren't really relevant to a Buddhist context. The Abrahamic religions try to present some answer to the question ""what is reality"" (why are we here, where do we come from, etc.) While Buddhism does have some answers to that, it is really not the core of its teachings. You could say that Buddhism is more concerned about figuring out why we feel the need to answer those questions in the first place. That's in no small part why there's not much proselytism in Buddhism. The answers to those questions just don't matter all that much. To give you an example, religious Buddhists for the most part have some notion of reincarnation. But there is no strong insistance on anyone actually believing in it. It's just not what matters most in the teachings. The closest you'll get to a description of reality is the idea of ""impermanence"" summed up in the sentence ""what has the potential to arise will also pass"". If you're a secular Buddhist that might refer only to what happens in consciousness. If you're a religious Buddhist it might also apply to the physical world (I'll try to stick to the more secular stuff just to make it more palatable). In fact, I'd say that if you had to sum up the entire teachings of Buddhism in two words, it would be ""everything changes"".  As for the self and what it means to realize it's an illusion, Sam Harris had a nice definition of the self: ""the sense of being a thinker of thoughts in addition to the thoughts themselves, the sense of being an experiencer in addition to the experiences themselves"". For me, it's been more of a process punctuated by several insights instead of just one big insight. I think the first major insight was during a meditation retreat. At some point the ""self"" just faded away. The sound of the wind didn't feel any less part of ""me"" then my thoughts or whatever physical sensations I was feeling. I'm at a point where I can more or less reliably slip into that state of mind. For someone like me who was severely depressed at one time, this is invaluable. I could be overcome by feelings of hopelessness, sometimes anger. Now these feelings still arise, but since I can put myself in that state where I no longer feel attached to those feelings, they just pass without leaving a trace. Another way of putting it is that consciousness is a mirror, and the mirror doesn't take the shape of what it reflects. So when certain feelings are reflected in consciousness, you don't take their shape, they just appear but the shape of the mirror doesn't change. But even with that, I'm still far away from what Buddhists would call ""awakening"" or ""enlightenment"". Every step forward is a realization of something else that I hadn't noticed, some filter that my thoughts were going through without me even realizing it was there.  As for links, here's an interview with Stephen Batchelor, former Buddhist monk who now teaches a form of secular Buddhism (so, much more palatable to Western audiences, particularly in the fact that he doesn't buy the ""no self"" idea) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYXm6vAxOMI Here's a series of talks by Joseph Goldstein on most of the fundamentals of Buddhism, still fairly palatable but not entirely secular: http://dharmaseed.org/teacher/96/talk/6162/ but put together is more than 50 hours long! So it's really only for it you're really really interested (or just incredibly bored ^^).

@rinhu8864,"Robert Johnson Everything is an illusion, a subjective perception and creation of your own reality. It does not mean that you are fake and that if everything is an illusion there are no consequences, life is very real.  Rene Descartes famously said, 'I think, therefore I am,' that's just about the least amount of words you can use to explain that.  It can come as an intellectual epiphany if you've never considered it before, but for most people they already have a sneaky suspicion as to what's going on so it's not like the floors gives way beneath them.   In terms of insight you realize after a while that your brain can't always be trusted, for instance the other day I had a job interview, I thought it went OK at the time, but I didn't get a call back within a week. Suddenly my brain filtered out the good stuff and focused on the bits that didn't go great, soon my memory of the interview became negative so according to me the interview was a disaster (my brain had rewritten the past experience independent of the experience). I actually got an email about a week and a half after saying I'd got the job, I joked with the recruiter that I thought I was never going to get an answer. They were like, we got great feedback and they look forward to working with you. In that moment my impression and memory of the interview completely changed to positive...  a bit of a long winded way of saying that reality can be warped by our brains and they aren't as reliable as we would like to admit.  So when you say what is 'the self,' it's everything, your genetic predisposition to certain character traits, environment growing up, your interactions and how your brain changed because of them. It's also your conscious self and as Jung said your unconscious 'shadow self.' But mainly when people talk of the self it's the little voice inside their head and most meditation practices are about dissociating from that narrator of unfolding events and as you aren't 'in your own head' you live in the moment, that's enlightenment, being effortless with wu-wei, going with the flow etcetc  What is not an illusion is that your reality is a specific illusion to you.

@robertjohnson9565,"Rampas Inhumanas: you said ""Everything is an illusion"" Illusion: an idea or belief that is not true, or something that is not what it seems to be. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/illusion) Those are two different things. We are trying to talk about things that are true, partially true, wrong, bad, good or so-so. We will succeed and fail. So why say ""Everything is an illusion"" if our dictionary definition is: ""an idea or belief that is not true."" That means you are stating that 'Everything is an idea or belief that is not true'. That doesn't make sense if you are trying to think about what is true (and what isn't for that matter).  You said my illusion is a specific illusion to me. But all humans share exactly the same in birth, death, body and mind (basic natural commonalities of impulse and feeling). Is all of that an illusion? Obviously not. And by the dictionary definition of the word 'illusion' it is not. So what is left (individually)?  Obviously idea and belief is more specific to the individual...that would be illusory if you state that Everything is so. And if you say ""Everything is an illusion"" (pertaining to idea and belief = all not true by the definition) then many people (hearing that and trying to digest it) might end up being undermined in terms of their creative individual expression.",7년 전,0,

Peterson's postmodern approach on the concept and meaning of truth? 19:15 The postmodern claim on the impossibility of perceiving the world due to the infinite and equally likely ways of its interpretation. 21:03 If there is no objective truth how do postmodernists justify the use of Marxism in their description of the dynamics of the human interactions? 22:00 J. B. Peterson's concept of truth - ""narrative"" and scientific truth, the former arising from ethics (based on the observation of evolving rules in repetitive animal interaction behaviour - rat experiments.) and the latter from the description of the objective material world (based only on the interpretations of reality that lead to continued reliability of producing successful results). 24:47 Why are postmodernists and deconstructionists wrong in their social constructionist views? The behaviour arises first as an artefact of the social hierarchical structure. Later it is mapped as an image and story. Then articulated.  27:17 Audience Q1: Influence of Russian literature and culture in J. B. Peterson's ideas?  29:02 Audience Q2: What is the source of meaning (beyond God)? 29:03 Neitzche, Freud, Jung and Piaget - derivation of meaning from the internal organization of motivational states. 33:20 A. Luria, Sokolov and O. Vinogradova - meaning as a manifestation of a deep instinct (orienting reflex). 35:09 The sense of meaning as a manifestation of the synchronous optimal operation of the left and right hemispheres of the brain responsible for function/behaviour in explored and unexplored ""territory"", respectively. 37:40 Darwinian (evolutionary) and Newtonian (materialistic) view of reality and meaning defined by the end goal/ purpose (τέλος).  38:10 Audience Q3: Possible futures problems of increasingly liberal societies? 43:08 Is the act of categorization itself an act of limitation of individual freedom? 45:25  On categorization, classification and the understanding of statistics - mean, overlapping.

For example the establishment of welfare programs - as well-meaning as they might be - have unquestionably given rise to a large class of people who have become incentivised to stay poor.

So when i play, sometimes i would do shit and instead of winning a few times, he would win like half the time. Then i would get serious and he would still win (because im acting).

But it’s the only way we, as individuals and as a society, can think, process, and fine-tune ideas in order to keep our society stable, because we need both sides to adjust and adapt optimally in a constantly changing landscape.

Some of these guys did have pretty good strategies, for influencing the world,  it was there job to rap up the people of there time in it, and go beyond that, to produce success.   so when a country is applied to a persons name or writings, through history reasearch or archeology, it them using it to influence power. (they are reusing the dead, wrapping you up in intellectually to resource people for it) Your being used man brother.   That person did a goodjob for there time, is what im saying. thats how i think about it.  What they truley influenced how it was made to be is still on the line, re-itterate, is a weakening tool of it. They langauge fit where there time, there current events, can you imagine if one of these 4 scour and 7 years ago people jump out of a box and started teaching it. Everyone would be like wtf are you saying man, we have computers, cars, technology, update information, lingo'  words, that where non exhistant back then becuase of it. There is so much information that doesnt fit in with new versions or updates,  ( every now and then one jives(right person right time) just a little bit to kick character up, but its nothing to physcholgy about.   Physcholgy too, diagnose thought or influence people through. ( there zero progress in it, it actually goes backwards inforcing thought, constricting alliances tight, to where alliance becomes words big words that immieditely acknowledge just becuase with no meaning). in the past TGB the way i mean it.    ( what they had going is out there ""on the line"", working, the books the updates (the vocabulary change), the countries added, the names they have become since they where from that country or barely traveled to it, are little relivance. Not to be mentioned even. ( call it by its pangea name if you want to be awesome). or just think of pangea as a word to trigger open time. (whole).   In college after getting pissed off after writing my first MLA paper, i decided its bullshit, appeising this system, didnt have word or patients verified in order(abilitiy), to express it well. at the time in the past. TGB the way i mean it.   So i decided to call it what is it, in my own mind, ""structrued plagerism"", i would pay no attention or argue with thoughts of others on paper, nor would i acknowledge the fact that a similiar idea was attributed to someone else research. (giving them part credit to make my credit), it was , is my fucking idea. I;m not going to include some one from outterspace in it, include someone from china in it, include a computer from germany in it, to make my paper. (this is not a fucking group project, this Tyler Guy Barkers papers, i would think.   (but then it was worded a quick acknowledgement that said ""fuck this"", im going just going to print one off the internet whole).   I must of put it out there hard heard ""on the line"" because  That very same week the teacher proffessor at the college, introduced a imaginary (im not sure if was real or not), paper program that subimission, that would search the internet to see if it was a copy. I thought well what the fuck there goes that idea, i thought a couple seconds more. I printed one complete off the internet,  So then  i just rearranged the paragraphs, the introductory sentances and conclustions, Wrote them out to fit the arrangment of the paragraphs.

@matthewmalpeli,"Artificial scarcity describes the scarcity of items even though either the technology and production, or sharing capacity exists to create a theoretically limitless abundance, as well as the use of laws to create scarcity where otherwise there wouldn't be. The most common causes are monopoly pricing structures, such as those enabled by laws that restrict competition or by high fixed costs in a particular marketplace. The inefficiency associated with artificial scarcity is formally known as a deadweight loss.  In a capitalist system, an enterprise is judged to be successful and efficient if it is profitable. To obtain maximum profits, producers may be restricting production rather than ensuring the maximum utilisation of resources. This strategy of restricting production by firms in order to obtain profits in a capitalist system or mixed economy is known as creating artificial scarcity.  Artificial scarcity essentially describes situations where the producers or owners of a good restrict its availability to others beyond what is strictly necessary. Ideas and information are prime examples of unnecessarily scarce products given artificial scarcity, as illustrated in the following quote:  If you have an apple, and I have an apple, and we exchange apples, then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea, and I have an idea, and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.  — Phi Kappa Phi  Even though ideas, as illustrated above, can be shared with less constraints than physical goods, they are often treated as unique, scarce, inventions or creative works, and thus allotted protection as intellectual properties in order to allow the original authors to potentially profit from their own work",7년 전,0,

@COAKY,"Typical JBP response...  Question: What are your thoughts regarding the proper placement of a toilet paper roll on the holder, over or under?  JBP answer: [contemplative pause] Well, I’ve been thinking about this quite a bit. It’s an impossible thing to consider. You don’t just go at it as simplistically as which is best, over or under, man. You consider a topic as complex as this at your own peril. No, seriously. It’s quite traumatizing to contemplate. You know, I read Aleksandor Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago a number of times, and it synthesizes with Jean Piaget’s archetypical take on Carl Jung’s approach to psychophysiology. The reflex by which one approaches the toilet paper roll is symbolic of chaos. It’s so fast it’ll make your damn head spin! It happens in an instant, and this is where many people get it wrong. It’s something like [contemplative pause]...there was an experiment conducted by the Pellis couple in Alberta, Canada that addressed the rough-and-tumble play of little mice that ties back to the Darwinian landscape that completely dispels the postmodernists from a Newtonian stance. It’s no little matter! I’ve given this a lot of thought, devoting at least 20 years trying to navigate the vast complexity of the foundations of this process. There’s eternal danger in the pathological chaos of limitless toilet paper positioning. If you’re high in openness and low in neuroticism, the endless proclivity of the liberal Left’s position, from what would you say...the manifestation of the logos employed by the Soviet Union during a time in which millions of people were slaughtered under a cruel regime...you know, I used to address this topic with my students. You could be that sort of monster. It’s like, obviously you could’ve been the sort of soldier who would put a bullet in a pregnant woman’s head. It’s no simple matter, bucko. It’s like, yeah [inappropriate laughter and quick reestablishment of flat affect] it’s sufficient to consider who placed the damn toilet paper there in the first place. It’s like, obviously! As far as I can tell, the postmodernists under the likes of Derrida and Foucault will steer the dragon of chaos right smack into the heart of, what would you say, the tyranny of an overwhelming preponderance of the overbearing mother. According to Jung, this sociological mythos varies according to the thematic representation of my book Maps of Meaning. It’s extremely complicated and will devour your soul, man! So...

For a professional engineer your working life is thus 99+% failure aversion, all your experience and knowledge is in understanding how things can go wrong to help your project not fail. Its also why outsiders think engineers are incredibly risk averse, this is however naive nonsense.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@TheCossak,"Perhaps I'm misunderstanding Peterson, but what I got from his description of the two views of politics today with regards to how to view reality is that the problem with the left is the tribalism which leads to conflict. He prescribes individualism as the solution for this.   However the way I see it, all he has done is made the tribe smaller. Instead of being part of a small-medium sized group, you are part of a group with just one individual member (yourself). It is tribalism minimized to the smallest degree. It doesn't change our proclivity for conflict, all it does is that it makes the opposing tribes so small (single member) such that their potential for harm is minimized (would you rather fight against one individual or against a mob of 10 individuals?).   Rather, wouldn't it be better to enlarge the tribe to encompass all of humanity, and indeed the world? Instead of having 7 billion individuals fighting amongst ourselves, wouldn't it be better if we were all part of the same single tribe and so had no opposing tribe to fight against? There would thus be no need for political correctness. Perhaps one could argue that this is not realistically possible and so Peterson's prescription at least minimizing the harm. The reality however is that we don't live in a world where we are all taken to be sovereign individuals. Tribalism is unfortunately a reality and so hoping for individualism is just as much a long shot as hoping for one big tribe. We are caught in the middle.

@LovingTinha,"Too bad if you fit into both of his preset categories, than you are at odds with yourself and everyone else, pretty much sums me up perfectly. Which just proves this entire structure is faulty and not useful to humanity. I'd like to see someone like Jordan Peterson begin to entertain more interesting and open views about a society without political hierarchy, and rather a scientific and hierarchy based around technicality and practicality, facts and knowledge and efficiency and effectiveness, rather than constant conflict and rather than populist politics and power politics. And would also like to see him entertain a world without money. I believe Jordan is limited in his assessments because he only considers what is currently in existence and he accepts that to be the way forward, when really, it is proving to be an utter failure by humanity to accept such systems. Would be good to see Jordan explore more interesting prospects for humanity, than those that are already failing humanity. Than i might be more inclined to listen to him, as then he might have something fresh to say. Otherwise he is just pointing out the obvious without actually making any solutions to the problems. It isn't hard to identify problems and speak about them in depth, and sound intelligent. But the real intelligence is in proposing better alternatives and implementing them. So will continue to watch Jordan, but I put out this challenge to him to explore more interesting propositions to solve these problems in current world. His idea that we simply just accept things and deal with them, is very simplistic, and even goes against what he says about progression and development and growth and moving forward. So it would be nice for him to make some valuable suggestions of how to move forward with some better systems than those incompetent ones we have currently.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@josephvictory9536,"I found it was useful stuff. But i also found it could be better represented. For example, his points about freud and the environment's role in shaping inner forces lean towards Skinner brand behaviorism today. In fact, skinners beyond freedom and dignity is a fantastic read that dives into the kind of follow up that peterson does not do well in this precise case. Skinner was also influenced quite heavily by the Russian thinkers.  What i think Petersons biggest advantage is the way he has returned the 'dream' to psychology in the form of cognitive information resolution in the mind of the thinker. Peterson himself notes via his own introspection the varying levels that a philosophy can take.  In entrepreneurship there is the same exact process but instead of looking for a rigorous theory to support it. The intellect must just find a way to manifest the dream of the entrepreneur organizationally. And with sensitivity to the market.   The theories of psychology can be seen as a product of psychology. Similar to how a map is the product of a good geography department. And the psychologist and geographer are very similar in professional ontology. We are thrust into the world of mind and reality with very little understanding beyond our intuitions and agreed upon ideas. Hence the centrality of maps in both studies.   But petersons idea's ability to be used as an effective map is evident. Far better than skinner could have ever managed. Which i am absolutely certain given his publications that he resents. Despite is enormous influence in the field of psychology on a whole.  Much like Aristotle Peterson is uniting all aspects of human nature (especially the biological and political) into the psychological concept and presenting it in simple digestible and directly useful cultural format.  While its not immediately clear the value of say pop musicians to experimental ones. Or pop psychologists to experimental ones with the truly radical ideas. The more information there is, the more maps that allow better filtering of information themselves become embedded within a hierarchy of value.  Even if its not a new idea, its application is fairly new , tangible and timely. Our cultural and post modern problem can be reduced to 'too much information'. An unintended consequence of diversity and new ideas. Naturally we need a way to preserve the good without stopping new ideas. The political cognitive map of intersectionality has failed terribly here, despite its overwhelming popularity in policy.   In the same manner that intersectionality brought scientific and political power to tribalism or our tendency towards collectives. Petersons maps of meaning with all his talk of evolutionary play, heirarchies ect brings scientific and political power to individualism. This is the psychological experience hence its relevance.  I also somewhat found him lacking in explaining the benefits of collectivism. For example, corporate entities are collectives. So much so that they even have 'person hood' in spite of the individuals that compose it. This means the employees are collectivized under the corporate banner. And this is fantastic on many levels given that we can actually do far better through cooperation towards specific goals than we can do apart. Societies with strong corporations are far wealthier than those without.  Corporations as collectives have their efficiencies that can even be rendered crudely in politics. A fascinating example of this is when Castro used his entire nations wealth to genetically engineer a new milk producing cow and design their entire economy around milk and cheeze. He used communisms collectivization ethos to turn the state into a corporation that produced milk, milk related products and whatever else the dictator pleased (instead of what the people needed). But at least for milk, there was massive development that couldnt happen in their small economy at that time. Akin to a capitalist nations endeavors when matured. It was terrible for the nation's overall development and economically ineficient because collectives cannot possibly satisfy all humans needs. But by divesting the collectivized power to many many smaller collectives, individuals have choice to find a place to find meaning.  IF meaning is somewhat a product of the work we do. Then a corporate society is one which has a plethora of choice for how someone finds meaning. Especially if they want to produce more value.   There is a place for collectivization. Its in the corporation. Not government. Government should be for individuals the majority of the time because diversity is fundamentally a solution to oppression of ideas and of peoples.  While petersons ideas are not entirely fresh in origin. The realities he explores are very much what we need to explore to get rid of the pathological mentalities that infected our base notions of the individual and collective, given our current psychological cultural development today.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

(they where impowering it in a negative very hostile way in the past TGB)   You want to teach them that they are more powerfull,smarter,better than the forieng leaders influence mechanisms as a american, that to use foreign leader influence has signifigant signifigance to limitations of what there capable of. that they learn this as american, taking over the power that was to be, put together in a positive way. (create a base). A base of use resources, something that doesnt go backwards to it. there kind of a tool box, but every tool in the box should be out of the box, on ""working"", if you have other tool in the box out of the box working eventually they start building together, they realize there working together, This is a called ""a Union"".  a working union.  To build together, relationship,understanding, ability, that carries to a productuct full hull/whole.    The people that are being led, are people who are part of the system, but leadership as fell at the top, (there is plenty of work to be done, alot more than just taking over what is, was (fitting it or trying to shove it in a ""old model"").  If there was a real war, half the homeless, gangs members, would be off the street,drug users, salemen out of a job. Before sending them to a ""rehab program"" or expensive work placement program (with repeating effects , housing cost) they could join the military, should join the military. (the buisness of it all is quite troublesome loose right now in some places) Can we build terortories , military bases in places we have already conquered, yes that is a option as well.  I look at this way, how many extentions of prison government medical facilities are there. Work,rehab,education,medical,training,housing,monitering. How far into are sociecty has are development of prison jail medical facilities extended. How much money time, training, employment to tend to it. We have ""harbours"" for a system, that extends everywhere in every city. These should be military bases far and beyond, with work ethic, postive drive, training for sociecty. ( there are no drug problems in the military, there is no time for it, your life is on track (alaways.) in a really good way.  The support system if free, it comes with the ""work"". the training.  A mass recruiting, to solve end a epedimic(drugs, gangs,population , time misused), yes thats the answer. Its easy.  Should every highschool have a graudation enlist program, YES absollutely, it should be there as a opotion for them to see hear, no about when there middle school, to be complelety aware of in highschool.  ( there are county highschool diploma programs, along with G.E.D. scheduling that can link up with all high schools). Theres a sense of knowing, caring, respsonibility excitment about the future, that comes with enlisting.  (more than ROTC, those are often a different type of personality, all that structure canuniform stuff can be intimidating to a strong youth that has ""cool stuff"" on his or her mind, or other activities, such as sports, recreational sports[surfing skating biking hanggluiding or skydiving type stuff ""ideas""], travel or bigger thoughts.  ROTC is very exclusive. A graduation program route bridge will do great, do great things for school safety, for the general consenus. for president elections obama's campign was shown to bus people to the voting stations, to go to places where people didnt have transportation or the know,will to get there.   ( that started at highschool, middles school, there mindset), these are also people who couldnt find the recruiting center, who never knew or felt the support comfortabley.  It should be part of there life, the education system, eliminate that trend.  Knowing its there, is a huge thing ( i knew it all my life, was garuntee'd to be successfull by it, part of my mind held it, in a good way. I means alot, people start preparing for (kids,children, teenagers) in a way , a mind set, as they go through school, as they decide , measure and way what there strengths are, what there job is. ( they could have there job ,POS, decided with a ship date  the weekend after graduation.  Knowing that all the way through highschool, its like ""your ticket"", your future, dreaming about the places you might go, might be shipped to, taking your highschool girlfriend, or getting another one. Family goals are there, theres a real future, your adulthood, but embraced. Its awesome thing.  ( its keeps your thoughts in line when things get grim, you know how many friends you have in the military, 1000, a thousand friends, a paycheck alaways, a cool new place orginal, that uniform feels good too the first time , most of all the time. BDU's are kinda sweet, , its instills a power on you, a formation a guide of thought,  a bouncy one that nieve but true,. So whats your shipping station, what base are you going to, whats your MOS, that should be a highschool conversation option as you get bored, or joke around with your friends on the walk home from school, theres really cool jobs,really cool places .    It makes parents proud early on, gives them something to support, something they know works that is real, that is truley reach able. Something they can enforce ( if they were taught college is ""FAR away"") its leads to college, the support might be enough to get them( the children the kids) to place a road where they make there own decision, grow there options. Uncle sam has some super powers. too     ^ ""How to be president"" ^   why im thinking about it....sociecty stuff imporant when some body ask you for you change, tell them ""you know can join the military"" (as opposed to saying get a fucken job or no i dont have any, or when you give them change, say it in a carring way, ""you know you can join the military, or somebody younger like you could have too""  These people talk to each other, word of mouth,carries, mediums of influence, it will get around,Even if they are absolutely to old or have reason to say they cant, they will acknowledge it in a good way, even if there holding a sign that says ""vetran""  its supported by uncle sam, and use of guilt that goes to produce structure, to end a trend.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Even if that were true, which it is not, your efforts to rid your country of non-whites will fail.

As more people are pulled out of poverty and into prosperity, as has been the trend over the last 20 plus years, couples in what were previously poor countries will start to have less children.

By nature of his topics and methodology Peterson doesn't simply 'answer questions'. He breaks them down and rationalizes every single smidgen of the tinniest piece, builds it back up, and then derives the answer. Of course this is in no way bad, but in a format where similar questions are brought up one after the other, Peterson's tendency to laboriously clarify his rationale simply doesn't fit. It gives a sidetracking feel to the answer. And while he comes back to it by the end, its filled with redundant paragraphs that takes away from the actual answer.   TL;DR: Peterson should stay away from Q&As, as his M.O doesn't fit the format. Stick with other forms of discourse (debates, speeches, therapy, classes, books, etc). Just my take on it.",7년 전,7,

I'm just confused as to how so many millions of people who watch his videos have turned their back on post-modernism and post-Structuralism, without seemingly understanding those schools of thought in the first place? And everyone saying that the 'Lefties' don't like him because they're snowflakes obviously inherently misunderstand that many people fundamentally disagree with his philosophical and critical perspective, in a way which makes it almost impossible to argue against him as the two people will end up talking about different things (an example of which was his debate against political correctness).   I would actually be interested in hearing WHY, in this day and age, after all the varying schools of philosophy and critical theory that occur after the Frankfurt school and also preceding that - WHY so many of his 'followers' one might say, are so anti-postmodernism?

@mirjamheijn5214,"I think Peterson functions best in Q&A's. I just think that despite what he said (""That's a good question!""), the questions weren't actually very good questions. In contrary, Lafayette College asked questions that were to some degree beyond his ability to answer sometimes and as a result a much more valuable discussion.  Basicly if he can answer with his previous work (which he mostly could), you have not asked any worthwhile new questions. Though I suppose to some degree that is inevitable.",7년 전(수정됨),2,
@Aspectioner,"That's a pretty substantial aspect of my argument. Most people in a Q&A won't be able to ask worthwhile questions, especially when its a paragraph question -> 3-5 paragraph answer. Think if Oxford union can't do that effectively, it's a fair anecdotal example. By not worthwhile I mean questions too common or broad, where Peterson's consistent extensive answers aren't necessary, and therefore feel redundant.  That inevitability you agreed with is why I say avoid Q&As. This won't happen in my aforementioned alternatives, as those are chronological or at least patterned. I believe a debate / interview is where he functions best, as been proven by his many viral videos. General-public Q&As, not so much.",7년 전,2,
@mirjamheijn5214,"I can see why you say that. I guess I prefer the chaos and unpredictability of a Q&A, because even bad questions are telling me something about the environment they come from. I haven't seen a very good Q&A from oxford in a good while, for example and some really atrocious ones. So that tells me that Oxford is not going in the right direction as an institution, most probably.  I definitely see where you're coming from though. In this case I don't lay blame at Peterson's feet, rather at the people who gathered that day at Oxford's feet. I thought it was quite nice he kept his initial speech short, for example.",7년 전,2,
@Aspectioner,"Agreed, Oxford has produced some especially terrible content in recent time. At least from what's been recommended to me; so this is coming from a semi-ignorant perspective, not enough to say wether Oxford as a whole is heading downhill. Some really intolerable talks though nonetheless.  But if the goal is unpredictability and unique perspectives, I feel a class' ""question time"" following a lecture or a debate involving multiple intellectuals with different perspectives (similar to the munk debate, but possibly a larger group) would accomplish said goal without that 'inevitability'. As they would all be aware of the basics, allowing further, more in-depth discourse / questions.   I guess my issue specifically was indeed the audience, like you're saying. I want to see how far this can go, what truths further dialogue would uncover, and in what ways it would enlighten me. Self proclaimed ""Street-level"", like 1:04:43, just won't get there. And it seems to me that's what public Q&As always are, regardless of the intellect of the crowd. I want great intellectuals convincing each other-- not the general public like a game of politics.  In a way Q&As just hit a different front, which I just don't really care for in Peterson's case. Probably biased my view of it in a sense.",7년 전,2,
@mirjamheijn5214,"I thought the street level comment was really funny. I thought she was using the moment to somewhat cowardly tell off the children for being close-minded. I don't think we can get rid of the game of politics in the realm of intellect anytime soon, it'll get more political before it becomes free-er of politics in my estimation, at least for another decade or two. It seems that when religion is gone and a religion sized hole is in people's psyche, it fills itself with politics instead.  You are probably right in regards to the format, thanks for sharing. Interesting that you had a similar experience with Oxford. Ps. with recommended do you mean personally or through youtube?",7년 전,1,
@Aspectioner,"Both. Though mostly YouTube, as I don't usually search for stuff I don't enjoy. It mostly comes in waves where one video leads to another. A notable one would be the Islam one (a little old), and the less popular ones are, well, not very interesting. They did a slightly better job imo with Dave Rubin's Q&A, but was still pretty mediocre.  The comment was great, its just not something I want within J.P's content. There are plenty of funny moments in here, it's just not what I came for. Nearly all content out there is a mix of semi-serious discussion broken up with humor (e.g. all the DESTROYED videos); this is one of the few places I believe should stick to the serious stuff. This sort of ties into the whole format thing, where Q&A is more casual, while debates tend to be be strictly on topic and wholesome. Peterson is one of the few exceptions that's capable of remaining deliberate, thoughtful, and blatant throughout.   With political game I meant the idea of ""as long as the other can't prove he's right, you're right"". A game, or an act, attempting not to convince the opposition, but the audience. Just watched a great clip from ""Thank You for Smoking"" that sums it up perfectly here: https://youtu.be/Ir2dcZ-bkMs?t=24m22s .

@sayyadsaioo,"Hey @Jason Noble, good comment, but I don’t think you fully got what I was trying to say. I’ll try to better explain my point here again,  I didn't say ban free speech, BTW, all I'm saying is I believe the professor is oversimplifying the situation in a beautiful sentence and it's good between thinkers and highly intellectual people which most people aren't as he himself said, most people subscribe to the notion of the low-resolution thumbnail because as Jung said thinking is hard and most people would tend to do the easy thing almost always, it's a biological trait as well, the point is again I really wish the outcome is as peaceful as the sentence but it's not. And again following the same analogy; okay, free speech has both the virus and the antivirus but it takes a whole lot of time, work, effort and money to manufacture that antivirus and you might not be able to get everyone who's sick to take it (you’d also want to consider that people’s immune responses vary greatly…. depending on so many factors but that’s beside my main point), whoever oversimplifies that never worked in the health field, IMO.   Like should we accept the millions of lives lost because of the bad ideas? I'm really asking you if you could prevent this from the beginning would you not? Would you rather have millions dead than compromising on the free speech principle? And that's why I'm saying it's impractical like I'm sure beyond doubt communists and Nazis would have inevitably lost the ideological battle but it wasn't in a classroom in a university between high intellectuals (a controlled environment), that wasn't the case, and that's my point, I really wish you could reason with all of your enemies but that's not how the world works, do I really need to give you examples to that? There are still people believe in Nazism and communism, for god's sake! And they are increasing. And it's okay for you, for us all, as long as it remains this way, right? Believe in what the hell you want, preach and spread it, as long as you don't get in power to enforce it. (Which I'd argue again, it's not how things work, if they get the numbers they’ll be in power) So I believe it always comes to the fundamental question: ""where do we draw the line?"" Because you/we do/did the same thing all the time.   That said, there's an important distinction to make and again the professor pointed it out brilliantly earlier in the video. You gotta differentiate between what he called the Darwinian viewpoint and the Newtonian viewpoint, they aren't actually the same,  meaning, if you're forced to have a virus that's spreading without you enabling it, like out of your hands (how the world works= the Darwinian viewpoint), then you have nothing to do but to depend on your immune system, that's not the same as enabling the virus to be spread deliberately (the Newtonian viewpoint) because our incredible immune system will develop an antibody to it, both may lead to the same outcome but they're not the same, you get me? And that’s what I believe that statement by the professor sounds like.    It's also worth pointing out the vaccine analogy, a vaccine is a microbe in a weakened form given to the immune system to stimulate it to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, produce antibodies to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future, that’s also not the same as giving the body a strong (if not the strongest) strain and say I’m stimulating the immune system, you could kill that patient.    That said, I’m talking about it generally, however, if we specified the case to the discussion that’s going on in Canada for example, then I’d stand with the professor because I think the left has taken it there sooo far and he’s actually bringing them back to the balancing point.",7년 전,0,
@sayyadsaioo,"And regarding the external regulation and what you said about it, I also think it’s like saying we don’t need a constitution and punishment laws because if you put the evidence in front of people they will do the right thing, so you don’t need to externally regulate the society, self-regulation is much more practical, and I'll say while self-regulation is far superior and lead to better results, you need both.

When JBP refers to subjects which are not his primary field of endeavour, he always relies on the empirical data of the most respected studies in said areas, and he is always able to cite said studies when called out to do so. So despite not being the primary scientist in the respective field, he's not exactly making stuff up as he goes along. For example, when he was asked about male on female domestic violence, he stated that, in fact,  there were more instances of female upon male domestic violence than vice versa. This goes directly against the mainstream narrative, but it's true. The study was conducted by the CDC (which I did not know).

@garytyme9384,"Yeah, and where did these diseases come from? Ecologically, if you introduce a foreign element in to any ecology (like what happened in Australia, like what happened in England with the introduction of the American crayfish...it wiped out the indigenous crayfish) then they are sure to wipe out the local population and multiply i.e.  Australia is host to 56 introduced invasive vertebrate animal species. They can be categorised in the following ways:  Invasive – species has a tendency to spread their range into new areas or plague their range Ferals – defined as animals for domestic purposes (i.e. pets, recreational use – such as hunting – or beasts of burden) which have gone wild. Pests – animals which have a direct effect on human standard of living or the environment/ecosystems in areas where they are present, have a high rate of reproduction and are difficult to control.  so Yes I do know what I am on about sir.

I posit that he at times says things that are of tactical value to him. For example, in a number of interviews he has said ""I never said that!"", for example that he wouldn't use certain gender non-binary words, yet in a recent interview, I forget which one exactly, but it was a british show with two women, he claimed to have never said that. This wasn't the first time. Another good example is the one catalogued by the video ""Jordan Peterson's Most Pseudoscientific Claim Ever"" by Genetically Modified Skeptic.  I think that he's holding back and playing nice for a bigger plan and at the very least lying by omission in certain cases.

@ZodeakUrganomix,"@Josh C Incorrect. People have a massive range of likes and dislikes which will be somewhat affected by genetics but far more determined by upbringing. For example, one person might love tacky action films, but another thinks they're boring, laughable, and altogether silly. Are you telling me this is a direct result of evolution and has nothing to do with your environment / development? Are you telling me this is based on some sort of hierarchy? You may not be able to choose what makes you happy per se but it's not simply determined by genetics - that underlines a misunderstanding of evolution.   ""In that quest for those basic needs to be fulfilled, you must be willing to engage in the social hierarchy and compete for validation and dominance"" this is clearly wrong as well. Our basic needs are food, water and mates, in a Darwinian sense. This can be achieved in a multitude of different ways, as evidenced by the numerous, vastly differing tribal cultures around the world, almost all of which were actually far more democratic than our current society, lack strong forms of hierarchy (there will usually either be one chief that makes decisions based on the various arguments put forward by other tribe members, or there is a revolving council on which every tribe member needs to sit/participate), and existed for tens of thousands of years successfully. On the social side, literally just think about your own friends, partners etc. Are they all superstars? No, you value them for who they are, flaws and all.   You also say ""... you find happiness in the escalation of the hierarchy"". Some people might. Some people want to dominate others and be better than them, but those people are psychopaths or sorely lack self-confidence. Most people are happy doing what they love, regardless of if they're ""the best"". If I were you, I'd critically appraise Peterson a bit more, as basically your whole post was an unfiltered copy and paste from his writings / public lectures.

@ZodeakUrganomix,"I never denied that we're social creatures; I agree that we should live our lives as social creatures - many people find the most happiness and fulfillment by living their lives for others. This is unrelated to my above points, as what I said above and happily living in a community are not mutually exclusive.  ""Wanting to be respected for mastery does not make you a psychopath"". I perhaps poorly conveyed my point here. Of course mastery is something to be applauded, but mastery for the sake of dominance over others, as opposed to mastery for the sake of itself - to fully understand an idea or process - should definitely ring some alarm bells. Saying we're evolutionarily predisposed to dominate others at every opportunity is the same as saying that men are evolutionarily predisposed to raping women (both are behaviours exhibited that have clear evolutionary advantages in some circumstances). Even if it were the case, which is obviously isn't, why on Earth would we do that? ""Because we evolved to be like that"" is not a good enough justification.   Nor did I say we find ""meaning"" in our interests abstracted from real life. We find meaning in our interests in an abstract way (because we find the subject interesting, for whatever reason, dependent on many factors) and our learning about it. It may or may not be relative to other people, depending on whoever's interest it is (e.g. our position in these supposed hierarchies may or may not matter). Equally, I never said you can CHOOSE your meaning, but we can better define meaning in this case. Peterson's definition of meaning may be true to him - he wants to be the best at what he does and that's his ""meaning"" - it may also be true for you in your life (and that's cool - no big deal) but for so many other people it is irrelevant. Moreover, advancement in these supposed hierarchies, or just being ""successful"", isn't really valued by other people around you in any long-lasting way. If you're in communities that primarily value you based on your competitive achievements, get the hell outta there! Having lived my entire life in various well-knit communities (family, friends, academic, sports etc), I fully-well know that advancement in the hierarchy really isn't what is valued by other people and I'm sure the vast majority of people would agree if allowed to think about it. What is valued is if you're nice to be around, a nice person, if you will. Interestingly, I feel only people inexperienced in social skills would think that other people's valuations of them are based primarily (but maybe not solely) on how ""successful"" they are, which seems to betray Peterson's lack of understanding here.  I think I'm perfectly realistic about how we find meaning.

@gaddyiii,"38:00 onwards proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that this man is an anti-Enlightenment charlatan.    Despite his deflection, the point he makes is extremely postmodern (or premodern):  he argues anything that helps a human's motivation to survive is inherently true (""Darwinian real""), and that this truth is at least as important as universalized observations based on repeatable tests (""Newtonian real"").  Peterson's nomenclature confuses things, as I don't think Darwin would agree that what made his work true was its value to human survival--it's true because it describes biological phenomena observed in a reality external to human motivations (today we call this ""science,"" though we might, here, want to say ""natural philosophy"" or ""natural history"" to avoid anachronism).    Indeed, Darwin's work ran counter to the meaning/telos that just about every thinker in his day ascribed to the world.  The point of natural selection was precisely that, in reality, there is no meaning to survival--just competition between species (or genes) within a finite and randomly/chaotically changing environment.  We humans might not like it that that's true--it might even be better for us if we collectively decide something else is true instead.  But, the fact is that it IS true--observably, repeatably, theoretically, demonstrably, objectively, etc etc.  To let go of this is to let go of any meaningful notion of the modern project (or ""Western Civilization"" as this guy likes to say).    You're being duped if you fall for this.  It's classic social-constructivist postmodernism, it's just in a conservative self-help voice, so y'all go for it.  Consider asking questions about why this guy wants to make human motivation a reality on par with Newton's laws--why he wants to present his worn out Freudian (!) readings of cultural history as a serious perspective on Darwinian theory.  As far as I can tell, he's trying to inject a conservative cultural agenda into fields in which it doesn't belong--and in turn to politicize reality.",7년 전,14,

JBP makes the case that religions are evolving structures, tracing the beginning of Christianity back to Marduk.

@Myndir,"As far as I know, almost no-one in the philosophy of biology (which is post-Darwinian synthesis, obviously) denies teleological views of biology now. A rare exception is Alexander Rosenberg, although even he's gradually shifted away from his early hyper-Humeanism. There was a real effort, for instance, to develop mechanical theories of biological explanation (and explanation in general) in the mid-to-late 20th century, through things like the DN-model and the SR-model, but as far as I know, contemporary philosophers of biology don't think that they can do justice to actual biological theory and reasoning.  So no,  post-Darwinian biology is NOT opposed to teleos. Quite the opposite: we can't explain biological reality WITHOUT talking about teleos, including those beyond natural selection. (I note that you had to be ambiguous about what is selected, and also ignored the fact that contemporary human evolution isn't even Darwinian, e.g. most humans don't die prior to reproducing. Social Darwinism would be incoherent if it WAS!)  ""he argues anything that helps a human's motivation to survive is inherently true ""  No, he doesn't. What made you think he does, especially since he explicitly contradicts that in this talk?  (Disclaimer: I don't agree with Peterson on truth.)  Finally, you mischaracterise the logical relationship between Darwinism and the existence of meaning. What Darwinism provided was a theory of EVOLUTION (not life in general) that was superior to those that interpretations based on the unfolding of some broader teleos or plan. For example, AT LEAST post-Darwinian synthesis, Darwinism is better supported than Intelligent Design. (Creationism hasn't been well-supported by evidence, ever.) Ok. What doesn't that imply for the existence of meaning? Nothing: their logical relationship is logical independence. Darwinism can be true and the most flowery theory of the meaning of life can be true. Darwinism can be false and the most thorough nihilism true.

But that doesn't mean Peterson's perception of truth is grounded in sound logic. This video I believe sums up the flaws with his arguments to truth:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwXAB6cICG0  Then there's his debate with Matt Dillahunty.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8&t=2s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LjYovTo4uc  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWWGB7QpSTg&t=5s  When it comes to the main problems I have with Peterson one doesn't need to bring left or right wing politics into it.

The way he laughs at skepticism, the way he tries to redefine religion, god, truth, and atheism, how he believes Stalinism or Communism in general is somehow secular/humanist, how he believes we'll somehow lose art/the narrative without religion/god, etc. When it comes to certain subjects he just seems so out of his depth.

Perhaps because Newton's laws do not (and cannot) say anything about consciousness (and thus humanity) because materialist science is based entirely on the data obtained from lifeless, inert, unconscious instruments which cannot measure consciousness or even detect it.  In the realm of science, consciousness (and thus humanity) does not exist. This is why those who live exclusively according to materialist science and only accept materialist truths end up erasing their very own existence. This often manifests as denying free will.  Scientists/ materialists end up mistaking their MODEL of the universe (a model which lacks consciousness) for the ACTUAL universe. It is like living in a reflection in which you do not appear. This is the malaise that is now threatening western civilisation, and the reason why Peterson's emphasis on archetypes, psychology, humanity, personal responsibility etc has attracted so much attention.

@stormelemental13,"L L Gaddy  I don't see what the issue is. This is how I understand it, so feel free to correct me if I'm really off base. Post-modernist says the platonic ideal of 'house' is bunk. There is no one single house, nor can you even define what a house is, let alone decide which one is better. The white house could be a house, a cardboard box under a bridge could be a house and as a person may well prefer the box the mansion, it is impossible to say what is the 'right' house. Peterson's position is that it is correct that there are an infinite number of things and ways that can be called a house, but there person who lives in a mansion is more likely to survive that the person who lives in the box, so that gives us a place to work from. What is a house, a thing that helps you not die from exposure. What is the better house, the one that better improves your chances of not dying. By looking at those houses which people don't die in, we can come to a pretty good practical definition of 'house', even if the exact philosophical niceties are a bit fuzzy. So, the Petersonian says the cardboard box isn't a true house. The post-modernist says you can't definitively say that. And arguments go back and forth and round and round until people agree what is a true 'house' as per city ordinances.   While this is all going one, the Newtonian stands around being useless. This isn't his fight. However, he is very useful once someone wants to build a house the complies with an defined standard, the housing codes.

@konberner170,"I don't share Jordan's representation of Jung's view of Nietzsche. Nietzsche was not arguing for a blank slate where you invent your morality ex nihilo. He was arguing for individualism, which means coming to your own morals through subjective means. In effect, this means that you will indeed come up with the same ""solutions"" as many others. However, the important points are: 1) you cannot just take these things on hearsay from religion as being moral and still be a creative individual, and 2) you may indeed discover some variance in your ""meaning"" to others depending on your individual personality traits among other things.  So by ""creating your own morals"" the meaning is similar to finding a career based on what you actually enjoy instead of it being dictated to you by a career counselor or the some kind of career bible that tells you what you should and shouldn't enjoy. He never said that these morals can be anything. However, let's say that someone did look within and find that their morals are to cause suffering as their highest ideal. This will obviously not work well in a system that is created for collaboration and procreation as humans are primarily built. However, the question as to if you should try to be someone else by adopting ""normal"" human values or not, or be yourself and likely end up in prison or dead but at least authentically so, is an open issue.  There are human norms, but they may or may not apply to you. Take having children. Sure, we are built to do this in general and nature will likely reward such a goal and give feelings of meaning. However, does this mean ""you ought to have children""? No! You might hate it and be a terrible parent and be much happier not having children. This is what is meant by finding your own morals and values. Part of this is realizing the price of having various kinds of abnormal values.

@konberner170,"26:00 Appeal to nature fallacy. That something is natural doesn't mean it is moral. Is it useful? Yes. and Genghis Khan would be your ideal hero if spreading genes is high morality. My suggestion. Don't focus on animals in general, but focus on human exceptions. Among the biggest exception is trading outside of the family, which almost no other animal does. The power of this behavior is vast and until this is understood, I don't think these moves Jordan is making have support. With this understood, you can still fall into the pit of ""human flourishing"" because utilitarianism is easy to refute. Once that is dealt with, you can arrive at how trade agreements and private property tend fit human nature in such a way as to tap into Smith's invisible hand and tend to make all boats rise in the long run. You don't need ethics to have liberty and justice, you need consent, trade, and private property for humans, and these as agreements, not moral obligations.",7년 전,0,

Specifically, free trade hierarchies have very different traits to imposed hierarchies.  The left/right distinction is less primary than the consent/force distinction.

I have always voted Green here because it was obvious that they were the only straight shooters. The other three parties were into some funky shit that I had no interest in supporting. I voted Liberatarian here for our provincial election because Our conservative leader, Doug Ford, rarely would answer a question. He would just say pleasantries and tow the party line.

But increasingly it begins to bother me that he is often so agitated, and that he is so much on a mission, and seems to have less and less self doubt. He’s got quite an ego now. He apparently relies increasingly on having a big following of people who agree with him to the point of being acolytes. They will applaud no matter what he says. His answers to some straightforward questions become increasingly complex and drawn out, and they are quite capturing nevertheless.

He knows what he's doing. He's trying to become popular and rich. A great way to do that is to manufacture a cult following. Don't forget he's a psychologist. He knows exactly how to play with these people's heads.   Create a boogyman to which he is the solution (Marxists) and don't contradict people when they worship him undeservedly. This is a man that's been trying to get rich and famous for a couple decades, and thanks to gender pronouns it's finally working. His ego has always been large but was tempered by the reality that he just wasn't that smart. But the gender pronoun issue comes along and suddenly he looks like a genius for simply not being a retarded SJW. Then he misrepresents Canadian legislation to make himself look even better.   It's always been about ego, about money and fame. No surprise that he's now falling for his own bullshit what with Oxford calling and all this money shoveled at him. Now he's going ""maybe I am an unprecedented genius that deserves to be treated like an Oxford scholar!"" All the money and fame has convinced him of the bullshit line he's been feeding to all of us. He's becoming his own worshipful acolyte like so many egotistic rich people before him.",7년 전,0,

@mirjamheijn5214,"rewtnode, are you aware of the lindsay shephard affair? Have you seen the various violent protests? I don't consider his criticism of cultural marxists to be against a straw man. As to criticism; I hope you keep it up. It tends to go that way with popularity; Peterson's popularity is well deserved in my opinion and in general of a good to the west, but with that comes many people that have a poor understanding of his ideas and follow and defend him on superficial basis; I've run into that a couple of times. I had the same experience listening with his 5-10 minute answers, though when I went back to the question, I thought he really did answer the question, though in a deeper way than might have been readily apparent. I don't think I'm fooling myself with that either; my IQ is around 130, which is a good 20 points or so below Peterson's, so I accept that in general I need a longer time to digest his ideas before I fully understand them.  I don't think it's fully true that people will applaud him no matter what; there seemed more than a few in the audience quite anxious to applaud exactly that which challenged him and I consider that a healthy sign. As he continues to grow, the price on his head, or the value of someone being able to tackle his ideas to be more precise, will continue to rise. You haven't really challenged the core of any of his ideas, only accused him of a straw man, mentioned some personal pecularities and pointed out some people display the kind of annoying follower syndrome. I think you have the capacity to do better criticism and I'd say that starts with supporting your argument of his strawmanning with stronger evidence and focusing on attacking his ideas rather than his superficial personal characteristics or the dynamics of a person coming to fame.",7년 전,0,

The hierarchy is adaptive to the environment. The best hunter may not be best for survival if food is no longer a pressure.  The only thing that pushes nature to adopt hierarchy is environmental stress mainly lack of abundance.  Nature is filled with stress and scarcity which will lead to a hierarchy.

@jrd33,"I think his point is that we are not rational actors. We have a huge amount of subconscious biological behaviour which has evolved over millions of years and our rational minds are only rarely in charge of how we feel or what we do. Therefore the idea that we can rationally create our own ""values"" which will be acceptable to and acted out by our subconscious is hopelessly naive (as anyone who has written a list of new Year's resolutions can attest).",7년 전,0,
@BabudroSun,"Well now hold on. I agree that the subconscious is a much more potent force to direct action than the conscious. To say that our rational minds are ""only rarely"" in charge of what we do I think is pretty subjective and open to debate. True, my conscious mind does not choose when I breathe or other unconsequential actions, most of the time, however when it comes to actions of consequence I do believe that we are able to influence how we act.  On the extreme other end of the spectrum, when it comes to knee-jerk reactions like running from a lion, I can once again agree that it is our subconscious doing the work. I think in the middle there is a lot of room for our rational minds to flourish though.  So now on to the values. I guess it's worth asking what is a value, especially when it would come to, what is a value we might suppose to have created ourselves? I would not consider anything so fundamental as survival or comfort to be values that we create ourselves, but values such as decency or the respectful treatment of those less powerful than you I would say are not an innate value which derives from our basic instincts.  To discredit our own role in deciding what values we consider to be a priority just because we learn from and observe others is also a mistake to me. Everything we know came from others. We aren't physically able at an extremely young age to survive alone so we depend on others to protect and nourish us, which unerring brings with it a transfer of values from caregiver to child. Yet this often does not result in an adult possessing exactly the same values as the one who raised them.  As to new year's resolutions, I would say those are one form of value but not the epitome of the subject. Some people might take them more seriously but I would think most rational human beings realize that putting yourself up to a strong about-face on habits you have held for a long time (which is generally what new year's resolutions are about) is not an easy task and not something to take lightly. Rather, the changes we are able to make to our actions and our habits throughout our lives and not just at new years are a better illustration of how we can craft our own values.

@Crypt0n1an,"I don't understand why JP goes to such great lengths to explain his rationale against defining hate speech, in a way that seems to in part entertain the possibility that hate speech advocates might even be right. This is preposterous, they are fundamentally wrong from first principles so there is no discussion to be had, do not even give them the satisfaction. To me it seems perfectly simple and the answer is blatantly obvious. In fact it is in the very term itself, hate and speech. Last I checked speech was free so that takes care of 50% of the problem. Hate is an emotion and while to some certain emotions are more valuable than others we can all probably agree that all emotions have at least some utility. They are there for a reason, they alert us to something that is happening internally and in the external world and I would say that even hate has it's use. Seeing as we haven't yet made emotions illegal it would be preposterous to even begin to address making the expression of hate illegal. Of course when we have an imbalance of emotions it would be safe to assume that this is not ideal but that is more a matter of competence, emotional competence to be exact. However we have yet to make incompetence illegal either. So it seems to me that these advocates for the policing of hate speech are just fascists or emotion/competence nazis that want to stamp down on what they perceive to be an unacceptable emotion or state of mind.   It is quite ridiculous, all the laws that are necessary to govern this sort of thing already exist(limitations to free speech), asking for more would in fact end up putting us in a totalitarian state. But at the end of the day they are forgetting the most powerful tool we have to counter what some perceive as hateful speech, and that is freedom of association(don't like what someone is saying, don't talk to them, distance yourself from them). Oh wait, they are actually trying to take freedom of association away from you as well? They say it is racist, xenophobic? They are trying to make best friends illegal at schools too? Oh wow looks like it's far worse than i thought these people will stop at nothing in trying to stamp their ought on the world, basic human rights mean nothing to them(the ends justify the means).   The ends justify the means, which gets me to my final point. To me there are 3 kinds of evil. The first kind of evil is perhaps the most benign, it comes in the form of ignorance, or evil out of ignorance. Some would say that is not even evil, but I would counter that ignorance is in and of itself can be a kind of evil. The second is typically a byproduct of unquestioned self righteousness which inevitably manifests in the attitude of 'the ends justify the means' which at it's extreme manifests in a willful ignorance of the means in order to avoid corrupting the ends. This is quite bad as it implies that the person is at least in principle capable of knowing the evils of their ways yet is refusing to question their actions at any stage. The final and perhaps purest form of evil is when one knows what they are doing is evil beyond any rational justification yet they do it anyway the epitome of which is evil for the sake of evil. Thankfully these leftists have not yet reached the levels of the final evil but seem to be playing around with the second kind of evil and that is in and of itself quite sinister.",7년 전,1,

@davids2368,"I think its a reaction against the radical Peterson acolytes who worship every word he says. I've seen that view expressed more and more recently and its the opposite of critical thinking. Its like JP is sermonising people and if they agree with him then they're right,  if they don't their wrong.  Exactly the same thing happened with Christopher Hitchens fanboys, (still to this day in fact) this is however a worse manifestation of that phenomenom because JP sometimes can present his opinion as fact and make that into a working theory based on a mix of opinion and fact. And everyone does this a little bit because life is subjective but Ive found it more egregious with Peterson  (especially recently as he's hunkered down into his trench against the left).   And thats not a bad thing to do intellectually because it gives a different unique viewpoint to complex questions; that doesn't mean it's factually true though.  So thats where the pseudo intellectual claims are coming from I think. I don't think JP is a pseudo intellectual but what concerns me is people aren't viewing JP as he is; an extremely compelling eccentric.",7년 전,14,
@pizzabinge,"John Nada I'd argue that it's merely a survival mechanism for those who feel threatened. Part of the fight-or-flight response, if you will. A lot of people enjoy ""certainty"" in their lives, or the confidence in the ""rightness"" of their beliefs. Certainty enables people to make quick decisions/judgements and it keeps life simple and straightforward. The downside of certainty is that it can stunt intellectual growth, restrict analytic thinking and be a slippery slope towards extremism. Life becomes black-and-white...and eventually us-vs-them. When someone presents an argument that threatens a deeply held belief, the easiest response is not to think or to make a counter argument, but to attack the messenger, to silence them, reduce their potency, to remove the threat as quickly as possible. It is irrational in a civilised society, where logic and reason are so rightly cherished. When you are unable or unwilling to make an argument, what else is there to do but shout and scream? A baby can't articulate why they're angry or upset, but they'll let you know that they are nonetheless. You see this play out in various cult groups, political, religious, you name it.",7년 전(수정됨),4,
@johnnada1917,"To my understanding (after watching a substantial amount of videos starring Peterson) he constantly stresses that he´s not infallible, and that he´s constantly pondering over subjects. He even stresses it in this Oxford address, which is usually the characteristic of a person who´s honest. I often hear him saying: ¨And i might be wrong...¨ Or: ¨Correct me if i´m wrong¨... Thoughts and theories usually evolve over time and Peterson is no exception, so i guess that his fans should be intellectually honest and acknowledge that.  This however does not give anyone the right to attack Peterson personally, on the basis of opposing views or simply because they don´t like the way he talks or puts forth his theories. I read very little argumentation against his proposed theories by his ¨enemies¨. Rather it ends up being a mudslinging contest by people who come across as jealous children. Put forth good counter-arguments to his arguments, and i am sure most of his opponents will gain more respect overall, instead of attacking him on silly things like what words he´s using etc.  Is he eccentric? Well maybe he is and maybe he isn´t but what does it matter? His views are clearly resonating deeply with people, they understand him and like his way of thinking.",7년 전(수정됨),2,
@freedommatters9596,"It's a pretty good thing to be able to digest everything he is saying in one pass. JP does not talk on one level. He talks like a book series with sub plots, bouncing between ideas dynamically and you often have to juggle multiple side stories before returning to the main character and central plot if you will.   For people who can't follow someone who speaks like this it is easy to dismiss them as a quack. Then there are those who have an agenda to cash in on their ideological pay day so, whether they understand him or not, will deny everything he says.   I don't agree with everything JP has to say, but I love listening to him speak, and agree with him on many points. We really do lose out as a society when we cannot disagree and appreciate civility in the presence of different perspectives.

@QuakePhil,Attention whores be attention whoring :),7년 전,2,
@dmbindallas,"John Nada I made a comment to this end. Maybe it’s smug maybe not. I think he would be rightly irritated if I argued over a clinical diagnosis. I could say that, yes, I’m quite qualified because one does not have to be researching in a field to be well versed on it. But between the two of us the only person who is actually qualified to diagnose, for example, depression is Peterson. Not me. Why? Because that’s his field, his training, and he has licenses to do so. I’m working on my dissertation in historical theology. That means I’m qualified to speak on religious studies, world religions, and historical development of ideas in various societies. That’s my training, and the fields in which I worked to get a bachelors, masters, and doctorate. When an issue of history or ethics is raised, between Peterson and me I am quite confident saying that I am better qualified. I can’t speak for all ‘intellectuals’, but I can say it annoys me greatly when he speaks to subjects that I have years of work and training to understand...and he completely botched it. What annoys me isn’t so much that it’s wrong, but that he expresses something wrong in a very convincing and easily repeated manner. Another thing that is frustrating is when pseudo intellectuals say things like “people get angry when you ask them to think in high resolution.” (A) that’s almost entirely meaningless. What’s high resolution? Logical reasoning? If so, great! But he continues on leaving that undefined and makes a shallow point that it’s much easier to think in low resolution and call someone a Nazi. Resolution isn’t defined at all, but is a rhetorical device. Great to argue against name calling I suppose, but he mostly said...barely anything. (B) that line is a good representation of Peterson, as it precludes any nuance or possible objection. Let’s say that a figure in a hypothetical country rose to power by claiming to be oppressed by immigrants who stole his success and the national pride. Historically that is the narrative outline of Hitler’s beer hall speech. Now, I think it’s not helpful to say that for example Trump is a Nazi, but to say that there’s a similarity in the ideas and fervor is historically accurate. Is that low resolution thinking? No, it’s pointing out that fascism as a political ideology has happened before in one manner and events that are similar are occurring presently.   If I were to wager a guess I would say that many of us also find Peterson’s ad hominem attacks on the role of the university, combined with the insistence that he knows better than anyone else what we should be teaching  - even in fields in which he has done no research...a bit off putting. Anytime Peterson says a complaint about universities it is almost always followed by a mocking jeer at an exaggeration of what really is taught in classrooms. Telling students to think creatively about different approaches to problems and about the meaning of justice may merely be a teaching tool used to help engage students who would otherwise prefer to be drinking (trust me it’s a challenge). Moreover most colleges are so desperate for funding they can’t afford to be ideological to either left or right. Schools now use algorithms that calculate students reviews of their courses, their grades, and campus engagement. The program will provide a score and analyze the likelihood that the student will continue or leave. Colleges know exactly which semesters are most likely to cause students to drop out and which professors cause students to be frustrated. Most professors are not hired on tenure tracks anymore and the worst thing about teaching is that the student who sleeps during class, uses google on their phone to answer a question about the reading, and richly deserves a bad grade for turning in a paper that is badly written or maybe plagiarized - if you give that student a grade they deserve then they will almost certainly give you a terrible review. The reviews are saved by the provost and they determine whether you will be assigned classes to teach and your entire career as a professor. So, what do you think most people do? Let the student with the truly disturbing views of Islam pass a world religion course? Let the adamant liberal submit something slightly off the assigned topic? Or do you think most new professors will challenge their views and convince them to become liberal anarchists which is more or less what Peterson describes. I went into debt of $100k for a doctorate, because I love teaching and research and want to make the world a better place through education. How much incentive would you have to risk getting multiple scathing reviews from students, risk losing funding, and likely face a job market that is truly fierce and dying just to do what Peterson is saying we do - namely, push students to be social justice warriors? Trust me, academics are more worried about keeping their jobs that pushing a conservative to become a liberal. In my experience liberal students don’t complain or distort what you say nearly as much or as consistently as conservative students. Conservatives are extremely sensitive to being corrected or reading evidence contrary to their opinion. Let’s say most of us get a phd with $40k in debt, do you really think we would risk defaulting and being unemployed to “brainwash” students? Hell no! I care far more about my family and teaching and paying back my loans than I do about whether a student becomes politically correct. What Peterson accuses all of us of doing is the opposite, and he gets away with it because most people don’t realize how difficult it is to survive in this career path or that administrations are so fearful of losing students that they will correct you if your students are unhappy. It’s really really offensive when he speaks so flippantly and with such grossly false allegations. It doesn’t help that he does it with intolerable arrogance.  I could care less about his career and I’m not jealous of him in the least. Though I do envy the nice looking suit he has in this video. I don’t think most academics care enough about him to be jealous. I think they are either offended at his distortion of topics that he doesn’t understand or offended by his unbelievably insulting mockery of what it’s actually like teaching at a university and how little we are repaid for such thankless work.",7년 전,3,

@brandonvick387,"Note: I’m just posting this even though I rushed it and my structure could use some work.    It's not impossible. It's just difficult, as it should be. Take the law for example. One way to look at the law in America is as a collection of rules that derive their meaning through precedent and are interpreted on the plain face of their text. And that may be true if you look at the right epoch or the right area of law. But how do you explain the judge who justifies a judgment without precedent that stands because of the popular will. How do you explain a judge who makes a call on a matter that has a subjective answer? Clearly, factors other than precedent could affect a judge’s decision, and they could even go unsaid. On and on you can see all kinds of caveats to what seems like an objective original description of the law. The answer then, plainly, is that there is more than one valid description of the law, and because of that, there are likely infinite descriptions. The most accurate, but still incomplete, vision of the law is one that incorporates multiple perspectives to account for its function.   However, you do not need to concern yourself with the infinite portion of that equation. To +Myndir 's point ""There are an infinite number of theories that are logically consistent with the evidence doesn't imply There is an infinite number of theories that are equally confirmed by the evidence"". I agree, but the point is that there isn't just one valid description of phenomena that is confirmed by the evidence. You don't need to acknowledge that all of an infinite number of descriptions are equally sound, just that more than one is. Our reason and view of the facts, while flawed in their own way, are tools that can help us distinguish between narrative that are plausible, those which are theoretically helpful, those of which are overreaching garbage, and those that are practically applicable. Because the point, overall, is that it is impossible to describe the world in a singular grand objective narrative.   The utility of postmodernism, to me, is a reminder that a singular description of phenomena is not to be taken for granted. The infinite part of that equation of more of a logical aside, there is very little to be gained from it other than “oh that’s interesting”.   To the point of other commenters: Jordan Peterson’s representation of Postmodernism is annoying because he doesn’t seem to understand it, and it’s hardly reasonable to blame the rise of neo Marxism and Marxism in general (if this rise is even happening, show me the evidence) on postmodern theory.

The left has had the biggest burst of innovation and a rapid adoption of new language and rhetoric probably since the 60s. ""white privilege,"" ""intersectionality"" ""systemic racism"", etc.  Peterson positions himself as an ""antidote"" to this and equips primarily young conservatives with a means of understanding the root of progressive ideology and allows them to make sense of all these new ideas and where they come from.   Unfortunately, mixed up in the answer he provides to conservatives is an old far right idea of ""Cultural Marxism"" which Peterson has repackaged as ""Postmodern Neomarxism.""

@jml7916,"I'll try my best here to address your questions on his claim of postmodernists are everywhere. I am not sure which country you are from and therefore don't know the state of government or education that you are coming from but I am in Canada (BC to be more precise) and might have some insight into what Mr. Peterson might see.  First I would assume that most people that he identifies as postmodernists aren't actually aware of where and how their beliefs came from. They are not likely versed in philosophy and/or history and don't make any connection with their thoughts and beliefs and the ramifications of them. These are people who believe in core leftist dogma such as gender is a continuum or the patriarchy is real and needs to be torn down or capitalism is the core of evil etc. but don't ever think about or extend these ideas beyond the surface level that they seem to feel right at. They are taught these ideas in university or find them on the internet and are drawn into the narrative because at an emotional level, they feel right.  These people have filtered into society as a result of these ideas being prolific in education for 40+ years and now they are represented everywhere in the culture. Mainly in education (not just academia but primary school on) and in government. Our current government has embraced the equity of outcome agenda wholeheartedly and has implemented social programs in an attempt to change society towards their ideological view of what is right.  For example, in local schools here, children are taught about gender continuum and racism and inclusivity at a very young age where they should be being taught simply to share and not bully. A 7 year old child does not need to concern them self with white guilt and the patriarchy.   Our government has passed compelled speech laws and for a while our federal agencies were not allowed to address someone as sir or ma'am or Mr. or Ms. on the telephone. They were not even allowed to say parent, father or mother.   I assume from your second post that we likely disagree on many issues including affirmative action but I hope we can agree that all of this virtue signalling and indoctrination does not actually examine an issue, it's causes and present a solution. It's nothing more than the proliferation of an ideological viewpoint and goes counter to the concept of a free country. In my opinion it is also counter to actually solving an issue if there is one and a huge waste of resources.   If you want to drive a social agenda then let's talk about improving healthcare, improving education k-12 and access to post secondary, affordable housing, reducing poverty, teacher shortages, labour shortages due to housing or 100 other real issues that need to be dealt with.",7년 전,1,
@karlmarx809,"jml79 So the problem with what you're saying is that you can be against certain PC policies such as not using Mr. or Ms. or being against affirmative action or whatever, without instilling the perception of a dangerous overarching ideology that connects all of these things.   From my experience that just leads people blindly being against any kind of change to the status quo that progressives or liberals might support. When you start connecting dots that don't really constitute any consistent ideology this can lead to further and further right wing reactionary thinking.   If not referring to Mother and Father or calling people Ms. or Mr. is the result of postmodernist-influenced thinking, how far does that extend? What do these issues have to do with affirmative action, exactly? Is calling black people ""African-American"" postmodern PC thinking, or just a shift in cultural norms of politeness? What about referring to a trans woman as a woman, even though she was born a man? Is this a result of postmodernist thinking?   You could potentially convince yourself that one is, or that they all are the result of ""postmodernism"" or ""intersectionality"" or ""marxism"" or any other right wing boogeyman. But you need to think really hard about why you're connecting all these things and why they deserve a certain label.

@karlmarx809,"Anton Just because other people are talking without nuance doesn't mean that it's okay to do the same. Especially when you are influencing as many people as Peterson is.  The general message Peterson presents in the area of gender disparities, as he did in this Q&A, is that they are caused by inherent difference. He doesn't really give any credence to the potentiality of hangover effects from patriarchy and other systemic issues.  This is why he always brings up that Swedish(?) study which apparently shows that gender differences become more pronounced as the playing field is leveled in societies. I'd like to take the time someday to read that study because my instinct tells me he is misrepresenting its findings.   My guess is that while this is true in some areas (males dominate engineering more, females dominate nursing, etc.), the general trend is that most fields (i.e., law, accounting, sociology, physics, finance, marketing, entrepreneurship, etc. etc.) show much less gender disparities as society become less patriarchal and women are encouraged to pursue education. He didn't really represent this side of the argument and nobody pushed back against him on this.  Again, I haven't read the study so I don't really know but practical experience would suggest he is somewhat misrepresenting what the data show and the goal of many diversity/inclusion programs. For instance, my own field of law has gone from practically no women 50 years ago to being roughly 50/50 male and female today.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@jml7916,"There is a lot in your post. I'll try here.  Calling black people ""african-american""  was an organic shift in the language of the US. I would argue that calling a trans woman a woman is also an organic shift and common decency. Compelling the use of multiple arcane gender references (Bill C16) and prohibiting the use of common greetings is ridiculous and not a organic shift of the culture. I would argue that a gender neutral ""they"" does exist in english and is an organic use for the few cases where it is needed.  The ""boogeyman"" of postmodern thought does not line up with tradition progressive values and objectives. In my mind there is a clear line of delineation between socialism and the types of thought that have been brought forward in recent times from postmodernism. The oppression and victim narrative can easily be traced to postmodern thought. Whether that is a correct and full interpretation of the various philosophies is a different debate. But even then, postmodernism itself isn't the whole story. The ideas, as far as I understand them, of postmodernism don't explain the bigger issue which is the extreme tribalism that is occurring and the leaning towards a more authoritative government. The idea that the government should be a nanny to protect you from offence is preposterous. I honestly don't have my finger on the cause of those issues even though JBP blames postmodernism for it.   As to the question of ""right wing"" and ""reactionary politics"", I highly doubt that actually having a discussion and watching good discussions critically or even being a JBP fanatic will lead to that.

One concern is that inherent gender differences can potentially shape society in ways that actually reinforce and exaggerate the original genetic differences. This is basically what lies at the foundation of the ""gender is a social construct"" argument (well at least for some, others actually adopt the postmodern approach and genuinely assert that gender is entirely socially constructed and being ""male"" or ""female"" literally means nothing outside of biological sex assigned at birth).

Oppressor/victim narrative can be traced back to neo-platonic Christian theology, and probably back even further. That's part of Nietzsche's 'ressentiment' case against scholastic thought, remember.  The 'nanny state' case you talk about however... Wel obviously that's a mystifying shit, if and only if you look at it as such.

Now, before you turn around and claim I'm saying clinical psychologists are neo-nazis (bc fck logic amiright), let me spell it out even clearer: The issue, main issue, with Peterson, is that he doesn't know what he's talking about, most of the time, recently. So most people, who are 1) familiar with his work, 2) don't have some sort of political agenda pro or con, don't like that. For example, most psychologists I know personally, appreciate his work on say addiction, if they're familiar with it, but don't like it when he steps outside of that field to mumble on about postmodernneomarxists. Most other disciplines: sociologists, historians, political scientists and mainly philosophers (my bunch), don't appreciate it when someone's in the news all the time, mumbling about things he clearly has never read the slightest thing about, never researched anything on.  On the topic of reflexive. Great. You have a dictionary. The fact that you think the usage of the word reflexive is bad, proves my point.  Reflexive just means to reflect on something.

I think that a lot of his psychotherapeutic thought ignores the cognitive revolution. And he often says things about economics or epistmology that are wrong.  But I don't ridicule him.

@pomtubes1205,"Troy Barnes| Okay. Here's my best attempt to condense it: Q: Where is the source of meaning, if not God? A:  He answers the question first by noting that humans cannot create value by themselves. There needs to be something else. And that else is Freud's idea: that most of who we are, and what we do, is something that we have no control of. Jordan then predicates that these forces are the source of meaning, particularly in his first out of three answers: 1) Placement. According to him, we have these intrinsic forces -- motivations, maturation, etc. -- that becomes arranged into a heirarchy of being, and that heirarchy manifests itself into the community. Now, meaning arises from the arrangement of those intrinsic values, as well as from the community itself, or where a person is located on that heirarchy and where it should place the self. I think it's the idea that everything has its place in the world and that where everything else is, is predicated on its placementwithin the world. And that could be the source of meaning. 2) Contemplation. When an enlightening idea hits you, you get statled. Then you try to figure out what to make of it. Hence, meaning is constructed upon it. 3) Balance. One foot in the dark; one foot within light.

@xyhmo,"I'm a conditional and pragmatic tribalist, which is compatible with the idea of a sovereign individual. I'd prefer individualism, but it only really works if that's the framework that everyone acts out. But if some individuals decide to gang up and form a tribe and use that to their advantage at the expense of the rest, the individualists, what other choice do they have but to go tribal themselves? A tribe is more politically powerful than a bunch of uncoordinated individualists. There's a parallell to war here. War is terrible and mostly to be avoided, but if one side decides to go to war against you, what else can you do but to pick up a gun and go fighting? You either fight or surrender and let the victor do as they please with you. It takes two to cooperate, but only one to start a war — or to force the rest to go tribal. I do believe a society that's largely individualist is possible, but it requires reasonably closed borders. You can be individualist within a tribe, as it were, if the position of that tribe is secure and not under threat.

The radical left have spent decades intentionally misrepresenting the political right so that people no longer want to associate themselves with the political right. Decades of leftist brainwashing has convinced people that the political right is backward looking - 1950's - old - against progress. Naturally anyone who was creative and imaginative automatically began to associate themselves with the political left. But remember this was all a result of massive myth making.  Take someone like Dave Rubin. He believed for a long time that he was a leftist but he has increasingly discovered that he is actually on the political right. So his high level of creativity and open-mindedness was nothing to do with the left. He had always been on the political right. He just didn't know it. Decades of neo-Marxist brainwashing has convinced people like Dave that the political right is very backward. So naturally anyone who was creative and inventive assumed that they must be leftists.

@robertbrothers2099,"Regarding Baduki's comment: He's being serious. He's at odds with how to use the language--he prefers a pragmatic use of language and a consequence of that is that it's difficult to define some actions like 'believing.' It's clear that he doesn't know how to define the act optimally--there is a view of 'acting as if' and defining your words accordingly and a view of claiming a belief because of empirical evidence or statistical priority--both of which are too undefined to address with a position. If you disbelieve-there is also a question on what basis you do so--if you look at the recurrence of the archetypal God-then you are inclined to be partial to the existence of God literally-and are accepting a symbolic or archetypal existence of God by definition. If you use a statistical standard-you are more inclined to this position, not by much-but the partiality can't be quantified. If you use a scientific standard-you simply rule out the literal existence of God as something unfalsifiable-this is what most people do but there is also a sponsored ideology behind it-which makes it harder to be partial and it's not obvious that it is the default preference-if anything it appears not to be-but that is accounted for by a Darwinian propensity (ie-that there is a potential for a preferred mistake in terms of propensity to live--he also addresses this point frequently-referencing ""Darwinian Truth' from Nietzche) rather than a philosophical foundation. I don't think Peterson is being disingenuous-he's being obsessive compulsive-and he would demand that level of specificity in most of his responses regardless of the subject of the question. The truth is-that it is a hard question to answer with an exact statement. In fact it is impossible to make an exact statement regardless in spoken or written language. If you did it would look like this: This (Used(having(possessing..)..)..)..  . This is defining each word of a statement. Because of this-you rely on pattern recognition and implication to learn to communicate some things are harder to prioritize for communication--The short answer is: he believes that you should act as if God exists and you should not include language that is superfluous-in this case: using words that contradict how you ought to act. So as a minimum-you should say you believe in God if you act as if you do-but it is made as an exception because it is virtually certain to produce a miscommunication. He also isn't a literal athiest-he seems to be a literal agnostic but I'm not sure.",7년 전,1,

As we know he abhors the radical left and the radical right in equal measure. That the mainstream media wilfully misrepresent and smear him is disgraceful. It shows that the radical left rot has gone unchecked far too long. As JP says, the left need to have some defined boundaries which constitute the limits of acceptability. It seems the left leaning are relexively siding with the far left before they would agree with anything moderates like Peterson are saying.

@Andrew-qu7lq,"Martin W, in reading the CBA document, it seems their statement contradicts the quick stance on restricted speech.  ""Hate speech legislation is not aimed at discouraging repugnant or offensive  ideas. It does not, for example, prohibit expression which debates the merits of reducing the rights of vulnerable groups in society. It only restricts the use of expression exposing them to hatred as a part of that debate. It does not target the ideas, but their mode of expression in public and the effect that this mode of expression may have."" Arguably, misgendering a person, and if a professor were to do this frequently for weeks and months, would not be a debate of merit on all of this, but could be argued as an act of hatred toward that individual.  It continues, ""The amendment to the CHRA will not compel the speech of private citizens.  ... In federally regulated workplaces, services, accommodation, and other areas covered by the CHRA, it will constrain unwanted, persistent behaviour (physical or verbal) that offends or humiliates individuals on the basis of their gender identity or expression. ""  They are saying it doesn't do it for all private citizens, but in the case of a professor at a public university,  then if the persistent use of the incorrect gender expression which that person feels is offensive or humiliating, then this bill is seemingly restricting that speech.",7년 전,0,
@michaelrafferty2482,Martin W Having read the c16 Bill I'm afraid Peterson is correct in that in comes down to what is hate speech. Who is the arbiter of hate speech. Peterson was subjected to all sorts of abuse for refusing to use compelled speech so where was the law stepping in for him expressing an opinion. Do you think its OK in a civilised society for groups to stalk Peterson for what many millions of people believe to be a fair opinion. The use in the piece of it looking at suicides shows the bias in the Bill.If it was balanced it would have mentioned the young male suicides. Should we pass laws because of that or actually look at the core reasons for them. Nowhere is there a common sense attitude in the bill and its effect is to make people wary of saying anything that might offend which is a nonsense in a progressive society. Unless we stop the tide of bills like this then the western world will go extreme right wing and that historically should be ringing alarm bells everywhere.

@gideondavid30,"I don't have a problem with believing in a Higher Power. The issue at hand is whether we should all be nominal Christians like Jordan Peterson suggests, where we just accept the stories in the bible as manifestations of our instincts to give us meaning or we ACTUALLY BELIEVE the stories as literal and scripture as divinely inspired.   Jordan Peterson is either purposely deceitful as he should understand this ""nuance"" of BELIEF or he is genuine conflicted on the existence of God.     It matters if Jesus rose from the  dead or Moses received the 10 Commandments on a mountain of smoke and fire.

Also, I don't think I've heard JP once say that anyone should be a ""nominal Christian."" The only time I've heard him talk about Christianty is when he suggests that modern liberalism evolved out of some fundamental Christian ideas, like sovereignty of the individual.   I'm an atheist. I don't believe in the God that the Bible describes.

@ericberman_,"“If you need a thumbnail view of the world, the most effective thumbnail view of the world isn’t that you’re a member of a tribe. The most effective thumbnail view is that you’re to be regarded as a sovereign individual, and you’re to treat other people that way as well, both with regards to their rights and even more importantly and often forgotten, with regards to their responsibilities. I think that policies that are based on the first set of propositions (the tribal) degenerate into precisely what you would expect, which is tribal warfare, and the second have the possibility of blooming into exactly what they have bloomed into, which are the most functional societies, the most peaceful societies, the most successful societies, the societies that are the best at generating wealth along with inequality that the world has ever seen. And so I would say we sacrifice the latter to the former at our great peril, and I would also say that — and this is something that I’m very ashamed of — the universities broadly speaking are doing absolutely everything they can, as fast as they possibly can, to ensure that we sacrifice the sovereign individual view for the collective tribal view, and I think that is appalling beyond forgiveness...

It is not critique to ignore reality so you can make obviously uncharitable and politically motivated attacks against a strawman of a figure that needs no strawmanning to critique.

Most of Trump's ""critics"" have lied and sensationalised themselves into a corner where anyone can see the goal is to attack him and pander to those who wish to see him attacked, while bending the truth beyond breaking point to do so.   These people are not Trump's critics. They are the number one reason he's in office. They've spent so much time dishonestly embellishing the description of the ""wolf"" that most people really don't give a shit what they say.

Are you even in this dimension? What kind of bubble do you live in? How do you even start to claim that Trump even has the support of politicians that have already been doing their job blocking his laws, let alone the fucking media. You can't go two sentences in most ""mainstream"" media reports without a condemnation of Trump. But in your world the media is condoning his actions? You are not living in reality my friend.

I do not have to be to despise the behaviour and incompetence of a portion of his opposition, and there are many like me. Sadly, you cannot change reality to fit your arguments. You cannot redefine my own thoughts.

If they did, you would no longer be mentally ill.""  Now, did that help change your mind? I doubt it.

@il2xbox,"Well I think he makes a lot of good points in this particular video, and I couldn't point to anything that I disagree with here. But the first thing that comes to mind that I do disagree with him in about in general is some of his views on religion, which is not something he talks about in this video. I hope this isn't too long winded, but sometimes reasoned discussions have to be long winded, as I said. Also note that I'm a computer programmer, not an expert on religion, but here's what I think.  He has said on a few occasions that true atheists cannot have morality, and if someone believes in morality and claims to be an atheist then they are not really an atheist. Now I've seen all of his lectures on the psychological significance of the Biblical stories, which covers Genesis in great detail, and even though I am an atheist, I think that the way he covered that material was logical and coherent and I think he sends a good message about why we should study these old religious stories, even if they are myths. So I do think he has a lot of good points to make about religion as well. However I disagree that morality requires belief in God, and that atheists who are moral are not real atheists.  I think the issue is the definition of God. ""Theist"" means someone who believes in God, but what does ""God"" mean? It's easy to say that someone doesn't believe in God if they don't believe in the same version of God that you do, and it looks to me like that's what Jordan does when he says that atheists who are moral are not really atheists. I might not be doing his argument justice, but I think his argument is that God represents the highest possible good, and morality is aiming at the highest possible good, and there's an objective truth about what actually constitutes ""good."" And if there's some objective truth underlying that, and it is independent of whether humans exists or not, then that's no different from the concept of ""God"" because God is objective and universal and independent of humanity's existence, the same as this abstract idea of objective morality and ""good."" So, since atheists believe in objective good or morality, they're not really atheists.  But most people don't mean that when they say ""God."" They just mean a deity, which is an all powerful, all knowing, conscious being who created the universe and the Earth and humans. When people say they believe in God they mean they literally believe that there is a unique being who consciously created everything. And I think that that description of God is not the same as Jordan's description of God. The deity description is about something concrete and that actually exists in the physical world, whereas Jordan's description is about something metaphysical, and that's not the same thing. For example, I believe in morality, but I do not believe in a literal deity.  Basically it boils down to a difference in terminology, in my opinion, and I think he fails to make the distinction between the two concepts because his opinion is that they're the same thing. There are probably a couple other things I disagree with him about too but this youtube comment is too long already.",7년 전,1,
@mkhosono1741,"There's already a field called literature that does what Jordan does with his ""Maps of meaning"" except they do it with any and every book. There's nothing special about the bible and its stories. We can get more meaning from comic books than the bible.  Is what is moral, what god says is moral? or is it moral irregardless of what god says?  If it is the former, then you are arguing for moral relativism. If it is the latter, then we can cut out the middle man and discern morality ourselves.  This was a kiddie interview at best.

He went into his typical Jungian babble about hierarchy/archetypes appearing across time with Jesus representing the West and other deities in other areas. The other answer to the question was his typical evo psych/biology analysis where apparently ""emergent truths"" can arise from studying societies over time.

Classic example is when talks about postmodernism. On one hand he is critical of it accusing people redefining things such as gender and on the other hand he is prepared to redefine truth. Carl Jung was an interesting psychologist which evidently has influenced     Jp;however, Jung and frued have crazy ideas and that mythology somehow shape who we are and archetypes predicated on myths which I’m not sure about hence JP says metaphorical truths are truer than scientific ones.",7년 전,1,

I don't mean that as a criticism per se, I'm just suggesting you cut him a little slack.  He hasn't explained the danger of political correctness fully here but he has elsewhere at length. If you are genuinely interested in his thoughts on this then I suggest the first few lectures of his maps of meaning course would give you the outline you are looking for.  You make a good point about postmodernism but I would note that JP isn't critical of postmodernism by itself, other than to note that it doesn't give a person a meaningful way of moving through the world. He is critical of the amalgamation of postmodernism and neo-marxism, the marxism being added on by left wing types to put back the meaning that postmodernism itself lacks.",7년 전,1,

,"Two things I have not heard or seen Peterson touch on: 1) the biggest divide is not left/right, but collective/authority vs individualist. The first types complement each other, the second are doomed to be opposed. 2) When he delves into archetypes and religions, he seems to miss that each flavour has a spectrum between “god is part of us” and “we are part of god” That’s fundamental, and unexplored, and goes back to the first point, but at a deeper level",7년 전,0,

Since nobody wants to be called racist or sexist, if anybody tries to point out the Postmodernists' hypocrisy, they can form their disciples into a bullying mob to name-call and shame critics into silence.  They are using social justice to push a pathological ideology.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@karlmarx809,"Alister Sutherland I've actually been thinking quite a bit about why Peterson is so resonant. I think it's actually fairly simple and that most left wing critiques are spot on.   I think for more apolitical centrist types, he functions to preserve the status quo when people are increasingly concerned about disturbing noises coming from the  left (Concepts like ""white privilege"" ""toxic masculinity"" ""institutional racism"" ""antifa"" etc.) and right wing (Alt Right, Trump, Incels, MGTOW, Fascists, Populists, PEGIDA, UKIP,  EDL, etc.).  These people perceive him as a preserving a reasonable center/moderate position who preaches self-improvement over engagement in politics. He also champions easily supported and banal concepts like ""free speech"" and not judging people by their identity, but by their character.  To the right, I think conservatives/right wingers like him for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons is that he is helping form what they perceive as a coherent ideological description and refutation of progressivism.   The left has had the biggest burst of innovation and a rapid adoption of new language and rhetoric probably since the 60s. Peterson positions himself as an ""antidote"" to this and equips primarily young conservatives with a means of understanding the root of progressive ideology and allows them to make sense of all these new ideas (again, ""white privilege,"" ""intersectionality"" ""systemic racism"", etc.) and where they come from.   Unfortunately, mixed up in the answer he provides to conservatives is an old far right idea of ""Cultural Marxism"" which Peterson has repackaged as ""Postmodern Neomarxism.""  So, looking at this, you can see why Peterson is almost universally maligned by leftists and progressives and why they see him as such a threat.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@davidjames-cameron617,"jodawgsup can i just ask you, whats the point of you writing that to this person you dont know? Seriously? What were you attempting to accomplish and how in the world do you feel justified in insulting him? He said in laymans terms that with Jordan Peterson comes thoughtfulness and discussion. He isnt worshipping him. He isnt calling him god. Just praising him for the work hes done and exclaiming his expectations. I advise you next time you would like to pretend you can read the mind of another person youve never met then act aggressively, keep it to yourself or maybe take interest and ask questions. This is a place for intellectual discussion not emotional outbursts so I hope this helps",7년 전,2,

Yeah, the proletariat rises up against the evil bourgeoisie over means of production and ownership and distribution of goods.  Blah blah blah.

Therefore, he will have to be forced to do so in order for this experiment to work.  Who is going to force him?  Who is in charge?  Who decides what is according to each person's means etc. ?

@christianlibertarian5488,"I admire Peterson greatly, but I think you are overstating the case. While he certainly has formulated some ideas of his own (the action of Logos in society), mostly he is simply re-iterating Enlightenment ideas with modern scientific backing. That is a very good thing, but he is not in the realm of, say, Nietzsche. Peterson himself wouldn't make that claim.",7년 전,0,

@briankirwan6958,Marxist Atheist Hedonistic Demonic Big-Dick Monster  U are not seriously trying to tell us that Stalin didn't murder millions ?  And since the designation Right Left arose out of the French Reveloution you may need to rethink the sentence about what the Right did or didn't do for thousands of years.,7년 전,1,
@briankirwan6958,Marxist Atheist Hedonistic Demonic Big-Dick Monster  When u claim a moral standpoint based on an aversion to the actions of one side you have an obligation to do so for the other side. If only to demonstrate that you are equally opposed to excess on all sides.  I criticised your willful conflation of two very different right wing politics coupled with ur attempt to play down the excess of the Left as proof of the lazy minded outrage which is back in vogue.  Solutions are to be found in the dull and conventional center and not on any of the extremes of left or right.,7년 전,3,
