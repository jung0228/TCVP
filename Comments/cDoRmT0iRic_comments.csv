@jagerfromgsg945," @HDproductionnal    No they could. Commercially made armored vehicles have weaknesses as he said, doors, underneath (changing now bc of IED’s), and the top. The armor on the killdozer was 2 ft of concrete and steel, against a small town police force. Not to mention that it was 2 ft thick everywhere. The man got in it with no way out of it, thus making it a lot harder to deal with.",4년 전,49,

@cgi2002," @Stevieboy-ne9ll  there are few police forces with anti-tank weaponry. Most have nothing larger than a 7.62mm bolt action marksman rifle. What the police do have are phones, and the numbers for the military/national guard. They do have anti-tank weaponry, and generally will respond to a request from law enforcement. What they won't do is use AT weaponry unless lives are on the line, property damage is one thing but endangering lives changes the rules of engagement.",4년 전,5,

The taller the military's vehicle profile the more it suspectable to fire and no matter the weight of it once it's hit -  it's done. And if a 10 tonne truck would be rendered inoperable on a mountain road with other vehicles in a military column behind - it would be disastrous massacre.  I've seen a video from Yemen rebels where they hit a saudi military column with a heavy machine gun fire.  The vehicles were alright but on of the vehicle in the column was Georgian made ""military"" jeep  like this marauder.  And when it was riddled with 12.7 calibre fire the driver pushed his acceleration pedal to the floor. In 10 seconds the car has found  a ditch on the road and got it's SUSPENSION BROKEN IN HALF in the middle of nowhere under heavy fire. The other armoured vehicles in the column had to turn back all under fire and evacuate soldiers from such armoured car.",4년 전,0,

There's no worries at all imagine ur gonna be that one single person alive with all the fuel in the stations etc. Also....i dont think u'll be roaming and having trips around the world in this situation. Like first get a good fortified spot. Go to ur nearest gas station. 77% of the time U'll see a tanker fully loaded near the station. U know for the stations Resupply. Jus find d keys n get that baby home. Done! That tanker alone is enough for 2 months of gas. If that gets over. Head on to the next station. U dont need people to pump up the petroleum from the sea....whats there at every station is enough. Jus enough. 👍,4년 전,31,

@cgi2002," @anjaneyasreetrout2444  always amuses me people think that, and that it'd be a quick end. There would be days, weeks or even months of pure chaos before it reached apocolpase levels, during which time other people are the threat.  Sure it can shrug off an RPG or assault rifle rounds, but you need to get out of it to fuel it up. Can you shrug off an RPG or assault rifle rounds, can the fuel station, will the fuel station even have fuel, the military will likely have cut supplies long before this point. If you want fuel your likely to need to siphon it from cars/trucks which will also be blocking nearly every major road.  If you want to survive the apocoplase, you really need a private self sufficient island with cliffs on all sides, about a dozen engineering degree's, lots of experience with farming and fishing, and about 500 other things. Just think you'll need enough spare lightbulbs to last your entire lifetime, along with spare parts for your generators, the ability to refine fuel from plants (most oil based fuels have a limited lifespan of less than 5 years).

@Artyomthewalrus," @toyotacorolla4268  I mean, it wrecked the back bumper and the rear right tire. Imma bet that's going to be over ten grand to fix. Just buying a set of used logging truck tires costs around $10k, a single one of these tires, being super niche and probably custom made will likely be as expensive as that set of used logging truck tires. The bumper could probably be fixed to a workable point with very little money, but if you wanted to replace it so it's back to factory spec, again, custom part will be expensive.  It probably also damaged or destroyed the rear drive shaft, which again, expensive",5년 전(수정됨),69,

@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏ Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the   ‏ Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏    https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42    🌹  ‏https://youtu.be/YtQGJ1pS6Fs   🌷    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO/view    🌻    https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U    🌼    https://discoveritsbeauty.com/mobile/   🌺",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏ Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the   ‏ Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏    https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42    🌹  ‏https://youtu.be/YtQGJ1pS6Fs   🌷    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO/view    🌻    https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U    🌼    https://discoveritsbeauty.com/mobile/   🌺",4년 전(수정됨),3,

@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏ Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the   ‏ Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏    https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42    🌹  ‏https://youtu.be/YtQGJ1pS6Fs   🌷    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO/view    🌻    https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U    🌼    https://discoveritsbeauty.com/mobile/   🌺",4년 전,1,

It's truly incredible, but every test I've seen they can't really show anything because it's still classified or company secrets for the tech. It has a special intelligent suspension, and based on the audio from test drives, it is actually comfortable unlike its predecessor and can perform extreme climbs, decent high speed, etc... they've also done away with the laughably weak .50 cal machinegun and offered it with a 30mm autocannon similar to the main gun on attack helicopters.

@timbroski4487," @EyFmS  That's absolute bullshit. It isn't that much deadlier, and the overall exhaust is way cleaner. The volkswagen schandal only seperated the morons from the people that know anything about cars. Diesel has a higher energy density, and it emits a lot less CO2 compared to petrol, because of a cleaner burn. And with AdBlue the NOx and HC gasses are filtered out too, making it a much more environmental friendly car compared to petrol. Also the diesel engines are more efficient and therefore burn less fuel, this has to do with temperatures inside the engine and the way they inject fuel.",5년 전,5,

To call it an inconvenience and nothing more is a significant exaggeration.  Aside from the bumper and cosmetic damage(neither are important). That was definitely a mangled tire and probably the wheel as well. The worst thing that was glazed over is the destroyed rear differential and/or other significant drivetrain components. You definitely used the still functioning front axle to drag the dead rear axle out of the hole and limp away.

@LuxorVan,"The H3 was not even manufactured by AM General, it was manufactured by GM. The original hummer was not designed to be a heavy transport, but a small personnel carrier it was also modified by the Military to carry small weapons, radar systems and a few other things they came up with after production. It was a heavy duty vehicle to replace the famous Jeep it was never designed to be a system like the Marauder! I grew up in South Bend, Indiana I had a friend who's father was an employee of AM General for many years. The guy also nearly died at the plant due to another worker pressing a button while walking by as he stood inside a press that formed body panels.    He was hospitalized for quite some time, he was crushed down to 8"" while standing shoulder to shoulder in that press before someone heard him and hit the emergency stop button. The guy was given a desk job as a foreman due to his injuries after spending many months in the hospital and rehabilitation, but succumbed to alcoholism after many years from the depression and trauma he suffered. The original test track/proving grounds were located here: 41.6375821284, -86.2552825098 just north west across the long removed train tracks is where the original AM General was located before moving to Mckinley highway in Mishawaka, Indiana that location also has a test track.",5년 전,0,

It has lots of room for passengers and luggage. Comes with a full-size spare. It's AWD so good traction in wet or icy conditions. It's old-school well-built without any expensive composites or carbon fiber, so like fixing the odd ding or dent isn't going to cost a fortune. It doesn't have any fancy like electronic gadgets which could go wrong. The only thing I would want to add is a back-up camera and parking sensors for when my daughter drives it, but those can be added easily for relatively cheap. Lovely car.",5년 전,0,

Why do so many idiots find the first argument logical and compelling, while they find the second argument illogical and absurd? Aren't both arguments illogical and absurd?  Do you want to know why the US is broke and subject to an increasingly totalitarian surveillance regime?   It is because the American people allowed themselves to be duped by absurd arguments into endorsing the ""Global War on Terrorism"" - spending 8 trillion dollars and agreeing to give the government unlimited surveillance/policing powers in the name of ""fighting terrorism/extremism"" as characterized by the first argument above.",6개월 전,0,

But on the other hand, the European Union rejects oil from ASEAN. and the European Union knows the end of nickel containment will lead to an economic crisis, termination of employment in the EU countries. We can sell all of our natural resources to countries other than the European Union, the USA, the Aussie even though under the threat of an embargo. everyone who goes to school in any country in the world has the right to seek out the life he likes. and it has nothing to do with the issue of buying and selling of natural resources, technology between countries and related problems therein.

@d.bcooper2271,"Atheists claim that they are intellectually superior to religious people because they are willing to question their beliefs, whereas religious people are dogmatic and refuse to question their deepest beliefs and won't consider evidence that could potentially undermine those beliefs.  Well, have you ever heard an atheist say:  ""I wonder if constantly increasing individual freedom is a good thing.""  ""I was wrong about democracy being a viable system.""  ""Maybe the sexual revolution was a mistake.""  ""The evidence shows that equality of the sexes is destructive.""  ""Let's have a debate on if freedom of speech and religion is good for society.""  ""Could it be that women need fewer rights?""  I have never seen an atheist raise these questions or hold these positions up to serious scrutiny. Nor do they provide any evidence for their beliefs on these matters. They simply assert them and ridicule and mock anyone who disagrees with them..​ @fewsaid ",6개월 전,0,

@asovietreunion13,"​ @oculusdexterx6249  Dear sir, I rather think that you are the one who is mistaken here. By your continued replying, you simply prove the point of your opposition that you wish to continue the argument. I understand that you wish to salvage your pride, as being wrong is not fun, I most truly do. However, you simply must let this matter go, as it seems to be rather unhealthy for your psyche to continue to argue over the point of a joke on the internet. These things are simply not worth the trouble you put into them. A far more productive use of your time would be admitting your fault and attempting to reconcile with Mel Gibson. The joke was in fact recognized as funny by the vast majority present in this wondrous forum, while this does not make it necessarily ""right"" or ""wrong"", as both are such subjective terms, it would strongly suggest that you should back down from your tirade against Mel Gibson, as the hordes of this forum seem rather eager to mash your argument into the unholy ground. I exist as further proof of this fact, and would also like to make you aware, if you are not yet, of the extremely low amount of people liking your comments. In fact, the vast majority seem to give you a ""dislike"" as they scroll through the comments. I would not know, as I am not everyone, but can only speak for myself. I did not find your comment offensive, like many others did, but rather, amusing in its ignorance of simple facts. While I am of slightly higher intellect than the average poster here (most likely due to increased education) I would like to note that most others like me would not try as hard to educate you of your folly, and as such are most likely laughing at you without posting anything about it, as such behavior would appear trivial to them. In conclusion, You have most completely made a fool of yourself on the entire internet, as a post that requires this degree of effort on my part is highly unlikely to remain confined on this site alone.

@علي_التميمي-ي3ق4ج,"‏ Innate Nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes not does it qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. However, they “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material” World. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “original god” of Rome: Desire!.  ‏NOW we can see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to establish a purpose for his presence on earth. This is well recognized in the Attributes of Allah and what does He require from man. He does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other man, desire, or sex. He provides man with the proofs that He is the One who can redeem so that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. THIS Creator Has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him, the Ever Living. To Him is the Final Return where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not begot nor He is begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel as a Message to the Children of Israel: “For there is One God, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between God and men (the   ‏ Children of Israel), the man Christ Jesus) (I Timothy 2:5). A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “But in vain they do worship me!” (Mathew 15:9). A man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest, etc.. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need and God (Allah) is Self-Sufficient.                                                           *     ‏‎‏    https://www.fly-cards.com/en/cards/42    🌹  ‏https://youtu.be/YtQGJ1pS6Fs   🌷    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Q_WcvkBJDR3XJOqdGuIG3ri-lYA4JIO/view    🌻    https://youtu.be/Ibz2MrW8x6U    🌼    https://discoveritsbeauty.com/mobile/   🌺",4년 전,1,

@Fabrizio_Ruffo,"Its cool and all, but a pretty lame MRAP. It lacks belly armor. Despite it's height, it has nothing to funnel the explosion out from under it. Worse still it has tones of small air pockets and caverns under it, these pockets catch the airblast and focus it, tearing the belly to bits. You need a flat angled surface to deflect blasts. And that's assuming the flat side armor is even bullet proof. I don't buy for a seconds that this can stop an RPG by itself. Maybe with a cage, but certainly not by itself. I could be improved, but I don't think hummer has any new military contracts left. So I assume this program was a dead end.",7년 전,0,

@jazzyjaytee9961,"The civil version, which Mr. Hammond tested here, is 4wd. Military versions are available in 6x6 config, as well.   I can totally understand your question, though; as it seemed that after the explosive blast, the rear right tyre didn't spin when he tried to rock himself out of the crater.   I've been wondering myself - was it because the differential was being damaged, or was it because it doesn't have a fully locked rear diff? Anyway, seven pounds of explosive is a LOT. I wouldn't be too surprised if the blast broke something. Even a couple sheared-off bolts are enough, and the driveshaft cannot transfer power to the rear axle anymore, thus rendering it 2WD... meaning front-wheel drive, in this case. Vehicle like these are meant to protect its passengers from gunfire and smaller IED's, not traveling through a mine field. Just my theory, of course.",8년 전,9,

@DzinkyDzink,"We need an ""apocalypse-ready"" version of this.  1. MRAP - though the mines and IED's might be underepresented due to fact that people wouldn't be actively trying to kill you rather opportunistically. But ambush protection is a must: up to 7.62 rifle cartridge 360* protection and basic suspension and transmission protection. 2. Offroad capabilities - nobrainer since the roads are gonna be filled with ambushing marauders and abandoned vehicles. A bulldozer blade would also be nice so you could dozer your way through the latter in case of emergency escape. 3. Internal capacity for 4+ peeps supplied with food and water and gas for at least a week. 4. NBC protection - we don't want to get a zombie-virus or radiation plague our little post-apoc trip, aren't we? But then again: in such situation you'd probably need a bio-toilet too. 5. Repairability - any ordinary Joe carsmith should be able to fix most of the problems with whichever basic tools would be available. 6. Secure weapon locker - in case your country's laws allow you to own guns and you don't want your 6-year old kids get accidentally hurt.  7. Navigation system that would be able to work without the GPS. Or at least detailed maps of the surrounding area and a compass. 8. Alert systems? Something that could warn you in case your 6-year old kid falls asleep while on guard and some-one/thing tries to sneack upon you.  So all in all: we can go away with less military protection, but we require NBC protection, extended carrying capacity and a fuel-efficiency to some degree.",9년 전,0,

Took 20 RPG hits and anti aircraft guns to stop the vehicle in the end half of his head was missing. Video is on youtube if you want to look at it.

@NotQuiteLucid,"Eduardo Riv True I was thinking about my 2c comment after and, the Conquest vehicles are much better urban transports than the Marauder. Faster, easier to get in and out of, has that nifty IR cam setup and definitely could put your protection outfit in business with someone who wants to travel well protected in style.  But for the money you spend on the Conquest vehicles, an IR system and luxury interior could be added and it'd still cost less.  It's really the 100mph hauling ass that makes a difference.",11년 전,0,
@Quisqueyax,"well, for the people who can afford those vehicles, money is not the problem.  but we are in the same page because if marauder company decides to build a luxury marauder it will be the end of conquest.  but, price will be high because it will be a real badass truck.     my question is, who in this world need  a marauder protection level? to bring your kids to the school?  I think  that vehicles is  more suitable for troops than the regular jet set guy.   or the people who love that kind of toy.   ( like us )  US$300,000 just for pure fun.  cool.  there is a reason why marauder is build in South Africa....",11년 전,1,

@manictiger,"TheKanethegreat V-shape allows for less armor to provide the same protection.  When you field thousands of these, fuel use becomes a big issue.  Every pound matters.  Also, it seems NATO is rather picky.  For some reason the MRAP weighs 14-18 tons, which means the 10-ton Marauder probably doesn't cut it for them for whatever reason.  Probably has to do with the fact that some IEDs use EFPs (Explosively Formed Penetrator), which are significantly better at piercing armor than just raw explosives.",11년 전,0,
@71hemi440cuda,manictiger The military uses the mrap and the matv. The matv is a lighter faster vehicle due to components made from fiberglass. The marauder is an unarmored version of what looks like a 4x4 slightly modified mrap. And yes the v shaped hull is as simple as a bent piece of metal welded on the bottom,11년 전,0,

Not just because of the weight either, but the wheels would be hanging off the sides of the flatbed because it's far wider than the tow truck. Also, notice the cables that go under the tow truck rather than above it.  When he ran over the two cars, did you notice the two cars were parked very very close together. As if they were setup for the kill.  Don't let these facts ruin the fun of the video though. I still give the video a '12' on a scale of 1 to 10.

@Namaste1001,"THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL vs THE PRIVILEGE TO DRIVE  The Law is clear, traveling on the public highways is a right devoid of any statuary obligations, need of licenses or permits, or any other form of permission from the state.  “The navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence,*and the carrying places between the same, shall be common highways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory as to the citizens of the United States, and those of any other States that may be admitted into the confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor.” [Northwest Ordinances, Article 4]  “Highways are for the use of the traveling public, and all have the right to use them in a reasonable and proper manner; the use thereof is an inalienable right of every citizen.” Escobedo vs. State 35 C2d 870 in 8 Cal Jur 3d p.27  “The right of a citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, by horse-drawn carriage, wagon, or automobile is not a mere privilege which may be permitted or prohibited at will, but a common right which he has under his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Slusher vs. Safety Coach Transit Co., 229 Ky 731, 17 SW2d 1012, and affirmed by the Supreme Court in Thompson vs. Smith 154 S.E. 579.  “Users of the highway for transportation of persons and property for hire may be subjected to special regulations not applicable to those using the highway for public purposes.” Richmond Baking Co. vs. Department of Treasury 18 N.E. 2d 788.  “Constitutionally protected liberty includes…the right to travel…” 13 Cal Jur 3d p.416  In California, a license is defined as “A permit, granted by an appropriate governmental body, generally for a consideration, to a person or firm, or corporation to pursue some occupation or to carry on some business subject to regulation under the police power.” Rosenblatt vs. California 158 P2d 199, 300.  “Operation of a motor vehicle upon public streets and highways is not a mere privilege but is a RIGHT or liberty protected by the guarantees of Federal and State constitutions.” Adams vs. City of Pocatello 416 P2d 46  “One who DRIVES an automobile is an operator within meaning of the Motor Vehicle Act.” Pontius vs. McClean 113 CA 452  “The word ‘operator’ shall not include any person who solely transports his own property and who transports no persons or property for hire or compensation.” Statutes at Large California Chapter 412 p.833  “A citizen may have the right, under the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, to travel and transport his property upon the public highways by auto vehicle, but he has no right to make the highways his place of business by using them as a common carrier for hire; such use being a privilege which may be granted or withheld by the state in its discretion, without violating the due process or equal protection clauses.” In Re Graham 93 Cal App 88.  “The license charge imposed by the motor vehicle act is an excise or privilege tax, established for the purpose of revenue in order to provide a fund for roads while under the dominion of the state authorities, it is not a tax imposed as a rental charge or a toll charge for the use of the highways owned and controlled by the state.” – PG&E vs. State Treasurer, 168 Cal 420.  “The same principles of law are applicable to them as to other vehicles upon the highway. It is therefore, the adaptation and use, rather than the form or kind of conveyance that concerns the courts.” Indiana Springs Co. vs. Brown, 74 N.E. 615. “The automobile is not inherently dangerous.” Moore vs. Roddie, 180 P. 879, Blair vs. Broadmore 93 S.E. 632.  “The use of the automobile as a necessary adjunct to the earning of a livlihood in modern life requires us in the interest of realism to conclude that the RIGHT to use an automobile on the public highways partakes of the nature of a liberty within the meaning of the Constitutional guarantees…Berberian vs. Lussier (1958) 139 A2d 869, 872  “Truck driver’s failure to be licensed as chauffeur does not establish him or his employer as negligent as a matter of law with respect to accident in which driver was involved, in absence of any evidence that lack of such license had any casual or causal connection with the accident…Bryant vs. Tulare Ice Co. (1954) 125 CA 2d 566  “The RIGHT of the citizen to drive on the public street with freedom from police interference, unless he is engaged in suspicious conduct associated in some manner with criminality is a FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT which must be protected by the courts.” People vs. Horton 14 Cal. App. 3rd 667 (1971)  “The RIGHT to TRAVEL on the public highways is a constitutional RIGHT.” Teche Lines vs. Danforth, Miss. 12 So 2d 784, 787.  “The right to travel is part of the ‘liberty’ that a citizen cannot be deprived of without due process of law.” Kent vs. Dulles 357 U.S. 116, U.S. vs. Laub 385 U.S. 475  “A citizen may have the right, under the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, to travel and transport his property upon the public highways by auto vehicle, but he has NO right to make the highways his place of business by using them as a common carrier for hire; such use being a privilege which may be granted or withheld by the state in its discretion, without violating the due process or equal protection clauses.” In Re Graham 93 Cal App 88.  “CVC 17459. The acceptance by a resident of this state of a certificate of ownership or a certificate of registration of any motor vehicle or any renewal thereof, issued under the provisions of this code, shall constitute the CONSENT by the person that service of summons may be made upon him within or without this state, whether or not he is then a resident of this state, in any action brought in the courts of this state upon a cause of action arising in this state out of the ownership or operation of the vehicle.” California Vehicle Code  “CVC 17460. The acceptance or retention by a resident of this state of a driver’s license issued pursuant to the provisions of this code, shall constitute the CONSENT of the person that service of summons may be made upon him within or without this state, whether or not he is then a resident of this state, in any action brought in the courts of this state upon a cause of action arising in this state out of his operation of a motor vehicle anywhere within this state.” California Vehicle Code “When a person applies for and accepts a license or permit, he in effect knows the limitations of it, and takes it at the risk and consequences of transgression.” Shevlin-Carpenter Co. vs. Minnesota, 218 U.S. 57.  http://humanityawakens.wordpress.com/category/law-sovereignty﻿",11년 전,6,

@Namaste1001,"As the case law clearly establishes, traveling on the public highways in your private property is a right, not a privilege. Rights cannot be usurped by legislation, only voluntarily surrendered. Which is what the act of registering your car does - gives the gov legal title to your property.  Your right to your own property cannot be taken only surrendered, they cannot force you to register, that would be a crime on their part. They can however make it appear as though you will get into trouble if you don't, which is actually fraud as they are trying to coerce your compliance.",11년 전,0,

@TheBigOne0305,"True armored vehicles (like the M1117 that is slowly replacing the Humvee) feature angular sides, which can direct the force of projectiles or blast waves up or down, reducing the amount of force put directly on the armor. This is especially important with warheads or IEDs using a shaped charge where the molten copper stream would otherwise easily burn through the armor. This ""car"" shouldn't even be compared to the Humvee/Hummer -no matter the version- one is an APC, the other just a heavy SUV.",12년 전,0,
@TheBigOne0305,"The Humvee was not designed as an armored vehicle, it protects against small arms fire at best. Additional armor was added after they were deployed and the deficiencies became apparent, but this put extra stress on the suspension and caused new problems. Those mods focused mainly on adding protection to the sides, IEDs and mines that direct the blast from below were still very much deadly. Shaped charges are also still a thread to the uparmored versions, possibly due to the straight sides.",12년 전,0,

Top Gear's insane popularity is more than worth the cost of one of those...and it wasn't even that badly damaged, just the axle and rear suspension. You could probably fix it for cheap. It costs companies millions for a short superbowl ad seen by a lot of people. Well, a free marauder is far less than that and this 8-minute segment made it look pretty amazing.

@fbmderek,"well the biggest fears right now for the military regarding vehicles, is IED's which normally activate when a tire/track goes over it and explode in that area. unless remotely activated, they usually never explode dead center. but, most armored vehicles are the most heavily armored where crew would be, so the center may actually be the hardest to damage. transfer case may become ineffective but the body/chassis would be very much salvageable.

@fbmderek,"regardless, if you put the c4 at the rear of the hummer, you get the same results for the most part, MAYBE the engine would have been spared. you still have vital components at the rear such as axle and differential, transfer case im sure was close enough to get hit. the fact the the hummer was in pieces and the marauder drove away with a flat, goes to show it really wouldnt matter much where the c4 was placed",13년 전,0,
