@xZeroOffical,"Saying that this will make internet faster is exaggeration. This will only help a little by speeding up loading of the websites when you visit them for the first time. Reason being that the websites load a ton of resources in background which might or may not come from the same hostname.  Faster DNS, faster these hostnames resolve to actual IP addresses and faster your browser can start loading them. But your device also has its own DNS cache that will kick in after 1st resolving of the each unique hostname. Cache response is usually below 1ms which is faster than ANY DNS - so there's that too.",1년 전(수정됨),3,

(assuming we've been running even in past runs for instance)  All that said, and I'm not usually surprised after 1/2 century of computin but I threw it into my modem and the house I'm staying at they pay for 50 down and a speed test would hit mid 40's but avg pretty much 35.  Now I can't test under 47 on anything anyway tried.  But the real plus is it really is ""snappier"" as in I cannot make that spinner appear loading YT vids with ads/no and that just did not happen hour ago.  I'm happy.

@skylarmorehead9883,"This is SUCH crap, and in more ways than one, for starters just because in windows internet settings your link speed is 2.5 gig and i highly doubt your link speed says 5 gig because of some tin foil  but even if this were true that DOES NOT mean your ACTUALLY getting that, your limited by your ISP, no matter if you use a entire roll of foil on your make shift antennas. PLUS your wifi connection will NEVER be able to even come close to your advertised an d paid for speeds. only a wired connection meaning your ethernet connection will be the pnly connection  able to hit the advertised speeds through your isp especially at 2.5 Gbps. and i know this because its happening to me also. i am paying for ""gigabit plus"" through my isp which is advertised at 1.2Gbps but i have a beefy modem and router that has 2.5Gbps Lan ports and am running a Cat 6 e cable from the 2.5 port to my desktop and on windows my link speed is 2500MBPS or 2.5Gbps but when i run network benchmarks my speed is hitting at 1.4Gbps which is 20% more speed than what i pay for but only because of quality hardware and quality cat 6 cable along with knowing how to tweak the settings of my network adapters in my internet settings. still my wifi is only able to hit 900Mbps to 1.1Gbps and thats with my devises that support wifi 6 as well. So please do yourself a favor and read up on how to do a simple internet benchmark on google and get your REAL Speeds through that. antennas will never ever make you gain more speed EVER antennas increase the power of the wifi radio waves making it reach out further than what it maybe was but your absolutley not hitting 5gig becasue of some aluminum foil and your wifi being connectd through a PCIE connection this is a flat out lie",2년 전,0,
@user619tlsdca5,"Well, I never chopped a cherry tree down and Ive checked W10 OC readings from the IP and connection as it states Im using 5gbs to make sure before stating this.

We here to help each other out, and Im not going to the dark side of any comments, but I understand your view but, to say its alie is somewhat off and amusing is best reactions. Besides, thru many decades of wi fi use, the set up now is much faster as a flash of the loading of pages. Stay safe is important to me for others because you likely save someone later to do so.

@aber6441,"No sense at all and people are mixing loading known pages with download speed. This only applies for pages which are not cached in DNS servers, means rare used sites by anybody and the difference will only be few milliseconds in speed if that page was already visited by somebody else already in the cloud flare dns. However even if your default dns doesn’t have the page and need to bring it to you, you will not notice the difference at all in speed. But when it come to internet speed which is download and that’s what interest people here the most. There are no difference, because if you pay for a speed of 30mb per seconds from your internet provider, all your download will be limited at that speed because simply that what your internet cable set to max. Even if the government by you a private dns and set it next to your door this won’t make a difference since the cable connected to that dns have a limit of 30mb and your download  will always be the same.

I went and checked my modems settings and wow, they upgraded the firmware.. it don't even look the same.. and now, I can't change the DNS there.. hard coded by their system..

@collegepennsylvania837,"“He was despised and rejected— a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief. We turned our backs on him and looked the other way. He was despised, and we did not care. Yet it was our weaknesses he carried; it was our sorrows that weighed him down. And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God, a punishment for his own sins! But he was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins. He was beaten so we could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed. All of us, like sheep, have strayed away. We have left God’s paths to follow our own. Yet the Lord laid on him the sins of us all. He was oppressed and treated harshly, yet he never said a word. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter. And as a sheep is silent before the shearers, he did not open his mouth. Unjustly condemned, he was led away. No one cared that he died without descendants, that his life was cut short in midstream. But he was struck down for the rebellion of my people. He had done no wrong and had never deceived anyone. But he was buried like a criminal; he was put in a rich man’s grave. But it was the Lord’s good plan to crush him and cause him grief. Yet when his life is made an offering for sin, he will have many descendants. He will enjoy a long life, and the Lord’s good plan will prosper in his hands. When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish, he will be satisfied. And because of his experience, my righteous servant will make it possible for many to be counted righteous, for he will bear all their sins. I will give him the honors of a victorious soldier, because he exposed himself to death. He was counted among the rebels. He bore the sins of many and interceded for rebels.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭53:3-12‬ ‭NLT‬‬ ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life."" John 3:16 God loves you so much and showed that by sending His Son to die for us so that we may inherit eternal life. We deserve hell but He gave us heaven through faith in Jesus. He took the punishment we deserved and by putting our faith in Him we can be saved. The Key To Eternal Life: https://youtu.be/uZdv-TtiMkg For evidence for Christianity check out https://youtube.com/user/drcraigvideos and https://youtube.com/c/CrossExamined because if Jesus really rose from the dead it is the most important fact ever!

They only Extend the range of the incoming signal by simply amplifying it. Common sense is all you need to determine that what I am saying is true. ie. your incoming signal is 4Mbs. What makes you think you can speed this up? There is no equipment out there that can speed up your internet connection. If your provider is sending it at 4Mbs, how will you speed this up.That's right, only your internet service provider has the capability to speed up your connection.

DNS looks up the IP address for a domain name and then returns it to you, and that is the end of the transaction. Your computer then uses it's normal resources and routing paths to reach the domain server. DNS does not carry or route your connection, data, or viewing. A quick DNS service will bring up the page fast, and perhaps this plays into having you 'think' the connection is faster, but it is not. 1.1.1.1 will play no part in the session performance, link speed, or in subdomains of the primary domain.",4년 전,27,

@npgoalkeeper,"Its not misinformation, just misleading. Technically, this is a way to speed up load times under certain conditions. Also I really hope whatever youre using doesnt keep websites cached indefinitely",4년 전,0,
@aschecky1," @npgoalkeeper  No not misleading, just plain not true. If you are on any modern computer OS you have a local DNS cache. It is just the way things work! On a Windows machine, you can check/flush your local DNS cache with the ipconfig command, on Linux, it is the nscd service. Even going out on the wire a typical bind on a DNS server would cache to prevent any further trips down the line. If the ttl on a domain is set so low (extremely rare) it is possible to effectively eliminate the cache on the DNS server with a need to do the full lookup. Since the DNS server, your ISP uses will be fewer hops from you than an external server, your ISP DNS server is faster to reach. Once you get the resolution, bind on the DNS server will cache the information. If we assumed you have flushed your local cache, the entire trip would be to your  DNS server for its cached information and back to you (since bind cached it on the DNS server).   If we assume that the other DNS is faster for the complete lookup (debatable) then it is only faster the first time we use that domain name in a ""session"". After that by definition, it must be slower since the ""other"" DNS will take longer to get reach and reply than your ISP DNS (or your local DNS cache). Most DNS servers are not processor bound but I/O bound based on the network pipe. If you were talking 15-20 years ago then it may have some validity as the lookup from the server may have had to go through some slower connections to get to TLD.",4년 전,0,
@npgoalkeeper," @aschecky1  by “under certain conditions” I meant your 2nd point. Your 2nd point is assuming that the DNS servers offered by your ISP can return a result faster than the DNS servers offered by cloudflare (even with the additional hops), and that your ISP has both their routers and their dns servers at the same site where your connection is terminated, does it not?",4년 전,0,
@aschecky1," @npgoalkeeper  Assuming you flushed your local cache and you have recently asked for a DNS resolution the DNS server will have cached the result using bind. At that point, the only trip is to the DNS server (for it to read its cache) and back to you. Unless your ISP is doing something strange, the connections within their network to their DNS will almost always be faster than the trip outside the ISP network to the public DNS and then back from the public DNS into the ISP network back to you. In more technical terms you (end-user) are considered the UE and you do a Req from UE, the DNS server will then do a Res to UE, that request-response flow will in almost all instances be faster within the network rather than traversing the ISP external gateways. Is that difference large, I would hope not. In fact, you would hope the DNS resolution will be the fastest component of accessing a website/downloading/uploading. Assuming that the full name resolution on the public DNS server is faster, it is in actuality only a small component and is only pertinent on the very first request for a specific domain (since caching will negate any future gains on that domain).",4년 전,0,
@aschecky1,I did not even touch on the issues of using a public DNS server and possible DNS amp attacks where you know most major ISP have a mechanism in place to detect these type of attacks and make it easier to control since that would reject any requests that originate off-net either in the server or on the external firewall.,4년 전,0,
@npgoalkeeper," @aschecky1  you’re still making the assumption that the dns servers offered by your ISP is going to be able to return a result faster than cloudflares even with the additional hops regardless if their dms servers have the result cached or not. I also fail to see why dns queries from other dns servers can’t be cached by your ISP, especially with the existence of DNSSEC and friends  Even if dns is the fastest portion of a connection, a gain is still a gain and the title still holds true.  As for dns application attacks, I fail to see how denying dns queries from ips outside of your isps service area would mitigate attacks (at least, that’s what I think you’re trying to say).",4년 전,0,
@aschecky1," @npgoalkeeper  Put simply assuming that the local cache is flushed, public DNS server and local DNS server will process the request in the same time on second request for the same domain. The only difference is network speed.  Given the public server is faster when searching from a TLD the first time, that component is minimum compared to the actual data download. Thus you would never see a huge increase in performance.   I do not want to go into details, but servicing DNS requests off the public network can be an issue. If you don't believe me read all the RFPs on this (you may even run across my name).",4년 전,0,

@mr.quisizyx7545,"The quadruple one app doesn't seem to work with every website.  I didn't check it on all my devices but the one I used the most which is the fastest and has the most memory didn't work with YouTube.  It seemed to work with most websites I commonly visit but when starting the YouTube app it claimed I had no internet connection.  I tried various things but the only thing seemed to work was removing the quadruple one app.  Like other commenters here I didn't notice any particular increase in speed but was willing to accept it as long as it provided VPN protection.  Since it didn't apparently work with YouTube I made the assumption there would be other sites which would not be able to connect so removed it and went with a previously used commercial VPN.  The only reason I tried it in the first place was because it was free.  No service charge for VPN privacy.  BTW, I would recommend Mullvad for a VPN.  They have a flat rate which for the US is $5.50 per month at the time of this posting.  They were first established in 2002 and their price has not changed since then.  This rate is the same whether you pay by the month or by the year.  They have a high inventory of servers established in a large quantity of countries and you have the ability to pick which country you wish to select a server.  The main reason for this recommendation is for privacy, confidentiality, and legal reasons.  Since they are based in Sweden the way the laws are configured there is no legal way the government or any other entity can legally request data for any particular customer or client.  Such a request would be hard to implement even if attempted because Mullvad does not keep any specific, pertinent, personal data of any client.  All data is erased and not stored except for data required to execute the VPN process which in nearly every case is temporary data therefore not kept.  The only caveat is if you set up a subscription to automatically pay for the service.  This would tie your identity to a specific account.  If you do not do a subscription then Mullvad has no information tied to any client.  Not name, email address, location, or any type of personal information of any kind.  The only way they identify clients is by the account number you are given at the time of setup.  For absolute privacy Mullvad is the only VPN having all these characteristics and attributes I found during my initial research of VPNs.  Not feeling the need I haven't repeated the research and it has been a few years ago so there may be others who are equivalent.  Unless they are established in a country with similar laws with focus on personal confidentiality and privacy, even though the VPN may advocate strongly for privacy, the country's laws may not protect the data as securely as a country with laws similar to Sweden.    After the quadruple one issue was encountered I did some research and discovered Cloudflare was the source of the quadruple one app.  According to their website they're involved in Internet services and sell a VPN service as well as other security and privacy products.  Given their experience I'm somewhat surprised the quadruple one app had issues with YouTube.  JFYI.  Be well. Take care. Be conscientious and avoid the virus.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

If I keep the place in my movie the movie doesn't work till I start from scratch. It's a 7 minute process that's ruining the movie I like. Has anyone had this happen? Not sure why it's only the tab A I have all the apps on my phone and another tiny tablet that's hard to watch movies from otherwise I'd just watch on that and forget the tab A. Someone told me to look up error report but I'm not even sure I get them. My movie just stops no wifi available and I turn my wifi on and off and it starts working, except when watching with a VPN.

@dsbennett,"Search the internet for ""CenturyLink won't stop billing me"". We cancelled last October and they still bill me. I refuse to pay ever. A relative quit several YEARS ago and is still being billed even after many phone calls and registered letters. I just filed a complaint with the state attorney general. CenturyLink is set up so you can never cancel the service. The agents seem to be motivated to ignore requests to cancel, so you can call them 100 times and your account won't be turned off. There's even stories of people who never even signed up for the service and started getting bills! If you tried to get internet and they don't show up, thank God for that blessing! If you are a customer, RECORD ALL PHONE CALLS with them because that is the only evidence you will have. When you call to cancel, they do not send a verification email. They will provide a verification number, but if you call back, they will claim there's no such number in their system.",4년 전,0,

@saabsly1,"hum.... Since you seem to know what you are talking about, i'd like you to explain this...  I did a ping on my actual DNS, which is my own router (the first device that is connected to my PC, and I am using a 5g Wi-Fi connexion). The response time was 64ms. Then I pinged 1.1.1.1 (and or one.one.one.one to make an actual dns resolution request). The response time was 54ms... How the hell can the response be quicker when the request has to pass by my router, then my ISP's router, then whatever way it needs to reach 1.1.1.1 ??? Remember this is a ping, not even a resolution request. I'm lost!  My guest is that something must be put in memory somehow to be able to respond quicker than my first device it has to go throught. Wich is something that is worrying to say the least. Unless, now that I am thinking about it, 192.168.0.1 is also the adress used for the ethernet connection, so it must be a translated adress within my router because it is impossible to have the same IP adress for two separate physical access point (all the wired ports, and all the wireless connection). Still find it very strange that going outthere on the net is faster than going trhough my own router, since it has to go through it to begin with anyway...  Even a 127.0.0.1 (loopback test reserved adress is even slower, which is the ""stadard"" 128ms). But that one being a reserved adress for the purpose of testing might be hard coded for a 128ms response just as a stable comparison base.",4년 전,0,

@animeisdope5264, @nateh75  I played on my console and it didn’t go too well but I think that’s cuz I have 30+ devices that use internet. I just fixed my ps4 pro today tho by using a small trick that does kinda help. My ps4 went from lagging out and leaving the party and game every 10 mins to working smoothly for a few hours then I got off the game. Basically just turn off the ps4 then once it’s settled down press the power button until you hear it beep the 2nd time. Once it’s done I believe it should turn on by itself but if it doesn’t just turn it on again  and your done. If that doesn’t work I don’t know what else to tell you but good luck.,4년 전,0,

The exact steps vary depending on what device you're using.   The important thing to note here is that this video is misleading in a way. DNS (Domain Name System) is the Internet's equivalent of a phone book in that it maps hostnames (like google.com) to IP addresses (216.58.195.78). It is impossible for a DNS server to make your internet connection faster. A fast DNS server will allow your computer to lookup IP addresses faster, but it cannot make your connection faster. That is simply not the point of DNS.",5년 전,0,

Without getting too technical, computers use DNS servers (Domain Name System) in order to know where a website server is. DNS is the Internet's equivalent of a phone book in that it maps host names (like google.com) to an IP address. Using a fast DNS server will make the DNS look up query faster, but it cannot make your Internet connection any faster. Most home Internet connections are asymmetrical, meaning that the download speed is almost always faster than the upload speed. The reasoning is that most people download more than they upload.

@elfi9409,"Bloody Cloudfare. Why are you all promoting Cloudflare> See here:-   https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-leaks/  You are at risk of leaking DNS requests to Cloudflare, no matter which Mullvad setup you have. To prevent this, open Firefox Options > General > Network settings > Settings, then deselect “Enable DNS over HTTPS.”  You can then visit am.i.mullvad.net to easily check whether or not you’re leaking information. Why are DNS servers important from a privacy perspective?  A DNS (Domain Name System) server is the first point of contact that your browser makes when you try to access information over the Internet. This is the case for every URL you visit, every file you download, and every image that loads on a website, including ads.  Since your browser contacts the DNS server for each and every new domain name request, the DNS server will know which pages you are visiting and what resources you are looking at. Therefore, you are constantly leaking information about what you are doing and when to your DNS server provider, which is usually your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or a big company like Google.  Using Mullvad’s DNS server ensures that you don't leak information to a DNS server provider that may be logging which sites you are visiting. And if, for some reason, your traffic ends up on the public internet, it goes to our non-logging DNS server.  It's worth noting that all our VPN servers hijack calls to our public DNS server and that the DNS requests are processed on a local non-logging DNS server installed on that VPN server. This is done to process requests faster and to leak less information to the internet.",5년 전,0,

@Formedras,"Eh, people just love to rag on Linus for every reason they can think of. Some are having fun with him and his quirks (e.g. ""Linus Drop Tips"" or ""sandals with socks"" comments), some are asshole trolls just spewing out bullshit. As for this video, the topic is about how a faster DNS server can speed up the beginning of loading webpages. Which is absolutely true. Faster DNS queries lead to earlier webserver queries, even if it is less than half a second per query. Although the title is clickbait, there's no actual claim that your download speeds will increase, because they won't. Once you're connected to the server, DNS does nothing. Personally, I don't use third-party DNS servers for speed. I just don't trust my ISP at all (Cox Communications), and I trust free Wifi hotspots even less. Obviously, they can still track me if they have the systems in place for reverse DNS lookup, but maybe they're not bothering with that because hey extra work for minimal benefit. (Just a side note: Although I have used Cloudflare DNS in the past, as well as OpenDNS and Google Public DNS, my current preferred service is Quad9. That may change in the future, or I may just rotate services on a regular basis.)",5년 전,2,

@Dr.Mohandes,"it shouldn't change and unlike what a lot of people say 1.1.1.1 is not always faster it depends on your connection, for example i have 50ms ping with 8.8.8.8 but 100ms with 1.1.1.1 now if i change my dns from 8.8.8.8 to 1.1.1.1, i have to wait 50 milliseconds more when i'm opening up webpages (if it's cached)  this method is a scam only change your dns if you hate your current dns provider's privacy policy or it blocks some website or it's located so much far away that your ping to it sucks so bad but this is not the case for most people 8.8.8.8 is already good enough and ISP's dns are most of the time is the fastest even though they're not recommended because they may not be as reliable as a google or cloudflare and might block some content If you still wanna change your dns server, try using a dns benchmark tool like ""dnsbench"" or ""dnsjumper"" and see which one is fastest for you",5년 전(수정됨),29,

@marc_copywriter,"Thank you Linus - I'm a big fan! My Internet speed when from 130 mb/s to close to 400 mb/s depending on the server it's pinging with to test it! I changed the DNS, then restarted my IPHONE 11 and now it is 457 mb/s download and 300 mb/s upload! More than 4 times what it was before. After all, I did pay for 1 GB internet, now I'm getting more of what I paid for. Yes - I am sharing with 4 other tenants at my apartment complex. Except they don't know this trick! Buwahaha. Luckily, I'm a bit of a self-taught computer/tech geek myself because I had some trouble shooting to do because it didn't work at first on my laptop. I actually lost my internet connection by just changing the DNS alone. Follow the steps below to flush your DNS before using the 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1  I hope this will help others!  Do an internet speed test first. I used speedtest.net website because -- the Windows app sucks.  Press windows key and type ""Command Prompt"" -> You will need to right click on it and run as administrator. ipconfig/flushdns --> Press enter ipconfig/registerdns --> Press enter ipconfig/release --> Press enter ipconfig/renew -->  Press enter Type netsh winsock reset and press enter.  Restart computer Add new DNS numbers   1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 Run an internet speed test after to compare results.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@AndyTomlins,"Eyes dont send images, only basic scans of the edges of objects at the limit of nerve impulses, the brain processes the differences between each impulse into a moving image. The recognition system of objects is much slower though which is where the idea of having a much lower visual fps came from and uses other systems like blinking and rapid eye movements to detect new objects.. The image you build with these systems remain in current memory for 1/15th of a second which is why film is at 30fps as at whatever synchronisation you have between your brains information and the film it will always be a new frame before you forget the last. You will detect a difference in the fluidity of the image of faster monitors but they will be higher than our senses have evolved to detect new objects.",5년 전,0,

@300fans,"​ @cameronlotter1392  Think of it like a river:   Data speed is how WIDE the river is (how much data can fit at the same time).   Latency is how FAST the river is flowing (how long it takes the data to get there).   Multiplayer gaming is more dependent on latency than data speed, as everyone needs to be seeing the same thing at the same time. This will never be truly instant, but you want to get it as close to instant as you can.   This trick improves latency. It does not improve data speed. It will improve web browsing and gaming.

@brianrawks123,"ok. so i tried this and TL;DR, it worked like a dream   to the degree that it worked, let me set the stage for you.   my ethernet cable broke and i found out a jerryrigging way to get ethernet. and no. i dont have a wifi adapter on my pc. and the USB wifi stick i have will cause immense problems for my pc.   my method is to trick the computer to think its running an ethernet connection when its really running off of wifi, to do this, i have a laptop i regularly use that i connect my pc to and [ctrl panel > network and internet > network connections] my way into it and i turn on sharing on my wifi.   so it works really well especially as a replacement for a wifi stick (you can use this method on litteraly any device that doesnt have wifi) and for a while it runs pretty well. but my pc always runs differently everyday so some days its slow.    and recently its been ABYSMAL im talking downloading PUBG and GTA taking DAYS like 20 something + days!   i tried this and i've already downloaded the games i deleted for storage temporarily in a matter of hours. (its good for streaming but dodgy for downloading)   so thats my experience with it and i hope it helps anyone in 2019+",6년 전,0,

@danielhall6805,"This is absolute bullshit. I've been watching your videos for months but now I think its game over. Using a faster DNS resolver will NOT double, triple or what every increase your internet speed. It will just tell your computer where the server is a little bit quicker (milliseconds!!!!!) and once you've saves maybe 10milliseconds you're ""internet connection"" is then running at.... have a guess.... the EXACT same speed as before. Who the frick goes to a new website every time they open a website? This video is incredibly misleading.  Linus, stick to what you know, because this isnt it.

We're one of the first countries in the world to have internet, and yet, compared to the rest of the developed, first-world countries, we're lagging behind in terms of fiber deployment - it is embarrassing!

@grahampitt8882,"This video is lame.  Basically noones internet experience is being bottlenecked by the name lookups and Linus must know this. Theres a little latency looking up names on first use, but it's generally a trivial overhead and since most users will use the same web services repeatedly a local cache is quickly built.  Theres no timings of his ISP provided DNS, Google DNS and 1.1.1.1 to compare. All that is offered is it 'feels faster, tabs open quicker'. All subjective stuff.  Theres also no explanation why thIS DNS provider is holding on to your lookup records in memory for 24 hours. Why hold on to them at all?  No explanation is provided how some ISPs will intercept, log and even hijack DNS requests sent to 3rd party DNS servers. If this is something that your ISP does then you may find that your connection is slower because of that indirection.  Basically, this video is a bit poor.

The worst part is gaming is like my biggest hobby and the only thing even close to being possible to letting me play games is a shitty unlimited hotspot that gives, idk 2mbps Speed. I can’t even fucking update shit on my own. I have to go down to my cousins house with my entire gaming rig in a laundry basket just to get a game updated. I moved from Germany to fucking Texas.

@Dr.Kryptanical,Thankyou recently I had discovered because SKY's unlimited fibre had been retract those of us on it were either upgraded to fibre max o(a new faster package) or downgraded depending on availability in the area (this is because they need to upgrade the copper wiring in the landlines to support the faster speeds) sadly it wasn't available in our area yet as they are still upgrading outside the village and have a few miles before they reach here which will take months... this basically means i'm stuck with the basic package which is supposedly 11mb/s average download...   but I found for some reason despite a decent signal it seemed to be even less and I couldn't figure out why until now when you help me find I was on auto DNS which had put me on a slow one hence why despite having a 4k capable screen and hardware I couldn't even buffer anything above 1080p this has now changed and I watched this video buffer well ahead in 4k even after skipping ahead in the video beyond the buffer so it has made a well noticeable difference...   and I do prefer my privacy the sercurity is good I had enough with the phone survey army back when our phone-lines were mean't to be private... we were getting calls about surveys 2-8 times a day... anyways gotta go now i've suddenly got hiccups!,6년 전,0,

It's possible DNS server 1.1.1.1 had a different IP address on record for the site speedtest was running against. If that site was further away from you (or slower hops for the route it took from your PC to the site) then it may not show the best performance for your connection.,6년 전,0,

@daveburrows9876,"Until Saturday, I'd been using Hughes Satellite because that's all that was available in my area.   They give you 50 GB data during which time I was getting 20-30 mbps, then throttle you down to a max of 3 mbps.  Even using the web frugally, I used the 50 GB in a week or 8 days.  When throttled, I never got higher than 1, and most of the time, I got 0.3-0.4 mbps.  Fed up, I called the broadband company that does come close to me, and they decided to bring it to me.  Theirs is just over half the price I'm paying at Hughes and it's unlimited.  My speed test while the installer was here was 76 mbps, and I was happy.  I tried the DNS tip you gave with the Hughes router, but got zero increase in speed.  I tried it with my cable connection, and am now getting between 216 and 246 mbps.

Is it really that hard to wrap your head around this? Apparently, even basic human kindness is shameful to some people now.

@martinbrakl3410,"Congratulation you shortened time to moment when webpage become downloading but the bandwidth of your connection to the Internet is still the same. So you saved maybe 1 second. But doubling your bandwidth may save you hours. But in that case you must pay more to your ISP and buy correct router not that ""free"" router which is able to handle only 50% of your bought bandwidth.  E.g. ISP guarantee you 100 mbps Internet connection for 20€ per month and give you router which's bottleneck is 80mbps wide. So you get mad, go to the shop and buy 300mbps router and then you figure out that your download bandwidth increased on amazing 250mbps and upload on nice 160mbps.  So if you wanna ""faster"" internet, buy the fastest router and the cheapest ISP fibre optic connection. Maybe you will have luck on stupid ISP which is slowing down connection by providing shitty routers to his customers.",7년 전,0,

@pedrorubiomoreno9119,"Hmmm... sorry to disagree, but this won't make your internet connection any faster. If anything, it would make browsing faster. And not really that much faster as DNS resolutions are stored in a cache, so your system already knows which address some of the URLs you enter point to. So to put it simply, you will only save a little bit of time (and just a few milliseconds) for every time you need to resolve a new URL address. And that's it. Not only that, there are a lot of security concerns regarding DNS and I laugh about the ""privacy first"" premise of cloudflare when cloudflare is anything but privacy by itself. By the way, if you change the DNS address in your system, it will only affect that system. There are routers that allow you to change the default DNS addresses for the DHCP, so the DHCP server in your router will propagate these across all devices trying to connect to it (if the DHCP server is enabled).",7년 전,0,

There is Latency, which is Ping [connection between you and the server]  DNS'ing will only improve number 2, not number 1. It will only load faster your webpages on the browser, because of the faster DNS you have chosen. It doesn't mean you have made your internet faster. The Internet speed is the same. You can check it by gaming or streaming a youtubevideo. It will be the same because of the same bandwidth. Go search for good ISP's or good offers of them if you want better bandwidth. You will of course pay more for it. ========== The answer of your question: Yes, It will load faster your websites. No, it won't improve the internet speed.",7년 전,0,

@CuthbertNibbles,"DNS, what this video is about, is what changes a website name (eg. ""google.com"") into an IP address (eg. 172.217.1.10). It only happens when the webpage is first loaded, and isn't done again for typically 5 minutes. As for the DNS lookup process itself, it usually takes <10 ms (0.01 seconds), plus however long it takes to reach the server. Getting a faster DNS server can only shave 0.01 seconds off your webpage's loading time, and that's assuming the impossible is done. It wouldn't increase the speed at which YouTube videos load, it wouldn't solve your game's lag, and it wouldn't make video calls any better/faster. Tuning DNS for faster internet is like tuning the aerodynamics of a bus for better speed by taping no more than 2 sticky-notes onto the top somewhere.  For those who don't understand how internet speed works, I'll try to explain it in laymen's terms, by saying a webpage is like water, and you loading the webpage is like pouring a glass of water out of the tap into the glass. Bandwidth - how fast the water flows out of the tap. Also commonly known as ""Speed"" Latency - how long it takes for you to turn on/off the tap. Commonly reffered to as ""Ping""  To get your glass of water as quickly as possible, you need both of these to be high. If your water tap can fill the glass in half a second, but it takes 3 seconds to turn on, it's not much better than a tap that can be turned on in half a second but takes 2 seconds to fill the glass. Unless you're filling a lot of glasses - which is similar to streaming.",7년 전,19,
@morid3938, @CuthbertNibbles  ok basically if you do what says in the vid the first time you go on a webpage it will open faster but that's it. Any interactions is still the same correct?

@CuthbertNibbles,"Tyee saying ""There's a new DNS in town"" doesn't explain anything. This video is inflated way above what it should be. Fair, Linus Tech Tips is an entertainer, and the longer they keep your attention the more money they make, but the gamble there is that the viewers get pissed off and lose interest. This video did cover a lot of content, teaching us about how DNS works, and starting off with the actual solution (after advertisements, of course) is a nice bonus, but DangerMan correctly believes the video's title is misleading, and its length does not justify its content since this not only doesn't make your internet faster throughput wise (throughput is the most common measure of internet speed), it only shaves a few milliseconds off your initial lookup time.  To demonstrate how insignificant this change is, let's look at the numbers. The average person doesn't visit 100 websites per month, let's give this the absolute benefit of the doubt and say 100 websites, each one visited every single day, all at the same time. Each DNS record expires after roughly 300 seconds (the average TTL for DNS records), so now we visit these 100 websites every 5 minutes. You have no life, so you do this 12 hours a day. 12 x 60 x 60 = 43,200 seconds a day hardcore browsing the internet 43,200 / 300 = 144 times each website is looked up each day, 144 x 100 = 14,400 DNS lookups per day. This is an insane over-approximation for one person, my household of 4 people averages 14,494 lookups/day over a 1.5 month average, meaning 3,623 queries/person/day. Each of us have multiple devices, and are heavy internet users. But I'm fine with exaggerating even this figure by almost 4 times just to make my point. I ran a DNS benchmark on my system, which determined that against competitors OpenDNS and Google, Cloudflare's DNS server shaved a 1ms (millisecond) advantage. This does not increase your ping by 1ms! This increases your first ping by 1ms, and ignores the next 5 minutes of pings.  14,400 x 0.001 = 14 seconds saved per day. Which you'll never get, because you don't visit 100 websites every 5 minutes, and you don't spend 12 hours a day intensively looking up websites.  If you implemented this on your network, by the numbers above it would take over 1 month to pay off the time you invested just watching this video not to mention the time you'll spend actually configuring the new DNS settings. Keep in mind, these numbers are inflated by 400% above 4 heavy internet users-we're all avid gamers and IT students-and assume you spend 12 hours a day intensively opening a new webpage every 3 seconds.  There's also another thing Linus didn't cover, your ISP's DNS servers are likely faster than any cloud provider because they're physically closer to you. This is highly subjective, dependent on a LOT of factors, but it is worth noting that sometimes your ISP is the fastest choice. Definitely not the most private, but if you're only after speed, it's worth looking into.",7년 전(수정됨),3,
@CuthbertNibbles,"Carlos Miguel  from my previous comment,  "" For those who don't understand how internet speed works, I'll try to explain it in laymen's terms, by saying a webpage is like water, and you loading the webpage is like pouring a glass of water out of the tap into the glass. Bandwidth - how fast the water flows out of the tap. Also commonly known as ""Speed"" Latency - how long it takes for you to turn on/off the tap. Commonly referred to as ""Ping"" ""  Bandwidth, on its own, isn't strictly speed, and has far too many definitions, though only two are correct. The first refers to (typically wireless) signals, which aren't applicable in this case. The second is throughput, ""In computing, bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path."" In today's networks, Round-Trip-Time (ping) is relatively low and non-varying, almost always staying under 100ms which is acceptable for the vast majority of non-realtime tasks (IE, not voice/video conferencing and gaming). True, ping is a factor that's considered when measuring internet speed, but is definitely not ""the big one"". Bandwidth, also known as throughput, is the maximum amount of data that can be passed through a medium in one instance. If your internet usage is plotted on a graph, with the Y axis showing bits and the X axis showing time, the bandwidth is the slope of the line. This isn't complicated math, but it's difficult to explain without graphics, and it's very important to distinguish that while bandwidth is measured ""per second"", it's an instantaneous measurement. Like your car going down a highway at 80km/h, you don't have to travel 80 kilometers for one hour to achieve that speed, it's the speed at which your vehicle is traveling at the time of measurement. Many ISPs measure your monthly data usage and call it ""bandwidth"", I'm not sure who came up with that idea but it's more correct to say that bread is a fruit than that bandwidth is a total data usage per month. Not even banana bread, like Wonder Plus Extra Fluffy White with the crust removed bread.  Now, as to why bandwidth is more important that ping. There are a few points that make this case. First and foremost, the majority of internet users would benefit significantly more from doubling their bandwidth than a halving their ping. While TCP traffic does decrease with higher ping, a lot of applications (from video streaming to online gaming) use UDP, and while online gaming is extremely low bandwidth, rarely consuming more than 256kbps, HD and 4K YouTube and Netflix are extremely bandwidth hungry. The second is queues, which form when the amount of data to be sent exceeds the maximum bandwidth. This queue massively increases ping, in some casing tenfold, and if the queue fills up, the packets are dropped. Finally, an increase in bandwidth usually leads to a decrease in ping, because at higher bandwidths, packets have to be sent through in less time. So, simply put, at 1mbps, a 125mB packet will take one second (google ""bit vs byte"" if this doesn't make sense) to pass through. At 2mbps, the same packet will take 1/2 a second.",7년 전,1,

@CuthbertNibbles,"Catalyst,  Unfortunately, in rural areas, the general approach to internet customers is ""get stuffed"". Satellite is expensive and very slow. Terrestrial (4G/LTE) towers are faster, but very expensive and sometimes not available. Landline connectivity usually gets delivered through DSL, which is fairly cheap but has extreme speed restrictions, at our family farm back home we saw 5mbps and that was it. Getting internet of any kind into rural areas is a huge investment for ISPs, and will never pay off; stringing high-speed internet to a farm may cost the company $100,000, but they'll make back $50/month tops, leaving a return on investment of 160+ years. If they do offer internet through cable, go with that, otherwise look into plans available for 4G. Just look up some ISPs and punch in the ZIP code for pricing.",7년 전,1,

@NInjatam,"My problem: Location. For most people, their internet speeds are restricted by how much they pay their ISP. In Australia, that's also true. I live in inner Sydney, which is a major city in Australia. Right in the centre of Sydney (almost centre) the literal maximum amount of internet speed I can get is around 1 megabyte download and 500 kilobyte upload. Because of my location, that's literally the best internet I can get. Most of the time, I am lucky to get 200 kilobytes per second download. It's pretty trash. The annoying thing is that I live in inner Sydney. I should have great internet. I get triggered when I hear people complaining about 'I have 30 Mb/s download, my internet is so trash'. Anyway.

I would love if you did a tech quickie about this subject.  Furthermore, doing a video on the differences between dsl services seems like a must. Customers order dsl services that range from ip-rt, fttn, fttn-bp, or fiber. All of these dsl services are drastically different, yet the public has no idea what the differences are, or what they mean. Most people dont even understand that fiber uses light vs. copper using sound( i have even commented before on your dual line cable video, showing dsl already does this in its fttn-bp service).  If you need more information, i would be happy to explain. The perception of these services are crucial when deciding your isp. Sales often blurs these lines to make it hard for customers to tell why they should buy certain services. I would love it if i could point my customers to an easy to understand video instead of explaining it myself.  Please reply if you would like an explanation.

@elecktr0freak,"Christ people, this ""trick"" doesn't magically grant you more bandwidth, it only affects how quickly your PC can look up what server to connect to when you give it a URL to go to.

@robertstevenson2957,"Look at what I found  From: Robert D Subject: I can't believe it  2 Day Profits https://warriorplus.com/o2/a/vv319/0     Last week I witnessed a viral marketing website erupt in growth faster than I'd ever thought was even possible.  I was one of the select few who was invited to test it before its launch today, and I can say with confidence that I don't think there's been a better Internet Marketing website released in years.  The combination of remarkably powerful viral growth and a breakthrough new type of direct-to-desktop advertising almost makes using this site unfair to your competition.  Today is the first day that this site is being made available to the public.  Check it out here... 2 Day Profits https://warriorplus.com/o2/a/vv319/0     I haven't explained the details of how it works in this email, since when you visit their site you'll see that they did such a good job of it.  Robert D  P.S.  Here's some actual emails they received from people while they were testing their site:       ""I haven't ever seen a system build a downline so       fast. I joined your program just to try something       new.  Four days later I had a downline of 43 people.       This is unbelievable.""                      ~ Harry Joseph       ""I invited just a handful of people only a few days       ago and I already have 48 members on 5 levels below       me.  I am going to keep promoting this, but I see it       has a life of it's own now. I couldn't stop my       network from expanding if I wanted to!""             ~ David Parton       ""I only sent a handful of invitations to members of my       upline, as my own test, and they ALL joined me!""             ~ Deb McCauley       ""All I can is wow! I have just starting using       DesktopLightning, but I was astounded at how quickly       and effortlessly my list grew. I just let a handful       of friends know about it, and my list quickly started       growing by itself, with new members added everyday.""             ~ Simon Ussher       ""This website is so viral - I received over 100      sign-ups and my network is already 5 levels deep in      less than 48 hours.""             ~ Rene Keiser       ""Wow! Desktoplightning sure is well named.  My list       took off like a Nascar Race Car! People are lining up       at the starting grid!""             ~ Mark McGimpsey             Definitely take a look at this site.  I'm sure you'll be absolutely blown away by the results you get.

Cloud usage and Gaming. It MIGHT affect how fast you can load a website with many elements embedded, BUT this is only true, if you're on a shitty provider with a shitty DNS.

However I confirm that when your ISPs DNS servers are a piece of shit (which used to happen in the past and probably still happens with some), it can help a lot with website loading time. I've been using Google's DNS 8.8.8.8 for about 10 years since my original provider's DNS were slow as fuck and also blocking some sites.

Not saying go with cloudflare either, but there's some good options out there that don't include google...",7년 전,0,
@CZbanhof,"But that wasn't my point. I didn't say ""everyone use 8.8.8.8"". My point was that changing your DNS won't improve your download or upload speed, won't improve your game pings, won't improve your video streaming experience, and won't improve content loading performance on most websites once you are already there, because all DNS queries are cached either by your PC or by your router.   It's not like all your traffic goes through the DNS server. A good DNS server will make your resolve queries faster, but they are relatively rare in normal operation and unless they take seconds, they don't really contribute to your experience negatively or positively very much.  As for the filtering, blocking content with DNS is the most dumb and lousy way of doing so. I don't think any provider is doing it this way unless they are technologically stuck in the 2000s. Same for user activity tracking. There are way more reliable ways. As long as it's fast enough, I don't give a shit about logging.  As for Google, I don't think they will start ""not liking you"" unless your IP does some shady stuff like requesting hundreds or thousands queries every second, in that case they will probably blacklist you. Remember Google DNS has no knowledge of your Google account because it knows nothing about your cookies or your web browser for that matter. It's just a damn DNS server, receives a UDP packet and sends back one. Very primitive thing.  As for ISPs DNS servers being shit, I just tested three. Our provider's at work, my provider's at home and my mobile carrier's. All three are have absolutely acceptable resolve times. And I suspect some are actually just a caching DNS proxy in front of 8.8.8.8 (Remember how 8.8.8.8 went down in Europe once and half of the internet went down with it? Fun.)  The bottom line is that even if you get a couple times improvement on the resolve speed in the benchmarks, the real-life improvement is quite small. Unless the DNS you were originally using was a real piece of shit. Which is possible and might still be a rule in some countries. But definitely not everywhere.   I'm definitely not advocating for changing to 8.8.8.8 nor 1.1.1.1 unless you know what you're doing. And also you might be using 8.8.8.8 behind the scenes without knowing, because that's where your provider outsources the DNS traffic.",7년 전,3,

@tomwilliam5118,Silent Dxnut I haven't gotten to the router yet only change the DNS on my phone and on my computer but boy the difference it makes the specially browsing YouTube videos. on my phone it's like night and day my computer was pretty much fast enough to loot the videos but it loads MSN homepage faster on the computer. I have a Xfinity router in the last I checked I don't think you could change the DSN in it but I'm going to have to reinvestigate that. Thanks for asking,7년 전,0,
,"you're probably an idiot, as your youtube app doesn't even use domain service. it's a straight to IP connection. even tho, once a domain is resolved, it stays in your cache. It doesn't have anything to do with UDP packets transmission speed (latency) or even bandwith. You just fell for the placebo effect. Things that CAN affect your LAN speed are: type of ethernet cables used between your router and your modem, CPU power of the router, RAM size of the router, quality of the integrated switch, Ethernet tech, and your WAN's bandwith + distance from your ISPs centers. So in fact, changing your DNS doesn't do shit. It's even worst, as the ping between your Home and a distant DNS will be atrocious, compared to the direct connection with your ISP.",7년 전,1,
@tomwilliam5118,Louis Brunet well Everyone's entitled to their opinion all I know is that when I change those settings and I launch the app the list of channels and videos that are available load much faster when I go to watch a video I do not get the little scrolling Circle it blinks for a sec Split Second when the video starts and then after that nothing the video plays very smoothly prior to doing this when I would try to scroll through videos it would lag and when I would play videos every so often it would pause and try to catch up and then play I sit in the same place in my apartment I've had the same setup for years and the same problems for years so all I know is what I see . however if I go back to the original settings on my phone and power off and power back on I get the same results as before I change the DNS settings explain that one,7년 전(수정됨),0,
,"Dude, it's not a matter of opinion, it's a matter of knowledge. I'm specialized in Networking (CCNA) and i can assure you this is purely a placebo effect. A DNS (Domain Name Server) has only one function: cataloging IPs and domain names and make the translation. It does not have any effect on your responsiveness. Every device IP-enabled has a DNS server of it's own in some way. Once the translation has been made once, it places a new entry in your DNS cache and will be remembered forever until it is flushed. So basically, in your day to day life, you will practically never send requests to a DNS server if you are consulting the same websites. Your home router has a DNS server of it's own and you shouldn't mess with it. a DNS works in a way that if he doesn't find a translation in it's table, it will relay the request to the next in line DNS. Your ISP's DNS infrastructure is optimized to find the best route depending of your location. Using a Public DNS can actually slow down requests, since it's not optimized for your particular location. It is purely a placebo effect, i can guarantee you.Linus is not the best source when it comes to advanced networking and he probably has no idea himself of what he's talking about. Have a nice day and put that all back to default configuration, there are networks specialists at ISPs who are paid to optimize your experience as much as possible",7년 전,4,

,"i don't think video is a great medium for this kind of content, as networking is often much more of a subject discussed between professionals than to the general Public. The best thing is still to provide the best service out of the box for the people online. On the consumer side tho, there are number of things you can do that may actually help optimizing your LAN and Internet speed: A performant router from a reputable company like cisco,ubiquiti, pfsense(not the one provided by your ISP, it's often cheap and accomodating for budget users), CAT6 shielded ethernet cables, for maximum reliability between your Modem/Router/Devices, a 1Gbps network card (or a recent motherboard), 802.11ac Wifi with low usage channels(you can sniff your neighborhood to see), Wifi Access Points....

@TanyaSapienVintage,"Bah. the thumbnail was clickbait. I thought this had something to do with antenna tweaking on your modem. As for DNS, I already use AcrylicDNS, and I defy any service to outpace a localhost repository running on an SSD.    To pre-empt any questions: AcrylicDNS is a program where you punch in a preferred and alternate DNS (so you can even use it in conjunction with 1111 if you insist) and from then on, it caches all DNS routing information locally. What this means is any time you visit your regular sites, it never even bothers talking to the DNS, it looks up the list on your computer and it already knows all the routing information it needs. It's only when visiting a new website you've never been to before that it needs to contact your DNS (which, again, you can punch in 1111 as that address if you really insist) and the very first time you load that new website it'll use the information provided, but from then on it will already know and won't need to look it up again. Second pre-empt, if it uses its list and fails to connect (due to changing server states, a moved IP, whatever) it will recognize the failed connection within milliseconds, contact the DNS, and then update its own repository to reflect the changes. It's the only DNS I ever use, and that's not a paid shill like Linus saying that, it's an actual satisfied customer.",7년 전,0,

Well this only helps you lookup the addresses in the phone book faster, while not having any effect on the speed at which you dial and talk to the person at. If your phonebook lookup is slow, then your 1GBit speed is waiting on getting the answer to that before it can actually make use of that speed. So yes it can effect your feeling of fastness, if lookups are slow... Just try it and see if page loads feel snappier, if they do then your DNS was holding you back.",7년 전,0,

@Daahma,"Youtube tutorials that propose to put the Google DNS to accelerate this or that ... The worst is a video where we propose to put the Google DNS to improve the ping (latency) while it has nothing to do strictly. Similarly on the forums, Internet users tend to propose to put the Google DNS arguing that it will accelerate the loading sites.  This is unfounded and, on the contrary, it does not accelerate the loading speed of WEB sites and is even rather counterproductive. Some critical elements concerning this change of DNS to the Google DNS.  In the data tutorials that have Google DNS servers set up ... It is assumed that Google's DNS servers are faster ... no evidence advanced. It's better point bar. In general, 0 argument. This comes from the fact that these tutorials are put forward by sites that do not check anything, but are there to generate tutorials and clicks to ... earn money with advertisements. So we balance tips and optimizations, without checking anything. Most of the time, these optimizations bring nothing, to see can pose problems. (I'm not saying that all Youtube tutos are rotten, far from it, there are sites and tutorials of quality)  Be careful, do not be fooled by what is being told on the internet here and there and always do comparison tests. You can use programs like Namebrench for example, which is a tool to compare the resolution speed of Public DNS.  The use of a DNS server external to that of the ISP makes that you must leave the network of the ISP, it is necessary to enter the network of the host of the external DNS server. Because of this, you must have additional jumps to perform. Thus, the chances for the connection time is lengthened, especially if the ISP <> Google / OpenDNS (for example), is not great (history of peering), is to be taken into account. Of course, other parameters are to be taken into account as the geographical location of the host. If the Datacenter of the external DNS server used, is at 4 countries from you, the connection will probably be longer than if the Datacenter is in your country. It must also take into account the equipment capacity of the host.  Like any connection to a server via the Internet, several elements must be taken into account:  The speed of your internet connection. The response time of the server, taking into account various parameters: the speed of the server connection, its geographical location. For this, Google has set up servers everywhere: https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/performance#loadbalance If the DNS server is overloaded, well optimized, ect ....  The results may be different from one provider to another. The gaps are not phenomenal, but more importantly, sometimes the DNS are very slow to respond. What must also be taken into account in these tips to change DNS for external DNS, and the fact that you do not pass by the box. But sometimes, the DNS service of the box can malfunction, using an external DNS, it can solve some problems. But there is as much to put the DNS of your ISP.",7년 전,0,

@DaHaiZhu,"I'm confused. Sure using 1.1.1.1 as your dns server means your isp doesn't directly know what sites you looked up, but isnt that data in the packets going through your ISP's servers anyway? So they can record it anyway.  And Cloudflare has secure dns (dns over https), but even after you've retrived the IP address of the site you're going to visit. That sites IP address is in those packets for your ISP to record and save - even with https web sites. After all, the destination is address must be available to all nodes, including your ISP's, so they know how to route your requests. So I don't see how any of this keeps your ISP's nose out of where you go on the internet. Am I wrong?",7년 전,37,

@wildmanfrost,"unless your ISP is going to spend a ton of time an money filtering your packets. then no they won't know. When you use their DNS, a log of resolves and requesting IPs are kept. It is not typical to filter and log packets. Also if it is secure you can't filter packets with out logical permissions from the routers involved, that would require a hack. If you are still curious check out wireshark.org",7년 전,4,
@dereksnyder4201,"Just changing the DNS address to 1.1.1.1 won't provide this.  You have to make additional configuration changes and maybe even use a paid plan, which he doesn't really mention in the video.  ""Cloudflare is also protecting your privacy by adding support for DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS. DNS-over-TLS takes the existing, insecure DNS protocol and adds transport layer encryption. DNS-over-HTTPS includes not only securit, it also supports forthcoming internet protocols such as Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) and HTTP/2 Server Push.""  What this means is that if configured, your client (browser) would have a cert and encrypt the DNS request in the payload where cloudfare DNS would respond with the IP for the website you entered like normal but the response containing the IP it resolved is also encrypted.  Your ISP will see you send something to 1.1.1.1 and 1.1.1 sent something back, but the payload is unreadable without the ability to decrypt it.  The IP packet header to and from clodfare DNS is completely readable, as you asked about, but other than seeing that, everything else is safe.  If you then use a VPN to connect to other servers using that IP obtained  securely from cloudfare, your ISP would also not be able to see the site you connected to using the IP you got from cloudfare.   Again, he leaves out the ass pain of setting this up and your ISP could give two shits about your weird fetishes as long as it's not breaking the law so wtf do all of that for.",7년 전,1,

@peterparker6584,this made me chuckle a bit. If you knew the problems were having with Alliant Internet in Nova Scotia you know what I'm talking about. Myself and others have even gone as for as trying other computers even building new machines and still having the same problems we should not be having. As an example it's very difficult to run youtube or Netflix and don't get me started with all the problems to deal with e-mail no matter if you're using Alliant or any other e-mail service. I could sit here and write a book about all the problems to do with connection speed and what actually is the issue. I'm paying over $100 a month for Internet service and still getting the worst service you could imagine. The reason is they want everybody to switch over to fiber-optic so they're deliberately screwing with the quality of the service for non-fiber-optic customers. Problem is people like myself don't have access to fiber-optic Internet and if you're using Wi-Fi Internet which is almost entirely run by Alliant clear across Nova Scotia the Wi-Fi speeds are horrible slow I've tried different laptops and you name it and continue to have the same problem whenever connecting to Alliant at various free Wi-Fi locations. Unfortunately I know I sound like I'm crazy but there's probably lots of other people who are stuck using Alliant like myself who have no other option available. I literally live in an area where Alliant terminated all other Internet companies access to the area they bought out and close down every other contenders Internet business. I initially ended up doing business with Alliant because there was nobody else available you can literally contact other Internet Commies and as soon as you tell them you live in this part of Nova Scotia you get the same speech about sorry you're in a Alliant only district and were not permitted to provide service there. Frankly I could care less about faster Internet speeds it would just be nice if the Internet we were receiving actually work the way it's supposed to if you knew the speeds worst post be getting according to all these fancy programs that tell you how fast your Internet is running and yet you actually go to do something and surprise surprise everything runs like crap.! It's getting to the point it's almost impossible to do things like e-mail because their service is so horrible. It's literally worse than dial-up.,7년 전,0,

So yea it shouldn't of slowed it down, but could if it wasn't getting the ip for the whatever googevideo domain... That's also why even when your internet it working well, sometimes a video doesn't load fast or properly, your probably tried loading it from one of googles shittier or bugged servers, but a reload loads a different one that works great again.

@-Gadget-,"Christopher Howard: Yeah, 100% correct, although I should have made that more clear in my statement and Not have tried to dumb it down quite as much as I did.   If you have a look at all the comments from the ""Ill Informed"" you would have noticed the demographic I was aiming that at. What I was getting at was that if you have a 10Mb/s account from your Service provider, you will not get even 1bit faster than they are allocating to you, no matter how many times you change the resolver.... You will most likely get less, but never more  (As is the case with me. I have a 4Mb/s account which is not truly 4Mb/s because I only get 500KB/s (Of which I am lucky to even get 467KB/s which is closer to 3,5Mb/s than 4Mb/s) instead of 512KB/s as it should be if they actually gave me a ""Full"" 4Mb/s line which would be 4096KB/s and not 4000Kb/s). I suppose yet another way the ""People"" are being screwed over.  Ten points to you for explaining it to the people that actually know what the difference is between a bit and a byte, but it would seem Everyone else out there thinks ""Internet Speed"" is the speed they are paying for (Think I phrased that wrong too).

For example when you said ""On the other hand no doors on bathrooms doesn’t Benefit anyone because nobody wants to see you taking a fat one"" Thus logically concluding that doors ON bathrooms does benefit people. Yet now you state privacy is an illusion after confirming it isn't. I see what your trying to say that not much privacy exists today but what you are suggesting makes that worse not better. Also you are assuming incorrectly that advertising is the only thing that these companies use this info for.    When coliedug said ""Should someone have to be doing something illegal to want some privacy? Should we just take all the doors off of bathrooms, I mean unless people want to do illegal activity in them?""  You responded with ""Coliedug Thats completely different bathroom stalls are so people don’t see you’re private parts the data they collect online is for advertising how is this harming anyone.""   It is harming them because it is at the very least invading their privacy which besides being morally wrong can be illegal. And Coliedogs analogy was spot on. The reason we put walls on stalls and wear clothes and a million other things are for privacy not because they are doing something illegal.   To go to the extreme to convey my point; If the government said no one can wear clothes because you might be doing something illegal like carrying an unregistered weapon does that sound reasonably to you? No that’s why we have the fourth amendment.  And lastly what if he is doing something illegal? when someone hears this they automatically think it is something really bad or nefarious but it isn’t always so. Have you ever done any of these things of which may surprise people that they are in fact illegal.   • Unlocking Your Phone [Jailbreaking] • Downloaded a song or movie without permission [pirating] • Used an Ad Blocker on the internet • Making GIFs and Memes • Downloaded a File from a google search and used it without permission from whomever made it • Connecting to Unsecured Wi-Fi networks • VPN and IP Address Loopholes [like using a vpn with Netflix]  Now it is almost impossible to find out who would be doing most of these things and most people just do it anyways so people just go with the flow, however it is illegal technically.

@oliverfunk,"The arguments made thus far have largely been irrelevant. Of course it would be a good thing to have complete privacy when you use the internet, that’s not the issue. What people don't seem to understand about this privacy issue is that these ‘free’ services are ‘paid’ for using the data they collect about you. These companies need to make money to operate and the services we enjoy for ‘free’ would not exist if they didn't collect this data. It’s entirely necessary.  Additionally, Facebook, Google, Twister, IG etc. generally don't sell the data they collect to other organisations (it would be dumb to do so, those other organisations would then HAVE the data and they could then potentially distribute it themselves etc.). They create ad services (Google Ad words, Facebook ads etc.) that are used by advertisers. In most cases the data doesn't leave their servers.  If you want to keep your privacy either don’t use the services that collect data about you, pay for it, or come up with a way to operate a service like YouTube, for free, without collecting data on your users (and potentially start the next huge company, change the way the internet works etc.).",7년 전,0,

Having a VPN may be the most secure way to browse and purchase things from the web, however you don't ""really"" need one. It depends what you are doing. Usually an IP changer is enough. you can find plenty of free ones, just Google. Also if you plan on going on the deep/dark webs -you don't need a vpn to browse, though if you plan on buying stuff then get a vpn first. many offer a free trial period, so if you are just buying a couple things then you can deactivate/install it before they try to charge you.

And Luke I have to correct you there, a lot of the things you said are NOT ILLEGAL. Jailbreaking or rooting your phone is not illegal, it's a basic right to have adminstrator/root access to the thing you own. Companies have tried to block you from having that access, but if you use a method to unlock it anyway that's your right to do so, and I think everyone should do so to take full ownership of their devices. If you don't have root to it, then who does? Someone else besides you is the actual owner of your phone then, and your just a user of it, a data source for them...  Niether is using an adblocker or making memes? Lol what? that was a joke right? Neither is using starbucks unsecured wifi (though not recommended without a way to secure your comms) And neither is using a VPN... Unless your in china, but even then they still get away with it and it's only selectively punished (see china vloggers)  Man you have been fed a load of shit in what you think is illegal...

@xHICKORYx,K3NNY O what about ipv6?,7년 전,2,
@k3nnyo411,"xHICKORYx IPV6 is more for Apple computers, it can be setup for Windows, but people complain it is much slower than IVP4, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you have an Apple. (and if you do I don't know much about Apple, sorry). Stick with the IVP4, and to be honest I have tried 1.1.1.1. as the DNS but switched back to 8.8.8.8. (Google's servers), for me they still worked faster. Try both, do an internet speed test using each one, write down the results during 3 or 4 diff times of day, and based off what you get go with the faster. hope this helps.",7년 전,2,
@edderepa9685,"Thanks bro, will give it a go",7년 전,0,
@k3nnyo411,"Plasmaboo It was first designed for Apple, by Apple in the late 80's and was not used much, (except by apple) but since the last couple years it has started to replace IVP4. You change the settings using your pc's software, not on your physical router. Most pc's today have both checked by default. You can manually enter a DNS if you know it, otherwise it obtains it automatically. Every ISP runs a DNS server , though the faster speed the more expensive your internet bill. Certain ISP's do not offer IVP6 support yet neither do older DSL modems/routers. So yes, it falls back to use IVP4 as you stated. This video was directed for ppl who are using IVP4 which is mainly used if you have a slow DSL (1.5 mbps or 3.0 mbps etc) connection, an older modem, router etc to try to get a faster speed from them. If you use IVP6 primarily (cable isp, fast modem, router or combo) you don't even need to watch this video. Oh and thanks for the f**ked up attitude, no need to be an ass about it, just trying to help a little.  perhaps you could make a step by step tutorial and HELP people out instead of wasting your time being a smart ass.

As long as ISPs know their place and don't charge extra, block sites or throttle, due to the Net Neutrality repeal, then all is good.

@alexanderbarr,Custom DNS servers are locked on BT home hubs in the UK. I tried this and was unable to change the DNS server from the one BT has locked it to. Looking into this further on forums and what not there is a recommendation from people to bin the BT router and get a third party router and then you should have the freedom to change whatever you want. So in my opinion most people will be using the router sent to them by their isp provider and they might have this DNS setting locked so the idea was great but the practicality of it is not achievable without spending money to get a decent router in the first place.

@camieabz,"Just for your info, if planning to use the GRC tool:  - It's better if you create a 'custom list'. This option takes about half an hour and returns the best 50 servers to you. - Add in your own ISP's DNS servers to the list if not there - Remove the redirecting DNS servers - Remove all servers slower than your ISP servers  Then have a look at what's left. It might be wise to configure as many as 4-12 DNS servers, with all your ISP servers included, and at least 2-4 other servers, ideally from two sources. I prefer the two fastest cached and two fastest uncached options. That way, if your primary or ISP servers go down, you have other options. Bear in mind, the process:  ---------- The DNS Client service queries the DNS servers in the following order:  1. The DNS Client service sends the name query to the first DNS server on the preferred adapter’s list of DNS servers and waits one second for a response.  2. If the DNS Client service does not receive a response from the first DNS server within one second, it sends the name query to the first DNS servers on all adapters that are still under consideration and waits two seconds for a response.  3. If the DNS Client service does not receive a response from any DNS server within two seconds, the DNS Client service sends the query to all DNS servers on all adapters that are still under consideration and waits another two seconds for a response.  4. If the DNS Client service still does not receive a response from any DNS server, it sends the name query to all DNS servers on all adapters that are still under consideration and waits four seconds for a response.  5. If it the DNS Client service does not receive a response from any DNS server, the DNS client sends the query to all DNS servers on all adapters that are still under consideration and waits eight seconds for a response.  If the DNS Client service receives a positive response, it stops querying for the name, adds the response to the cache and returns the response to the client. ----------  So it looks at: primary preferred adapter (1 sec), primary all adapters...most folk have only one adapter (2 secs), all (2 secs), all (4 secs), all (8 secs).  So if your primary is crappy, the request will take 3 seconds before jumping to any other DNS servers, so basically ensure the primary is RELIABLE, rather than just fast, and have a mix of fast and reliable backup options.",7년 전,0,

@Waynome,Wow guys really? Clickbait much. You're selling this like is a mayor networking enhancement. This is not speeding up your internet connection at all. You don't even load a website faster. You only speed up the process for your computer to query the god damn DNS entries for all the domains the website references to. A ~17ms delay is not noticeable if you already use Google DNS servers. Also this doesn't speed up your download/upload speeds because this has nothing to do with these. Not saying that the new DNS server doesn't have some neat features but seriously. Keep it professional and stop that click baiting.,7년 전,0,

@mjouwbuis,"+Adam Baldwin you might have heard some tidbits here or there about DNS, but you seem to be unaware how the most common system for (cloud)hosting somewhat smaller websites work, so I'll try to explain this concept using simple words.  In DNS, a host name points to only one IP address, so far you are right. However multiple host names may point to the same IP address. The web server running at this single IP address then uses the host name that was passed along to determine which site should be served. If you don't enter the host name, there is nothing to be served so you will see either a default site or an error message as you did. The most common but somewhat older name for this is ""shared hosting"", since multiple sites share the same server with the same IP address. This is mostly presented as an economy option since resources can be used optimally. The same principle applies to several more modern variants of cloud hosting, such as cloudflare.",7년 전,4,

Google, openDNS and Yandex were at the top of that list (all 3 have the same score). I agree that the DNS your isp provides you with is probably crap, so changing it makes sense, but chose wisely. Yandex has more features, like malware protection (keeping you off malware containing sites), family friendly dns (blocking 18+ content) and that sort of stuff.

@Shogoeu,"I ommited that from my previous comment, but lets talk about the ""snappiness"". I overexagerated things, because it was easier to write. The speed up doesn't even have half a second - their tests @4:00 show 13ms faster DNS, global tests @1:42 show an average of 30ms difference and that is even before local cache kicks in. These are times that a human won't even feel, if he isn't looking for it specifically. After the first request, these records are added to the local DNS cache, making the access to them under 2ms time. So 13 to 30 ms for the first load is something negligible and only in case when you do a DNS query. Believe whatever you want, if you feel more ""snappy"" that way, good for you.

@AlmostUselessPenguin,DNS stands for Domain Name System (/Server) which is the idea that instead of using IP adresses to access website you use a URL that is linked to an IP. You type in the URL and your computer asks a Domain Name Server for the IP to connect to for that URL and you are sent to that webpage. This means the only thing this affects is loading webpages with a URL since it is faster to access the 1 1 1 1 Domain Name Server. If you get faster download speed then it is pure coincedence / confirmation bias because you think it speeds up Internet when it only speeds up loading a webpage.,7년 전,11,
@fahadus,"It does affect speed in browsing. A webpage could have several requests to different hosts. I just switched and I can tell a difference. Apparently, my ISP was using a terrible DNS.

@Albanez39,Aren't ISPs the server providers that connect us to the internet. They are connected to other ISPs around the world and bring the connection to your computer too. So the DNS is the ServerOS or some kind of Port that is used by my ISP's servers?,7년 전,0,
@sh06un1s,"Yes, the ISP connects you to the internet. But something like ""google.com"" doesn't mean anything to a server until it's converted to an IP address. So you type in ""google.com"" or whatever site you want to go to and hit enter. Your browser will hit a Domain Name Server (DNS) first. The DNS has a table that it looks for your requested site on, and when it finds it, it then goes to the adjacent column and references the IP address that is linked to it. This IP address is basically the name/location of the server that the site is on, and from there it will make another request to the actual server, since now it knows where it is. Then a response is sent back to your browser and the site is loaded and shown. Hope that all makes sense ....",7년 전,0,

@AlmostUselessPenguin,DNS stands for Domain Name System (/Server) which is the idea that instead of using IP adresses to access website you use a URL that is linked to an IP. You type in the URL and your computer asks a Domain Name Server for the IP to connect to for that URL and you are sent to that webpage. This means the only thing this affects is loading webpages with a URL since it is faster to access the 1 1 1 1 Domain Name Server. If you get faster download speed then it is pure coincedence / confirmation bias because you think it speeds up Internet when it only speeds up loading a webpage.,7년 전,4,

@kylekyle4505,"I dont understand how this could be faster than local based solutions. If you setup your own DNS server local to your network and configured the forwarders to the external dns server . Eg. Google, cloudflare then you could enable your own local caching. Not only that but that enables you to have more control over your network devices DNS. Example would be if you decide you want to Cange your forwards it doesnt involve touching ever computer on your local network. Also you get the benifit of internal dns resolution should you loose internet access. How is using cloudflare directly on your network devices faster and better than this.    To touch on security, to my information DNS runs on port 53 TCP and UDP. Requests are not encrypted meaning anyone between me and cloudflare could STILL figure out what where I am going. Granted my local solution doesnt fix this either but still. Having a local DNS server would also close the possibilities or at least allow implementation of safeguards in preventing DNS spoof attack within your local network. If this video is aimed torwards the simple people (i just want facebook to load faster) i guess its not worth the effort to learn how DNS and TCP IP protocols really works for them... idk",7년 전,0,

@kaldogorath,"The answer to your question is that CloudFlare is a CDN, or content delivery network. CloudFlare already has a ton of servers positioned around the world for the service that people pay them good money to use. They also offer limited, free variants to their paid CDN service.   As a CDN, they are really good. They make sure that many of your favorites sites stay up even when the site itself is down, as they cache the entire site to be loaded from a server near to the person accessing the site. Internally, they likely have been using this DNS service for themselves for a long time, as part of the effort to speed up their service.  Now why might they be sharing the service with everyone for free? Well, accessing anything resting on a CloudFlare server will be that much faster if you're using their DNS. Because they're in the same facilities. That's a major advantage really, it greatly reduces the amount of bouncing around your connection would otherwise do. This makes their service more premium for the users of CloudFlare, and it also is a sort of advertising mechanism for the company in itself - it's unlikely to learn about the CloudFlare DNS without hearing about CloudFlare. Everyone who uses 8.8.8.8 knows that it's Google's DNS, for example.

@knowledgeseekerr,"Hey everyone, I'm a network engineer, and don't ever listen to someone that gives stupid tips or advice about increasing your internet speed it can't be done. Your internet speed is monitored and is set to a default speed that your ISP provides you. Their are things you can do to help you have a better experience with your internet. 1. You can directly plug into your router, which will give you a better connection, however this leads to using ethernet cable and laying a path out to have it at a stationery location. 2. If you are experience slow internet crawl speeds, you can simply power off your router and let it sit for like 30 seconds and plug the power back into the router and allow it to re-establish your internet connection. 3. If you still experiencing a slow internet speed, it could be something on the outside of your home that you need to contact your ISP company (be polite and nice when calling your ISP) they will send a tech out and replace anything that is malfunctioning. 4. The number of users (people) using your internet connection can slow down the bandwidth speed because its being divided out between the number of users using the connection. Never listen to people that say you can download, or configure your router in a specific way to make it faster, it wont work and this can lead to either viruses on your devices and a potential hacker gaining access into your router.  If you also want faster internet speeds, contact your ISP about increasing your bandwidth speeds, they may offer better package speeds.",7년 전,0,

@Audio_Simon,Ken Phillips Are you able to confirm Virgin don't simply redirect your DNS requests to their servers?,7년 전,0,
@Tekwyzard,"Yes, my own router actually directs DNS queries to my own caching DNS server/ad blocker that lives on a raspberry PI, but when the PI gets perplexed about a lookup it goes to ask OpenDNS for help. Of course any other public DNS could be used instead. Stuff that virgin typically blocks at DNS level gets through. So yes, virgin DNS is totally out of the loop, and I benefit from the protections that OpenDNS offers. They actually have a test on their site that verifies if OpenDNS servers  are being used or not, and occasionally I even get a page blocked warning, due to it being known to be malicious. I actually tried that  DNS benchmark that Linus mentioned, of GRC's today, just for a laugh, and unsurprisingly for non cached stuff my lookups are about the same speed as direct to OpenDNS. Interestingly 1.1.1.1 showed to be about the same speed, which as it gets loaded down doesn't surprise me at all, but wow, there's a lot of differences in lookup speeds out there.",7년 전,0,

(default is in the middle) 2) A faster DSL version doesn't always mean a faster connection (ADSL1, ADSL2, VDSL etc). Your router will automatically connect using the fastest DSL version supported by your exchange. The faster versions have shorter range and get very slow very quickly at long range unlike the slower DSL versions. So, there is a crossover point where ADSL1 is actually faster than ADSL2. Sometimes forcing your router to a slower DSL version makes your connection faster. However this is only the case if you're currently right on the edge of DSL range.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

(in the Netherlands) But the fine they got from the govt was so laughably low that most analytics thought they will just ignore it altogether. The fine was in the thousands, while their net profit is in millions. In short, the scandal was about accountants from KPMG (and other companies) kind of closing their eyes when their customer wanted it and payed a little extra... KPMG stood out in that scandal because most people see it as a reputable source. For those willing to look it up: The TV show ""tros radar"" made a short documentary about that scandal. It's in dutch, so either learn that language or rely on speech recognition and google/bing/yandex translate. --- BUT: perhaps it could also serve as a PR stunt, offering a free DNS service is an easy way to show your brand to anyone.

@BugBorAT,1st Question most of the DNS servers use caching so why is 1.1.1.1 DNS Server faster using the same protocol (which they have too)?  2nd Question if u have already used important Internetsites really often and most of the DNS Servers use caching doesnt the time benifit of 1.1.1.1 dissapear ? 3rd question if 1.1.1.1 fills the cache before a user even ever used a popular site. So what is if u use a lot of less popular sites e.g of  smaller University ( they often use a lot of sites) so it probably need to fill the cache with these aswell but cache space is reserved for some more popular sites so cache gets full at some time or searching in the Ip stack takes longer.

Great in theory if clourflare ran 99% of the internet, but it doesnt and given my biggest gripe with cloudflare is their ""convenient"" tendency to either throw errors on loading sites that refused to pay cloudflare fees for international traffic - or in the case of for example the popscience website - it will send you to an entirely different dumbed down, out of date and/or censored version of the desired website - it makes it really really easy to violate net neutrality and make cloudflare charging for ""premium"" traffic services a lot easier to implement.

I live in the Tampa Bay area, so YMMV.  1.1.1.1 got around 44ms cached ping response with 74ms uncached. This is in comparison to Google's 8.8.8.8 server which got around 14ms cached ping response and 63ms uncached.

@brinckau,"Let's try an analogy. If my job is to deliver some package to your home, then the delivery will be faster if I run fast. But if I need one hour to figure out where I have to go because I'm struggling with Google Maps to find where your home is BEFORE I can start running, then you may have to wait a lot to get your package. If I improve my Google Maps skills, then I will be able to deliver packages in less time. But it won't make me run faster.  When you use a website, let's say Facebook, your browser has to find where the server is. To do that, your browser asks your operating system ""what is the address of facebook.com?"". And your operating system queries what is called a ""domain name server"" (DNS) to get the information. If the DNS response is fast, then it makes the whole process faster. Once your browser got the address of the facebook server, it can start the download of the page you requested. At a certain speed that has nothing to do with the process of domain name resolution (well, actually the domain name resolution will usually take less time if your download speed if high, because it also consists in a download of some information from a remote server).  But the tip Linus gives in this video will never make a huge difference. It may save a few milliseconds here and there, that's all.  I hope my explanation is clear.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

@WereCatf,"Just as a tip: if you've got a router with OpenWRT/LEDE and you can spare the RAM, increase the dnsmasq cache-limit from the default 150 entries. One entry takes 82 bytes of RAM, so the default settings take ~12KB. I have a router with 256MB RAM, so I increased the limit to 5000 entries, which is still only around 0.5MB RAM consumed.  By increasing the limit your router can cache more entries and will have to perform lookups more rarely, and especially if you have multiple devices using the Internet, like e.g. you got other family-members using the same connection, this should drastically reduce the overall number of queries sent to the Internet over time.",7년 전,0,

This is using a clickbait title to tell people about a service which might save them a minuscule amount of time, and I think Linus and his employees know enough to realize this.

@PurdyDot,"I was just thinking... A while back, I watched a linus video where he talked about how you could make a pretty good gaming pc, and a pretty low price, if you based it off a slightly outdated ""workstation"" style pc. The concept was great, I would have LOVED to have tried it, because I'm actually still using a 10 year old PC to game with, *and, ahem, I didn't say BAD, I said ""old"". It's actually an exceptionally *good pc *for it's time*, and I've upgraded it substantially, in fact, substantially enough, that a modern ""low end"" pc wouldn't really be any better, actually it'd be worse for too many of the things i use a pc for so I basically can't afford to build anything new enough, and good enough, to be ""the modern equivilant"" of my pc. I'd need at least $1500 (and if i had that, i'd probably just buy a mek1 instead of bothering to build anyway), which was about $1,000 more than my budget.^^, Buuuuuut I couldn't try it. Because, for some reason, after linus put out that video, the prices for those kinds of workstations magically went *up*. lol So what you previously could have probably gotten for maybe $150-$250 and added a pretty nice video card to, in order to build a pretty good system for around $500-$600, were now being offered for prices of around $500-$600 (obviously without a good video card) which is like, wow. because if we had that much to spend on everything but the vid card, why not just build something much more modern and better? and thanks linus, now everybody who ""refurbishes PCs"" thinks that all their outdated workstations are gaming PCs that couldn't possibly be sold for the price of what outdated workstations used to sell for. :P And I saw another linus video where he was talking about how you could get these older dual processor boards for cheap, to use to build a low budget gaming pc. Low and behold... the prices of older dual processor boards increased substantially. Of course, still cheaper than new ones, but not enough to really make it any kind of ""Great deal"" anymore. And now I see this video by linus, talking about this dns service that could potentially be much faster than our current, overloaded, dns's.... Well, what help but wonder... If I happended to try this, would I suddenly find myself experiencing similar speeds as on my old ""overloaded dns"", along with around 5.6 million other linus subsribers, and come to find out that after everybody had moved over to ""this side of the fence"", if this new dns would end up all slow and overloaded from all the extra traffic, while my old dns would become faster and remarkably less overloaded... That just sorta popped into my head for some reason:P",7년 전,0,
@HeroUnit,"This is pure misinformation! You only do a DNS lookup on the first time you visit the domain, then the lookup is cached locally for (up to) a day!

[whatever]   is an amateur and should not be trusted to answer a question like  WILL THIS AFFECT ONLINE GAMING  @Creeper...........hehe  OMG Creeper says    No it won't   then he says      IT RESOLVED IP ADDRESSES FOR WEBSITES YOU BROWSE TO LMFAO  Ahhhh YEAH  and online gaming Uses IP Addresses to connect Hosts to Hosts  so yeah IT KINDA DOES AFFECT ONLINE GAMING  @Daeux Mate, doing this does affect your gaming, However   when you say DOES IT HELP  ................. DEFINE WHAT YOU MEAN BY ""HELP""  if Help Means will the graphics be better.......... The Answer is NO if Help Means will your ping be lower (my initial answer would be, You're an idiot and an amateur for asking, and you probably don't understand what a ping is)  but...    as to whether it would help.. it's debatable   you see, You're probably a kid and you don't understand how these things work, but YOU THINK YOU DO  and here in lies the problem with most gamers, they sit in front of a computer all day they play a game and they have watched a you tube video on how to build their own machine  and they therefore assume they know how to build computers and therefore this instantly grants them the knowledge to understand how networks work  the other problem is..... GAMERS LEARN NETWORKING FROM OTHER GAMERS,  Not from techs or engineers   the way that you asked your question tells me your an amateur (no offense intended) so how can i answer your question without knowing WHAT YOU MEAN by the word ""Help"" i can only really guess, can't i BUT WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO,  it's your responsibility  to ask the correct question.  also Whether its playstation online or X Box Live MAKES NO FUCKING DIFFERENCE ok what is relevant here is   DOES YOUR DEVICE HAVE A NETWORK CARD i don't give 2 fucks if your device is a toaster or a fridge,    if it has a network card IT WILL BE RELEVANT  if it doesn't IT WON'T BE  so does and XBOX have a little Ethernet port on it..............

Think about that for a moment. Over 40 Gbps of junk traffic aimed at one IP address. This is partially due to the fact that in the past, 1.1.1.1 wasn't considered in the range of public IP addresses and were instead dark traffic addresses.

The paid one allows specific addresses (to match your network scheme, for security purposes to make it harder to spoof, etc) and other features that are a necessity in a major organization. The ideal scenario for them is that some mid to high level network engineer for someone like Boeing starts using this in his personal setups, then brings it up at a meeting and his business group switches over, then some more groups, then corporate HQ notices and switches all business groups over. They also already have a large paying client base for their other services, meaning they can use the statistics from the free side to show why it would benefit the paid side to add this service.",7년 전,0,

@selfishlyintrigued,"@Skelath  You have no idea what ping means. An actual network administrator here.  Ping is simply the(But not always); the round trip time for a request, or how long it takes to get a response from a server or end device. Packet size is largely irrelevant.  Ping is not stable because networks vary. When you send a packet, it goes through multiple network layers where it must be routed to eventually get to an end server or device and back. Ping varries because traffic is not consistent on multiple levels, and layers of the routing devices your packets are getting sent through. So a delay is introduced in the time it takes a middle layer, or upper layer router node to receive, route, and relay your packet to another middle or upper layer router node which again will introduce a delay to route and relay said packet to yet another.... Etc, you get the idea.   Normally people will naively said distance matters the most, but if you had a fibre connection straight to your end device, whether they were next door or other side of the planet it largely would be irrelevant for an end user.  It's normally the amount of middle and upper layer route nodes you must relay a packet through that ultimately defines your ping time, especially if the best found path is through older hardware, or hardware that is heavily utilized and undergoing constant peaks. Ideally discrete network mapping should be able to handle this and find the best possible path, but not always.  However this is also largely irrelevant for a DNS, because if we're talking about games, they heavily rely on IPs, which really don't hit a dns server.",7년 전(수정됨),4,

Example: you're in front of a world boss but wanting to join a group, you see 15 players already there in front of you however when joining a group you get transfered to the realm that most members of the group are tied to and as a result you ""zone in"" those 15 players fade out (including mpcs), and 70+ players fade into view, if the amount of players from said realm becomes less than another, the entire group zones into a different realm.

My home network uses 400 GB of data each week and 1.6 TB of data each month with spikes of 800 GB of data per week and 2.4 TB of data per month. We usually use 1.6 TB for eight months and 2.4 TB for four months totalling 22.4 TB of Internet data each year.  1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 will have a noticeable effect on my real-time critical workflows; however, it may not have a noticeable effect for traditional gamers or content consumers; this makes a difference with a lot of data and a lot of varying source data when the IP addresses are not cached in the router.  My home network is data centre grade. The DNS servers are connected to the network via 10 Gbps Ethernet and 40 Gbps InfiniBand. Most DNS systems would not need to be connected at this level of bandwidth but it is part of my work to emulate multi-terabit per second data centres.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

I'm showing off because i have a super fast connection now before we go on,  YOU KNOW THIS WILL PROBABLY NOT HELP YOU to begin with, but , again... you wanted to show off and that's fine but don't look like an idiot while doing so  now moving forward  2. this has to do with Look up speed     NOT INTERNET SPEED  or the capability of your network adapter to be asking this the way you did clearly demonstrates your stupidity (just saying)  and then you top off that stupidity by confusing bits with Bytes  Seriously mate and then.. you have the gall to talk down to potato as if potato is a special little snowflake   Mate, fuckwits at Telstra (our ISP in Australia) say shit like 50 MBps   as opposed to 50Mbps  all the time  and they say it as if it makes no fucking difference when it does thus proving their utter fucking stupidity ,  they are tech support dept that doesn't know the fucking difference between a Byte and a bit  and you are a guy that thinks that B  and b are the same thing well mate if this was electronics and we were talking voltage   is    m  and  M the same thing     i think fucking not... huh there would be a huge difference between 5mV  and 5 MV    hehe  huh mate   Now....    FOR YOUR INFORMATION changing DNS Servers like this (Changing to a server with less load) will speed up your LOOK UP TIME beyond that it's a question of your existing internet speed  but also it is also a question of your hardware,      You can have a PC that has a Network Adapter that can run at 1GB   , but then your ISP may have given you a shit modem that has ports that can only run at 100 Mbps  (see the fucking difference between  100Mbps and 100 MBps..............YEAH) so , as you are probably aware, there is a bottle neck, and if you are running with slow hardware then the overall speed will run at the speed of your slowest device  you obviously know this because you clearly understand the technicalities of Gigabit networks  NOW.. SINCE YOU DO  AND SINCE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A TECH CHANNEL  WHY CAN YOU NOT GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER AND MERELY RESPECT THE SI UNITS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE FOR THIS SPECIFIC REASON and just fucking write BYTE as B  and bit as b  Why be fucking lazy mate,  seriously and then you go off at potato FOR YOUR LAZINESS  YOU'RE WRONG.......

@CheapSushi,"DNS Benchmark should be done so you can see which DNS is faster for your specific location.  The benchmark looks complex but it's super simple actually.  There's some DNS's for privacy, etc, so up to you what matters more. But just blind using a DNS doesn't make sense.   So like Linus did, use the GRC DNS Benchmark. Pick the one that is best for your location. Sometimes even your ISP is the fastest: https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@Billy123bobzzz,"The cost for this project is advertising dollars. By having videos like this one, and many articles appear in the computer news media, CloudFlare gets a lot of exposure that they would have to otherwise pay for. They have a huge network of servers already in place so to add DNS functionality to their network is a relatively trivial task since DNS servers are not heavily loaded, not even by millions of queries a day. CloudFlare is doing this as a public service, along with APNIC, so it stands to reason that they can also get a tax write-off for the nominal cost of offering this service for free. People will now be looking at what CloudFlare does and then possibly sign up for their service (their service is quite good, I have been one of their customers.  Changing to a faster DNS provider, like CloudFlare, does make your web pages appear faster, this is not slight of hand at all. I worked for an ISP at one time and was clocking our DNS service against others and have been doing so annually ever since then. CloudFare is the fastest DNS I have clocked so far. Its true that if you are in the boonies, a local DNS server might be faster but that is not true for the majority of us, for most of us CloudFlare should be amongst the fastest, if not the fastest DNS provider available to us.  Privacy is important. You an use Google's DNS service but its not private. Google has been shown to cooperate with any agency that asks for any information from them so they are most certainly also handing over your DNS queries as well. This can lead to you being falsely being accused of something that you did not do (its happened too many times in the past) so using Google is not good for us, as a society.  For those that are not familiar with KPMG, they are a well respected auditing/accounting company. Corporations routinely use them to enforce their policies and provide independent proof that is unassailable. Once KPMG starts their audits, we will be assured thatchy found proof that CloudFlare is protecting out privacy just as they are promising to us right now. There will be some sort of annual report that KPMG will stake their reputation on, so you know that it will be completely truthful.",7년 전,0,

In that sense, DNS does impact ping, as you first have to get a response from the DNS server before you can send the data to the correct IP.   Granted, you don't have to keep on doing this.

@EdgarOwlanPoe,"I have some interesting results concerning my internet speeds I'm using a wired ethernet connection to my school's wifi service (I think it's through Comcast?) and here is where everyone lines up (approximately). (mbps - Megabits per Second)  Download Speeds: Assigned: 24.8 mbps Google: 36.2 mbps 1.1.1.1: 33.5  Upload Speeds: Assigned: 3.08 mbps Google: 87.6 mbps 1.1.1.1: 87.5 mbps  Now a BIG grain of salt is meant to be taken from this. This was a set of tests using google's internet speed test that you can do by simply asking Google ""How fast is my internet"" into its search bar. This was only one test which was not repeated. These are not average but single scores. So while it might be tempting to say that Google's speeds are faster... I really don't have enough data to safely conclude that. However the margin of difference between the Automatic and manually inputted DNS's ARE significantly different, so I think that if you use 1.1.1.1 that it WILL be faster than your automatic DNS. It might not be faster than Google's, but like LInuz said, the security claim by 1.1.1.1 might make it so that it is a superior choice anyway.  Feel free to test out the speeds on your own!",7년 전,1,

@CuPi44,"DNS Hijacking (having inaccurate results supplied as responses) is common these days, but it's generally not identified in a news-making way.  1. It used to be a ""secret"" that could be used to direct unsuspecting users to a scam or marketing page (I won't get into that method/context here). 2. Now, it's common for ""captive portal"" systems in WiFi hotspots to direct people to the pay trap or terms of use landing page.  (If you tell users that the address for every site they try to go to that the address is the router or portal address, there's a good chance the users ends up loading that page - and it's lying/hijacking.) 3. Normal DNS traffic is not encrypted, so malicious routers and inspection platforms can track your outbound requests AND (for the hijack part) they can change the content of the inbound response.  (If a made-up site name that does not exist in the real world gets you a search page or an automatic redirect ONLY on a computer or network of interest, start suspecting malware or DNS hijacking at some step.)",7년 전,0,

Which means if you use a different NS than your ISP you may get routed to a distant proxy  server than the one you get with your ISP NS. So the benefit from faster DNS can be shadowed by a higher latency connection.. so don't jump the hype without fully testing the speed for a complete web connection to your favorite sites.,7년 전,0,

@BobHolowenko,"What?! Of course 1.1.1.1 came back to ""non-cached"" faster than your router...It had to go out to the internet and get that same info before responding to you, but once it has that, it's going to be FASTER to get it from your local router for all clients on that network. You're better off sending your ROUTER at CloudFlare's servers in round robin and continuing to point at it. Also note that this can also have an ill effect on your other services. For instance, NetFlix and Akamai caches are often in your ISP's networks already and by not using the ISP's DNS servers you often will not get the content you want from the cache, instead you will likely get it from farther away. I do point everything at Google/CloudFlare here at home  with the exception of a handful of domains that I point to specific servers to resolve (such as NetFlix and Akamai to my ISP).",7년 전,0,

@MrDavibu,"@jonixas1 Technically speaking the latency is the speed of the internet. What you are thinking of is the bandwidth, to be more precise the data throughput. The term ""speed"" is just commonly being used incorrectly.  OK, if you want to be 100% correct, DNS is built on-top of TCP/IP and as that is a service used on the internet and technically not part of the Internet(IP) and thus won't effect the speed of the internet, only delay later packages, because it's a delay not caused by the network-stack or the network itself. But that depends on how you define the Internet, as a protocol(connection medium) or as a accumulation of services. As a accumulation of services, some will run earlier(after DNS-resolution) and thus faster.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
