@Trippp550,"Your “Year One” forgets to mention the what, 4 years(?) of college, 50-80k in debt, and the time and effort it takes to juggle a full time job and a full time college career (hope you weren’t also juggling a family and/or any serious medical conditions) and then when you graduated you STARTED with a $75/yr job. That’s TWICE the amount most people in non-college educated fields get paid. I worked 7 years to become a manager at my retail store and that made $45k/yr. If I made $75k/yr and I was married to someone making anything around minimum wage, that would be over $100k/yr. With a proper budget, time management, and investing my money with an investment firm that will invest my money for me…. Your “Year One” would set my family up for life. Unfortunately, what it took you to get to “Year One”, the 4-5 years before it, is the barrier that most people struggle to climb over. Good on you tho man. Seem like a great kid.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

So my questions is what to do if you feel like you are not getting material and just can not improve yours knowledge anymore? First semester it was all good We were introduced to the programming everything seemed to be easy but after they introduced OOP i kinda started to fall behind and I have tried countless resources to get OOP and basically improve my knowledge but unfortunately I could not. I used youtube , bought courses from Mosh ( Coding with the Mosh. ) particularly Java course since I study Java at my uni. Every student at my department seems to understand and ask smart questions. So I kinda dunno what to do at my current point . Should I just grind and continue or review and change smth in my study plan ? We do not have that much of projects and i am frustrated when I do not know why we are learning particular thing in code . Plz help :(",3년 전,0,

Year 0-3: I work 12 hours per day for 36k Euro (before taxes) for Internet Startups and small Consulting companies, in the evenings and weekends I create websites, none of them go viral, none of them generate income.  Year 4-5: I slowly burn out.  Year 5-7: I work 6 hours per day in a small Software Company, tech lead but projects are boring and work repetitive. There is no growth. In the evenings and weekends I do freelance software engineering work. I still earn around 36k Euro per year (before taxes).  Year 7-10: I still work like a zombie. Next to my work I started to study Somatic Education, an alternative movement method to deal with chronic pain and personal growth.  Year 11: I stop being a Software Engineer.",4년 전,33,

@subjecttochrist,"I wonder if he ever found the greatest treasure, though? “""The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭13:44‬ seek first the kingdom of heaven, and all the frivolous things we worry about, God will provide. You must be born again! Believe in the Gospel. That Jesus died for your sins (because all have sinned and EARNED their wages, and the wages of sin, is death), Jesus died the agonizing death on the cross that you and I deserved. It should have been us on that cross, but Jesus took our place. His blood poured out for us was an acceptable offering, that atoned for the sins of the world. Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and was buried in a tomb. Jesus was raised 3 days later, by the power of God. Jesus was resurrected from the dead! Why is this significant? Because we, as Christians, serve a living God, who said He would return one day, and God never lies. His resurrection was witnessed by many people; it is one of the most well documented events in ancient history.  All one must do is confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, and you will be saved.  For more encouragement, check out our blog!

But to dissipate the depression some of you are feeling right now. :), try to think about your own passions and ambitions, not that of the Techlead.  He has been generally pursuing his passions since he was a kid, and as we've all been told, if you stay committed to your passions, you can become successful, and at the very least, learn a lot of lessons and good life experience during your pursuit which could lead you down a path you never dreamed of.  Use the angst you are feeling and keep moving forward. I think the Techlead provides incredibly sound advice/wisdom and good/thorough thought processes for making big (and small) life decisions and navigating those.  Take what is useful to you, apply it, keep evaluating the outcomes, and write your OWN story, as the TL has advised. :)",6년 전(수정됨),139,

We need to break those repetitive cycles and beliefs that are so engrained in us from childhood and that continue to influence our decision making.  I think that's part of why I love to travel, because I feel like that curious kid envisioning endless possibilities and letting go of my old self-defeating thoughts.

So after a year I’ll have a qualification equivalent to a degree. I know the basics of R and statistics now and already have a graduate job in BI lines up.

I pushed so hard to get out of my country. By a miracle, I came to the US and started out from, quite literally, zero. Proposed to my wife with $200 in my bank account. Lied to her father and told him that I had $2000. Now, 9 years later, I work for a decent company, I own a house and I have two amazing and beautiful kids. I still live paycheck to paycheck, but I love my life because of the little family i have. I have started learning how to code two years ago and i fell in love with it the minute i started.

@wonderram234,"Here is my 10 yr challenge. I hope it gives you an insight of how much time I also wasted but managed to land a role in programming.  1st year: - 18 years old - First year of college studying I.T. I previously dropped out of college studying music because well there's not really any point studying music. I wasn't an academic person also and enjoyed going out doing dumb teenage things.   2nd year:  - 19 years old - final year of college. literally scrapped a pass but was enough to land a Games development course in Southampton. Although this sounds exciting my real reason for taking this course was to move away from my parents, continue creating music beats and having the time of my life - First year of university. What an amazing time I had. Loads of partying, girls, drugs and friends. I was making beats  when I woke up but I didn't take it as serious as I thought I would. I was literally living in a bubble. I did minimal studying and hardly attended university.   3rd year: - You get how old I am now so I am no longer saying.  - Still in my first year of university. Woke up to a phone call from my mum saying I got kicked out of university.. they actually sent a letter to my parents house saying I am off the course. - Managed to speak to my tutor but they wouldn't reconsider kicking me out. There was no way I was going back home degree less, its embarrassing especially if you're the eldest sibling that comes from an Asian family so I decided to look for a job around the area to keep funds coming in.  - I found a job but managed to get fired from it..typical. I was a bartender working in a shitty pub but getting fired made me hit an all time low physically and emotionally. My only option was to head back home and face my parents. In that same year I also had a pregnancy scare...a girl from uni i was shagging had already given birth and I had to take a DNA test WTF! . I told my parents that they could potentially be grandparents so now I'm degree less and a possible dad... imagine the look they gave me. - Turns out the kid is not mine pheww!!   4th year: - I've decided to get my life into place so I go back to college and study music .... then drop out again I SHIT YOU NOT! my music passion is over. - I instead apply to study Business and Marketing (because it's a easy course I thought), in London where my parents live so I don't get distracted. However I'm also given an opportunity to studying a course in Southampton again. Was sooo tempting but I stuck to the Uni in London. Could you imagine getting kicked out off university a 2nd time?. - Started uni same year and this uni sucks. The people are boring , no parties, hardly made any friends but I had to focus on finishing this course . Now I'm slowly starting to get my life on track.   5th year: - 2nd year of uni and decided I hate Business and Marketing but I didn't quit. - Met a girl from Switzerland on a night out and got into a long distance relationship.  - Relationship ended because I met my future wife also on a night out   6th year : - Graduated from university and my parents are now the happiest ever. However I now decide the career I want to get into is programming but how the hell do I get one without any experience in programming at all. And also what programmer do I want to be? Software developer or a web developer..or mobile apps developer. At this point I had no idea what technologies I needed to learn, this was going to be hard.... now i wish I actually stuck to the Games Development course. - During summer straight after graduation I self studied for the CompTIA A+ exam which is the basic of basics tech support qualifications. I thought I would get into tech support first so I could understand more about the actually infrastructure of IT.   7th year: - Landed a junior support role in IT for a fairly big company and I'm only half way through learning CompTIA A+.  - in the same year I ace the CompTIA A+ exam and also completed the CompTIA network+ exam a few months after.   8th year: - No longer junior and promoted to 2nd line.  - The fun starts now. It's at this point I start learning how to code independently whilst being a 2nd line technician, starting off with basic HTML and CSS, then moving on to JavaScript.   9th year:  - Landed a job as a junior web developer and I couldn't believe it. All it took was 5 months of self studying code..pat on the back. I quit after 5 months.......turns out to be a very SharePoint orientated role...like who the hell likes SharePoint f that.   10th year: - I've been in my current role as a full stack web developer for 5 months and it's going really well. The social life could be a bit better but at least I'm in the deep end coding away creating new features on our web application and not hearing anything SharePoint related. My journey has been somewhat crazy but in the end I managed to land the career I have always wanted and it can only get better from here.  It just proves you don't need a computer science degree to be a programmer and you can get anywhere you want to be with a bit of focus - To add to my current tech stack I now also know C#, Typescript, Angular, SQL & PHP.   P.S I'm happily married to the girl that I ended my Switzerland relationship for and we share a beautiful daughter together. My parents are not angry they are grandparents!",6년 전(수정됨),4,

But you don’t even care much about stability or anything and I can’t tell if you’re insanely rich off a couple viral apps or poor or middle class. That’s insane. I guess now you’ve settled down and I’m happy for you and maybe even jealous at one point of how much you’ve done and how you simply left great jobs when you got bored etc. I guess that comes with your experience and you know it’ll be easy to get another great job when you want.

Most people only consider money when they say a ""great job"", but other factors like how fun and interesting it is, how rewarding it is, etc, should be considered as well.   I've got a masters in computer engineering, and I've got a couple of solid job offers locally at a little better than $90k each, but I'll still be making less than a third of what either of my parents were making when they were only a couple of years older than me. It's certainly not a bad salary in terms of the national average or anything, and you can build a decent life around it, but I can understand his desire to go for something more, especially if the work is uninteresting for him. Settling into a middling salary job that you don't like (or really any salary job, I suppose) for the sake of security isn't really worth it if you have something else you want to try when you have really highly marketable skills like he has, because he can just go get a $150k+ job at a large company whenever he wants (he's already done that), and he knows it's on the table if he wants it.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@TechLead,"There's an excellent train route. I go from Zurich to Lucerne, into the Swiss Alps (grindelwald/mannlichen). From there, I also visited the Zermatt side to see the Matterhorn mountain, but if you have enough of the alps you can skip it. Then go down by train into Milan, and from there follow the French coast down through Monaco, Nice, Marseilles. Head into Barcelona, down to Madrid, and the south of Spain (Seville, Granada). From there, you can cross into Morocco but I heard it wasn't worthwhile so I didn't do it. Take the plane out from Granada. (My favorite part of the route was really the Swiss Alps, though it is expensive.)",7년 전,0,

And your sister has to get you a job? Doesn't make a lot of sense, dude.  Why does a rich guy have to sublet his tiny apartment to go to Europe?
