@paulhubbard1747,"Crime exists outside of this place because greedy people know it's a money pit legally and illegally. If there was a button u could press and immediately end crime and addiction negativity in general they'd shoot it into space because the second u hit it millions maybe billions would go jobless. No need for police, courts ,jails detoxs, clinics, rehabs, fucking WAR wouldn't exist right so no national guard etc. Millions of family's are supported through crime and law it needs to happen. If u ever hear someone say they became a cop to clean up the streets and end crime look them in the face and call them a liar. That's like someone saying they became a farmer to make it stop raining or a carpenter to kill trees. Crime is the most dependable trade in human history. And when there's a recession in work they create probable cause like crack or racism or defund DARE  and all drug awareness programs 2 years before the Fentynal pandemic etc. We're just cattle on a massive country wide farm Waiting to get plucked and if your lucky you'll be the lucky one to have grown up with love and help and a set of eyes on your back. If not you become institutionalized, u become production, live stock, cash crop. Think about it. And if u get In trouble and a cop calls u scum remind him it's scum like you that keep food on table for assholes like him and his family. Just like rehabs. They tell you they want to help you get clean. But they collect a check at the end of the week. They rely on addiction to prosper.clean up the streets they look for work elsewhere.

@paulhagerty2773,"Dude, get your facts straight. The current lake was formed from an inflow of water from the Colorado River in 1905. Beginning in 1900, an irrigation canal was dug from the Colorado River to the old Alamo River channel to provide water to the Imperial Valley for farming. The headgates and canals sustained a buildup of silt, so a series of cuts were made in the bank of the Colorado River to further increase the water flow. Water from spring floods broke through a canal head-gate diverting a portion of the river flow into the Salton Basin for two years before repairs were completed. The water in the formerly dry lake bed created the modern lake, which is about 15 by 35 miles (24 by 56 km).  Direct quote cut and pasted from Wikipedia",3년 전,0,

@NaniceEllis,"Also, I find it intriguing that Slab City was built over a former (abandoned) military base, and the same is also true for Black Rock City in the Nevada Desert where Burning Man has taken place for about 35 years.   If you research the ""Playa""....the place where Burning Man is constructed in the Nevada desert each year, you'll discover that it too was once a former military base. Either it's just an odd coincidence that both Slab City and Burning Man are both constructed on ""former"" military bases, or are these military bases secretly active?   If Slab City and/or Black Rock City (burning man) are constructed on active military bases, shouldn't we be asking why?   Could the military be secretly using both these ""deserted areas"" as Proving Grounds....where the volunteer participants of ""these ""outlier communities"" (Slab City and Burning Man) could be secretly studied, observed and possibly used in various experiments without their knowledge?   As an example, unbeknownst to the majority of Burning Man participants, there's evidence that DARPA runs experiments and test projects/programs at Burning Man during the actual event.  Honestly, I don't have solid answers to these questions....but rather, I'm just pointing out some odd coincidences. If anyone has any thoughts, information or ideas, I'd love to hear :)",3년 전,0,

Every hostile or violent place I've ever been has times of tranquility.  You might need more than 30 seconds to find that out.  Then she ""falls in love"" with the older man who admits that he is simply ""lazy"".    They see a rock on the ground and it's like, ""Oh look at that rock""...too damned funny!  You notice after all the ""I love this place hyperbole"" everyone left.  No one kicked them out, they didn't have to leave.  Honestly, god bless the people in Slab City.  The older man said it best and  honestly.   Most are there because they don't want a  job.  Again, more power to them, it's their life and their choice.

@Partnerthedog," @hackerreportgaming9371  theirs no  enforcement. I stayed there and never saw one cop, or fed looking car. I rode my dirtbike around and no one gave a crap about anything you do. Their was a burned down motorhome and someone pointed at it and said ""he was the drug dealer, and he ripped some people off"" so they set his house on fire. Theirs a 2 story house made of wood pallets. Cars stacked on trucks with people living in them. Theirs a skatepark there. A giant rusty seesaw that throws you like 10 feet in the air. Poop and garbage and broken glass all over the place, and they purposely trash it so people don't move there. They want it to look gross because any person can technically move there and build anything they want. You can put up a fence and claim land for free, have your own yard. Build a house without violating any codes.. use the solar power. Collect rain, stuff the government would never allow. So that means they do Not follow federal laws. And if someone was like a rapist they'd just kill them and not report it to the police lol",3년 전,6,

The parts of Slab City you always see in these videos are  just the main area or communal areas, it's not a very good representation of what a slab city is . These are basically fluff pieces.  What Slab City really is is a huge area with people living in campers, tents and cars  with shit pits dug into the ground next to them. What you see in the videos is just a small area of Slab City near the entrance.

@alekjames4945," @BruceWayne-pm6co  you’re right it’s the common cold. See normally people get sick twice a year. Common cold, maybe the flu but usually it’s the common cold. The time they get sick is exactly when these “covid outbreaks” have happened. No they’re saying it’s a different strand of covid than the original. Just the same as every time you get the common cold it’s never the same as the previous one you had. Hence why we’ve said and been told all our lives there is no cure for the common cold. There also isn’t a cure for covid 19 nor is there a vaccine. Unfortunately you can’t tell that to these sheep. As far as hugging a stranger goes, or having love for a stranger; until you can view everyone as your brother or sister and realize we are all humans and should exist in peace, love, and harmony then yes it’s strange. That’s third dimensional thinking, and those living in the third dimension; they are deep in the matrix and can’t be saved. Refuse to listen. Refuse to question. Refuse to think. They might as well have an underlying disease with the common covid because living like that; they’re doomed anyways. You want to feel bad for people like that, but ignorance is bliss. You almost wonder how the hell they found this channel on YouTube because they lack any type of fabrications to evolve and elevate their energy and their lives. So back to case in point. COVID-19 is the common cold. The same antibodies in the common cold are found in COVID-19. When church shuts down but casinos stay open, when a governor says you’re not essential and your life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness don’t matter, but Walmart can stay open with hundreds inside; you’ve been played. You’re too deep in the matrix to question the science, but you should really wake the fuck up. You see, the truth is, your governors are bought and paid by big pharmaceutical, big corporations, and media. That’s all there is to it. Open your business up, buy a gun, trash your masks, rip down the plexi glass bullshit and if your governors have a problem,  shut them up, and you can take that how you want, but this conservative Supreme Court has your backs, all of you. Crimes against humanity and treason are being committed by these liberal scumbags and it’s time WE THE PEOPLE take back our lives and livelihood. Or, live in fear with your $600 stimulus check that followed your $1200 one for the year of work you missed. $1800 a year, sounds very China like to me. Wake up. Fools.",4년 전,3,

With the time, people became more enlightened and realised that you did not get that disease from thin air.  Now we have coronavirus.  You can catch it from other people, but this was probably filmed before the pandemic.  Now, in this present time, one has to be careful.  But, in safer times, you cannot go through life treating everyone like lepers.  This interferes with your life and makes you miserable.  Remember,  they probably have the same opinion about you.

My girlfriend and I went there in 2013 and took a wrong turn headed towards Salvation Mountain which ended up getting our car stuck in deep sand on a dirt road.   As the sun was slowly sinking into the horizon we were quite panicked since there wasn’t a ton of information about the area like this on YouTube.    We saw two men throwing out trash bags off the side of the dirt road and I told my girlfriend to stay in the car as I approach them to ask for help.  One of the guys was this man with the beard and another man wearing only a cloth over his genitals, tattoos on his face and leathered skin.    Long story short they took us to slab city, took us to the “mechanic” and the. We rode with him to pull us out, don’t worry we gave them a mice tip.   We didn’t even know slab city existed but we are beyond happy it did.  With no cell phone signal and being stuck in the middle of nowhere these guys were saviors.",5년 전,0,

@quintuplebanned4267,"west coast flava I know you can’t do this, but maybe try.  How would you like to live as a woman amongst men, at any time during history?  Have you watched these guys on YouTube catching child molesters?  How many are women?  I feel sorry for you.  You have to live with yourself.  I guess I’d rather be on the right side being oppressed than on the wrong side being you.  Men have been awful to women for centuries.  Just awful.  I don’t hate men either.  It’s just a statistical fact.  You would never tolerate what we’ve had to tolerate, especially considering you don’t have to tolerate it simply because you are physically larger and stronger.    You did nothing to achieve that power dynamic.  You didn’t earn it, you didn’t choose it. You just choose to abuse it.  That simple.  The cheapest, lowest form of power is to dominate or threaten to dominate anyone, simply because you can, and then justify it later with some bullshit.  It makes you hate yourself.  You won’t know it, because you don’t bother to consider anyone else, but everything in you will show it to anyone with intelligence. Calling someone a bitch because you disagree doesn’t seem respectful.  She can call you whatever she wants, because of centuries of abuse people like you have perpetrated.  It seeps into your dna.  But you really can’t speak to a woman this way, because you are essentially abusing her every single day anyway.  All of your brethren take on the mantle for the other..it’s sad if you are a woman.  It hurts every day in some way whether conscious or otherwise.  I imagine it must be like this for black people as well.  It hurts every day, in some way, and it just seems into your dna.",5년 전,0,

Do you like feeling angry all the time?  Does the anger go away when you put down women you don’t know?  Who most likely, wouldn’t think of hurting you?  Where is your empathy?  Apparently a number of people didn’t have any for you, and I’m sure that felt terrible - don’t aim your rage at the wrong people, aim it at the right ones.  And that’s never going to be some random stranger leaving a comment.  Do you realize how many of your gender are child molesters compared to women?  Do you think you might consider this to humble yourself...I lash out for the same reasons.  But it only helps for a second.  I don’t think either gender is the problem, I think it’s the person themselves and how they choose to manage their pain.  I hope you can see that a little more too.",5년 전,0,

@foxspurplelolli4318,William Herr it’s not your fucking money. SSDI aka Disability is an insurance that an employee pays into. FICA is the insurance on everyone’s paycheck that is used should someone become disabled and does NOT come out of tax payer money. If you have not worked and paid into your FICA for many many years you will not have the required work credits to collect disability. The alternative for folks who do not have work credits is to collect SSI aka supplemental social income and it does come from tax payer money.  So do some damn research before your uneducated ass starts to speak.,6년 전,51,

@anothercasualobserver8764,"Actually the Salton Sea was formed in 1905 from an engineering mistake, not in the '50s. In the '50s It was in its' heyday and was billed as the Salton Riviera. Also the fella that built  Salvation Mountain began a lot more than 30 years ago. I made my first visit there when I was 16 years old and the Salvation Mountain was well on its' way already in 1972. A couple of years later me and some friends from our youth group took him a pickup load of partial full paint cans for his work. My best guess is he started working on it in the mid 60s, a few years before my first visit. I am native to that desert and grew up in the area. When my kids were small they got to visit as well. They're grown with kids of their own now. Back in the 50s and 60s there wasn't any better fishing than on the Salton Sea. It's really interesting to be able to view Slab City videos from the comfort of my cabin 1800 miles away. Thanks for the video!",6년 전,0,

@SethPostal,Just because the place doesn't have established jurisdiction by law enforcement doesn't mean it's outside of the laws of California or the United states.   To say that there are no laws that's actually not true. Sure they might be isolated and the land belongs to either the government or whoever. Yet all property in the United States is subjected to the laws of the country. No matter abandoned or owned.  Sure people can do what they want on private land but doesn't mean there aren't laws. Even if there isn't an established law enforcement for that land.  For example if there was a drug operation happening there and it was reported to the feds. If the tge feds acted on it. That place would be ransacked and people would be arrested because they're on the land of the United States.,6년 전,5,

Industrialization and automation can go a long way to ensure that everyone's needs are met without anyone having to profit over another. If we were to do that then everyone would be way happier. I mean just look at these people. They're living in what seems to be the absence of capitalism, and they seem happy even when they're reduced to shitting in buckets as you said. Maybe eliminating heirarchies and unnecessary soul-sucking jobs really does give people breathing room, reduce stress, and stop people from feeling alienated. Am I wrong?",6년 전,6,

The IRS (which does NOT belong to the government) NEEDS you to work and pay taxes. Granted most of these taxes are put to use to maintain this society in a good way; it's just no for everyone. Those who are not interested in working for the IRS (which is what anyone who punches a clock and pays taxes does) also need a place to live. Now the NON- courteous homeless/lawless would just be mayhem. These folks need to be cast away to their own Island instead of locked up under our tax paid shelters.

When we did, somehow my wallet fell out unbeknownst to me. The next day, after we had reached our second destination, Havasu, AZ, I realized I didn't have my wallet and was devastated. That's the last thing you want to lose, especially during a 3 day traveling bachelor party! On the third and final day, while taking an elevator up to a suite at the Golden Nugget in Vegas, I get a call from the Imperial County Sheriff's Dept. telling me someone found my wallet and returned it to them. I luckily had a receipt in it for a tuxedo rental for the upcoming wedding that had my Phone number and address. I asked if they could mail it to my home in Fresno, CA and they did. I had cash and credit cards and other information anyone could have used or stolen. It was all there when I received it.

@SethPostal,Just because the place doesn't have established jurisdiction by law enforcement doesn't mean it's outside of the laws of California or the United states.   To say that there are no laws that's actually not true. Sure they might be isolated and the land belongs to either the government or whoever. Yet all property in the United States is subjected to the laws of the country. No matter abandoned or owned.  Sure people can do what they want on private land but doesn't mean there aren't laws. Even if there isn't an established law enforcement for that land.  For example if there was a drug operation happening there and it was reported to the feds. If the tge feds acted on it. That place would be ransacked and people would be arrested because they're on the land of the United States.,6년 전,3,

@TWEAKLET,"Over millions of years, the Colorado River has flowed into the Imperial Valley and deposited soil (creating fertile farmland), building up the terrain and constantly changing the course of the river. For thousands of years, the river has alternately flowed into and out of the valley, alternately creating a freshwater lake, an increasingly saline lake, and a dry desert basin, depending on river flows and the balance between inflow and evaporative loss. The cycle of filling has been about every 400–500 years and has repeated many times. The latest natural cycle occurred around 1600–1700 as remembered by Native Americans who talked with the first European settlers. Fish traps still exist at many locations, and the Native Americans evidently moved the traps depending upon the cycle.  The most recent inflow of water from the now heavily controlled Colorado River was accidentally created by the engineers of the California Development Company in 1905. In an effort to increase water flow into the area for farming, irrigation canals were dug from the Colorado River into the valley. The canals suffered silt buildup, so a cut was made in the bank of the Colorado River to further increase the water flow. The resulting outflow overwhelmed the engineered canal, and the river flowed into the Salton Basin for two years, filling the historic dry lake bed and creating the modern sea, before repairs were completed",6년 전,0,

@tanukiZoot," @IdiotBoxProductionsTV  nope. The land is free. Unless you live with someone else, there's no rent. Setting up your camp is what costs money. Solar power could run $7-10k to start, maybe more. Building your house costs money, or living in an RV is also a good option, but functioning RVs cost money, too. You will need money to set up your water (ever seen one of those 600 gallon water containers?) and be able to get it filled regularly, and have money for food, wifi (yes some slabs residents have wifi), supplies, and extra money to pay for unforseen expenses, like if a solar battery goes out or something else breaks. There's no ""jobs"" but you may be able to figure out and provide a service to the locals to make a few bucks, nothing extravagant. It's better to be prepared, those solar batteries cost at least $150 each and you don't have just one... With a decent solar set up, you have at least 10. They don't last forever. When you don't rely on the grid, it can take money to set up a comfortable living space. RV breaks down? Big lofty repair bill, or fix it yourself, you will still need money to fix it. Not to mention, a lot of the retired snowbirds who stay here actually leave may to October, because it's hot af in summer. They travel in their RVs. That costs money, too. You can't expect to live off grid with no savings. It's expensive to set up, but worth it in the end, you will be able to rely on yourself and have peace and time to learn, create, and explore however you choose.",6년 전(수정됨),6,

@SethPostal,Just because the place doesn't have established jurisdiction by law enforcement doesn't mean it's outside of the laws of California or the United states.   To say that there are no laws that's actually not true. Sure they might be isolated and the land belongs to either the government or whoever. Yet all property in the United States is subjected to the laws of the country. No matter abandoned or owned.  Sure people can do what they want on private land but doesn't mean there aren't laws. Even if there isn't an established law enforcement for that land.  For example if there was a drug operation happening there and it was reported to the feds. If the tge feds acted on it. That place would be ransacked and people would be arrested because they're on the land of the United States.,6년 전,7,

The lake starts to dry (takes years) and then the salt water fish emerge. then eventually it all goes back into the salt. They say under the lake is the largest and most pure fresh water aquafer on the planet and when the price and scarcity or water becomes an issue on the planet they will harvest it. At that time I would expect to pay $100/ltr. Some of the water they think is over 5000yo.,6년 전,0,

@Benjahmanmusic,"The term God is love seems to come with a common interpretation that God is an active being that only acts in love, and is used as a justification for genocidal commands throughout most religious texts,  but... ""Is"" means equal or the same.  2+3=5 or 5=3+2, either way they are the same thing.  Love is God without religion, ego or mythology. Love is the reason behind all Good, Fear inspired Hate is the reason behind all bad. The mythologies of Gods and Devils have always just been representations of these emotions or energies that lie within each of us.  If you name your God Allah, or Jehovah. Muhammad, or Jesus. Buddha, Krishna, Shen, Bathala or just plain Love... please stop fearing the beliefs of other people, fear leads to Hate.",6년 전,1,

Back in 2001 a guy killed another dude there in knife duel and had his 3 wittness that it was in fact agreed duel like in Count of Monte Cristo! 2003 government sold that small land to military and they have one small transfer barrack, three jeeps and five dirtbikes and guard soldiers, maybe half platoon, there and fenced perimeter. The soldiers dont do anything except guard it so no duels would happen there and they wont let anyone even near it. Still the government says its free for everyone to go... Not. You are apprehended immeadetely like 400m before you even reach to seeing distance of that area and barbed wire fence and the barrack. Its crazy how government claims to have only small military warehouse depot with no active military personnel there, even still they have about 16-22 soldiers and 2 dogs there 24/7/365. Why wont they change the law?

@SethPostal,Just because the place doesn't have established jurisdiction by law enforcement doesn't mean it's outside of the laws of California or the United states.   To say that there are no laws that's actually not true. Sure they might be isolated and the land belongs to either the government or whoever. Yet all property in the United States is subjected to the laws of the country. No matter abandoned or owned.  Sure people can do what they want on private land but doesn't mean there aren't laws. Even if there isn't an established law enforcement for that land.  For example if there was a drug operation happening there and it was reported to the feds. If the tge feds acted on it. That place would be ransacked and people would be arrested because they're on the land of the United States.,6년 전,0,

An I know Scientific proof of God. There is codes(language) in our d.n.a. in the second layer. Look it up. It even saids a message! An the message talks about a good named Yahweh an that's the 1 in the Bible! An I just got done speaking to God last night after I sung to him for like 2 hours. So I know he's real. He lives in me because of how I invited him in when I made Jesus my Lord and savior. It's amazing to go get saved bro. An God's words are the way of the spirit an of life!

Then someone inevitably tries to force their opinion on others and things can go very wrong, like far right wing Christians and far right wing Muslims do today.

@ponderrous2659,"@ VJ89VJ - I don't know if there's a hell. I think of it more of an awakening. One day I realize how much pain I've caused others and then get to deal with that. I do know there's a spiritual realm beyond what our eyes can see.   As far as capitalism goes, I have yet to have someone who hates ""capitalism"" give me a definition of capitalism that differentiates it from socialism. The ideal of both capitalism and socialism fall tragically short of their reality. The only difference in the real world between the two is the direction of the circle that the power and the money flows. In one, the financial industry funnels money into the government and then back to the financial industry. In the other the government funnels money into the financial industry and then the financial industry flows it back to the government.  @ Chris Wade - Yep, I feel what you're saying. I'm 45 and I see and feel the hamster wheel I'm on more every year. I'm always under someone else's thumb. I'm always expected to perform no matter how fucked up I am that day. I get pounded by my wife and boss for every mistake I make. But I have to please them both or I get to work until the day I die supporting her and isolated from my kids. It makes me want to just walk away. Sure, I'd be without medical care, I'd be at the mercy of the elements. I'd probably die quick and miserable. But I've been places where the animals have never even seen a human. So far from civilization that they come right up to you and sniff. There's a feeling of freedom I don't feel here.   @ re tards - You are still paying interest. Every loaf of bread you buy has interest baked in. The farmers that raised the wheat, eggs, etc paid taxes and interest on their equipment and homes, which they included in the price when they sold it to the baker. The baker likely has a mortgage and pays taxes as well, so he must raise the price of his bread to cover that extra. And then the farmer buys that bread, meaning the farmers cost goes up that little bit more. So his prices for eggs and wheat go up, and the baker must pay more, and thus charge more. It's a loop. Everything you buy, everything you sell, has those taxes and interest passed on to the next guy.  It's the mechanism that drives inflation. You can't escape it. That's how ""they"" get their pound of flesh out of us. They being the government and those in the financial industry.  I don't hate the rich. Some of them made their money honestly. What I hate are the ones who profit off this system that keeps the common man in permanent slavery. Those who think they are somehow ""better"" and shouldn't have to do hard manual labor.",6년 전,5,

@been3060,"First off, ""a system"" is not just one thing. It's made up of many different programs. There are plenty of parts of America's system that doesn't work nearly as well as other places.  For example, Portugal decriminalized drugs and focuses on rehabilitation, while America has a huge, war on drugs which seems to never end and creates a very shady underworld. It has shown no real improvement in stopping drug epidemics and overdoses. In Portugal, overdoses, IV contracted diseases, and drug related crime and murder is way down, and they are spending nowhere near the amount, per capita, as USA when it comes to ""solving"" the drug problem. Portugal is more effective, while USA spends billions of dollars to see no real change.  In that sense, Portugal has a better working one.",6년 전,0,

@QUICKONIONWRINKLE,The Salton Sea disaster was actually in 1905 and they kept some water to it for the farmers and people that lived around the lake but it’s slowly being diverted more and more away from the sea and so it’s evaporating faster than the little water going to it.

@Mx.RumpusParable,"   You likely live near or in, even, community(ies) like Slab ""City"".   Any of the endless Hamlets in NY State are easy ones to point at, for me, as I grew up in one...   Hamlets in NY are unincorporated population zones that can have only a few people or an entire setup of stores, houses,  doctors' clinics, etc.  Same is the case for little areas/communities allllll over the US.  They just usually get either A) mistaken as incorporated areas due to name (like SL) or B) just lumped into the idea of whatever incorporated area they are near or tied to.   Because of B I am ""from"" the Village of H but never lived there... the Village of H is just the nearest town-sorta-place where the hamlet is tied to in a few legal ways and by traditional thought.  Like said, hamlets in NYS and endless ""towns"" all over the US... It's one of those things that is so common no one notices.  I didn't know I didn't live in H until after I was an adult and already left... it's near but not part of. I found out when doing some research for fun about the area.

@Mx.RumpusParable,"Guys, to clarify their legal status I looked into it that night... Yeah, all laws apply.   They are just an unincorporated community residing on state owned land.   They've the same lack of laws a hamlet in NYS or a bunch of friends camping in state land...  That is, all of the laws that would normally apply, apply.  And all of the cops that would apply, apply.  After ending usage of the location for a military base the federal government released the land back to California state control.   California has chosen to let it sit and not develop it into anything else at this point - that's all.  It has the same legal status and laws as any other piece of state owned land.",6년 전(수정됨),10,
@longlivela7963,"yea if you want to make it technical, but with no one to enforce them then what do they really mean? They're basically not in effect except for rare cases where federal agents would come in which has probably never happened. ""Regular"" everyday laws are not enforced basically making it ""lawless"". You're overthinking it. It's not like there's a city with another station down the street where cops would be driving through. Most cops only have the authority to enforce surrounding areas which wouldn't apply here. Also 99% of small country places in the US have police and DNR, this is an exception as are a couple other places deep in the desert",6년 전(수정됨),2,
@Mx.RumpusParable," @longlivela7963  So, a person out camping where the police or other legal enforcement personnel aren't likely to come by any day/month/year without an emergency is someplace where laws are ""basically not in effect""?   That's absolutely silly.  99% of places have local cop coverage in application?  No, even just a few miles from a rural town you can be hours from any realistic coverage by police and many places don't even have official emergency services like fire departments or grid water.  If going off to ""Podunk, Montana"" or open camping where a cop, ranger or even other civilian may not come by anytime soon - or at all, even in a case of emergency, which still also speaks to huge amounts of the US - meant any kind of equivalent of ""no laws""... Well, let's just stop this BS of trying to make this nonsense reality - while a police officer may come by and catch you burying a body in the woods or fishing without a license doesn't mean it's not illegal to do either at that location.  Heck, both of those apply to private property, cops or no, too.   ""A cop isn't likely to be here soon"" is not the same as ""it's not illegal"".",6년 전(수정됨),5,
@Mx.RumpusParable,"And with that, I'm done.  I read up on it when confused and found out it's a completely normal law covered community that just isn't a municipality.

Life has too little wonder some days to not be fanciful when and where we can.  My understanding the facts vs my earlier confusion doesn't mean others have to like those facts.

Jesus died for every last one of us so we could turn our backs on this world, turn our hearts toward each other, and realize the hope and the promise that this world is not what God intended for us.

If you look up the term, it doesn't exactly pertain to a specific number. On the other hand.

I am aware that it will probably never happen, but I wish human beings would cease to adopt these theological notions that have only slowed us down over the ages, & continue to only cause more problems, even today. It just prevents mankind from psychologically evolving, & therefore effecting the progression of various potential advancements made in certain fields, such as scientific, economical, epidemiological,  epistemological, or hell, even ethical improvements. Religion is a stunt in our growth as a species, & due to its perpetual existence in our society, it continues to preclude the total assimilation of our environment, & the mechanics/function of the universe that we reside in amongst our population, & future generations. So, it is far from unreasonable to propose that promoting the abolishment of religious beliefs in an effort to create a worldwide axiom, would not only aid us more efficiently economically, & ethically, but would also aid individuals emotionally or psychologically, so that they may function more properly within our society, & make better real world choices.

@darthbiker2311," @dyinhope6840  Yeah, I grew up a Catholic and we always had to refer to the apostles as San Pedro, San Mateo, etc. When I became a baptist and started reading the Bible myself I realized for the first time how dense the apostles originally were, the most basic ethics concepts we take for granted now had to be taught to them using parables and gestures like feet washing. Jesus' act had a very specific context and if you divorce that context while preserving the act so you can have another ritual for your church, yes, indeed it looks stupid. They still do that feet washing thing on Catholic TV in my country, featuring politicians and businessmen who donate heavily to the church.

@datatwo7405,"Hey COOPERDOOPER, and you believe that all people would fare equally as well should we disband all governments and leave all to their own devices?    Slab City maintains it social rules because they all seemingly​ subscribe to similar social ideals.   And. . .my dahling Cooperdooper,  Slab City is a very small and isolated place, in an undesirable area which further contributes to its uneventful existence.   However, once Slab City is viewed to have something that someone who is more powerful desires, well if you don't see that outcome then nothing I am typing is going to change your thinking.  Try the idea of a lawless and governmentless construct in a mid to large city and you would have anarchy.  It isn't government.   It isn't laws.    It isn't GUNS.    It isn't wealth.   It isn't power.    It's not even good intentions...   It's something WE have very very little of in the United States of Corporations.   It's a culture of respect and goodwill.  Hell, we can't even handle the concept of such a thing because we're simply too selfish and weak.

Someday take your conservative little you to one of the Liberal Democratic-Socialist Capitalistic Countries of Northern Europe. (Ahh yes, they do exist and ​much more successfully than we are.)

@datatwo7405,"LOL, and reading comprehension seems to be an issue here.    I never said that anarchy is exclusively left.  Anarchy is anarchy and that is that. If I am reading between your lines correctly, anarchism is something your find romantic? If so,  then our discussion ends here dear.  Humanity is by no means ready or capable to live without government. And whatever that may be, depends largely on the society, their cultural values and their desire to survive long term as a collective people.    If you subscribe to the concept of survival of the fittest, well then again,   hope will not be found here.  That philosophy contributes nothing to the slow progressive evolution of humanity or the hope thereof. It only leads to more of the same. If you follow the money, honey. Trail it back along the wire and through all the knots and in the incredibly very short time humanity has walked this world we've only evolved technologically and slowly spiritually - ethically if you prefer that word.  So, let me just state this.  I believe and will ever strive for the evolution of the spirit above all else. For myself, that places the material as a tool to reach and aid in that evolution.  As for what evolution means (as we must always remember to try and define our abstractions when speaking to one another) is the slow difficult crawl towards the fantastic, the ideal of Kindness, Respect, Compassion and Charity above all else.  Unfortunately, it is very easy to stay put or even worse - regress. Creation is much much more difficult than destruction.  It is a shame so many are all too willing to let go the struggle because they have allowed their own selfish tendencies (and we all have them) to offer the easy excuse of disbelief.   ... No Virginia, there is no such thing as world peace.  But, if we chose to buy into the easy idea that things are worse then they have ever been, well it only makes our evolution more difficult and ever further down the road.  Because throughout the world and despite what our lovely corporate owned media and fascist-minded business leaders strive ever to convince us of is that the world IS a much less violent place in all of known written human history.  And, this despite our slow hurdely turtlely paced evolution.  Mr. Bell, do you understand what I say?",6년 전,0,

Would we gain any economies-of-scale for the mentally ill, elderly, sick, homeless and starving populations of our country, one or several locations.

Also little to no boats go there during the winter we fly during winter. All the islands we have have a sherif that roams, but doesn't do anything since everyone obeys the law, on this one island sheriffs get shot at so no cops go there. It's the only island the Feds, state or close islands or mainland will touch.

And if you ruined that you’d get consequences. It’s simple human nature. Yet the media portrays people like these as crazy,addicts, or hostile. When in reality they are being authentic and real. Mindfully spirituality and physically themselves. No one wants disrespect and everyone wants love, period! Who controls the media? Government. Who made the laws? Government. Who fucken cares about what you own? What really matters is your character. If your character is shit, anybody can give two fucks of what you own or where you live. But if your character is gold, everything else doesn’t matter. We are all human. We  breathe the same air. And shit the same. All I see is people living their ways without an annoying government always snooping on what you are doing, as long as your doing what you are told and feeding the machine. We all can live peacefully and comfortably with out government if you really truly think about it and weighing ALL the options. All I can say is ask questions... why MUST we live the way we do? So the 1% can live super comfortably, while we do all the work? Consider EVERYTHING into account. Do your research and THINK.

@PatriotCoinRings,"Is there ever really a ""lawless society""?   Okay so I love having debates and this is one that often comes up.  I eventually always run into someone who is totally anti-police state and dreams for the day of anarchy and living in a society with no law.  Often my response is simply there could never be such a society because even in a so called lawless society there are still rules of the land to live by dictated by others and being that there will never be a time where all agree on the same things, you are still forced into a form of law even if it is unstructured and I for one prefer to know the laws are written so I know what I'm dealing with and know although even in a non-perfect world, our nation in the states is arguably still the best there is  ie:  ""be courteous to your neighbor (a law) or they will shoot you (the punishment for breaking the law)"" @5:59.  Would you seriously prefer to live in the understanding that if you piss someone off because they want you to act like them and agree with them or you'll be shot?  Doesn't that force you into a retaliatory position of carrying a weapon to force your own set of rules in response?

We are supposed to be free peoples yet we are hampered every day of our lives by the laws of the elite and I for one don't want that anymore. Is so true what the drift wood artist guy said.. We go through our lives working a job for money to pay for food and accommodation and we wake the next day to do it all over again, day after day and year after year til we pretty much collapse into a vegetative state and die within a few years of retirement. That's not for me and I would hope much of humanity wouldn't want that for themselves either. This was a beautiful video. I get that #SlabCity is a little rough and ready but u could eventually work out the water systems by digging wells to get water that way. I know it's about being totally off the grid but we all need water to grow food and basically survive. If we could live like this the elite would have a meltdown. They know that basically people have been conditioned to having law and order because of the fear of the unknown. There are always going to be those who try to exploit these types of areas or conditions and that's why we will never be able to go back to this kind of society which is a shame",7년 전,0,

@roberthaworth9097,"BS -- county, state, and Federal laws always apply to anyplace in the US, even if there's no functioning town government! There is only ONE place in North America that has REALLY ever been completely lawless, by definition. It was referred to variously as the Public Land Strip (sic), AKA Cherokee Outlet (sic), AKA No Man's Land, AKA the (abortive) Republic of Cimmaron, and it existed on the territory of the current Oklahoma Panhandle from 1854 to 1889. A Federal cartographic error in '54 fixed the boundaries of TX and the other states and territories surrounding the Panhandle such that NONE OF THEM INCLUDED the Panhandle itself, and for decades that landlocked region simply wasn't considered part of the United States. Congress became aware of the error early, but was not interested in fixing it b/c it would cost money to ""improve"" the area with roads, forts, post offices, courthouses, and the like, and the issue became an interparty hot potato, albeit one of low priority b/c of the advent of the Civil War and the need to address other pressing matters. No Man's Land couldn't get recognized by anyone as a new country; the ex-Colonial powers in that region (Spain, Mexico, and France) didn't want it back, having formally surrendered all their claims north and west of a certain line years before. Therefore, since sovereignty over the territory -- which was some 130mi. long by 36 mi. wide, BTW, not  just an ""odd sliver of land"" -- could not be determined, there was no basis for establishing government at any level -- and thus any laws. Federal and state lawmen and bounty hunters soon found they had no power there -- the first few bad guys they hauled into courts in the States were promptly released for lack of jurisdiction. Indeed, crooks ran wild for a long time, but self-help vigilante justice eventually produced a tense balance of power between outlaws and the many honest families in the Strip. Finally, as a direct result of the horrible Winter of 1888 the (already rather thin) economy of No Man's Land, which was based on cattle ranching, gambling, and beer production to serve thirsty-but-dry KS just to the north, failed hard. Crime -- mostly rustling, coach robberies, and the like committed in the neighboring states -- became so bad that the Federal Government was forced to consider sending in troops to impose martial law. Instead, Congress rammed through a bill that corrected the map, and in 1890 Sooners were allowed to overrun the place and make it part of the new state of OK. Google this.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@ct6502c," @ChiotVulgaire  It could ONLY work in a small village with a very tiny population. But even native tribal villages do still have a form of ""government""...there are leaders, usually a group of respected elders who make decisions for the tribe. That's basically a representative democracy, which IS in fact a form of government. The fact is that you can't have a human settlement where it's just a total free-for-all and everyone can do whatever they want. You have to have order, and a system for maintaining order - whether it's a chief and elders in a tribe for a small native village...or a constitutional republic like the government in the US. Despite what all the Millennial potheads in the comments think, civilization would NOT survive without government. It's just human nature. There will always be a small percentage of bad people. The bigger the population, the greater the odds there will be bad people and the larger that percentage will be. So you need to have laws in order to keep them in check. You can't count on everyone having a good conscience. Maybe in a tiny group of 20 people camping together...but increase that number to 200 and let's see what happens.",7년 전,5,

@modemmark421," @ct6502c   - Libertarians Hate America!  (AKA this system which provides Us an opportunity to democratically develop the rule of law for self governance)     This is not My opinion, this is a Fact; Here it is, right from the most important Libertarian leaders, in their Own words:  ""Government (Of, By, & For The People) is not the solution to our problem; Government is the problem"" - Ronald Reagan, tool of the Oligarchs  ""My goal is to cut Government (Of, By, For The People) in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub"" - Grover Norquist, corrupt Oligarch   ""If this were a Dictatorship it'd be a heck of lot easier, just so long as I'm the Dictator... he-he-he-he-he""   -  George ""Dubyuh"" Bush Jr, fool of the Oligarchs  So, Libertarians wish to weaken and ""Drown"" Our system of Self Governance for which Patriots died and Our Founding Fathers risked everything to establish. ""Drown"" Our ""Government Of THE People, By THE People, For THE People"" which my Dad and Grandfather died while defending. ""Drown"" Our Government which all the world envied and tried to emulate; ""Drown"" Our Government which is our means to provide roads and infrastructure for our business'; provide police & fire dept, to protect our homes and business'; provide regulation and legal redress to promote fair and honest commerce; provided education so that anyone could access opportunity and become a contributor to society; for, as the Constitution says, ""the Common Good"" (not just for a greedy few selfish Libertarian billionaires and their ignorant supporters).  NO;  Being Libertarian is NOTHING to be proud of. And the Dumbest of all, are those poor and middle class FOOLS who voted and continue to vote for Libertarian candidates and laws that seek to allow corrupt Oligarchs to ""Drown"" Our Government that our Founding Fathers established for purpose of allowing WE THE PEOPLE to protect ourselves FROM Oligarchs and kings.   Why? Why is it so hard for these poor and middle class simpletons to see that by supporting ""Conservative Libertarian"" candidates and laws, they are causing the ruin of the underpinnings that support our middle class?  EVEN NOW a relative hand full of Libertarian Billionaires, who have benefited the MOST form our national collective prosperity (created upon the creativity, ingenuity, hard labor, and yes; tax contributions of ""We THE People""), those very Libertarians continue their cry ""Drown"" this Government to get it out of the way so that can pay no taxes and ride for FREE, and allow greedy Libertarians to be FREE to poison our citizens (while everyone else pays for the damage); FREE to foul our air (and not pay for clean up); Free to pay little or no taxes (while the hard working American people pick up their tab); FREE to pollute our beautiful waters (and leave a toxic mess for everyone else to clean up); FREE to rape our commons and our federal lands (and never give anything back, and then they say ""oh, but I gave to my own crooked private charity, so now I don't need to pay my taxes""); ALL in the name of limitless private wealth and MORE corporate profits, at everyone else's expense.    Libertarians are trying to ""Drown"" this Government by Lobbying and corrupting the Representatives of WE THE PEOPLE (just think A.L.E.C.) so that they are not burdened with rules of oversight which help prevent corruption; or burdened with laws which prohibit pollution; or burdened with the expectation that even greedy Libertarians should pay their fair share of taxes needed to sustain our commons and our infrastructure; or burdened with indictment and prosecution for their corrupt actions which are destroying the very Country which made them so obscenely rich.  All that these greedy Libertarians (""the 1%"") want is FREE everything; while us hard working socialists (the 99%) pay and pay and pay and pay more than our fair share of taxes so that Libertarians can ride for FREE while hoarding their ill gotten riches!

The few who do live there full time are retirees or people who would otherwise be homeless, most of whom collect government benefits and buy their provisions from a town over.

@ElectronicsForFun,"""No matter what, you're dealing with a bunch of people who for some reason couldn't cope with living in normal society, couldn't keep a job, etc."" not exactly, it's mostly gypsies and travelers. everybody who goes through there or lives there respects the place, they have a library, an oasis club with coffee and wifi for like $15 a month. there are some nuts out there but most of the people you'll see there are just average joes. of course they don't show you those people in the video because that wouldn't be very interesting, but it's a nice place to visit with nice people. every couple of years campers and locals in the city will volunteer to help with repairs on salvation mountain.   ""Now think that you're miles away from any help, and it definitely seems like a VERY bad idea to me to be there."" the idea is that you help yourself and you may also receive help from friends with in the community. that's how libertarianism works, it's a society governed by the people. if some people slip up or act foolish then they are dealt with by the rest of the community as long as the guys are the minority of the community. you can't just go out there and kill some people and expect everybody to look the other way when you walk into the oasis club the next morning.   ""Now think that you're miles away from any help, and it definitely seems like a VERY bad idea to me to be there."" well so is camping in the woods but people still do it, you're miles away from civilization and you never know when a hungry bear is going to come through your campsite looking for your food. you see not everybody is afraid of their own shadows when they walk outside. some people are willing to risk a little danger for a good time. l mean there are people hanging in tents off the side of mountains for christ sake, going to slab city is definitely not the most dangerous idea for a camping trip.",7년 전(수정됨),6,

""the premise for why someone would want to disappear and live in a tent or shack in the middle of the desert."" what's wrong with that? does that automatically make you a bad person? people don't go there because they are running from the law, they go there because that's the kind of lifestyle they like. not everybody wants to be a stressed out city slicker who works 40 hours a week for a boss they hate. some people prefer to live off of the land, and enjoy life instead of waste it.  ""These people aren't just living ""off the grid"" and they're not homesteaders building a cabin in the woods."" yeah they're not homesteaders l never said they were, but they are living off of the grid.   ""They're a bunch of anti-social weirdos who are living in freaking tents and shacks, 100 miles from anything."" you're playing too much GTA 5. the people there are anything but anti social. there is a little area where everybody sits around campfires talking about whatever and there is also a stage area where they have live concerts and karaoke.    ""If they weren't at Slab City, they would be living under a freeway in LA with a heroin needle stuck in their arm."" so all homeless people are drug addicts? it can't be the fact that california is the most expensive place in the country to live with a collapsing economy, no they're all homeless because they love drugs right?   ""Also, get off your libertarian high horse."" how am l on a high horse, if anything you're the one on the high horse. you think people are inherently evil drug addicts because they don't want to live like you. BTW that is how libertarianism works.   ""I'm pretty sure you're a Millennial, so you talking lofty about libertarian ideals is funny."" why is that funny and what does it have to do with being a millennial?",7년 전,1,
@ct6502c,"Electronics For Fun Yes, most people who are homeless are because they're druggies. Or they have severe mental problems...because of years of drug use. The idea of some poor innocent person being on the streets because they lost their job or just had ""bad luck"" is a total myth. It does happen occasionally, but there is help available for people who truly need and want it. Apparently, you haven't heard of all the problems being caused by vagrants in San Franciso. There are needles being left everywhere by bums, to the point that the operators on trains and buses have had to warn people to be careful where they walk and sit. Then there is also human waste everywhere on the sidewalks and streets. I'm glad I don't live in SF, but it's bad enough where I live. Every single day, I see bums holding signs and begging for money...and then I see these same idiots a little while later sitting on a curb smoking weed. These ""homeless"" people could get shelter if they really wanted to, but shelters have rules and they don't want to follow them. They couldn't get drunk and stoned in a shelter. These losers are on the streets exactly because they'd rather be high every day than lead a productive life. So YES, the majority of homeless people are that way because of their own fault. There are exceptions, but in general they are all druggies. That's the non politically-correct truth, but it is the real truth nonetheless. I don't have any sympathy for bums anymore.",7년 전,1,
@ElectronicsForFun,"""Yes, most people who are homeless are because they're druggies. Or they have severe mental problems...because of years of drug use."" that's bullshit, l knew one lady who was living out of her car with her 2 kids because she lost her job and couldn't pay the rent. they lived out of their car for months until she found another job and was able to get a nice apartment. she wasn't a drug addict and she didn't have mental health problems, she was just having a hard time. if l ever see you on the street i'll be sure not to pay you a dime because you would just waste it on drugs.   ""The idea of some poor innocent person being on the streets because they lost their job or just had ""bad luck"" is a total myth."" no it's not, have you never heard of a depression? that's when the economy takes shit and everybody loses their jobs because businesses shut down left and right. since general motors couldn't sustain itself under the last depression does that mean that they are drug addicts because they can't pay back their debts? or what about all of the people who couldn't get work because it wasn't there, were they all drug addicts? don't sit around and think you're safe and your life can't be turned upside down in an instant, l have seen it happen to people you would least expect. in fact it happened to my mother once, she had a good job and was making almost $300k a year she had tons of awards and was in the top of of the company and everybody loved her. she had great job security... then she got a new boss who wanted a new cheaper and younger workforce so he laid off everybody and my mother lost her job. she went from making almost 300K a year to making nothing, and she was real close to filing for bankruptcy and calling it quits because her credit cards were maxing out and she didn't have a dime to her name. it took her almost a year to find another job that didn't even pay half of what she was making at this other company, in fact she had to move, she was in california and couldn't afford to live there so she had to move to arizona in a smaller house in not so great neighborhood. she has been a hard worker all her life and still got shafted by life, is she a drug addict? the answer is no.   ""Apparently, you haven't heard of all the problems being caused by vagrants in San Franciso."" no l haven't but l wouldn't doubt it. california has a lot of professionals but that doesn't mean they are all that way. l mean when l see a guy in laguna beach begging for money with a new pair of nikes and a fresh haircut l usually look the other way.   if you know they are drug addicts then fuck'em, but don't automatically assume that just because they are homeless they are evil scum. same with the slabers, a lot of them live that way because that's the life style that makes them happy. it doesn't mean they are bad people.",7년 전,2,

But what you don't realize is........  You do know that the UNITED STATES is not a country? .....it is a Foreign corporation, located in the Foreign city state country know as the District of Columbia! .... there are THREE SUCH CITY STATE COUNTRIES ....1) the VATICAN CITY, in Rome, Italy, ...but not a part of Rome, nor Italy, ....2) the CITY OF LONDON, in London, U.K., .... but not a part of London, nor the United Kingdom. .... 3) the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA in America, ... but not a part of any state in America, nor the country of America. ...... You need to look this up, if you are claiming to be a U.S. citizen. ....for if you make that claim, you are saying that you are 1) a citizen/employee/slave of the corporation who's on paper name when it was registered in the foreign country city state District of Columbia is in actuality the ""UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CORPORATION COMPANY INCORPORATED"" ... And ALL of the states in America the country that are ""incorporated"", (that includes, cities, counties, and corporations. are all registered as such in the foreign city state country of the District of Columbia.).....This ALL took place when in 1871 Congress was looking for the money it needed to ""RECONSTRUCT"". America, after the war between the norther states of America called the union , and the southern states of America , called confederacy ....they were both America, the country Citizens. ..... at any rate the banker's would only finance America, if the Congress would give the banker's some considerations. !) take land from America, and give it to the banker's by forming a FOREIGN CITY STATE COUNTRY called the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (the name didn't matter to the banker's as long as it was not still American property) ... 2) they must then form a corporation and register it as the ""UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CORPORATION COMPANY INCORPORATED"" (the banker's demanded that this name MUST be the name used! you will find out why later) so Congress did it! ..... they knew they would get the money to RECONSTRUCT America when they did this, and THEY ALSO KNEW that it was a TREASON against the country, and the Citizens of America to do so. ..... So to cover there treachery the bankers had this country America. USURPED by there corporation in the FOREIGN CITY STATE COUNTRY. And a new name was given to our country America by the Foreign banker's. they called it there UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. (in fact it is just there corporation that runs the country, from the FOREIGN COUNTRY the District of Columbia...... and the reason it's registered name is U.S.A. CORPORATION COMPANY INCORPORATED is so that it can have franchises outside of there own Foreign land. .... for instance: In the country of America we have states... Florida state is one of them.... the foreign corporation has a company incorporated in that state, but is not a part of that state, just like it is with the Vatican City not being part of Rome, nor Italy there corporate franchise company in Florida is called the State of Florida ... this is a corporation registered in and for a FOREIGN CITY STATE COUNTRY the District of Columbia. .....It has nothing to do with America the country nor the land mass of America. It is only a piece of paper in a filling cabinet in the Foreign country the District of Columbia. the same goes for the counties, cities, and all the incorporated agencies. Like the police, jails, and court's in, but not a part of the country America. They too have been USURPED by there corporation counter pats.) Take notice: the LAW OF the country America IS COMMON LAW! .....where the LAW of the CORPORATION U.S.A. CORPORATION is Admiralty (law of the sea,...COMMERCIAL LAW) .....Just when was the last time you appeared in a COMMON LAW COURT? ......NEVER!? ....ALL the court's have been usurped in the country of America by the FOREIGN CORPORATION IN THE COUNTRY OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S counter parts.! .....a place where JUSTICE, Has been REPLACED by there corporation's JUST-US SYSTEM .....and YOU MY FRIEND ARE NOT A PART OF THERE ""US"" , and nether are THERE CORPORATE citizen/employee/slave's! ......AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY THEY ARE FIGHTING SO HARD TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS! .....The second Amendment to the first REAL CONSTITUTION was for the governing body, NOT FOR THE PEOPLE! .....It told the governing body what WE THE PEOPLE expected of THEM! .....they were given by WE THE PEOPLE CERTAIN RIGHTS! ....One that comes to mind, and has been changed for there benefit is the RIGHT TO REGULATE COMMERCE. ..... This in NO WAY gave them ANY RIGHT TO REGULATE ANYTHING ELSE! .....Like taxes on WE THE PEOPLE! ....Nor LICENSES FOR THE PEOPLE NOT CONDUCTING COMMERCE!..... those rules and regulations ONLY are to be met out to THERE cITIZENS, / EMPLOYEE'S / AND SLAVES! (NO the lower case ""c"" was not a mistake it was there to show a lower class of citizen, ...... American's are upper case to show they are the owner's of the country America) ..... ALL American Citizens own the RIGHT to TRAVEL on Our Roads in America. ......ALL U.S.A. corporation citizens must get permission from there FOREIGN CORPORATION to use the American's roads, and water ways. ...... American Citizens give there permissions, or they can restrict the Foreign Corporation's citizens from doing so. Why? ..... Because they are all Foreigner's on American Land. ..... If American's go to the District of Columbia, they must follow the rules and regulations and statutes of that Foreign country. ....... this ends YOUR lecture on the differences between the two DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND THERE CORPORATIONS. I sure hope you have gained some wisdom from this lecture! .....And by all means look every bit of it up! ......YOU will be surprised by what you find!

I stopped less than 2 minutes into this video to write this just because I felt I had to share. I can see how some people would just find the Salton Sea gross and scary. And it is! But there is sooooo much more. If you are a fan of movies where mankind has been wiped out and nobody is left ... welcome to the place on earth that replicates that to perfection without trying to. It is deserted all around except for one place, Bombay Beach. And The Salton Sea is HUGE! It takes a full day to drive around the whole thing. There are abandoned houses here and there and you can explore many of them without fear of anybody saying anything or doing anything to you. And many of them still have furniture in them. But completely wrecked from the weather. I've even seen more than a few abandoned boats. Your typical 2 to 4 person type boats are here and there to be found. It's incredible! Incredibly weird! And Bombay Beach is just the weirdest place to cruise through because some house have people living in them, others don't, while others are burnt out and just sitting there like it is normal. Everything about the Salton Sea makes you scratch your head in amazement which is why we were so taking with the place. I could go on and on about the place but I have a life to live so ...

Its 2018...we have been living alongside each other for centuries now...surely we have more understanding of one another than that, no? Our IQs (should) have increased by now. How did a race even live into the modern day if their people commit crimes in their own communities because they are a certain shade of color? Wouldn't they have drove themselves extinct?

@straightedgedirishma,"ct92404 Actually, you’re partially correct. The sea is receding. However, the Salton Sea has a few constant water sources; the New River and the Alamo River. The recession rate has increased since the county stopped allowing agricultural runoff. Additionally, just FYI, the. We River is highly contaminated with raw sewage and industrial waste from Mexico. It’s the most polluted river in the United States. That’s why nobody gives a shit about the Salton Sea. That’s why they’re letting it die. Plus, the Imperial Irrigation District is selling water from the Colorado River to other counties/cities. Nothing to spare for the giant, salty toilet. Nope. They turned a tourist spot loved by celebrities into a wasteland.",7년 전,0,

You will need to take more than 6 beers though as these partys can go on for days. Have fun.,7년 전(수정됨),0,

The water of the Salton Sea is just briny and filled with algae on particular seasons, that make it look uninviting. There are hundreds of thousands of tilapia that live in the waters, and it is also a fabulous place to kayak or take out a dinghy.   Thank you for this video though.

Think about being sick with no means of getting help or medicine, or getting a tooth ache without any means of going to a dentist. Look man, I was born poor. We did have electric, but no running water, or any type of insurance. The town was full of drugs, alcohol and most of the girls were having babies by 15. I chose to focus on what I wanted in life, because happiness is in the eyes of the beholder. I moved away, went to college, got a great job, pay the government more than they deserve, bolted fake boobs on my wife (just so I can squeeze them) and keep my debt at a minimum. Growing up poor I learned that if you want something you must be able to pay for it upfront, or you don't deserve it.... Nonetheless, this place isn't lawless at all. Lenient yes.

People don't like like to admit they fucked up their lives, or completely missed opportunities. It's not ego, exactly.. it's self-preservation. To think it, or admit it to yourself is the first step to suicide for most people.   This is why, often, everyone ends up with a ""well it worked out for the best"" attitude regardless of the difficulties they face. Divorce, unemployment, whatever. Rarely (if ever) are there situations that are totally fucked and put a person worse off in EVERY possible way. There is always an upside.   And what people do, if they are at all functioning, is to focus on that upside, elevate its importance; and simultaneously down-play whatever was lost. That is how people cope with reality. Get dealt lemons? Make lemonade.   So, yeah. You can find people who dropped out of the rat-race at 43 to go live in a off-grid hut somewhere and love it. Of course. Now ask them if they would like to have all the same free-time they currently enjoy, AND a comfy condo, or lake-house as well. Sure, they'll say! But they don't want to work for it, day in day out.  Now go find the guy that got a paper-route as a child, saved his pennies, avoided college to start a lawn-care business, which he then sold later and  is retired at 43.  OBJECTIVELY the second guy is better off, even if he chooses to spend retirement in an off-grid hut. Because it's a totally free choice. He isn't running from a job. He worked his way out of a job, rather than quit.   Nothing wrong with the first guy. I may even end up like him if my current work-from-home gig goes tits up. But if I didn't have my head up my ass when I was young, I'd be the second guy by now.",7년 전,1,

Just saying that, when listening to people's testimony about the choices they made, and how they are so much happier now, you have to take it with a grain of salt.. because 'positive' people are predisposed to that.   Then there is the flip side: negative people focusing on the fuck ups. Gotta be careful of that too.

One man disrespected our home on his 4th bottle of beer, he decided to throw it against a tree, causing broken glass to scatter everywhere.  He was over 6 'tall, I am all of 5'1. When I told him to pick it up, he laughed, I used  stronger language,  he turned to my old man, who saw I had kicked off my shoes, and asked him 'You  gonna let her talk  to me this way my old man's  response was to wipe his hands, and say, 'You disrespected her home, you deserve what you get'.  I jumped up onto the guys back, started  to punch him  in the face with each word I said ""PICK UP THE  BROKEN GLASS A$$WHOLE"". Until he did.

@rustykoenig3566,"+Bobbie Harrsch LOL!!!!! A lot of people laugh at the ""front porch sittin' "" lifestyle and scoff at the idea of that being the ""entertainment"" choice, either that or the 1-2 channels over the air on the tv (if there WAS a tv even).  I live in the city (some would call it a town) but most my family is deep in the ozarks.  I know a family or 2 that have DIRT for their floor.  People ""feel sorry"" for ones like this, but they do not realize that these are some of the happiest people they could EVER meet.    Some say that they are not ""educated"".  That all depends how you view it.  Lets say you have a college degree in IT or Computer Science and you make a sizable salary by designing the latest and greatest line of computer processors.   You may think you are WAY more educated than these ""hillbillies"".  Now lets say there is a disaster and somehow we find ourselves without running water, electricity for a LONG time..... Or you find yourselves lost in the woods because on a camping trip you follow a trail and when you turn around you realize that it was not a trail and are now lost as fuck.  How educated are you then? That degree is not gonna help you out, not even a LITTLE BIT.  Those ""uneducated"" people then become smarter than you OR your college degree and you would want some ""hillbillies"" around as they know what to do and how to do it.  So you see, ""educated"" or ""uneducated"" is 100% and completely RELATIVE.  I love going down home where all there is to do is ""front porch sittin' "" up on top of the mountain.  The people are down to earth, treat you like family, and guess what?  Social networking IS the front porch, not everyone with their heads buried in their phone all day :)",7년 전,9,

@sweetwheatsy,"Thing is, that obviously do they start creating their own order and live somewhat harmoniously with atleast 2 individuals - but there is an upper cap, too. The most important case for an anarcho-society (and, to a certain extent, a communistic one too) is that people have trust for each other; that is only attainable if everyone knows each other, and has somewhat the same goalset in mind and build towards realising that. If too many people start coming, and everything becomes interconnected (like practically all of the world is today), simple mistrust due to not being able to get to know everyone starts happening, and laws need to be put into place for the anonymosity.",7년 전,1,
@DoomFinger511,SweetWheatsy That's a good point you make. IIRC a single person is only capable of holding relevant relationships with about 200 people at one time. Which is about the size of decent tribe.  Once populations break past that point it becomes impossible to keep a society together based on interpersonal relationships. People must then rely upon some form of law otherwise the society begins to fracture.  That's why ideas like Communism work in small societies but always fail once they reach a certain size.,7년 전,2,
@sweetwheatsy,"Exactly. As you mention, that's how they can sustain and work; it's arguably a very good idea right now (especially for young people) to undergo a somewhat-communistic system in collectives/communes, where a permaculture can also be cultivated, and people have respect for each other. That can go a long way to live more sustainably.",7년 전,1,

It is a california class 1 water recreational lake and the state has kayaks and paddle boards for rent. As with any lake, the water away from the shore is the best, the shores are not groomed for waders as you saw in the video.   You can follow the progress of a few brave defenders of the sea  who call this place home as they fight to restore water to their keys, learn about the 501c who managed to navigate policy and politics to save a dying community.

So yes Poo-brain you made a very bad call , Your narrow minded conservative upbringing has failed your dumb ass once again.

The land ownership is under dispute an the reality is the people that live there are only one government decision away from being booted out. The only reason it hasn’t happened is because the government doesn’t have a plan for the people who live there and figure they are better left there. Oddly, the place seems to work. Let’s face facts...most of the residents there are down on their luck...whether it be drugs, mental illness, alcohol or just said fuck it to traditional living.  Most of what is there is a sad state of affairs. Yes, if you get out of line local street justice can be the result but that doesn’t mean your murder wont be illegal.

These found their fit in this place you didn't and therefore you condemn. But in a lawless pal e their is no concept of crime, just that which is morally right or wrong. I see the cover of peace, but I also see the desperation in these people who had the same dreams or hopes as you. And due to poor up bringing or bad people or poor choices they ended up here free from your harsh judgement of them. I'm an out cast I've lived as such for my whole life.

But, I've also run into temperamental and dangerous folks who would drive up to you from out of nowhere, and get out and start angrily yelling at you to get off their land. Even when you had no way of knowing you were on their land.   As a rule, the people who move out to the middle of nowhere tend to be misfits who don't fit into the rest of a ""normal"" town or city society.  They don't like to be around people, they move out there to get away from them, and they can get really pissed when those ""city folks"" come out to their areas.

It was a WWII training base with hundreds of concrete slabs used as foundations for Quonset huts, . It was officially abandoned by the Department of Defense in 1956. The DOD signed a quitclaim deed to the State off California in 1961. The concrete slabs are used as RV slabs for snowbirds during the winter. Contrary to the idea there are NO LAWS, the state provides fire protection through the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, ambulance service is provided from the town of Niland, four miles away, and police protection is provided by the California Highway Patrol and the Imperial county Sheriff's Department.

And come one use your common sense, do you think that this city is normal, if I can even call this a city, there a probably raids made by the police for some meth labs and I know for sure that if needed there are ambulances coming. But this isn't your regular city my dude. But hey these are my 2 cents.",7년 전,3,
@3DLoki,"Sar Jim,  you missed a few other things just like they did..  Salvation Mountain is NOT the ""entrance"" to Slab City AND it is actually a 501C3 (non profit org) the land was bought by a group of people some years ago. no matter what happens to the slabs it can stay put.  East Jesus is NOT Slab City, they are actually a 501C3 (non profit org) who bought and own the land they are on and can NOT be ""evicted"" (unlike Slab City squatters)  LOTS of places in the actual slab city DO have power (solar panels) and they also have their own water as well.  some dwellers there are good honest people just living off the land and whatnot while others are hiding from the law for one reason or another.  To others who replied to the OP, there IS a town very close to the slabs where people go do laundry, buy food etc,  and AT the slabs there is a cafe that serves coffee and has WIFI, as well as a 24/7 library that's a hang out,  AND a community stage where they hold events every week.  search ""slab City"" here on YouTube to see actual stuff from the REAL Slab City!",7년 전,6,

@huricane887,"Well I still doubt an anarchistic society would be as bad as our government wants us to think.Sure there'd still be crime (that's just the nature who're born and raised to be scum),but people would have the choice to decide what they want to do with their lives without being censored just because they don't have enough of the government's precious green papers they call money.With no government everyone would economically be equal in zones where the former rich don't band together.With all of the caves in the country and underground military bases having no occupation,there'd be plenty of room for everyone,though we probably would still need to somehow establish a scientific community within this anarchistic society to further space travel uninhibited.No longer would people be required to have an exuberant amount of college and debts to said college to become an astronaut,you could just start training and after you're done and the science groups accepts you,that's all you'd need.No middle man required.The different personality types of people will most certainly have their own ""villages"".But that's probably just a pipe dream from an optimistic view.

@chrisr3120,"Ruben Hayk Nobody looks like a commie to a commie, especially other commies.  The argument of ""That wasn't true communism"" always strikes me as being an arrogant one, because at the end of the day what the argument really is trying to say is more along the lines of, ""If I was the dictator then I would have implemented communism the correct way"", which is rather akward given that it is typically used in response to the long track record of past dictators who apparently failed to do so, and that really is the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is that the argument actually proves that communism is even more fucked if nobody on the planet, no matter how devout a commie they claim to be, can even get their shit straight enough to properly adhere to their own principals.  Somewhere in between these two options lay the third option that communist principals are just so subjective and nebulous that no two people can ever see eye to eye about what communism is. In which case, it's always going to be fucked due to infighting.  No matter which way you cut the commie pie the filling is always going to be made of shit.  All communist regimes, barring only those that adopted some sort of psudo capitalism in their agriculture industry, whether you want to accept them as being true communist states or fake communist states or even true communist states that went off the rails to become fake communist states or whatever... They all have one thing in common, they've all managed to fuck up something as basic as food production despite having ample resources and technology to produce more than they need.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

I miss traveling so much seeing this brought a lot back. Also be aware this life is very hard that's why people just live in social construct instead. My road family are amazing.

Back at Nomadic Tribe state, there was a communistic system but no wealth and no health care it seems people were happy more than but the battles over resources with other tribes normally mucked up things. Have to get rid of all but less than 100 million people to do that probably even less. Your idea would be wonderful but large numbers of people cannot be sold on it as it goes against humans predatory selfish nature. There is hope though as shown on Original Star Trek once power, maybe fusion will do it, is nearly free and you have more advanced 3D printing called replicators society will be so wealthy that money is no longer required and everything you need is free to all.

She had to find her hubby and she found him in another location beat up bad. They were taken to the hospital by a nice young woman about their age. The raped woman woke up in the pirate district. Jan 28, 2018 it just happen a week ago. Their belongings were stolen and they were originally heading to the hot springs when they were kidnapped and the woman taken to the pirate district.

@irishslaves7728,"The United States alone accepts ""each year""—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide. If you think the U.S. cannot turn into a third-world you're sadly mistaken. The ratio in America now is 3 to 1. For every 1 logical, hard working person there is now 3 of these irrational, violent, thugs running our streets. These thugs are producing 5 to 1. For every one of our babies we raise, love, and care for they are having 5 how are neglected, beat, and unwanted because we pay for them to do so. The elites have/are forcing “the people” to give the trash of our society money to out-breed us all.  It is past time to get brutally honest about our children’s futures. If you look into ""The Bell Curve"" you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, it is politically incorrect to speak about it because it's considered ""racist"". Quit allowing them to dictate what is morally right or wrong. We the people are being held back and dumbed down through our televisions, schools, jobs, etc... East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc. Intelligence has nothing to do with knowledge. As we are seeing today, history is being bent to spread their propaganda, facts are no longer being told, and everything is made to look as if mythical stories were fact now. Who has the ability to control what we are being taught, what we see and hear on television, and everything? It is not our government people. Something is feeding everyone ""white hatred"", causing us to pay for trash to not only to produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQ's into only the ""majority white"" nations around the world. And you choose not to think about it????? What about the future? What about your children? The saddest thing is not WAR, it is the people’s loss of thinking that something is worth fighting for. You are forced to send your children off to these institutions were you have no idea what they are subjected to, nor what is being forced into their brains. Back in the day, one could work while the other stayed home instilling morals and values into a child’s mind. Now days both parents must work in-order to just pay the bills. We cannot afford to ignore this anymore people.  In the year 2000, there were 7 countries without a Central Banking system, Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and Iran. It is no coincidence these countries were/are under attack by the western media. Now there is only one major nation without this central banking system, North Korea. Yes, there are small islands without this system, but even counting them in, more than 99.9% of the world’s population now lives within a central banking system.   Divide and conquer, sound familiar?  These schools bread “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege alone. Every race has been enslaved and been the “masters” at one point in time. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/ The media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as too lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU Obama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths.  Following all this, the banking system is doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come into these (once majority white) countries around the world. These elites want to stay on top and in control. What better way to do so than flood the earth with stupidity? ISIS tells children and teen, who are very uneducated, to wear bombs that explode outward. They tell these kids it is the only way to get to heaven and be a hero. Those pricks are no different from the elites behind this monetary system, and the politicians in this country. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM   The rules, or principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. https://youtu.be/uMfk5UeGw4E As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered through all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs, or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”? It must be nice to get everything you want from the government in order to ‘get the black vote’. It must be nice to “be free” to say, and do whatever you want. It must be nice to have Hollywood always present you in a positive light. Blacks have ‘no-go zones for whites’ all over our beautiful country, and if a white goes in they would most likely be beaten, robbed, raped, or murdered. If whites had these kind of ‘zones’, they would be prosecuted to the fullest. When are we going to wake up and realize these things are taking place in America and around the world? Our mass-medias and governments have been bought, and they are spreading hate to the millions of uneducated people. Wake up America before it is too late, we are all slaves to this monetary system, and we must unite in order to change anything. Fight for it, or it will never happen!!! Think about what this country will be like for your children, and theirs.",7년 전,0,

The Salton  Sea  was created just after about 1900< a history stated between 1905 and 1907, not 1950 as your video stated............. Before that it was a dried up prehistoric Lake , and a accidental  diversion of the Colorado river refilled the dry lakebed somewhat ,  , then that dead sea developed a ecosystem that had been dead ... First. Shrimp and a variety of  different wildlife grew then fish .the imperial valley became a major agricultural producing area  with more availability of water.,which is greatly declining now  Water availability has greatly declined, and the lake is increasing in levels of salinity , gradually killing everything in the ecosystem  , and some rescue plans are being considered . That prospect is not doing well at all.  That ecosystem has collapsed  a great deal from what it was before  and sewage from the2 mexican cities of Mexicaly and Caleixco dump their sewage in there, including their industrial wastes , and agricultural runoff. The Mexican  cities actually dump in at the Southern End of the Salton Sea....................................... The entire area is in a stage of very rapid deterioration, and though it hasnt happened yet it is estimated very soon  a rotten egg smell will be able to reach all the way to the coastal cities .

@ineffablebeing4276,"truthseekers “you are the naive one” nice attempt at deflection. But alas it isn’t an argument. I don’t assume no one can be happy all the time. I know so and I have given you multiple examples why as well as show you the flaws in your beliefs. So you resort to personal attacks and condescending remarks basically “well yeah, well you are unhappy, hurr durrr” I experience the full range of the human condition. Not just happiness. I experience pain, rage, joy, curiosity, awe and much more.  My way of life is to be human not some drone that think it experience one emotion for all of its days. Even though it can’t because it’s impossible because nature deems it so. Essentially damming itself to live a false hollow existence “Life sucks for you eh?” Life is going well for me actually, I’m on the path to becoming a pilot and achieve my dream of flying. “Dumb, you make bad choices” It’s a good choice, I will make a shit ton of cash right off the bat. It’s a booming field as well. Funny you cry about me making assumptions yet here you are making them. You are a hypocrite. At least I’m honest with myself and don’t lie and say “I’m always happy” on the basis of false beliefs that contradict reality. You have yet to argue any of the points I made.

@ineffablebeing4276,"truthseekers oh my, your hypocrisy knows no bounds. Now your argument is just full of assumptions, name calling and projections. “Your shit load of cash going to make you happy.” No, but it will satisfy my basics needs such as food, drink, housing, leisure. Which is fine. “You take a lot of words to say nothing” coming from the guy who has been taking out of his ass for the past few hours with nothing to back it up. “Just because you don’t believe it to be so doesn’t mean jack shit.” Yeah actually it does, because I have reason to not believe it, and have given you reasons why it is so. You just chose to ignore it because it goes against your beliefs and proves them invalid. That’s cognitive dissonance. “I have no cognitive dissonance or delusions of happiness” oh you do, your past comments and overall lack of an argument to defend your beliefs have proven that. As for calling you names. I’m just merely giving you a taste of your own medicine. Tastes bitter doesn’t it? “You have fake beliefs” coming from the loon who watches conspiracy videos “I bet you are a religious cult nut  to boot” how so? What evidence do you have to support your claim. You are the one spouting new age metaphysical crap. You are more likely to be the cult nut here. “Does god make your lame decisions for you” Nope, it was my own choice, no gods involved. “You are the drone who think the booming field of being pilot is awesome.” Hey it’s a lot more realistic then feebly trying to be happy forever and nothing more. Also what does my career choice have to do with this? You are just grasping at straws at this point in an attempt to insult me. Also, what is it you do by the way? Are you ashamed of your lot in life? “Your are the bird brain that thrives on depression and sorrow” no I thrive on logic and reason not metaphysical hogwash and beliefs that are outright false and have been proven false. “You fucking fucktard lol, you make me happy, I like to swat you know it alls, your reply will prove me right, it triggered you” first of all you just said I thrive on depression and sorrow, yet here you admitting that you like “swatting people down” mmm hypocrisy. The last part of your response just proves that  I have beaten you so hard that you have to make up a fairly tale to protect your ego and false beliefs. You then go on to to prove me right by throwing insults without any argument. No counter points or anything.” Your reply will prove me right” buddy you are dead wrong and you know it. That’s why you are just trying to tell yourself you won at this point. Even though you got your ass handed to you by me. You still have yet to refute the points I made a few comments ago, because you can’t. Why? Because you are ignorant and don’t have a leg to stand on. Now you are just spouting off foolishness in order to hide your failure. You just keep proving me right. You then have the audacity to call me a YT troll yet you haven’t once made a single legit argument, and stoop so low as to basically say “lawl you are triggered” like your are some sort of immature high schooler. You are absolutely pathetic to the point it’s laughable. At this point you are just talking out of your ass. But go on, reply. Reply that you can prove me right and that I can crush you even further.

Although the body of water was 4x as large as it is today and has always been a place that water would be filled up and would drain with numerous storms over centuries. The body of water built up has over 10’s of thousands of years. It wasn’t until the early 1900’s when farming boomed in the nearby Imperial County and the need for water for the farms and a railroad line that was placed to haul goods and that’s what help kept the body of water to were it is today. Most of what is of today of the salton sea is a human disaster.  The toxic water is actually from decades of water run off from the nearby farms (north of the sea and south of the sea) that uses of pesticides and not from the sewage from Mexico.  I’m from the area and studied the history of the salton sea.   People have been trying to fix this disaster for decades and even Sunny Bono tried desperately to help fix what man has caused. I even own land in salton city because it’s just such a wonderful place and the history that goes with the area.

@1SafetyAngel,"You guys were so nice to show your respect to the people you met in slab city. The recognition and hug you gave that man was priceless to him. This global society has become a heartless selfish world where no compassion nor caring is given to the heartlessly cast out of society members. I watched some totally mindless insights into how the rich and the celebrities live in their selfish world of indulgence without a care for any one else . The extremities between the rich and the poor are too extreme and the cruelty humans show each other will destroy this race. There should not be poverty!  There should not be ill people living on the streets!  There should not be families fighting to put food on the table for their children.  There should not be poverty nor famine There should not be any of this at all.  The homeless people the mentally and or physically disabled in our community are just walked past as if they are lepers. I'm grateful for a place such as slab city that can be their shelter their home and they have the security of other like minded people to be their family. I'm so sad that in this day and age human beings can be so cruel and heartless to each other. Humans are on the top of the food chain but humans are the dumbest as they eat devour and destroy everything below them including our home this planet. That's not smart it's stupid for as the old saying goes ""you never shit in your own bed"" and that is exactly what humanity is doing to itself. Humanity is quickly destroying itself. Chief Seattle once wrote ""If you sleep in a soiled bed you will suffocate in your own waste. It is the end of living and the beginning of survival""why does no one listen? Why do those who dare to question the cages of the systems we as human beings are jailed in get classified as crazy then medicated then institutionalised or out to n the street homeless. These are people who have suffered yet no one cares. Why? You may all cast a stone of cruel judgement on those way less fortunate but your bad karma will come round one day for the laws of the universe are powerful and you cannot and will not be able to pay your way out of your punishment. Stop being so bloody self centred and selfish and start stopping and caring. We are all human beings!! One race One planer One Chance",7년 전,2,

If you want to have the real Millies experience then bake for just 7 minutes, till the cookies are just setting - the cookies will be really doughy and delicious. Otherwise cook for 10 minutes until just golden round the edges.Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they don't all get eaten straight away!",7년 전,0,

@YOURmom-zv8be,"@vachief yes, but those weren't the words of Jesus. Jesus would be fucking PISSED if he came back and saw how wrong people went with his story. Hayzoos happened to dislike organized religion and taught the message of love tolerance, kindness, equality, and to share what you have. Not to hoard and point fingers and falsely quote the words he may or may have not said. And yes, I'm Christian. I think any religion that says it's the ONLY way, condemning anyone else's experience of God is simply perpetuating the very thing the right hand cherub/gay lover of God, the highest Angel who gained a third of God's heavenly people to follow him was cast to earth to reign Supreme is working to propagate... Eating the flesh of our father and drinking his blood. Sure. Jesus would approve. My point is all of that is bullshit. The dirty jews were logical people. There are many catholic rituals you know nothing of. There are extreme Christians. Do you think Christ intended for there to be a Christian crusade. No. Christianity wasn't even a ""thing"" until white kings got ahold of some paper and paid the priests to create a book made to placate the masses.

@Jarance,"""Think what it implies when you say that a country needs leaders. In your day-to-day life, you interact with all sorts of other individuals. And that's all society is: the collective name for lots of INDIVIDUALS. But for some inexplicable reason, we're taught to believe that one huge, arbitrarily chosen assortment of individuals (the ""citizens"" of one human livestock farm--I mean, ""country"") need some control freaks acting as intermediaries in order to interact with a different arbitrarily chosen assortment of individuals (the ""citizens"" of some other human livestock farm--I mean, ""country""). Because gee, how could I and some random person in the middle of China possibly leave each other alone if we didn't each have a gang of narcissistic sociopaths claiming to ""represent"" us? Oh, wait a minute. That's exactly how and why pretty much ALL wars happen: because different gangs of power-happy psychos pit their pawns against each other in violent conflict, while claiming to ""represent"" subsets of humanity.

Then Apple had it's shit hacked by the government which now probably has your exact face on file, so any time you go anywhere corporations and governments probably have your exact face on file. Meaning everywhere you go you are being tracked even when you don't have an electronic device. So you are under constant surveilance from people trying to sell you shit, someone trying to arrest and others just watching everything you are doing.

@gabeismae,"H. B. Lawrence Coming from someone who has been born and raised in poverty, recently has become homeless, and actually enjoyed being homeless more; you seem to understand that this is not an easy lifestyle. It is hard work every day, a complete lack of all daily comforts you have grown accustomed to, and everything you call yours needs to fit in a backpack and in your hands. To me, that is real living. Society is just as they described in this video. You wake up to do a job you don't like to pay bills you don't want to, hoping for a vacation that will fit into your life outside of work. This lifestyle, your life is work. Every day is a feeling of accomplishment that you got something done. Living by trade instead of money is incredibly liberating. Slab City is a very harsh location for this lifestyle, but this lifestyle is playing the best game of cards you can when you've been dealt a shit hand. I personally don't like to settle down somewhere, keeping on the move. The only time I would really consider settling down in any kind of society would be in harsh seasons such as winter. And I would chose a liberated society such as this or the rainbow family over what you believe to be society any day.",7년 전,7,

The living conditions here are completely asinine; and while a very small small fraction of population may be able to get by in this kind of community, the living conditions needed to support the human race would certainly need to be different to support actual families. The people that live here have already had their lives stolen from them in one or another, so all the more power to them to try to keep something like this going. It's only managing to get by though because of a de facto ""If you try harm me or my kin, we will intervene"" kind of understanding.

Saying you hate an entire race based on the actions of a few is ludicrous because each individual is responsible for their own actions.

I mean considering that good, bad and the idea of morality isn't real as they are based on ones on perspective. Its why hitler thought so highly of himself.

That makes sense. Why don't you use this energy fighting for people who are oppressed instead of defending white people again. White people have enough support to where my comment won't make a difference because NOBODY will stand up against white people even yourself.

@Apøłłø-Corvinus,"Anarchy is peaceful, people jump between dimensions with little regard for the compexities. To elaborate first (dimension) there's the individual, then his interraction with another, then within society. An anarchist state cannot exist without anarchists. My point is, it's one thing to be an anarchist, and another to want an anarchist community/family (community in a functional state is essentially an extended family) and an entirely different thing to want an anarchist state.   If anyone's genuinely interested in the topic I've done countless hours of academic research on the matter, and I love the heroes of the anarchist cause Proudhon/Gandhi/Tolstoy/Alexander Berkman/Kropotkin, Bakunin - each with their own unique flavour of this magnificent ideology, I heartily recommend them despite finding flaws in the grain of their logic, despite that there is plenty to love (and so easy to follow their lines of thought, except Stirman, you quite literally have to think like him to understand him).  I personally recommend Alexander Berkman's ABC of Anarchism - it's an excellent starting point.  Also the argument we would all murder each other in a stateless society (not one without 'laws', but one without authority, common sense and courtesy - respect those are laws of brotherhood, not a gun to your head that says do thus or don't do this or you'll be shot or locked up) is actually a point for anarchism. In ""civilised"" life we are not bred to be independent autonomous individuals (like a  child being raised to stand on his own two feet one day), authority needs us to rely on it. Anarchy is freedom, it requires neither the abolition of the state/authority or what have you, it removes your dependence on it and requires nothing, just simply realisation that it has no hold over you, never has.",7년 전(수정됨),3,

@Apøłłø-Corvinus,"I know youtube comments ain't exactly the best place to have a reasoned discussion, but if we're going to do it number one must is solid definitions. First what is anarchy? What is an anarchist? What is anarchism? These aren't hypothetical questions, it's literally the tip of the iceberg, answer those first before you delve deeper or you'll be lost in false conceptions, reading through the comments I'm definately getting the sense that people are definately not on the same page.  If anyone is interested in my findings - anarchy is freedom, total freedom to be precise. The question then is what is freedom? Surely being able to do anything you want without repercussions you say. Wrong, every action has consequences, period. This is why anarchism is often dubbed a pipedream by many because they get lost at the basics. Freedom is discipline (consciousness/awareness), it's about being conscious of what you're doing and why you are doing it, it's about knowing what you are letting in (so how you take on new information critically/academically) and how you present yourself/what you let out into the outside world/specific audience consciously (so being aware of the consequences and factoring them in, not out of fear, but to get a desired result). Now most Anarchist thinkers align the definition of anarchy to anti-authority (some anti-violence, since the state operates via violence so that is why it is opposed etc), because they believe that their freedom is being impeached by power/authority's violence, both direct and coercive. Simply removing government/authority would not set you free though, it would give you additional opportunities to be free, but in of itself it does little. Besides, having the discipline I mentioned would mean that government has no coercive capacity over you, there is no need to overthrow it. But it can/will kill me or imprison me you say, it must be opposed! You can't have the cake and eat it, anarchists live by the laws of nature, you make your bed and you sleep in it even you are punished under the artificial rules of government/authority, a prudent anarchist may adapt how he presents himself to survive longer, but make no mistake there is no indefinate life on this earth it's obscene to think that way. Coercion loses its potency the moment you stop being afraid to make your own decisions and finally decide to develop along a path of your own choosing regardless of what the outside world thinks (now depends on what you want, you may care about what they think, but then you go about it by moderating your external capacity, not your internal one). This ofc terrifies people, truth and real freedom can be terrifying, to most their delusions are the flotsam that keeps them afloat, truth doesn't set them free, it drowns them, just like the water of knowledge can be quench your thirst and drown you as well.   Almost all the key anarchist thinkers were peaceful/non confrontational (except a few ofc, Bakunin comes to mind) as they didn't need be violent, they merely realised that to achieve freedom they needed nothing besides themselves (but since we're humans ofc, we must interract/live in the world with others so we keep ourselves adaptable/maleable, but our insides are disciplined and organised).",7년 전(수정됨),1,

@HBMHD,"+Ivor Well, if we're going for literal meanings, anarchy just means without hierarchies; which, in turn may sound like ""total freedom"", but this is more of a popular interpretation. Freedom is not tied by any means to discipline, but people can manufacture a discipline for a ""free world"", no doubt; the problem is, in order to have the same discipline, we need to have the same ideology, and in order to have actual anarchy (no hierarchies) we need to have equal skills and minds, and that will never happen.  Let's imagine we're tribesmen, and you and I are the same aged men; but I like hunting, and you like cooking. One day our village is attacked by a pack of lions attracted to our food and half our cooks and hunters die; the next day we decide we need cooks to help hunting and hunters to help cooking. In that scenario, while we are out hunting, you will have to follow orders from me as the most experienced hunter, just as I would follow your orders when we are cooking; I am the boss in the fields, you are the boss in the kitchen  Hierarchy.",7년 전(수정됨),2,

@Apøłłø-Corvinus,"+HBMHD Aye, anarchy is about deciding your leader, leadership is a standard part of human relations, when two human beings come together one must dominate even if a little (in history women have predominantly took on the ""follower"" role, but that's besides the point though), anarchy is not about a lack of power or no leaders, it's about able minded human beings knowing who or what a leader is, a hiararchy not based on precedent or structure but consent to the true meaning of the term. Nowadays in Western society consent is essentially assumed if 20% of the voting population votes for you and left at that, I find the very notion absurd. It's why we see countries breaking up into workable pieces (case and point Spain atm, or Crimea in Ukraine though that's a different animal altogether).  Anarchy is not about having no authorty or power relationships, it's about free association, the ability and reason to realise why someone is leading you (since you freely surrender to their actual professional superiority), not because of a title or because enough people voted for them, but because in function they are more successful and you have the capacity to realize that, an ignorant person won't.

@HBMHD,"+Ivor That is the biggest problem with a failed movement: Lack of identity.   You see, what you described is called Anti-Statism, not anarchy; the simple idea of ""a leader"" is a status of hierarchy. While anarchy's concept is plain and simply inconceivable because it tempts against our nature, anti-statism does have a concept, but it would be chaos in today's standards; a free world without state, means no rules and no laws, and based on our historical background, that wouldn't work the way it works with a state.  Are we evil like that little +Forrester Marloe kid says? No, but we are animals, and animals can be cruel and selfish; the only thing separating us from them is our intellectually designed system that brings peace and order (relatively speaking).

@Apøłłø-Corvinus,"I actually agree, I received a distinction for an assignment highlighting this point, much the same way as I did with in my first post on this comment section, an anarchist society/state can only exist with anarchists, if its inflicted as we are now there would be chaos and mayhem not becuase of anarchists but because ordinary people are in a state of dependency on the current structure. How the state should operate is to nurture people to be self sufficient (just like raising a child), to be able to function at a civil level even if the state ceased to exist, the proplem with this ofc is that it eventually renders the state/authority redunant (or reduces its actual ""power"" over people, power being the ability to influence others), since it would reduce its effective coercive/direct power, ofc you need highly educated people like that to keep the system running, but only a small amount, that's why only a small percentage of the population have a degree.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

He just wanted to step away from all the bullshit in this world.. I can't blame him. If he's happy then shit, more power to him. He may not have nice things or all the necessities we have, but he's living peacefully and happily.. What more could a man ask for? For all the people who are calling him and I a dumbass, ask yourself is he the one who's thinking logically or are we? Why live life the way everyone thinks you're supposed to? Live life the way you want to. Sometimes you gotta look at the bigger picture in life, step aside from everything, and ask yourself, is this really how life is supposed to be?

@mikemcrae3163,"Insane is just a way for the insane to blame the insane..for being insane...normal is insane, as insane is normal, no one can say who is sane or insane as we all are insane...look at the human race from a 3rd person view.. and you will see... when a person gets plastic surgery to fix issues they think they have with there body..or when a politician tells a community how they should live, vs how ""they"" really live..or the lies and deceit from our own government. If people would care to open their eyes and see the things that control them, then they would realize the normal is not so normal. Just fish in a tank waiting to be fed..hoping our owner comes before we die.. honestly lawlessness, or having laws makes no difference.. the human race will always be dysfunctional no matter how hard we try to function ""normally"". We will never be normal because normal does not exist.. we are all different, what one person might find abnormal, another may find normal; as an example, some people like peanut butter and jelly  and may find it abnormal to make a peanut butter and banana sandwich.. and the peanut butter and banana person, may find it abnormal for someone to make a peanut butter and cucumber sandwich.. point is they are all sandwiches, does it matter what goes on them..to make them normal? We live to die..or we die to live, its all about perspective and believe; the human race truly knows nothing about itself..how we got here or if ""here"" is really even a place. Nothing is for certain, we just think it is. We fill up our daily lives with entertainment or other meaningless endeavors to mask the fact we are truly lost, and have no idea what is up from down or down from up, whats right or wrong. We try our best to figure out what works but nothing truly does. One thing may work in the favor of the individual pursuing a solution to a resolution, but it may cause another problem to their solution, They will never truly achieve a resolution to there problem just endless circles. The issue is mankind does not understand itself, and will never understand itself. We are not meant to understand ourselves, we are meant to live with free will, its how the universe works. Look into deep space, observe how things move, and what moves them....everything moves freely, but nothing moves with out reason; same goes for humanity, we may move freely but not without reason. Like space we are vast, and unknown.",8년 전,45,

@ATF1496,"I appreciate the way you think, but you have to remember that insanity is really just a word that we have created to denote madness, it gets thrown around a lot and isn't used in a medical sense anymore (it isn't even a valid diagnosis). If that man actually had some type of documentation of ""insanity"", he's more likely referring to a specific mental disorder, and those are just as real as the flu is. Is Alzheimers just an example of being different? No, I suppose the brain is literally deteriorating in that context, but something like narcissism is very real and actually inhibits ones ability to live their life, develop and maintain relationships, and generally has a negative and challenging impact on a persons personality.   Nothing makes any sense at all, perhaps, but that deals with a larger question that nobody on this Earth can answer for certain.",8년 전,3,
@mikemcrae3163,"True but whether a word is used a lot or not it is still a word. Just like any word in the English dictionary; I may have chosen to use the word ""insane"" yes; simply because it is the word of choice by the individual in the video. I could have used many other words to describe what a mental illness is  but I felt using ""insane"" was appropriate; Perhaps I was wrong and that is fine, just chatting is all. Sharing my opinions on the topic; I do appreciate your insight though. You seem knowledgeable and have a sense of thing's; but keep in mind that, mankind creates diagnose for illness.

Now you might be right there could be some EXTREMIST LIBERAL that want more successful people to pay through the nose tax wise but for the most part liberals AND people on the right are level headed it's when you get to extreme(on both sides) it leads to problems",8년 전(수정됨),3,
@mandalorian4620,"MichaelVitello  well, allright, I think you have good points. Personally I don't think that rich people should pay even more taxes (I dont know how it is in the US, but where I live, they have to give 60%, which is allready ridiculous). But I think that we spend too much taxes anyway, considering how our countries are throwing them away. The best step would be more control to a truely elected regional council (which actually exist, but in my country (germany) they have no power, we are actually still centralized like the Nazi regime), which determine how much money will be allowed for which projects. Or to be more direct: the people should decide which should be the priorities (democracy, remember?) For example we spend millions if not billions of euros to the elbphilharmonie in  Hamburg lately, which is useless to anybody outside Hamburg, we pay (and will pay for years/decades since they wont work) for everything the asylants need, while at the same time they need years to get the allowance to work (because the current leading government fucked up), while at the same time we have increasing problems in the poverty of old people. The average asylant in germany is actually richer than a retired person, even though they are the reason why Germany became a dominant country in europe again after WW2 and the asylants (de facto: immigrants) (who are to about 90-95% men between 18 and 35 years old, judge how you want) will probably be able to live on social aidings forever. I see myself in no political spectrum, since I think the ""democracy"" as practised today is an insult to the democracy of the ancient greeks. I consider myself a realist, in that i try to leave emotions/prejudices out of my mind.",8년 전,2,

Look up the statistics of violent crime and murder in Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas.... two cities that sit directly next to each other. What do you think keeps people from Juarez just walking right over into El Paso?  To be 100% honest with you I don't even really care about the wall. That sentence popped in my head one day. I thought it was kind of funny and made it my handle on YT. I don't think the ""wall"" needs to be an actual physical wall but I do see first hand everyday what illegal immigration does to my business and to other small businesses in my area. It hurts American citizens who try to do the right thing like keeping their business licenses up to date, maintaining insurance, and paying workers comp.   Watch 'Top Democrats All Agree' on YT.

The Klan, as it stands today, has an estimated 5,000 members. Considering there are a little over 3,000 counties in America that leaves the Klan with a whopping .6 members per county. Lol. In Charlottesville, those idiotic ""Nazis"" couldn't even get 200 people together for a planned event. And they drove from all over to get there according to some of the statements I've heard and read. Hardly a ""movement"" in my opinion.

There's a ton of normal people who go there only in the winter, and very few full timers (it gets upwards of 120 degrees in the summer, so you need a lot of solar panels or a big generator) Theres one full-timer couple that had a big screen tv set up under a canopy outside, and he and I talked about the video games we played",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@Iamdragonman,I am interested to understand what lawless means? Laws are only set up by the government to 'control' us sheep!! A decent human being does not need a law to not kill someone!! For instance....you are breaking the 'law' by smoking a plant?? BUT if you smoke a cigarette full of chemicals that WILL kill you its legal?? Go figure? The human race is f**ked up beyond all repair!! Slab city sounds a step forward but I guess thats all drug induced anyhows.......so not that different to 'normal' life then!!!,8년 전,0,

Just think about this... imagine going out on a live bombing range as planes are doing strafing runs and bomb runs literally over head.  They run out there and collect the brass and aluminum bomb casings.  And that's the least unlawful thing they do.  All to get meth.

@Kittydoc90,"What I'm always happy to discover is young people who already ""get"" what life, what living, can truly be about-love. Simple, wordless, indescribable love. It inspires behavior that can be considered nothing less than miraculous. It's the only thing we bring with us throughout our lives and carry with us right through the end.  There are people with good in them and people...without good, but we aren't born being vicious and cruel and hateful-this is what we see and experience and then may choose to perpetuate, or we can choose to love-to care for, to nurture others. This is not to say that we stumble through life with blinders on, putting ourselves in harm's way, but we choose to live our lives differently, and to look for the good in others. This is what living outside of your comfort zones will  bring you. Most people don't ever get this and some will only understand it when they're much older. How rich your lives already are and will be as you grow old(er). This video was terrific not because of what y'all found in the residents of Slab City but because of what you showed of yourselves, the courtesy and respect you displayed. Y'all offered it and happily discovered it in those you encountered.  ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.""

@sroberts837,"Well if you've seen a drug addict coming off of drugs then you already know. When you run out of drugs and get bored, people fight and steal from each other. Run people out of town, back about 15 years ago it could be dangerous to just show up randomly. I think the residents have realized since all the documentaries, When a random tourist comes out, or a camera crew, they bring gifts or money. So the residents are more chill now, just don't plan on staying late unless you bring some party favors.",8년 전,15,
@josephmelesio3765,"Hi guys my name is also Joey, and I live 20 minutes from the slabs. To answer your questions, if you're still wondering, the slabs is more less a slum, but a good one at least. Everyone there does there own thing. It gets pretty hot out there around 100F° average and 110-120F° during the summer. There's lots of artist, mechanics, electricians etc. One very common thing you'll might come across are meth heads. You usually have a group of people making it in their tailors, or some pot holes they dig up. There's a lot of rattle snakes and turantulas. Speaking of snake there is this one guy who owns several rattle snakes and he milks them for their venom. He sells it to the hospitals afterwards, or I think he goes to Ocotillo to give the rattle snakes to research, who then use the snake's venom to create anti-venom. This guy makes a living catching these things. You also have convicts or people with warrant squatting there too, but all in all it's an ok place. Just not the meth heads and cons.",8년 전,33,

They'll Rob you blind but will try and talk you into getting hi with them first, on your dime of course.  You gotta understand the heat in this area.  I remember some Summers at over 120°.  To choose to live in a place with no electricity you gotta have no place else to go.  You may think it's some how cool.  But it's not.  I'm sure they have some redeeming qualities but they're not so obvious.  What you really take away from that place is all they want is the drugs.  Mostly meth, some heroin, sprinkling of weed.  But the meth is what they're all about.  What really sucks is that having a conversation that makes any kind of sense with these people is almost not possible.  I don't feel bad for them at all.  They're doing exactly what they want.  And most will die out there.  They'll be free though.  Maybe that's enough.",8년 전,47,

@tapolna,"I was in eastern Europe after the fall of Communism where the police was so corrupt that they basically didn't exist and everyone knew it.  During the fall and for some time afterwords lack of jobs and other opportunities made petty theft, drinking and drugs rampant.  People were so poor that drug-houses (more like apartments where fake synthetic drug mixes were sold) used one needle to fix hundreds of drug-users.  Yet there were still laws, a least as enforced by the elderly women of the different communities. If kids, say, were caught drinking they'd suffer the wrath of these angry women.  I've seen elderly women chase a drunk out of a neighborhood with broomsticks.  If a guy was caught stealing, these women would get their sons and more-sober male neighbors or spouses to retain the thief as they marched to the police station to arouse the police into action.  In the end, even the police did what they had to do to avoid the relentless wrath of these women when angered. ... Well this is what I've seen",8년 전,59,

Also, I think it’s perfectly fine to joke about rape as long as you don’t actually mean it and you’re in a situation where it won’t offend anybody. We as humans use laughter as a form of medicine and to some rape victims, joking around about it is a way of making it seem like not that big a deal, a small blemish in their life. It’s a coping mechanism. But if it’s not being used in that way, then for the most part don’t joke about rape.",7년 전,5,

Then the Doctor came in and said that the hospital had a new way to treat pain of child birth. I was interested so I asked more about it. The doctor said that they invented a machine to transfer the pain from the mother to the father. It sounded like a good idea to me so I got hooked up. Later that night my wife was getting very close to having birth, so the doctors turned the machine on. They set it at 10% and I felt no pain. Surprised, the doctors set it to 50%. I still felt no pain at all. After being very hesitant, the doctors set it to 100%. I felt no pain at all and my wife gave birth without it either. The next day my new family left the hospital.

He actually told me that a black man in Africa was the first to go to space but we destroyed all their space ships and covered everthing up. I swear BLM idiots are so delusional that they should be in a psych ward at the hospital. Oh i forgot they also showed us how to live like civilized people because when they met the white man the first time we were supposedly still eating eachother.

@dannyboy410,"The Salton Sea is an economical time bomb. I recently did my English final on the Salton Sea. The Salton Sea NEEDS more attention. The government is simply ignoring the Sea. We need more money to go to this Sea. We have around 80 million dollars a year going to the Sea. But for complete restoration, several billion dollars is needed. If the sea dries up, the toxic bed of the lake will cause massive dust storms of toxic dust. It would cause way more than several billion dollars in just medical costs of the citizens in imperial valley. The kids in Salton City have to travel a hours just to get to school and the come back home just to get to the nearest grade school. There is thousands of acres of empty land, there only around 3,000 people living in Salton City and just about every single one of those residents want the sea to be restored back to the paradise it once was.",8년 전,64,

@LycanShift,"The sea is artificial anyways, it shouldn't be there in the first place.. so it's more natural to just let it return back to the land it was before. let the sea dry up. It's pointless ""restoring"" the sea as it will be a never ending restoration project that just consumes endless amounts of money and water as any new water pumped to it will also dry up over time.   It does more harm for mankind to tinker with and artificially create an ecosystem that wouldn't be there without humans making it possible through artificial means. So while initially the drying of the remainder of the Salton Sea will be an ecological nightmare to the newer ecosystems that currently thrive in the system, and will cause duststorms for a while, etc.. this will only be until things settle down and return back to normal.   Plus considering the value of homes within the Imperial Valley surrounding the Salton Sea (many are low income/slum towns with populations of ~1000 or less).. It is definitely much cheaper, to relocate residents directly effected by any toxic conditions than to keep dumping endless billions in a never ending restoration project. It will probably only cost ~250 million or less to relocate residents, which is far cheaper than several billions to restore the lake and countless million of dollars after to keep it maintained.  Or another alternative that's cheaper than restoring the sea and cheaper than relocating residents is to just to construct barriers each time the sea shrinks (add new sections of wind barriers each 10 feet the sea shrinks) to prevent the winds from stiring up the dust, giving the exposed ground time to settle.",8년 전(수정됨),13,
@nagualdesign,"+SaucyD Toxic dust?! :-/ You're talking about SALT. Strong saline is only toxic to living cells inasmuch as it causes dehydration due to osmotic pressure. Fish cannot live in water above a certain level of salinity. Plants rooted in salty earth cannot draw in water. Having said that, salt in and of itself is not toxic. The oceans are salty and full of life. Plants draw water in using salts. It's commonly used as a condiment on food. In fact you cannot live without it. You seem to be conflating the word 'toxic' with 'poisonous', and the word 'economical' with 'ecological'.",8년 전,1,
@LycanShift,"+nagualdesign , actually the Salton Sea is toxic,  during the time before the EPA, etc the lake served as the dumping ground and where all the run-off from agricultural areas surrounding it would lead to, so there is a strong concentration of farming runoff, such as pesticides and other toxic chemicals, this is what helped to the lake becoming unsuitable for people and started killing off the fish within it. Then with it drying over time, that's when the salinity levels rose as the salt just accumulates and H2O to dilute it lessens with time.   Asthma is an issue in the areas surrounding the lake. It's the Asthma capital of California and it's caused by the lake dry-off.  Also fun fact,  sometimes depending on the weather, wind directions, and other environmental conditions. The lake can be smelled (rotten egg-like) and particulates from it at times reaches as far as Los Angeles county (100-150 miles away) and triggers air quality warnings of surrounding counties.  Each time there's a significant dry-off, atmospheric hydrogen sulfide reaches well over 100 parts per billion (30 parts per billion is safe), and leads to 100 tons of dust full of sediment and small-grain particles blowing into the air.  Regardless of this, I still think the best thing to do is to let the remainder of the lake dry off, even accelerate it's pace if possible, but take measures to reduce the particulate blow off (i.e. construct wind barriers), as the lake is just going to be a never-ending headache for both the residents that live around it, the County and surrounding Counties, and the State of California. It shouldn't even be there in the first place, as it's an artificial lake that can't even support itself and only gets more and more toxic and more and more salty over time, so get rid of it.",8년 전,7,

I can remember as a adolescent and teenager before joining the Army of working downtown where on Saturday evenings we would watch the winos fight each other for pecking in their group. I worked in a graphic arts firm that was located near our building and would hear how in the Summer time homeless youths would sleep in the magnolia trees in the cemetery to keep from losing their shoes and other valuables. This was later confirmed when I asked some of the the people who came to our churches homeless shelter I was responsible for running. They actually used their shoes as pillows to keep them from being stolen. Now that's crazy.,8년 전,2,

@basilmemories,"@silly goose a lot of ""lawless"" communities have been recorded through the years. The largest was the Kowloon walled city and guess what? The overall thing that most people want to do... is live. In the larger communities yes there may be crime, drug use, and a definite lack of resources or regulations on some pretty important stuff, but most people are just normal folks who live, love and do what they need to survive. many of these communities don't have written laws, but many unspoken or inferred codes of conduct. Many of these communities are from refugees, the poor, or other people who have been marginalized by society. They either flee to these places to find a community of their own peers, or through sheer need for survival form these groups in liminal areas- places where the law or local jurisdiction leaves an opening.  Does that make these places ""better"" than cities? no. Does that make these places ""worse"" than cities? Not really either. Do you value strong infrastructure and systems in place to care for you? If yes, then a city is the place for you... just part of that cost is putting in for society and knowing that you're sharing a load for the betterment of everyone. Do you want freedom and close kinship with a community? and also know that you're going to have to sacrifice a lot of the basics you relied on, plus also you'll have to pick up on unspoken rules? A community like the one in the video might be the thing for you.   but don't use claptrap like the phrase ""virtue signalling"". that kind of buzzword is the sort of thing idiot alt-right people lean on when they don't have anything intelligent or useful to say.",8년 전,3,

Since you are showing zero objectivity,  it's time for a little schooling.  While I can agree buzzwords can be shortcut to thinking, this however is no such case.  You're sentence there practically suggests that virtue signaling is not a thing.  It doesn't exist.  Because one can simply point the finger back at the one who is charging someone with the debate crime of virtue signaling at every moment that it is suggested thus suggesting that it never applies.  OF COURSE IT APPLIES AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME!  What the commentator did here is IN FACT IS THE THE TEXT BOOK DEFINITION of REAL VIRTUE SIGNALING.  In fact, here:  virtue signaling: the action or practice of publicly expressing opinions or sentiments intended to demonstrate one's good character or the moral correctness of one's position on a particular issue.  The idea that the commentator can go on to her computer and say something without any sort of evidence and fact that ""lawless cities are more welcoming that regular cities"" which is the precisely what she said is a textbook example of virtue signaling.    To suggest that this inference of the phrase virtue signaling is just a crutch and something alt-righters would say is PATHETIC by you, because in this case, nobody....NOBODY would argue that what said isnt a text book example of VIRTUE SIGNALING.

@TheDeadlyDaedric,"I learned this joke from my dad and I think it's a good one. It goes like this: The day finally arrived. Forrest Gump dies and goes to Heaven. He is at the Pearly Gates, met by St. Peter himself.. However, the gates are closed, and Forrest approaches the gatekeeper.   St. Peter said, 'Well, Forrest, it is certainly good to see you. We have heard a lot about you… I must tell you, though, that the place is filling up fast, and we have been administering an entrance examination for everyone. The test is short, but you have to pass it before you can get into Heaven.'   Forrest responds, 'It sure is good to be here, St. Peter, sir. But nobody ever told me about any entrance exam. I sure hope that the test isn't too hard.   Life was a big enough test as it was.'   St. Peter continued, 'Yes, I know, Forrest, but the test is only three questions.   First:   What two days of the week begin with the letter T?   Second:   How many seconds are there in a year?   Third:   What is God's first name?'   Forrest leaves to think the questions over. He returns the next day and sees St. Peter, who waves him up, and says, 'Now that you have had a chance to think the ques tions over, tell me your answers'   Forrest replied, 'Well, the first one -- which two days in the week begins with the letter 'T'? Shucks, that one is easy. That would be Today an d Tomorrow.'   The Saint's eyes opened wide and he exclaimed, 'Forrest, that is not what I was thinking, but you do have a point, and I guess I did not specify, so I will give you credit for that answer.   How about the next one?' asked St. Peter, 'How many seconds in a year?   Now that one is harder,' replied Forrest, but I thunk and thunk about that, and I guess the only answer can be twelve.'   Astounded, St. Peter said, 'Twelve?   Twelve?, Forrest, how in Heaven's name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?'   Forrest replied, 'Shucks, there's got to be twelve: January 2nd, February 2nd, March 2nd... '   'Hold it,' interrupts St. Peter. 'I see where you are going with this, and I see your point, though that was not quite what I had in mind. ...but I will have to give you credit for that one, too.   Let us go on with the third and final question.   Can you tell me God's first name'?   'Sure,' Forrest replied, 'it's Andy.'   'Andy?' exclaimed an exasperated and frustrated St Peter.  'Ok, I can understand how you came up with your answers to my first two questions, but just how in the world did you come up with the name Andy as the first name of God?'   Shucks, that was the easiest one of all,' Forrest replied. 'I learnt it from the song,   'ANDY WALKS WITH ME, ANDY TALKS WITH ME, ANDY TEL LS ME I AM HIS OWN.'   St. Peter opened the Pearly Gates, and said: 'Run Forrest, run.'",8년 전,1,

@jacksonhuecker2534,A guy is sitting at home when he hears a knock at the door. He opens the door and sees a snail on the porch. He picks up the snail and throws it as far as he can. Three years later there’s a knock on the door. He opens it and sees the same snail. The snail says: ‘What the hell was that all about?’,8년 전,0,
