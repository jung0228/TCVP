Phil, since you have the following you do, how does using patreon benefit you and your organization?  I'd have allot more faith in your network remaining impartial if you simply accepted support through your own merchant account through your own website, instead of placing another biased, corporate influencer in between your financial supporters and your organization. Seriously, I do need that to be explained, because Patreon is just another corporate roadblock that uses your money and attempts to control your narratives by threatening to ban you if you report things in a way that they don't like. It's already started happening to others. Using Patreon makes me wonder why, since, at your level, you'll obviously be generating more traffic for patreon that patreon will ever generate for you.",8년 전(수정됨),2,

@cabanaboy112,"Philip, first of all, congratulations on your success and the evolution of your channel. I think it's great. Will you please, please use your platform to bring attention to this new tax bill that congress has just rushed through the approval process? In my personal opinion, it's more important and relevant to every American's life than any other topic at this time.   While the nation is caught up in arguing about differences in race, gender, and political affiliation, U.S. Congress has taken advantage of this distraction pull off the greatest theft of wealth in the history of this country by passing a new tax bill as of 12/2/2017. They rushed this new tax bill through the approval faster than any tax bill in history. They also snuck in a law change that has nothing to do with taxes...it allows oil drilling to commence in Alaska.   After 2027, the corporate tax rate will permanently be reduced from 35% to 20% from 2019 onward. By 2027, taxes will be higher for most people.   I recognize that resolving our DIFFERENCES is a very important endeavor, but we all need to put that on pause for the moment and recognize that all of us are going to be affected by these changes in tax law. My personal suggestion is to come together to boycott the corporations that are making the members of congress rich until they repeal or change these tax laws. They're focused entirely on increasing the amount of income they receive at our expense, so we have to counter this by reducing their income by not purchasing the products and services that their corporations sell.   Please look up the new tax bill and you'll see it for yourself.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

I wondered if you thought about making a video about the U.S relationship with Cuba? It opened for US tourism under the Obama administration and it seems that now it's slowly all getting undone? I just recently came back from a trip to Cuba and  LOVED the people, the culture, etc. so seeing us (the US) taking steps backward with out relationship with the island country is a little disappointing. Especially when so many other countries  (including our allies) have many travelers going over for touristic purposes. Mind giving some insight?

Make sure that you don't call them ANTIFA or acknowledge that terrorist organization.  And when you're done with that we'll move onto 2) Bring in someone involved in fashion (you're on the west coast, you should be able to just step outside and grab someone) and have that person come on the show with a full wardrobe and the two of you can model just what it is that a ""typical Trump supporter"" looks like.

@jgreenzicle,"I like your content, and I think this is a good idea, but there are problems with doing the news as you want to do it. The problem isn't getting the facts right, or even you giving your opinion once the facts are right. The problem is how you are painted by competitors, commenters, or critics. Rachel Maddow does very deep dives into the subjects she covers, and always throws in little quips about how she feels, and while we might say she is objectively analyzing the facts, someone who disagrees will always accuse her, and you, of bias. If you think Trump's healthcare plan is bad because the CBO predicted millions will lose healthcare, that's great, I agree, but someone who disagrees is always ready to call you a biased liberal, and the attack the facts you present. It works the other way too, gun regulation is more complicated and nuanced than one might think, and there are good arguments on both sides, but people don't let the facts change them, they get more entrenched in their views. Even if you don't give your opinion, and just give the facts, if the facts skew towards one side of an argument, you will be seen as a representative of that argument. I laud your efforts, and if anyone can do this it's you, but this is an issue you have to consciously tackle, or else you'll be painted the same color as every other news show out there that just set out to do the news.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

From dumb Florida stories to serious foreign policy and civil debates, LTA, SourceFed, all your projects are underscored by that discourse mindset. As the news becomes both increasingly mad on the one hand and unreliable on the other it is becoming necessary to facilitate the exchange of information and opinions peacefully as never before. I don't think you provide facts in spite of sharing your opinion, but because of it: openly sharing and justifying an opinion requires facts to be given; an honest openness to discussion means no opposition to transparency. You're a reasonable bloke, and I, among millions of others, can attest to that after years of watching.

All new businesses are a gamble, however if people are donating to a project,  they are likely to want to see the project be successful because otherwise it would be a wasted donation. So if Philly is building a new sourcefed and people are donating then they will watch and support even if it's shit. Consequently making him more money.",8년 전,1,

@veganatoralpha7662,"Philip DeFranco  From a fan; someone who has connected with many of your videos throughout the years, I urge you to consider this. Granted, I am no businessman. I am not savvy in marketing either. However, I am a fan. I connected, much like many others out there, with your old channel: SourceFed. Honestly, the comedic value within it has changed my life, especially when times grew very dark. The channel inspired creativity and gave a warm home-like feeling to all who chose to join in and watch. The fiasco that's happened recently with the Nerd channel has caused chaos and uprising within the audience and even some previous hosts, causing them to speak their minds.   There is SO much potential with the ideology of SourceFed, and it can be resurrected. It just needs the guidance and loyalty to achieve said potential. I plead for you to reconsider, especially with your new move to be an independent creator, yet again. You know what works; your 5.4 million subscribers is a small testament to that. You're superb at finding loopholes and finding the advantageous route through anything you do. Here's what I'm thinking:  Merge the SourceFed component with what you're doing and you'll have such a spring board in what you're doing. You have your comedic side and also a news network that shows you, the audience, what the real news is. By bringing in the cast and crew from the SourceFed team, you bring that fanbase, which is amazingly large considering all that has been done by them. By gathering the lost sheep of SourceFed and putting them in mixed in with your ideas about real news, real talk, real everything,... Now That is something I feel we all would watch.   I know you're a busy guy. I know that there's probably a one in a million chance you'll see this (and another one in a million you'll respond). However, I believe in trying to put whatever I can out there to make a difference; a change for the better. I hope you can hear my voice. I hope you see what I see, and see what we love. It's a cry for help from someone who can't do much about what has happened. Regardless of your decision, you still have my sub. You're a great person and have such a talent for what you do. I just implore you to hear me and the cries of many people who want to see justice for the people we've supported for so long. I appreciate your time and patience. Stay classy, ya beautiful bastard!",8년 전,0,

That's a tough one to overcome. Philip needs pro investors with big money. However, they will require an actual return on investment, while fans do not. So I can understand why he'd start with crowd-funding, but I also understand the eye-rolling going on in the comments. The bulk of his fans are now in their 30s like him - with mortgages, taxes, loans, bills, babies, insurance premiums, and a consistent need to eat. :P",8년 전(수정됨),0,

I still feel like I could have a conversation with you without feeling like you'll attack me for thinking different then you and that is an amazing and rare trait to have. People like Maher, Myers, Colbert Ect... the way they go about their opinion is very condemning for people who don't think like them. You're place of news and media feels safe and it's what we need. A place of rational conversation with different opinions.   I respect you so much and hope that you explode with even more success. I love what you're doing. I will invest in you. You. are. Amazing.

I kid you not, a low budget 30 minutes show here in the UK, according to the BBC will cost around £47k per episode, and that is a 30 minutes episode with no advert and no sponsor, so will there be advert and sponsor on your news network? If the answer is yes, then sorry, you don't deserve a penny that goes to your way, if the answer is no, everyone should donate to you, if it is going to be another Philip DeFranco show, means daily video that last less than 20 minutes, then no, you don't deserve a penny that goes to you either. You also need to let your fans know how much you are looking for, how much your news network is gonna cost, best in details, but rough idea will do as well, because for a guy that earn £6K - £96K per month from your channel, and a millionaire to ask for donation, some will question whether you deserve it in the first place, let along some suggestion on the internet saying that your network is around $3-4 millions, and you don't really need that much to have an independent news network, aka, new youtube channel with daily 10 minutes video with advert and sponsor on it, to be honest.

@spartanseventyeight8673,"It's hilarious the amount of ""He's a Millionaire"" comments I see. My response is, proof? What you saw an article about how his worth is X amount? Well, if you look up Jerma985's net worth (popular twitch streamer) first result claims he's with 100 billion. And hey, for another quick comparison:  1. Site claims that Phill's net worth is 4 Million. 2. Another site claims the Game Grumps net worth is 2.4 Million.  Phill has 5.3 Mil subscribers. Grumps have 3.8 Phill has 1.8 Billion video views. Grumps have 3.1 Billion video views.  Phill puts out 1 video a day, while grumps put out 2-3 a day.  They both sell shirts, grumps are more seasonal, limited time offers,  and as a result they amass a shit-tonne of sales Phills are daily and  are often re-prints of existing ones, meaning less will be sold with  each subsequent sale.  If you were to base their worth off of youtube, the thing they're famous for, the grumps would earn alot more than Phil simply because of the amount of views they're charting, about 70-80% more than Phill's, and yet, there they sit at 1.6 million less in worth to Phil. Does it not seem that these idiots performing calculations are basing it off of sheer subscribers, not statistics like video-views, video length, merchandise, etc.  Long story short: Don't believe everything you read on the internet.  And lastly, you think he's going to put literally 0 of his own money in? 'Course he is, but he's going to need donations to help out, and is going to provide donators with benefits like earlier access to some videos, as he said IN the video.

Second, the reason he's asking for money isn't because he's a ""greedy fuck"" etc. but because he's trying to provide advertiser FREE content. He's giving you news for free if you become a supporter or not. Can you say the same about the cable subscription you pay for to watch CNN and other news sources of the like? I really don't think so.  Although it makes me so happy to see the overwhelming support, every single person that says something about Phil's greediness is entirely missing the point of why he's crowdfunding and are the kinds of people that shouldn't be in his audience anyway.

@EISGOTT,"ImDemonAlchemist you say it's impossible to prove that he isn't a millionaire or that no one can argue it. Ok if you so ardently believe that I want you to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he is a millionaire. What is this standard you ask? This means that the proposition being presented by the you must be proven to the extent that there could be no ""reasonable doubt"" in the mind of a ""reasonable person"" that Phillip deFranco is a millionaire. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that it would not affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the Phil is a millionaire. Also your burden of proof is to be such that the facts you provide must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than his being a millionaire. What is a reasonable person you ask? A reasonable person refers to an ordinary person who exercises care while avoiding extremes of boldness and carefulness. I disagree that your claim against his supposed wealth is irrelevant to his crowdfunding goal. He is crowdfunding because he isn't wealthy. Do I believe that you will actually take the time to prove your point? No, because your just a troll looking to get a rise out of people in an angry fashion. Trolls don't do well against well formulated, judicious opposition because it's no longer ""fun.""

It's true that there are ""somewhat"" big name YouTubers who aren't millionaires, but it's not exactly rare for 5+ million sub YouTubers to be millionaires.

@Bk1gamer,It's a shame seeing a multimillionaire beg for money from his loyal sheep. All this man is doing is making his already extremely popular show 7 days a week. In the video you see a construction site and do you know what that tells me? That tells me he is expanding his company he doesn't need money if the only thing he's doing is working a few more days a week right? If you are expanding your company you go to investors to give you money but the reason he's not doing this is because in doing so would take money away from him. So what's the next best option? Begging for money from your fans telling them they would be apart of a new movement to show that the mainstream media doesn't run things anymore and you know the what best part is that defranco loses exactly $0 in fact by defrauding his fans like this will grant him millions upon millions of dollars and he doesn't have to pay anyone money in return for investing. It's a shame to see people get robbed but people must live and learn the hard way. And defranco will burn in hell for scamming millions from people who trusted him.,8년 전,14,

@LucasGabrielStarscream,"You don't really know the history of his channels do you?  Actually, did you even pay attention to what is being said on the video? He said that for the first time in years he is going back to being independent, think about it.  If he is only going back to it now, that means that before this point he wasn't such, and if this is good news that means that being dependent on those investors/owners is not a good thing.  Now, a little lesson about history and researching before saying nonsense stuff that make you look stupid: Phil made Sourcefed and SF Nerd with youtube help, this worked out great while youtube was still helping him, but eventually such help stoped, and he had to start to relly more on, as you had the bright idea to suggest, outside sources of money such as investors and the like, that wasn't enough, so he had to take some loans, as someone up there was also really smart to deduce could be a good ideia, to help pay the bills because he trusted the project could still work, surprise surprise, they wheren't enough as well, this leads up to where we are now, where Phil to avoid being bankrupt had to sell Sourcefed, Sourcefed Nerd and HIS OWN TWO CHANNELS, and it seems that he finally made to acquire them back, after years. So, in resume, because he decided to take risks and start a project he believed on, he ended up losting most of his intelectual properties and become as he said, dependant on other people to do his work.  And now, he is willing to try it again, and is clearly avoiding making the same mistakes he did before, the same MISTAKES that you are suggesting he do again, interesting right? How people that actually do something are able to learn.  And I don't know you, but I would hardly believe that someone who would go to such lenghts as to indebt himself to the point he had to sell his entire company, because he trusted in dream, would be a Schemer trying to fool everyone.",8년 전(수정됨),2,

Since Google's advertisers lit a fire on the Youtube boat & Google's solution was to flood said boat, it's going to sink. As such, you could probably join up with other youtube content creators & build the replacement. Make a new network for news & entertainment, one that's more fair to content creators & something cheap people might actually want to contribute towards funding.

@Weird-City,"Scary isn't it Alex? Someone we never even heard of a few years ago sticks his face on youtube and people just idolise him like feeble minded subordinates. Kind of shows you that the human race is not actually very smart (perhaps collectively but as individuals most are numb brains). Nobody really knows him from Adam (they just see the carefully edited version).  Intelligent thinkers can obviously deduce he is at best unscrupulous and greedy (at worst an outright con man). The facts are he sold his last company for millions lol. This is so clearly nothing more than a reaction to the present YT climate and a desperate grab for cash. Of course he is worth millions (probably $20+ million) but then the irony is he isn't one of them. He is smart enough to know he will never actually meet any of them and provided you put your morals aside...well why the hell not take a few $ from the dumb masses. Leave them to it, you won't change anything. I actually think it's funny watching people who are most likely struggling to make ends meet (or working shitty jobs under $100k) give money to a multi-millionaire to fund a company where their ""investments"" amount to absolutely nothing.  But then this is precisely why they are working shitty jobs - they ARE the collective masses and they aren't very shrewd (to put it politely). Many I should will be kids (I can't in all seriousness believe a grown adult would ""donate"" a few dollars to a multi-millionaire lol. Good luck to him, they would only waste it anyway.

His channel was owned by a company and they took a share of his earnings and like he said he used a lot of the money he made to buy his show back. A big amount of his overall views was before you could make money of of youtube. He does research. But i don't know what i expected i'm clearly talking to a person that randomly watched this video of a person he never heard of,and is talking bullshit and the fact that you think that you can start a news network without sponsors/donations or a shit load of money and workers by itself should show that i'm talking to a person that has no idea about the topic or the person we're talking about.",8년 전,0,

@biogeniclife,"Guys this hate on Phil about him being rich is coming from a Keemstar podcast. Thing is they misrepresent him. His channel offers rewards for donations. Sure maybe he is rich, but if you are a fan of his and want to donate because you want to be a part of his vision you should donate. Don't give all your money to him, I don't think anyone would be doing that. They give what they can, and also get rewards.   But yeah it's a thing that people get upset when rich people ask for money. I am on the fence about this, just like Philly is about every subject so you won't hate him. Because remember this is just a discussion and he really wants to know what you have to say in the comments down below. Also if he had a super controversial opinion he would get too much shit and his channel would suffer.   Everyone has ulterior motives. I know Phil wants to make money and stay well off. I can't fault him for that. It just comes down to if you enjoy his content and want more of it. If you do then support what he does regardless of this bullshit Keemstar is jealously yapping about. Keemstar ain't a bad guy either I don't care what people say about that. I think he tries to play the moral signaling bullshit game too much but I don't think he is just jealous, he has a small point that Phil just isn't very up front about what's actually happening.   All in all I've rambled enough and I just think I could have just said that this is just stupid drama and Phil most likely will make a video about it because it's some thing to whip up some good ol internet rage and get some talk happening about his channel. I'll be surprised if he just ignores Keemstar, and if I were him that what I would do.",8년 전,1,

@OnlyForThePriceOf999,"A) He's had to purchase and remodel commercial properties, as well as furnish them and provide work computers and server equipment, which are all fairly expensive things to do. B) You don't invest all of your income into an unproven startup, even if you're a millionaire. Ever heard the saying ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket""? C) He's essentially asking for interested parties to invest in his startup. Elon musk is a Billionaire, yet he still gets investors from interested parties every time he starts a new business because having other creative minds and allies is good. This will help Philip to understand the demands of consumers, as well as somewhat allowing the consumer base to have a say in what is going on with his channel. Good things. D) He is offering some nice things to people who pay. He's not begging for money, he's simply saying ""Hey, here's an unbiased way to donate to the project, get some cool perks, have a say in the development of the project, and all in all help expand my business to be more entertaining for you guys"" and nobody is obligated, you can donate if you want to, and are capable of, donating, or not. Its up to you.

@nekocatwarrior,"You do realize that this is how YouTube works right? The majority of YouTubers can't even live off of the ad revenue they make from posting videos. This can also be because most people probably either skip ads or block them through AdBlocker. Most of the money for successful YouTubers come from fans who support them through donations and patreons like us. This way all fans can chose how much they want to pay for the content that they are getting rather than having to pay a subscription fee. Its a way to support the content creators based on what they create so that way we only pay what we feel is worthy of our hard earned cash. This is also a way for everyone to be able to view the content for free that is being distributed, meaning you don't have to pay if you don't want to but still are able to enjoy the content just the same.",8년 전,0,

@nekocatwarrior,"But the content is free..... I mean you're watching him now aren't you? The only reason why some people choose to pay is because they feel obligated to support him and respect the content he creates. Think of it like how a street performer earns money. They go out of their way to create a performance for onlookers lurking in the streets. If an audience member feels satisfied with the performance, they'll be willing to give a couple dollars or some spare change to the person who had just preformed. This doesn't mean that everyone gives them their money, but only those that feel obligated to out of respect to the performer. Its the same way with Philip DeFranco and other YouTubers. You want to help support them and continue creating the content you like and enjoy. If you don't want to support Philip DeFranco with your money, that is totally fine, I respect that since I know not everyone has the money to support the creators they like. A way to help support your favorite content creators is to subscribe to their channels, watch their videos, hit the like button, and just comment about how you enjoy their content with a positive and respectful out look instead of a negative one that only discourages their content and them selfs.",8년 전,0,

Mainstream media was no an issue back then. It did not fit the narrative. Back then it was about making accurate news, no more fake stuff. Totally not about the money!

@Stillontumblrunfortunately,"Richard Henderson I don't know if you've been keeping up with phils show the last few weeks, but a significant number of his videos have been de-monetized, so he's not making money from advertising on the page, that goes straight to YouTube/Google and most ads will be completely removed. He primarily makes money from in-show ads for other products, which I would hope he could drop doing if he received enough crowd funding, as I do think it detracts from the professional news he's trying to create. So, no he's not getting paid just from me watching his content for the most part, he had to add more to that to make the show in the first place.   And the other point I want to make is that Phil currently has four staff members for his show. This money doesn't just go to him, it goes to a group of five people who write and produce a news show that is more accurate and well sourced than almost any other media outlet I've found.   You're also still referring to it as a donation. Patreon by its nature is not really meant for donations, it is meant for paying creators and artists for their work. I give to charity, I volunteer my time, I also like to get good news, and am willing to pay $1 a month for the creation there of. By your logic of ""going to give money, give it to charity"" I also should never buy myself a soda or go see a movie, because that money is being frivolously spent and could be given away. Because what I'm doing in this case isn't giving to charity, it's buying something. I also didn't say people shouldn't buy cable sports packages, that's not really my thing, but it's a good example of a mainstream existing process that Patreon and creators that use the Patreon services are attempting to mimic. One that people are more likely to be familiar with and that I think has significantly less return for the cost.  Edit: clarity ",8년 전(수정됨),10,
@getwirelessdeals,"Emily Reid​​ Your argument of not buying a soda and so forth is a straw man. A clever one but still made of hay.   I'm calling it a donation because you are getting no return. An investment produces a return. If you really believe that you are paying him a dollar a month for the service that he's basically giving to you for free anyways then I can't argue with you.   I would say that he does make money on ad revenue, but would agree that neither of us know for sure. As far as the hawking of items he does that is another revenue stream as well. All in all he's making money.  My point, if there is one, is that I can't fund someone who has more than me to do something they are choosing to do. He should try and get some investors together that have the same goal he does of unbiased news ( forgetting of course that bias is inherant to the human condition ).   Those investors do not have to be advertisers. So he will not feel the need to pander to their wishes of what he covers. If he feels like this venture is one that will pay dividends then people will invest. ",8년 전(수정됨),3,
@Stillontumblrunfortunately,"Richard Henderson yea it's finals week for me so I don't really have time to explain everything I want to. But basically what you're saying is that he should get a small group of investors to bank roll him? Ones he won't be beholden to? But like he's said in this video, he looked at that option and didn't feel like any of the options would give him full creative control. Investors also would generally look for something to sink money into and then get a return, as you've said. I feel like I'm getting a return. I get the perks of what being a Patreon donator are, things I'm interested in because I'm a fan of his work. That's part of my return. I get to feel like I'm contributing to something I believe in. I get things out of it. I also can part with the dollar, I'm in that financial place. It's not everyone who can, but I like to think that by my giving then he can create something for everyone to enjoy, even people who can't afford to give at all. Your problem doesn't seem to be with Phil or his show but more with like crowd funding creative endeavors in general? And I don't know what to tell you about that. I have no idea why people pay for half the shit they do, but they do and that's their choice, I guess I just don't understand what your premise is here? Like you agree he should seek investors, and then he seeks investors in his fans,  the people who consume what the media he's creating, and they each individually agree to be small time investors in his project of their own accord, and then you're not happy with this investment scheme?",8년 전,12,
@getwirelessdeals,"Emily Reid​ Fans are donators not investors. Investors, as I've said , and you've agreed, seek a return. There is no return for this. Simply enjoying the content can not be a return because even people that do not donate can enjoy the content.   My issue IS with crowd funding millionaires. I don't understand why that is so hard to grasp or understand. If he was a guy that was not a millionaire and wanted to start a channel or invent a gadget or make a indie movie and he couldn't get investors that would be entirely different. I would think about donating to that ( and I wouldn't have to sell it to myself as buying a service ).   As I've stated on another post, this is the same as an NFL owner asking the tax payers to fund their new stadium. Those NFL owner could very well build it themselves or find investors to help them build it. Instead they're asking people to subsidize their wants when that money could, and I would argue should, be going somewhere else. ",8년 전(수정됨),2,

@Stillontumblrunfortunately,"Richard Henderson  you're saying I don't get a return, but I'm TELLING you I do. Patreon allows for Phil to create pay-walled content that I want access to. So there's my actual concrete return. Also what I'm trying to explain is that the content he would ""create anyway"" won't exist without some kind of sponsorship. He would keep making videos I'm sure, but of the same caliber? As frequently? As freely? Unlikely. I want the most free, frequent, and professional videos possible from him. I'm investing in that outcome.   It's also not at all like an NFL owner having taxpayer dollars build a stadium?? Taxpayers have no choice in paying taxes without facing legal repercussions, in that instance the best they could do would be to try to vote representatives out of office in the next election. Which would probably be too late to change where the money goes. Patreon is a fully opt-in program that allows me to choose how much I want to pay and I can cancel at any time if I feel I no longer want to support the endeavor.   I'd also like to address the issue of self investing that people seem to be bringing up a lot. The problem with a single person personally bank rolling a project that probably costs upwards of a quarter million dollars a year (five full time employees and studio space in LA?? That's not a crazy number right??) is that it's totally unsustainable. It eventually has to turn a profit or the investor runs out of money. Phil has said many many times that ads from YouTube do not and will never cover the expenses of the show. His videos are consistently demonetized for featuring sensitive or adult content, he cannot access the highest pay scales (that are open to all advertisers) because he hasn't made a kid friendly video in his life. So. If not from YouTube ads, then he has to make a profit some other way. I would prefer to pay my $1 than deal with in show ads or pandering to get more Adsense. With enough crowd funding I would like to see Phil remove all pre-roll ads as well, or as much as he is able. He had also said (in this video as well as others) that he has personally invested a significant amount of money into this project. I would bet he personally bought out his contracts, leased studio space, and covered the cost of transition. Ideally he will be using Patreon money to hire more staff and handle upkeep.   If in a few months time I find no improvement in show quality, quantity, or ad free news, or if I feel the Patreon exclusive rewards are not up to par, I'll likely cancel my Patreon subscription, because I will not feel like I'm getting the returns I was promised.   I am trusting Phil to not sell out his channel, I'm trusting him to deliver on promises made in this video. In the same way I would have to trust anyone I pay to perform a service well. If he fails, he'll lose my investment, however minimal that may be. The value of crowdfunding for someone like Phil as opposed to an investment group or advertisers is that he can count on people coming and going at their leisure without it significantly impacting his funding simply due to the sheer volume, unless he truly fails to deliver.",8년 전,3,

You want to believe that having access to content that ANYBODY in the world with internet can get is a return that's on you.   Also, I guess you're not aware of how the funding of NFL stadiums work. So the owners ask for the money from politicians, who then have to get approval to spend it. Where does that approval come from you may ask? Voters. They must vote on whether they want to find the stadium, usually through bonds. If it does not pass there is no stadium. Ask St. Louis about that.   In the way that a rich person is asking non- rich people to find their venture it is EXACTLY like that.

I do not want to give a millionaire money to fund his venture when that money could be going to better things. I think its tacky to ask people far worse off than yourself to fund you while you're sitting on bank.  That's it in a nutshell. It has nothing to do with Patreon or any other brand of crowd funding in general. It is solely the ask that I take issue with.  If Patreon customers get extra perks for their payment, then maybe only hit up your patreon customers for money. Instead he's on YouTube, a free media service ( at least free in the sense that you don't have to pay to use it ) asking for it.  You are free to disagree and donate to your hearts content. I'm sure millions of people will. But you are doing yourself and civil discourse in general a disservice when you resort to name calling out of ignorance.  Thank you",8년 전,0,

And your only problem is with him telling his fans about the new project (the new project IS his Patreon page)? Like genuinely have you used Patreon before? Because that might be the one thing we really aren't seeing eye to eye on with this, you seem to just not really know how it works like as a tool, which he definitely didn't explain in the video I think he just assumed people would be familiar. So Patreon isn't a social media site, it also isn't really a crowd funding site like indie gogo or something. You set up a page that people can pay either by month or by ""creation"" (that's usually more for artists or comics coming out with new issues) for access to exclusive content. Different donation tiers would allow you access to different exclusive content ($1/month for behind the scenes videos, $5/month for Q&A videos, $10/month for a unique Polaroid mailed to your address with a thank you on the first of each month; these are not Phils perks but examples of ones I've seen or received). So I /am/ paying for content that is not freely available to everyone on the internet. There's that point sorted. The other thing is that Patreon is really ONLY used for this service, so he didn't have a Patreon ""following"" before this announcement. To me he's not asking us to donate, he's just clueing us viewers in to a new platform he'll be putting content out on and the changes we can expect in his usual show.

This is coming from someone who is very politically passionate, but often feels like I have to suppress my ""unpopular"" opinions. I feel like I am just taking  constant unintentional/indirect back lash from others, as they are unaware of my beliefs. I have always gotten my news from you because I have found a way to stay informed on society, in the most comforting way, rather than having feelings of uncomfortable rejection. It has established so much of my trust in you. I just wanted to say this because it is so cool that we can have our own opinions, and even though they maybe different, having the ability to open up and listen to others is so important because it teaches you so much about the world and about new outlooks you may not have thought about before. Thank you for making me feel comfortable to be myself, as well as learning to listen and open up to others, and researching both sides of the story. I have the upmost respect for you ✊",8년 전,16,

I mean we deal with YouTube ads all the time, because we expect to pay in one way or another (with time or money) for the experiences we wish to have.  Get over it.  There are material costs.

Sure they wouldn't be monetized, but there's nothing STOPPING him from continuing to make the videos. Already being a multi-millionaire he's made more than even most doctors will in their entire lives, so it's assumed he could EASILY continue living off the already made income, and do YouTube as a hobby probono. However, this shows you where the intentions are.   ""I want to make an honest network blah blah blah BS"" It's obvious what the motive is, and always has been, greed.

@antonea808,"My two cents.  Is the new business model not involve posting to YT anymore? I wasn't clear what your plans were. But without consistently posting ""free"" content, your patreon base will start to drop off over time. And the revenue. You still need to actively recruit new supporters. I only say this because of a lack of real content these last two days.  Personally, I thought your news network plans would be more than just a patreon page. I realize so many creators spend a lot of time on their content, I just can't financially support every single one. And while I like where this channel evolved from (no more ""babe"" thumbnails - yikes!), it's quality and content choices have never even come close to filling me in on real news. It's always been a mix of news with some internet controversy that I find to be more of a guilty pleasure. I subscribe to HBO now largely because I love the Vice content. I just don't feel like your content warrants a minimum of $5 a month, especially when you have such a large fanbase already. Personally the content just isn't there. For my contribution, I need a cheaper minimum or higher quality content.  To be frank, there is SO much digital content out there, creators have to compete now more than ever.

He is controlling the narrative of the story but in reality the main reason he wants a public funded new network work is so he can keep all the profits. If he had investors involved he would have to share his profits with them. It's a win win for him because he won't be in debt to the investors if it fails and if it's a success he keeps all the millions of dollars in profit or he can sell it like his other news network. He is doing the exact same thing as the mean stream media with holding information and pushing his agenda.

@GamingBear_Q_E_D,"The Potential Lost Generation in America and the Euro Zone 1965-2017. Well where do I start… some facts, a hypothesis then a question. According to the Pet food manufacturers association 2013 Cats are 19% of the Households in America and the UK, which is fine, but what use is it? Digging down, you can find that from 1965-2002 there are 4.1 Cats per household in 1965 happily with a solid birth rate of Approximately 84 Births Per thousand women aged 15-44 (National centre for Health Statistics WSJ.COM). Increasing to 7.8 Cats per household in 2002 (Different but standardised original method of recording the data), approximately equating to 4.1 Million Cats in 1965 & 7.8 Million Cats in 2002, with Approximately 65 American births per 1,000 in 1995, a drop of 19 Children per thousand, or just over 22.6% lost in birth rate, not far from the 19% increase in the Cat population. I did not expect to find an exact correlation between the decreased birth rate as demonstrated by the Wall Street Journal and the, increased Cat fertility rate shown by the Pet Food Manufacturers Association’s pet population data. Those sources potentially linked the increase in single person households with the increase in the Cat population and the decreased in Westernised societies birth rate and the financial breakdown of the systems following de-regulation and movement away from the Gold standard as States began printing money to cover exorbitant social security benefits to fund the breakdown of families and the increase of the Social Security system devised by the KGB. 80% of the new jobs of the expanded state went to women as the State grew, drain the profits out of the rest of the profitable society to fund more borrowing to make more promises to the Baby Boomers and Women to buy their votes, with the majority living for today, at the expense of the rest of society. A new handbag that will last a fortnight is always worth more than the futures of their own children and grandchildren. Since the 1960’s, families were to become less central within society, Millennia of experience centred around functioning families, happy children with brothers and sisters as well as a Father and a Mother. The KGB’s plan for a Socialist State with small diverse fractured sub groups as directed by Moscow has almost fully happened (See Yuri Bezmenov video reference confirming this).  So, this is what we had:  2002-2014 Average 7.9 Million Cats.   2012 8 Million Cats. 2013 8.5 Million Cats. Just below 4 Million. Approximately 62.5 per 1,000 Women aged 15-44, the low point of the WSJ’s figures according to RT.  2014 7.9 Million Cats. 2014 – 2015 Slight Population increase in line with the decrease in Cats born. 2015 7.4 Million Cats, with a firming up of the WSJ’s graph at about 62.5 births Per thousand. There was a correlation between the decisions made by Women aged 15-44 and the transposing of babies for Cats since the mid 1960’s. Births per thousand dropped significantly, facilitating a need for huge Migrations to attempt to replace the potentially lost Children brought about by legislative changes to conform to the KGB plan since the mid 1960’s, leading to a structure where Women feel less secure, & unhappier than they have done at any recorded time in the past …. Thank you Stalin! Could the Drop in the Cat birth rate and the increase in babies being born in 2015 correlate to the legislative changes to allow increasing amounts of immigration into both America and the Euro Zone? What country does not want a low skilled 40-year-old economic non-refugee migrant ‘child’ claiming social security, housing et al for themselves their 14-year-old wife and their two children!?  With an 80% chance of none of them working, a different culture and no intention to learn a spoken word from the country they now live in but will never call home, that is where they send their money every month, they also expect the original inhabitants to change to suit them.Whatever the relationship between similar legislative changes in America and Europe, or the exact correlation multiplier, if we take a 1:1 relationship then in both America and Europe there would be a loss of working population by a significant number of people per year since 1965 and when the number stabilized in 2013 at a theoretical 3.8 Million Children lost per year, needing to be replaced, supposedly by migrants, but all it does is depress wages and make it harder for the indigenous population and thus increase the social security bill. It is definitely not more cost effective to move someone from their home country & culture who does not know your language let alone culture, that is just a way of purposely creating more societal problems than you fix.  Well at long last we know that this must be the new reality, our masters have told us that we must think of the children…. not those who we could not afford for ourselves, but those who are being forced on us in the hope that it will hide what the KGB have been planning for us since the 60’s. The heart of the problem is the need to Make up the difference between the original 4.1 Million Kittens born in 1965 and the 2014 figure of 7.9 Million Kittens, our own people could work, but the Stateists are bringing in migrants to destabilize America and the Euro Zone further by over-burdening the system till it finally collapses rather than allowing people to do a good job, earning a fair wage in order to have their own happy stable families. The difference of 3.8 Million additional Kittens could correlate to a figure as high as 3.8 Million lost Babies a year in America alone, when taking the Euro Zone into account on a 1:1 basis that figure could double. If we guestimate that the additional 200,000 Cats born a year till the balance point of a total additional 3.8 Million was reached in 1983 following the legislative changes since the mid 1960’s, giving a potential lost Children to Cats that could be as high as 296 Million overall in America and the Euro Zone since 1965. Potential Lost Generation    1965 200,000   1966 400,000   1967 600,000   1968 800,000   1969 1,000,000   1970 1,200,000   1971 1,400,000   1972 1,600,000   1973 1,800,000   1974 2,000,000   1975 2,200,000   1976 2,400,000   1977 2,600,000   1978 2,800,000   1979 3,000,000   1980 3,200,000   1981 3,400,000   1982 3,600,000   1983 3,800,000   1984 3,800,000   1986 3,800,000   1988 3,800,000 Annual Births Years 1989-2015 98,800,000 3,800,000 26                         Guestimate America 148,200,000   Guestimate Euro Zone 148,200,000       Guestimated Maximum loss 296,400,000  If only 10% of the estimated Cat population increase between 1965 and 2015 was the potential loss of Babies to make way for those Kittens plus a modifier to negate the lifespan differences, then the loss could be as insignificant as 30 Million Children, a drop in the ocean compared to those lives already lost to socialism in the past 100 years. Socialism was great for the Cat population, but possibly not so much for the American and the Euro zone’s human populations. Was it a coincidence that the financial decline in both America and the Euro Zone began when the State in both areas significantly increased spending on supporting Women back into the workforce, divide & conquer …. The Rosenbergs would be so proud of the useful Idiots as Stalin called many   😉 confirmed by KGB Defector Yuri Bezmenov (Reference below). It was a great sounding idea, and that 1 in 283 female Genii in something other than the social sciences will be a boon for society, but at a very high social cost. The KGB plan has created more single person households, worse disparity between the Rich and the Poor, breakdown of the family, and what for us and society? It was obviously not for the children…. unless you are a cat!Is this the reason certain countries have been trying to dramatically increase immigration to cover for the shortfall in working population brought about by the potential lost generation of children in America and the Euro Zone since the mid 1960’s. What have the Baby Boomers and the KGB done to us this time?!? Could this potential situation have been brought about by just some well-intentioned legislative changes, or could they have led to part of the societal and financial issues experienced by Westernised Nations since the mid 1960’s as devised by the KGB … well let me think…. Or are our Politicians really that bumbling and incompetent for such a long period of time? Potentially 30+ Million Children have already been lost, isn’t it time to end the KGB plan for us before things become even worse!?!Just a Thought. Yours, Gaming Bear.Citations: (Not included to stop it being picked up as spam, but available upon request).Currently I have found no data for the Cat population between 2002 & 2012 but the approximate difference from 7.8 Million to 8 Million per year in the space of 10 years leading to an average increase of 200,000 Cats per year in the intervening period to an average Birth rate of Cats of 7.9 Million Cats, leading to the extrapolation that during that period that 7.9 Million Children a year were not Born in  American and theoretically a similar number in the Euro Zone were lost from the population each year during that period.",8년 전,0,

If you struggle with that kind of money, which is mainly meant to support your work and not your lifestyle you may need to check and think about your priorities and which kind of route you are going down right now.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

As long as his delivery remains the same, I don't personally see the issue.

@edgeninja,"There's such a huge cult of personality surrounding Reagan that few Americans realize it, but you can almost draw a straight line between him and Trump. Reagan's the guy who started the whole de-regulation of Wall Street/the Big Banks that continued through proceeding administrations. He began the trend of union-busting, shipping jobs overseas, supply-side economics (taking money from the poor to give to the rich). And, of course, he was propelled to the White House through the rise of the radical religious right, which also got Trump elected.",8년 전,1,
@mattymcmattface9269,"I'm trying to make sense of your logic and it's not coming to me at all. Putting the classification of ""entertainer"" on Phil has little to do with his qualifications or reasons to start this news network. Did you watch the whole video? He's trying to make a platform in which real, important conversations can be had by people with opposing views. Too often we see each other in the light of the extreme. Idealist or not, someone needs to be a voice of reason, and I don't understand why you think Phil shouldn't be trying to bring in that voice. No big news network is going to do this in his place. Making the Trump comparison seems completely unreasonable; there are no other points than the title you've given Phil as an entertainer to connect your argument that Phil's news network will bring about something related to Trump becoming president. I want to hear your thoughts on that. Particularly why you consider him an entertainer when his channel is mostly dedicated to sharing news in the most non-biased way he can, and why it's such a bad decision.",8년 전,2,

News Channel - 3-5 hosts talking about things Phil doesn't have a chance to. But without as much comedy as Sourcefed had.

Remember that even Youtube is not turning in any money for Google, and it is the second most visited site in the US, and it also host most of the ads that people see everyday.

Not just ask other people to do it for you so you have zero risk, and then if you fail at it it's OTHER people that have to pay for your mistake instead of you. Just not a fan of the lack of balls people have in developing their own business, but I know not everybody agrees with me, and that's ok.   Besides, didn't you just finish a TeeSpring campaign? Last time I looked at it, it was over 8000 sold. I've done a TeeSpring campaign before so I know how much you marked those shirts up, times 8000.... Why the fuck are you even asking people for their money after that campaign? Not to mention your link to your new website just re-directs people to your patreon, at which nobody can see how much you're making per month, just how many people have helped out, and even at 1 dollar per person, you're still making 9 grand a month, but we know it's WAY more.

@stevepetrovits,"Phil, I like the concept and agree with much of what you espouse, however I think you need to become a bit more objective to create the news network you're attempting to build. You have a tendency to lean to the left on certain subjects; most of the statistics you cite when you report the news lean to the left. I understand most of the statistics are generated by the left however statistics shouldn't be right or left and when they are they shouldn't be reported (or you need to take more of a centrist view noting this)! Perhaps your show needs a mathematician who can tell you when source, sample pool size, distribution of sampling, etc are invalid. I'm an active viewer, however I don't comment often. I don't feel like the viewpoints I have are any more valid than others (having not lived their lives from their point of view). My political views are quite centrist, and I rarely comment because I'm worried I may accidentally offend someone. Political correctness is a minefield these days. I hope your network starts to report more on the polarization of society. You need to take more of a breakfast club approach. Labels are dangerous; often empowering people to act in stereotypically labelled ways. We're all humans we need to drop the labels and see ourselves as such.

I've been a fan of this channel for years, I subscribed when you were Sxe Phil, because I had a crush on you 😂 I hate watching the news because it's always depressing and I just can't deal with that. But through your show I don't mind hearing about the news and all the fucked up shit that happens. You share the facts then your opinion which is so refreshing and helpful. I like to think I'm an open minded person but sometimes I have to take a step back and rethink certain situations because you've shined a different light on it that I was too blind/ignorant to fully accept. I also learn a lot from your show and I feel like I'm growing more as a person. I've never been to any playlist lives or vidcons (although every year I wish I could go) and sadly I've never bought any of your merchandise (living that broke single mom life 😅) but I try to support your show by telling people and sharing your stories/videos that I know can touch someone else. You are an inspiration to me because you're so open and speak your mind and have worked so hard to get where you are. I'm not in a good situation in my life and trying to overcome issues everyday but seeing you (and my other favorite YouTubers) makes my life a little better.

To avoid the corporate, leftist, establishment elites-- and their brand of indoctrination through lies and manufactured hatred-- is admirable (and I'm not saying the right is always right, or the left is always wrong-- but there's ZERO question that the establishment left, the mainstream media, the gatekeepers of social media sites, and pretty much every other outlet where political and social information is accessed, is being monopolized and completely manipulated by increasingly radical left-wing ideology, to the point that anyone with views that don't STRICTLY adhere to the leftist/globalist narrative, is being effectively SHUT DOWN). The ONLY way anyone can share news, or any type of political/social commentary, that doesn't absolutely stick to that narrative, is to ""crowdfund"" the project, and dump the leftist establishment, with all of their corporate, ""elite"" money and influence. It's PATHETIC that it's come to that, in 2017 America-- where you're only ""allowed"" to openly discuss politics and society from a globalist, communistic perspective, unless you wanna spend all of that time and effort working on something, only to have the constantly-changing ""rules"" strip away your revenue, and the powers that be, attempt to silence you in every other possible way.",8년 전,11,

@TheEnoEtile,His business still needs to turn a profit. A lot of YouTubers aren't confident in ad revenue anymore because changes in how monetization works on YouTube are constant and arbitrary. A lot of the successful companies and personalities that use YouTube have multiple revenue streams because they don't believe its wise to rely on ad revenue from YouTube. Actually Rooster Teeth just did a video about how they manage their income streams.,8년 전,5,
@bryanmatson5164,OneTwoMark I don't know if you were listening to what he said but he did say and I quote some of my own money as well period I am taking a big risk. I don't think a man with a family to support should risk all of his money but a wise investment out of his pocket isn't a bad start. it takes a lot of money to start something this big. he is talking about more than just his channel. it sounds like a complete rebuild of what he sold to Discovery and this could be huge.,8년 전,2,

@SchmataB,"when you say news network do you mean actual news or just same you do here but on greater scale (more people involved in production, longer episodes, etc.)? because you mostly cover what's trending on youtube or twitter and big chunk of that is shit nobody should care about (youtube drama queens crying one over another, idiots doing idiotic stuff, etc.). I'm not sure if world needs more of that. will you have camera crews going to interesting places where something important is going on? will you make interviews with people who have important things to say? people like doctors, lawyers, specialists of any kind not dude who makes a living by posting videos of making pranks.",8년 전,0,
@KayleighMorganMusic,"To those calling this a money grab =  Phil has always stated that he wanted to show unbiased news, that real research should be done in journalism and that his videos here are a 'conversation' - you have people from all kinds of backgrounds watching this show.  He has been with Discovery and such for 4 years and if he felt the need to leave them to create this news network, that suggests that he couldn't do the true unbiased network he wanted to create with them.  Making that decision to leave their funding and that security is a giant risk for his entire career, but he still choose to do it for the principle of what he's trying to achieve.  Now yes, Phils made a lot of money on youtube over the years, he has a nice house and his wife doesn't have to work - he clearly has sensible finances personally. But this show already has quite of few members of staff, it requires a premises. Discovery were clearly footing the bill for a lot of those business expenses that Phil is now trying to do off his own back. He may have a lot of money for one individual - but he's talking about hiring full time employees, operating and paying rent on a space, investing in equipment and research and lord knows what else - most of which were things he didnt have to fund individually. He has already stated he's investing his own money into this - I truly believe Phil wouldn't ask for funding if he basically was able to do without it.  If you are a fan of phil, if you believe that this truly is a 'conversation' and you support the idea of bias free well researched journalism, then you shouldn't begrudge him for asking for support. a whole news network is not something one man can achieve off his own finances, even if he is pretty minted from youtube money.  Not to mention - he's had so much demonetization lately and youtube is an incredibly unpredictable and unreliable platform for creators now - that money has probably decreased while his actual subscribers and views have increased.   He's asking the people who care enough about the show to pay forward their support, for the show to continue to exist and thrive.   I think what Phil is trying to do is huge - potentially unattainable - but I am perfectly happy to part with 5 bucks a month to watch him try. The last few years have shown the true dangers of the media, and the importance of transparency - The fact that someone is risking their career to try and tackle that in any small way is just incredibly impressive and noble.   TL/DR  Don't be a dick, understand that Phil is trying to do something good, and he doesn't have money coming out of his ass. If you want to support him great, if you don't you know where the door is. simple.",8년 전,0,

@Hobbles_,"I implore you to re-watch the video and really listen to what he's saying. He just said that he left his parent company, and personally invested his own money to buy back every single one of his franchises from said parent company. That likely put a severe dent in his bank account, as these were not small channels.  Then, if you've been watching any of his recent videos that talk about YouTube, you would know that a very large portion of his videos are being demonetized under the new regulations, and those that aren't are usually under certain flags that mean they will make much less than they could. Since he is no longer with a network, he is not guaranteed certain kinds of money anymore, he is solely at the whim of what YouTube ad revenue makes, which right now, with what's been going on, he is not set up to do.   A patreon would mean that, regardless of how bad the YouTube ad revenue debacle turns out for his company, the fans who watch will still be the ones that his companies revenue comes from, allowing this endeavor to be as unbiased as they can make it.

@crazybadcuber,"Please show evidence that it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars. Far too often people talk shit out their ass about things like this looking like ""the good guy"" and give these ""facts"" about prices and shit, but literally none of them ever back it up with actual evidence. If you want to be smart, prove it.   The reason people hate crowd funding so much, is because people who are REALLY well off, like Phillip, are just asking other people to take the risk for him. Before the internet, if somebody had a business they wanted to start, they would go to the bank and get a loan to start the business, that way if it fails, it's that person who ends up paying for their mistakes, not everybody else. The internet these days has made it WAY too easy for just anybody to come up with any idea and have other people take all the risk. It's fucking stupid, and cowardly.  I mean, the guy get's over 9000 patreons a month, do the math. I mean you have to, because he's one of the rare ones that DOESN""T show on his patreon page how much he's actually making per month, because if people actually saw, they wouldn't bother because he's making more than enough already.   Let's not forget the T-Spring campaign that he just had for the ""sports."" shirt. Last time I looked it had over 8000 buys. I've done a T-Spring campaign before, so I know how much he marked those shirts up (a fucking LOT), times that by 8000? He made enough just one that alone to start his own business.   People like you are stupid. You don't even take the time to consider how rich somebody is who's asking other people to fund his business instead of just doing it themselves when they can more than afford to. People like you are the exact kind of people that continue to allow the rich to get richer and the poor to stay poor. Everything Phillip does is to make money. He's made a fucking lot of it too, and now he's asking other people for their money, so he can use it to make more, and not have to worry about not being ""as rich"" as he used to be.

@UdyKumra,"His show has something like 10-20 people working on it full time. They have salaries. He also has an office. That has rent. He also needs equipment. That costs money. Overall, breaking away from Discovery and any other affiliations means that while he gets 100% of the money, he also assumes 100% of the cost, meaning that his overall profit is lower. In other words, while his Total Revenue may be higher, his Total Cost is WAAAAY higher than when he was affiliated, so his profit is smaller. Simple economics.",8년 전,5,
@micklemore,"CrazyBadCuber You're so blinded by hate it's crazy. He hasn't fully owned his YouTube channel for 4 years. The discovery network owned part of it (they also own seeker and other news channels) In order for him to do what he wants he needed full control of his channel which requires him to buy his company back. Which is expensive considering he has over 5 million subscribers. On top of he gets next to no add revenue at all, because YouTube is broken. Hes not forcing you to support his patreon, but it would be stupid of him to not use all his resources possible to fund and found a News organization. You're argument about people used to get loans back in the day makes no sense. People also used to use telegraphs and now they use phones....

I just find absolutely no honour at all in asking other people to pay for it instead. Phillip is a very wealthy person, he should pay for his own business. And you're right, patreons are not investors, which means they don't get anything in return besides some shitty ""rewards"". Phillip get's all the money.

I'm also not going to hunt down the videos in which he said that his channel is owned by Discovery and he was talking about how he might not get to keep the channel.  These are things I know from watching his videos, and clearly you have not watched his videos. Go back through the last two years and you'll see that I'm telling the truth.  But I can't be expected to do your research for you because I'm not a fanboy that'll defend Phil at all costs. He can take your hate because ultimately, you are insignificant in the grand scheme of things and, seeing as how you won't support the show or, if you have the money, won't give a few dollars to help jumpstart the business, you're also unimportant and will have no impact on this whatsoever. By trying to argue with you, I am wasting my energy in an argument that ultimately does not matter. So keep shouting into the abyss, because WE DO NOT CARE.  Phil, good luck on the news network!

@TheOriginalFayari,"CrazyBadCuber, nothing of what you said is a reason to dislike him. He runs a business. A business makes profit, and has costs. Is he doing anything illegal to get the money he gets? No. Is he forcing people to pay him? No. Is it bad that he wants to crowdfund? No. His business model provides content and merchandise that people enjoy and consume, and in return, people want to support him with views and money. It's a perfectly good business strategy.  People are VOLUNTARILY supporting him, and you're just hating him because you're not as successful. I mean really, disliking him because he's richer than you, has more patrons, and he sells T-shirts that people want to buy? How stupid and pathetic can you possibly get? You act like the people who want to support him are idiots, but you're the one expecting him to do what he does for free.  Do you think people make movies for free too? If you watch a movie in the theater, do you expect them to just let you in without paying because you cry and blubber about it?

I just disagree with somebody as wealthy as Phillip asking other people to fund his business for him when I'm 100% fucking sure he could just pay for HIS business HIMSELF, so if HE fails at it, it's HIS money HE wasted.

I would like to know if you'd be willing to do an international effort with creators from other countries?   e.g. using your news network with trusted creators to give more local topic news.  e.g. a French correspondent talking about the populist movement in France that is trying to get Frexit and how that would literally mean out of the top 3 economic powers in the EU all but Germany will have enacted article 50.  then there is Germany about to go through their electoral cycle and the same worries but different stories rising there .  and for me, the UK which is currently undermined in its democratic​ power by the apathy of voters and mired by those who voted complaining that we lost reason. (and a PM who on seeing polls U turned to declare an early election to use voter apathy to claw more power away from the opposition)",8년 전,0,

Uploading all DOF content, saving it and also turning it over to CPA and police! As well as MAKING SURE The DeFranco Channel and yourself as well as your staff and family would NEVER be sued by The DOF or MOF, so that no less than 93K people came to launch a kind of defense by massively Publishing all they could about the abusive F'ingBS in that house! Also if you did not see it, they got on a local news station (DOF-MOF) and well you need to see it to believe it! It is of important mention that Emma and Cody are now in temporary custody of their natural Mother, it also seems that the natural Father of the other remaining children is going for custody  as well! DeFranco all I can say is that you may have saved these children ALL of them! Being programmed to be sadistic, both mentally and also enforced with Physical violence! Well I think you saved more people than you could have imagined. I wept when you first reported this, I suffered this sort of abuse as a child of the same ages as Emma and Cody (Cody has ODD confirmed) So not only were they torturing these children in a very sadistic way, they were doing it to a child with Special Needs! So MASSIVELY I thank you and your family and your staff. Wonderful thing you did, and you should know you may have done a greater service than you realize",8년 전,5,

He may have 5m subs but if you've been watching his channel even within the last year you've realized that YouTube does not give him top tier ad revenue. His videos are also blocked under the restricted mode, further diminishing the returns via ad revenue. Creating a new networks, paying for utilities, staff, etc. is very expensive. Ad revenue alone (considering how big companies are pulling ads off of YouTube and forcing them to be more restrictive to who gets top tier ad revenue) would not be possible or sustainable. He's taking a risk and is investing his own money into this. He could have stayed safe and under his contract but he would have a lot more restrictions to what he can say and what he can upload. Under the circumstances of how YouTube demonetized many videos that they consider not ad friendly, it most likely created more content restrictions for Phil. I've been watching him since nearly the beginning of his YouTube career and he's definitely a guy I would trust. I'm not saying everyone should. But he's forsure one of my favourite if not my favourite content creator on this platform. Many creators on  YouTube are supported by Patreon. SciShow with the Green Brothers have been supported by Patreon for years now. If you don't like it, don't donate. But don't spread hate.",8년 전(수정됨),304,

Of course, we have to take his word for that. Personally, I do believe him, but I can completely understand the doubt.  I don't think it's realistic to expect someone to start a news network or any large network for that matter, with only their own money. How much is really a few million dollars in the attempt to start something like this? I don't think it's viable to say ""I'm starting this with my own money"" as if that would never could potentially change or as if he could cover that to begin with.  Nothing is stopping him from using the current formula, but looking at the bigger picture it's fair to say that he's not reaching that many people. How many views does a single show get? About 3 million? He's probably trying to reach a much larger amount of people than that. I can imagine that the end goal is hundreds of millions.  I think he's genuinely going for it and speaking the truth. I completely see where you are coming from and understand what you are saying though.

Not that it's not interesting to be up to speed, but you probably have many international viewers and it would be something I would certainly be interested in watching weekly, if not every few days.

@claespetersson1812,"How can a channel that is growing not have a better overwatch on it? Your channel clearly is not intended to spread lies and rumors, or to rile up a crowd. I do not understand why YouTube is not looking into this further. A channel that is growing, but is under the label of ""risky YT channels"" should have its case looked into further. Added subs wont come if the uploader is hateful and disgusting to everyone but his/hers own group of people. Clearly DeFranco gains subs, so what is the deal YouTube? What is so sensitive that you remove his income? There is no false truth coming from this guy and his co-workers. They try just as hard as you guys do, so give them some slack. Controversial channels with subs over X, gotta be looked into further by YT staff if the channel is still growing. But with this said, i still think everything will get back to somewhat normal again. Maybe not in a instant but i dont think it will take months and months further then it already has. They working on solving the problems but it seems like they are too quiet towards their youtubers. An open discussion with a ""red line"" between makers and YT staff. Needed now before it creates a wall between the two. It will not become good if a wall is created inbetween makers and YT, soon we will have to find another site and Twitch is not ok if i cant watch the videos when i have the time (and not when the streamer decides to stream).

@9littlefoot971,"mickskitz exactly! After 7 years of watching his content for free, the least I can do is invest a few dollars a month to help create something new. The ""he has his own money"" argument is stupid. First, if someone is ""worth"" X number of dollars, that doesn't mean he HAS that money sitting in the bank. It means he has a house, 2 cars, a business, etc and ALL of those things = X. Yes, he could buy/rent his own studio space, he could pay for renovations of his studio space, he could pay his employees out of his own pocket, and he IS doing all of that, but that's not a long term solution especially if his videos are losing monetization pretty quickly after being uploaded. And he could get sponsors, which I'm sure he will, but a long term solution is to crowd fund. If you want to donate $100 once, you CAN. If you want to donate $100 over 10 months, you CAN. If you want to be a crybaby and cry about him setting up a VOLUNTARY patreon, you CAN. But be aware, people are going to call you a bitch baby...since that's what you are.",8년 전,6,

But if you need to set up a patreon account to make ends meet then it's time you did what the rest of us do and that's get a fucking job and have some self respect.

That money could be composed of housing and other investments. I mean his house looks big but I wouldn't call it a mansion but if that's the case an easy 2 million would be there. Someone could have a million dollar net worth and have 50 bucks in the bank. I just didn't realize that half of the people in this comment section were business experts. I bet you guys all make pretty good money because you know how to manage it. Maybe you all should be the ones to donate. This video could barely be considered begging.

It's like a guy with a toupee trying to recommend a barber to me.. Also, I think this idea is very misguided. DeFranco has no experience in geopolitics, journalism, technology, philosophy, etc. There are already many independent news sources on Youtube and across the web, many journalists who are much smarter than DeFranco who delivery the news daily without bias or agenda.

I'd really prefer to have some concentrated news report of important things with no mention of youtube or youtubers unless youtube buys Ford or something, or a youtuber wins all the gold medals at the olympics.  I would also want shorter reports when there is no important news, meaning there is just a threshold for how important a story has to be to get reported.  The threshold of importance should be way higher if it's a speculative story rather than a conclusive one, so nobody has to waste their time considering too much speculation for days before the full story exists",8년 전,0,

@nielshealey6395,"Hey Philip DeFranco, I know that the current minimum $5 a month through Patreon is the best way of getting enough funding. For some of us (students, with low incomes) even 5 bucks a month can be pretty tough ( I really wish it wasn't cause I want to see this succeed). Is there anyway that you could allow us to do 1 time donations and/or maybe smaller 2 to 4  dollar monthly donations (that tier wouldn't really need any rewards ) but it would be a way for some of us who would like to support in away that is more than just watching your videos, to donate a little towards your dream. I know this comes off kind of cheap but I want to support and I am guessing that every dollar helps. I know for my own budget that I can't currently afford another 5 dollars a month, I don't know if anyone else is in a similar position. Even if smaller regular donations (smaller than $5) aren't possible to do with Patreon, maybe one time larger donations could be possible so that we can contribute larger donations when our budgets allow it and stop if we really need to?

Of course, it would be done in the DeFranco style, but maybe it'd be a little more like alt defranco.  Of course, I know Alex Jones is probably not someone you want to be like, so you would have to do it your own way, maybe somewhat like Joe Rogan.  Anything like that would be great.  Just bring people on who might be on some of those type of shows, give them a little time, so that you can introduce people to them.  It doesn't have to be anything that turns people off of you, because I know you will know how to do it your own way.  That's why we love Phil, because even if we don't agree with him on something, we still get his straight opinion on it.  The honesty is what we love.  I'm pumped!

You have no idea or a clue how to accurately check the accuracy of content unless you publish how you check and verify news stories. Until that time you will fall under the Entertainment News of slanted left leaning content of inaccurate news. Hire some one that understands fact checking and has a track record of doing so.

Back then i could watch anything entertaining, but now i only care about keeping informed on news that effects me.   If you want to stay true to your promise to lead with the facts you have my support and the support of people like me. i desperately desire for a modern Walter Cronkite or someone i know i can trust.   I DON'T want someone who wants to flush out a new ""political"" video every day or talks to people on the street for pageviews (anyone can do that). if you do decide to saturate your videos with entertainment for the monetization, just make sure to hold a respectable/well-researched segment once or twice a week. (Please, always present both sides of the argument like you plan to, and provide sources other than reddit).  Personally,  i don't care for multiple personalities. i would only prefer one anchor (you) with correspondents, the way John Stewart did it.   Modern news networks are failing, but they belong to corporations that are too big to fail. those guys are your competition and they don't want you to succeed.   Keep your target audience above 20. Your viewers may have started out as kids, but they are growing up and getting jobs and looking for someone to act as their voice in society.  i may have assumed too much in this comment, but if this resonates i hope it will guide you.

@brandimunguia,"Alnarra you should be aware that that is bullshit. Where a video 6 months ago with 100,000 views would generate $100, it is now generating $10, if you're lucky. That also if your video is monetized. Most of Phil's videos are no longer monetized because of the strict policies on youtube now in regards to what is considered advertiser friendly. Most of his videos are now only available in unrestricted mode and that means they aren't able to be monetized. On top of that, he isn't just 1 guy sitting in a room, filming a video, editing it and uploading it. He has a whole team of people he employs that help him find content to talk about, research the stuff, write his ""scripts"" and i use that term lightly, edit his videos, do his graphics, handle his hr department, handle his accounting department and so on and so forth. He runs a traditional business and employs the amount of people it would take to run a traditional business. So even if he was making around $400k a year, after you take out youtubes cut, which is typically 40%, whoever his network was, again normally 30-40%, the taxes he then pays on that income, again 30%, then his employees pay, he is pretty much left with a normal salary for someone working at a fast food restaurant full time. But again, that's going off the old analytics which no longer apply to Phil or any other youtuber.",8년 전,3,

I might be willing to offer you some ""free"" development work or technical consulting to help get your site made the right way (because I think it's a good idea). I am a full-time software consultant that works for one of the largest IT consulting firms in the world (developing web applications and services). Reply to me or send me a direct message and let's see if I can do something for you. I'm not saying that I'll build your whole platform for free and by myself, but I'll do what i can spare time for.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@chrismerrick7599,"I disagree. The name's not nearly as important as people think it is. For example when pewdiepie was being attacked by the wall street journal people assumed it was just another leftist mainstream media news site attacking free speech, however if you even looked at the name the "">WALL STREET<  Journal"" then people wouldnt jump to such conclusions and pewdiepie would not have been defended so much by the right (imo). My point is, people don't care so much about the name of a company as they do the output, if a company (or news organization) puts out stories that support the left or the right, the rich or the poor, the weak or the strong then that's what they'll be judged on.",8년 전,3,

I haven't stopped looking for news/content, I look around the web just like you and your team of fantastic co-workers, and teammates. i have a feeling that DefrancoElite will become one of the largest news networks within the next two years. I believe this because I know your passion. I sense your drive, and your wanting to give back in a way that thousands if not millions can absorb and take. You are right, this is a risky move, it is bold and dangerous. But all great trials start a little shaky, and I think you have the right mindset, after becoming a father, after seeing the world transform before your eyes, to create something beautiful and filled with your heart, soul, body, and mind.

@zacharypope7043,Will this new venture be airing solely on YouTube or are you planning on setting up another site for news articles and more videos that YouTube can't take down because of their vague rules?

And of course utilizing YouTube and other already streaming sites. I really think y'all can step by step drastically expand y'all's reach. Regardless if my guess is correct or not. I have been a fan for years and I definitely don't see myself changing that any time soon. The steps you are taking are directly towards your dreams and through the unknown at the same time.

Why did Phil wait X number of years to give HIS opinion not (?) tainted by “the powers that be” but yet kinda always—from my handful of witnessed videos—presented with his voice & character that he was giving his personal perspective?  Wait, I don't really care to know the answer, that however just crossed my mind when watching this video—that Google suggested would “fit” my curiosity/attention approval—about a free news source without​ a “sponsored” agenda.)    I imagine [based on some colab “Christmas” special a few years back] that there is an element of “Church of Jesus Christ of latter–day Saints” agenda that is underlying.  But that was only based off the one video, of the however–many–thousands–video catalogue accumulated... a miniscule scale for me to use to create an imaginary conclusion.

@godisnotgreat3311,"Can't say I have seen him as much of him as most of you, but enough to say this. He seems to suffer from a bias. A neutrality bias. The news is supposed to be objective, not neutral.  Maybe now that he is on his own, that will end.   The last thing the world needs in another cable style chanel, presenting both sides of an issue where there is not 2 sides. An example being climate change, there is not 2 sides. Having 2 people on, one spouts political talking points, the other facts and calling it a draw, then saying what do you think folks!  I am only using climate change as an example. There are many sides to that debate about solutions, should we tax carbon, should we intervene in the climate etc...  We also don't need another chanel calling itself news, when all they do is repeat the reporting of actual news stations and giving their opinion. That is not news, we have TYT who does that and calls themselves independent media. They are neither independent nor media. Nothing wrong with that, but don't call yourself independent media.",8년 전,6,

@godisnotgreat3311,"Ok, but sometimes there is not 2 sides to the story. 2+2=4 and that is all there is to that.  This panic about free speech is blown way out of proportion. A few , mostly back block, not leftists, protesting and rioting here and there is a minor problem when compared to the massive propaganda machine  on the right spouting lie after lie with an agenda to leave people with a false impression.  Of course attacks on free speech should also be covered. However there seems to be a lot of mid 30's youtubers absolutely obsessed with a few thousand, nation wide, idiots about free speech, when they give almost no coverage to a much larger threat. And judging from the content on youtube, free speech is not threatened by a few nuts. It is under threat by the current occupant of the WH and his ilk. They have the influence and money to affect free speech. You don't have to be silenced to have your free speech affected. All you need is to be drowned out by a mountain of mis information.   Also it is up to the speaker and the venue to stick to their guns, protest all you want, they are still speaking. They are allowed to protest, riot and get arrested. And that comes from the paranoid security environment since 9/11 created by the right wing.",8년 전,1,

To me, you have been one of the most forward thinking intellectuals to drive this country and more importantly this world forward this past century.

@Jarethification,"Totally behind what you're going for. I have a 'feeling' though you're far from the first person to have this perspective towards news/journalism. I could see you building a legacy and the ones who carry it on ruining it by making it become the daily mail (think of SourceFed). The people responsible for most news outlets probably shared your perspective when they first established their outlets. I'm not sure building a network will be more effective than what you currently do, as it is primarily down to the individual to deliver honest journalism, the network although a factor is less significant than the individual towards what you aim to achieve.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

You try to stay in that grey area trying to protect your brand but please stop with the I'm different. You are not. Ask people to fund a new news program so you have a outlet to voice your opinion.

@NewCanadianTurtle,"Phil, I garuntee this will be a failure. And I'll tell you why: Not everyone is open minded like you. At a certain point, you will end up hiring a journalist with super-liberal views and will likely spew anti-conservative propaganda. I can tell you're planning on hiring a whole crew of independent news staff. Will all of them be liberals? Or will there be a mix of conservative opinions as well? In order to further society, you need to challenge BOTH left and right wing views. I fear that this will turn into a far left propaganda machine like MANY other news outlets out there. Do you think you're the only one who tried to succeed in making a ""bias-free"" news outlet? Look through history, MANY have tried. And they all end up going either left-leaning or right-leaning. Mark my words, your news outlet will turn into this.  You should've just kept it as ""you"" only.",8년 전,0,

I saw a different side that I haven't seen before, a more honest Phil. I kept watching to see more, and eventually resubbed.

People are so entrenched in their beliefs that they are not only unwilling to even listen to a differing point of view, they want that differing point of view shut down so that it doesn't possibly influence anyone else listening.  At the slightest sign of disagreement every political conversation turns into vulgar name calling, comparing people to nazis, declaring everyone idiots that don't agree with them, and ridiculous straw man arguments.  The most disingenuous form of expression is shouting someone else down, but sadly that is pretty much the entirety of political discourse in this country right now.  People can't have rational civilized conversations about issues using facts to form the basis of their arguments.",8년 전,0,

By then the Earth has already been destroyed by our own greed and selfishness. Nature fights back by causing massive hurticanes and volcanic eruptions in attempt to defeat the humans. The aliens take notice of this and decide to help the petty humans rebuild civilization. In return for saving the humans, the aliens make the humans their slaves to take over the entire multi-verse. The aliens exhaust their strength while taking over the Multi-verse and very little life exists anymore. Luckily a hero arises Philly D who was in hiding this whole time rises up and gives the multi-verse un biased fair news hooray for all!    But everything changed when the fire nation attacked. Our hero trained in the arts of airbending a saviour destined to vanquish all evil..... is killed because hes just a news guy. But a small speck of life growing on a droplet of dog poop evolves and morphs with the poop. Taking the DNA  from the dog poop the speck of life becomes your average household doge but when he sees philly's dead body he mega morphs again and becomes an airbending news poop doge. The doge spits out stories on events happening around the world and bores the fire nation into submission. In a mere 3 days our new hero morphs with whole entire multi-verse and challenges god the battle is intense the is rages on for over 4 decades finally the doge takes down god and morphs with him.

If you close the door on science completely, you end up stopping any new innovation from that field. If someone says Vaccinations cause autism, it's their prerogative to show their data and evidence. If it checks out, then shit, guess who has to talk about vaccination...But if it's clearly wrong, (with science you can prove things) then the whole argument dissipates and you will be happy.

@nana-gl8zf,"I must say.. I'm kinda sceptical of how true you can stay to your vision since there are many biases that we as humans are simply unaware of. I'm more on the right side of the political spectrum and I know that sometimes I can be unfair with my opinions towards the left. But I agree that we need a platform and a mindset as a society where tolerance doesn't mean conforming to the most popular opinion but where tolerance is the true acceptance of each others differences and needs.  Either way, as I'm in college I'm not in much of a position to help you fund it, but once I start my job later in fall I'll be sure to support your cause (along with wikitribune, another project that I have high hopes for).

@Jaqen-HGhar,So answer me this if the truth actually sits on the left should a channel be middle of the road?  If the truth was on the right should it be middle of the road?  Because the truth almost never sits in the middle and arguing that someone should be middle of the road or should present both sides as if they have equal footing all the time is ignorant or dishonest.  The truth either is in favor of the liberals in some areas and with the conservatives in others and an honest person would be able to accept that.  Not label everything they don't like SJW.  I want Phil to turn into a channel that reports on the truth.  He's done a pretty good job of it so far but his fault is that oftentimes he bends over backwards to appear to be giving both sides equal say in the matter.  Sorry but every time we talk about the planet we shouldn't also have to hear what the flat earthers have to say.,8년 전,1,
@smallpseudonym2844,"major L - Ancala isn't saying that any of those things are ""wrong"". If that's what you read, I think you misunderstood. They're simply positioning his statements on the (oversimplified) left/right paradigm, (which in the US is skewed anyway).",8년 전,1,

Making the case and debating the issue is the right way, not attacking and shutting down anything you dont like hearing. thats why i think phil is one of the best news people on TY, maybe even the world. hes fair, honest, go to down and rip someone apart if you commit a crime against humanity, and will make sure the right thing is done. keep going phil.",8년 전,0,

However , I will not be contributing to the patreon, unless you allow the page to show the amount of money you and your team will be getting per month or per video.

Disclosing how much people have contributed is bad all around because then you'll have people thinking ""oh he has enough money now, my $5 won't make a difference."" People are becoming a patron because they want to and have the necessary funds to. I don't see how disclosing the amount is important at all.",8년 전,9,
@TheLeshegompe,this comment is ridiculous,8년 전,2,
@cynicalblossom3191,"No, he doesn't have to show you anything. I think you're the rude one for even asking this.",8년 전,2,
@TheRealCeeJai,"This kind of thinking is flawed from a logical standpoint. Let's say, for example, you have a grocery store in your neighborhood that you frequent for food and supplies every month. Do they have to post to you what they are paying the owner and/or employees? Do they have to inform the neighborhood of what they are spending their profits on? Does the owner of the store have to even publicly state what he's worth or how much he makes from the store each year? The answer to all of these is ""No, they don't.""   ""But I'm giving him money VOLUNTARILY. I should have some kind of report of their income."" No, you are NOT a stockholder, you are a Patron, which carries with it unique advantages and disadvantages. You are not buying into a share of their profits, therefore, you are not entitled to any financial disclosure on their part.  ""But I want to know how much they're making to see if the content lives up to what I think X amount of money should buy."" If you are afraid of paying someone before seeing or receiving the final product, simply don't. Let it ride a bit. There a plenty of people who will pledge early, and if you decide you like what they're doing, pledge later. If not, you can always contribute constructive feedback or just decide it's not for you.  No offense, of course. I've seen a lot of people say things like this lately. It seems some people think Patreon should have it's own kind of special social contract, but, to put it bluntly, I don't think it needs to be treated any differently than any other business where you pre-order specialty products.",8년 전,0,
@gustavlp,"CJ Krause, Actually, your thinking is the only thing that's flawed here. First off, you added levels to the ""issue"" that were completely non-existent in my original comment, and thus completely irrelevant. You painted a false equivalence between a fan-funded, online entertainment endeavour, and a standard business structure, which obviously has completely different cash flows and income sources. I mean, the grocery store is not funded by passionate customers. The store simply buys and sells items with a profit margin, whereas Phil creates virtually free content with an option to fund the production on the back end. These are not equivalent ar all.   Secondly, you're talking about this as if I have already contributed, and that I claim to be unhappy with my return. This is obviously not the case, as I clearly stated. I simply refrain from contributing until the total amount is displayed on the page (as it is for the vast majority of Patreon pages).  Imagine a fund-raiser for a charity, after which the organizers refuse to tell people how much money was raised. Seems a bit weird, don't you think?   Besides, an added bonus of displaying all the numbers on the page, such as how many people have chosen a certain reward tier, is that people who just want to support Phil and ""ride the bandwagon"" can do so. For instance, if you have trouble figuring out which tier is most worth it, you can easily make a choice based on the displayed stats, showing you which ones are the most popular. That way, you can feel more confident that you actually get some good perks for the money. Otherwise, you might very well have a constant thought of ""Am I one of just a few to actually choose this tier, instead of the one above or below?"".",8년 전,2,
@kelsischossler2401,"gustavlp you don't get to just create stipulations and make demands. You have two options: contribute based off of the information given to you, or don't.  Each tier shows you exactly what you get for the amount of money you contribute. That's transparency.   The perks you get for contributing is considered a ""thank you"" for donating and making the project possible. If you have to weigh your options to get the best bang for you buck for a donation to make a project possible, then maybe charity just isn't for you. And that's a really sad thought.",8년 전,0,
@TheRealCeeJai,"So, this is an interesting discussion. I understand your point of view, however, I do still disagree on some major points. If I may, I will take on your points as they appear in your response. Firstly, I do not believe I added any layers to this. Quite the opposite; I peeled it both down to the basics. The basics in this case being a business offers products (whether tangible or virtual) for monetary compensation.   I would also disagree that they have different income sources unless you are literally talking about taking people's money at a register as opposed to funding someone through a website. In both cases, you are paying before you receive the product, yes? Beyond that, I'm referring specifically to your comment regarding funding of his Patreon for his news network, thus still talking about paying for something before you receive it.   The last thing I would like to address in your first paragraph is your claim that Phil makes ""virtually free content"". Unless you are talking about free to the consumer, this is horribly wrong. Phil definitely has overhead, he has mentioned before about having to pay employees, bills, etc. for his show. I would argue that all of these mentioned points that you made are in fact, adding the levels you claim that I added to the ""issue"".  Going beyond that, I will say that if the vast majority of Patreon pages list that, that is fine. But that should in no way pressure other creators into doing the same. Some people may not be comfortable with that, and, in this case, Phil has stated this is a huge project. As others have stated - and should be common sense - trying to start a legitimate news network (whether on YouTube or elsewhere) is a huge and expensive endeavor, and posting the kind of money that would take might create unrealistic expectations in people's minds. I would add as well, that I have seen plenty of fully-funded Kickstarter projects that mentioned nothing about how much the people behind the project would be taking as compensation for their time, though they obviously would have to in order to have some income to merely survive, if nothing else. However, that is obviously anecdotal, and I digress.  To your point about charities, I would have to argue that is a true false equivalency - one is a business, the other is, obviously, a charity. They are governed by different laws, and vastly different rules regarding financial disclosure. So, yes, I would agree that a charity not disclosing how much it took in would not only be weird, but (at least in the US) pretty messed up.  To your last point: that is purely personal preference. I would be more than happy with them simply showing the percentage of people who donated in each tier (though I would make no demands that they do so). That way, you can still ""ride the bandwagon"" if you wish, but there is no burden or expectations created from any kind of financial disclosure. (Although, personally, I would wonder why you would donate to a certain tier just because everyone else is, but that's just my opinion.) I'm of the belief that if you are spending money on something, that you are already ok with what you are getting for that money.  Regardless of our differences of opinion, thank you for a well-argued and civil discussion. Quite the rarity on YouTube.",8년 전,0,

Both sides have this problem, with O'Reilly and Maher both being able to fall back on the ""we're just entertainment"" excuse whenever they give (purposely) misleading info. Just like seperation of church and state is important, I think we also need seperation of news and entertainment (or at least hold the entertainment parts up to the same standard of truth).",8년 전,0,

@drago2021,"This is probably gonna be swallowed by the deluge of incoming comments, but let's do this.  I remember the first time I saw one of your videos. It was like, 2009. I was in my world history class, not being a productive student. I saw one of your hilariously clickbait-y titles and said fuck it. I proceeded to watch one of the cringiest, douchey videos I'd seen in a long time. I hated the content haha.  Fast forward to 2015. I was in the hospital for two months after a major incident. June, I was in critical condition, constant surgeries. July I was stable, and had just gone into the physical rehab wing. And I was a month out of date, so I went on to YouTube to catch up. I came across one of your videos, but didn't make the connection to the massive douchebag from 2009. I loved your content. I binged through about 3 month's worth of content in the span of two weeks.  I've admired your desire to bring true news- current goings on rather than (the occasional) sensationalism drawn onto arbitrary bullshit. I've always wanted a place void of culture. No lines drawn between, ""Us and Them."" Religion, gender, politics in general don't matter here. Let's have a serious, respectful discussion about something, even if we keep all our biases intact. Then we can walk away simply having heard the other side. It's an amazing community you've gathered, and I thank you for it.  I don't know how bleak or vibrant all the behind-the-scenes, businessy bullshit is going, but here's to the best throughout all of it.",8년 전,0,

I have been very uninspired lately due to the fact that even though I am lucky enough to have great prospects in journalism after I finish my degree (I get good marks, have had lots of work experience and have made good contacts) the horizon still looks bleak to me. Commercial interests, fake news and sensationalism are all things I do not look forward to dealing with every day. I want to get into this industry to make an impact and to tell the untold stories, not have my main concern be what's going to sell (that's always going to be a concern but we could talk about that extensively). This gives me hope that there are actually people out there with integrity trying to make a real difference, and I hope I can find something like this in Australia when I graduate. I really hope you employ up and comers or seek interns to help students see that there is hope!!",8년 전,0,

Biased and wrong/unreliable are not synonymous. Just because you don't agree on some things with someone or don't like which team they're rooting for, doesn't automatically deem them incorrect. Which is why I don't  understand how anyone who watches FOX news can honestly believe that CNN is the unreliable one because of it's biases. We all have biases. We wouldn't be human if we didn't.

I've watched your family videos and I've seen the love and devotion the people you work with have for you. Because of these things, and despite any differences of opinion we might have, I believe in you.  I don't have a lot to give, but I have decided to support you as well as I can in this endeavor.

I know as a 36 year old married father of two, I probably don't fit within your average audience demographic, but you need to know that us ""older folks"" appreciate what you do for journalism.  Your ability to look at a story, set aside your own opinion, and state the facts in an objective and non-coercive way is something that has been missing from MSM news for a long time.  On top of that, I appreciate that you are not afraid to state your opinion once the facts are presented, and that you allow for others to respectfully disagree with you.  The entire concept of having a conversation that you so wholeheartedly subscribe to is one I wish so many more people would buy in to.  I don't know if you have ever seen the show ""The Newsroom"" (it was on HBO for three seasons in the early 2010's), but your ideologies and methods towards journalism are very similar to the main character's from that show.

He hardly ever opens up a story with ""These people did this dumb thing and this guy is a horrible person""  it's more like ""So this story blew up, here's what happened, here's what both sides of the issue are saying online, here's my sentiment.""  The way that he starts with the facts allows you to decide before even hearing his opinion on what you think.

(one year later when he is wearing a suit to look more smart and yelling at camera). jokes aside Im telling you as per his history of touching some news topics , he goes on topics that are famous and shares his opinion based on info that can be found with 2 mins of googling and also Im sure he cant take the fact that his views will drop by a lot because a real Journalist doesnt wait to upload at the ""lots of people are on youtube at this time"" time or gather a lot of clips and upload them all in one video, the thing is no one needs opinions, people just want news with facts provided to them. at the most he might become the second TYT, but he wont ever get close to real journalists like Luke at WeAreChange channel, this guy even travels to most  protests and gets right in between them to record everything live while things are blowing up right infront of his face with gas mask and goggles on.

@rarewavemusic,"I will be supporting you and I wish for you the utmost success.  To me, one of the challenges to your new venture is how to have this ""conversation"" you desire with your subscribers.  The commenting format of YouTube, Disqus, Facebook, or Twitter is not conducive to real conversations.  I don't have an answer, but I'd love to see a way to be able to comment on stories and read others' comments in some kind of non-linear fashion.  Top Comments or Newest First just don't cut it.  Maybe if the stories you share each have some type of commenting section of their own, rather than the entire show containing all the comments.  It's not feasible for viewers to wade through several thousand comments to know if a reply to a comment is more appropriate than making a new comment.  Sometimes, reading others' comments inspires me to see another point, but I can't read every comment, so I miss the majority of them, especially if I watch the video later than most, and if I watch the video shortly after it's released, I rarely go back to the video later to read comments. I hope you will be able to find a way to really engage your viewers through their interaction with you and each other.",8년 전,0,

@carlthellama3435,GalaxyEspeon Not just facts but fair judgement. Everyone has a bias but calling people on their shit (even if they're on your side) is important and Phil's been great about that.,8년 전,11,
@balls261,"I agree, but my only concern is that this idea might be too romanticised.  Even if we are to assume that Phil himself can present the facts in an objective way before getting opinions involved consistently (which he has done well so far) if more and more people are added to the team that may run the risk of the 'facts' getting slightly distorted, not researched properly, or subtly getting injected with a bias unintentionally or otherwise.  I trust in Phil's vision and a news network that focuses on facts first sounds great, but there's a part of me that feels like it can't be done.  That even if it does do well at launch it will only be a matter of time until the the objectivity starts slipping.  And that's not a judgement I'm making on Phil or any potential people he may hire to his news team, I just feel like it's human nature to gravitate towards bias even when you are trying not to.

CNN and FOX are full of political pundits on both sides giving their views and it's a shit show that plays into the reality tv drama that people love consuming. It's part of the reason we're in this mess. How about we go back to the days when television news outlets didn't editorialize so god damned much. The last thing we need is to hear more talking points from Antifa or Neo-nazis. Our population is full of people that are more passionate than thoughtful and think as long as someone is speaking passionately they must be right. Let's not giving these groups any more air time than they already have.,8년 전,1,
@ccdimage,"Agreed Jurgen.  How ""News"" is gathered is tricky. How it is presented is harder. There is a limited number of ""facts"" you can present in a 90 second bit about any news topic. The fresh news googled from Fox, buzzfeed, CNN, Brietbart, ... Has restricted ""facts"" to begin with.  Take this story ""Dog bites man"" and you want to do 90 seconds on this news. Do you. Call the man for a 60 second interview. Call the Dog owner for a 60 second interview. If you only call one of them you are open to accusation of bias. What if the Dog Owner has 300 seconds of ""facts"" to tell about the incident, but the Man has 120 seconds of ""facts."" How can you avoid bias or accusation of bias when you need to ""edit"" each persons ""facts"" to fit into 90 seconds total.  What if the Man, or Dog owner won't do an interview? Then you only have one side of the story so it is bias. EDIT: Of course not equally covering the ""Fire fighter rescues Cat"" story and covering the ""Dog bites man"" story is bias.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@ISSGOD,"A little bit of information about myself before I post my view. I have been doing online debate for nearly two decades and one thing that still gets to me is the preponderance of anecdotes argued as fact. Alternative facts are the norm now and argued as objective facts as opposed to the anecdotes that they are. I see alternative facts as a form of confirmation bias where only the evidence that backs a predetermined narrative is accepted, and evidence that does not support the predetermined narrative is summarily dismissed. Evidence should be objectively followed to a conclusion as opposed to starting from a conclusion and finding the evidence that supports the predetermined narrative. As of late I have literally been arguing that we need an objective source of news. I have been a viewer of your channel for a while now and am impressed by your objectivity. If you start a news network then you will have my backing and I will promote you to the best of my ability so long as you continue to be objective. Sadly my living of a fixed income makes financial support not possible. We need more objectivity to counter all the bias and if that is your goal, count me in and I will support you in any way that I can. Name is Robert by the way.",8년 전,0,

@BrandonDKirkwood,"Been with you from the very beginning many years ago man. My other channel is called vegan news and is inspired by you for sure. It's only a few months old but building quickly but I hit a snag, Trolls. They attacked my family and my character and it broke me for a while.  I've taken a break the last two weeks to get my head straight and thicken up my skin and I remember when you made a video too all those years ago saying you were quitting and selling your macbook, I did the same nearly. I didn't remember that video that no longer exists until a week ago but when I did I compared how far you've come through all that with what I'm building and am passionate about and realized it was the same thing.  I have a disability that took my profession I loved away and much of my social life and other activities I once enjoyed too. Finding out that I could channel my creativity into something new and helping the animals and seeing people enjoying what I make lit me up in a way I've never felt before! I found my calling!  Without all the episodes I've watched since 2005 or 06 or whenever this started I'd have not created what I have. Thank you for paving the way for so many of us and for helping to be part of what has channeled my suffering and pent up creativity into something I will do for as long as I live. You're my main source of news and have been for over a decade along with The young turks. Good luck to you and what you are building! I know it will be incredible and it's what the world really needs right now, old school neutral journalism. Hope I can buy ya a beer one day",8년 전,0,

I know there's pretty much no chance you'll see this but I'm a junior in college majoring in psychology and minoring in media studies. I've been thinking about what to do next year after I graduate and many things are appealing to me, especially new (not news) media like Youtube. With my degree I hope to be able to apply psychology to improve media productions and also use industrial/organizational psychology to help media and tech companies and their employees. I thought I'd throw that out there since you're expanding your network and will need more people to make it all possible.

@CaptainMcAwesomepan,"""Back in the late 1700s, however, doctors literally blew smoke up people’s rectums. Believe it or not, it was a general mainstream medical procedure used to, among many other things, resuscitate people who were otherwise presumed dead. In fact, it was such a commonly used resuscitation method for drowning victims particularly, that the equipment used in this procedure was hung alongside certain major waterways, such as along the River Thames (equipment courtesy of the Royal Humane Society). People frequenting waterways were expected to know the location of this equipment similar to modern times concerning the location of defibrillators.""

@7Comic7mischief7,"Alright DeFranco, here we go.  I've been following you long enough to not be proud about starting to watch you, those were some rough beginnings. You've grown into a guy that I'm totally ecstatic to tell people I watch.  I don't think anyone starts without the intentions you've enumerated. Everyone wants to be independent and fair. Do I think you will actually pull through on it? Maybe. If past experience means anything, there are topics where I think you really do present both sides fantastically, but some where you seem purposefully middling, afraid to talk about the pros to one side even if you talk about the pros to the other (which you always do) for fear of COMMUNITY backlash.  Because that's that special thing about you. You see the tides turning. It's easier to break away from corporations now that the community has the power. Patreon, merch, crowdfunding projects, they are all more stable and often better paying than Youtube ad revenue. But they're as dependent on your community as you've ever been on a corporation.  I'm saying, please don't separate with the corrupting powers that be only to fall prey to the emergent corrupting power of public favor. You're gonna take hits. You're gonna say things people won't like. You always mention that you're okay with this happening, but now you're quite literally putting your money where your mouth is.  But as I said, if there's any single creator that I think could do it, it's you.  Best of luck, my guy.",8년 전,0,

If you fail to achieve your dreams, change your ways not your God. Remember, trees change their leaves and not their roots. You will never reach your destination if you stop and throw stones to every dog that barks. Haters will see you walking on water and say its because you can't swim. Even if you dance on water, your enemies will accuse you of raising dust. Make it your ambition to live a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your own hands.

Compared to the other people at the event (Nadeshot, Tobuscus, H3CZ & many more) I was small. Most of the big creators there were not too interested in talking to me. But I started up a conversation with Phil on the bus to the event as I'd been watching the PDS for years. To my surprise Phil was even nicer in real life. He gave me a ton of tips for YouTube, answered any questions I had and really inspired me to keep growing my channel, beyond all of that he was just... super nice, like REALLY genuine and kind in person, a real gentleman. A few years later I'm at 85k subs and growing steadily. Phil if you're reading this, thank you for being such a genuinely nice human being and treating others with respect.

I've never given to a crowd funded campaign before, but the PDS is the one place I can get information and not want to mute the speaker because of some bias or agenda. (Although you make that option easy by giving the facts first and your opinions second. Thanks for that.)  I'm really excited for this.

@Mck6,"Calling a network ""DeFranco Elite"" might be a mistake. Most of all, it has the elitist ring to it, giving it a negative connotation from the start. Then you put your name at the front, which while not bad in itself, sounds narcissistic. While it's fine as a show name with you as the main star/host, and many people put their names in their company names, it's usually done in a neutral manner (""Soandso's Shipping Company"", ""Turner Broadcasting System""). Imagine if CNN was called Turner Elite? How much more flack would they be getting nowadays when supporting the establishment with that name? Putting both together just compounds their effect.  Elite is also a strong word (like 'super', 'extra', etc.), and shouldn't be used in the name of the whole network. If I were to give the name ""DeFranco Elite"" to anything, it would be like a chat or Q&A with your patrons or something.  Other than that, good luck!",8년 전,0,

@EimileMabry,"In addition to my previous comment, I'd like to add a few things:  I would love to support your Patreon, but my question is what does the ""patron"" get that they don't mostly get from your YouTube videos? Yes, I've already viewed the page. Q&A's, livestreams... I mean, I'll watch them if you post on YouTube, but I live in Chicago where your typical stream/upload time coincides with my commute home. I mean, if you were doing a full news broadcast for like 30 minutes then I'd be like I gotta pay this dude but I've never heard you talk about longer videos - just more frequent (still dope!). Sometimes we get 8 minute videos, sometimes 15 (personal fave). When  I think about the other people I support or subscribe to, they're all streamers who are streaming for multiple days a week for sometimes hours at a time. Sooo yeah? I just wanted to throw my two cents in. I'm sure this has all already crossed the team's mind, buuuuuut yeah. :)",8년 전,0,

Phil's channel have one special thing about them, just one thing that make different, the only thing that we're really all here for; Phil and his team, without them we wouldn't be here, and because of that taking his channels away would be pointless.",8년 전,0,

A point a friend of mine raised is that you focus on gathering available information from different sources and verifying it, but some may say that's not journalism. That to be a journalist, one of the things you need to do is be one of the people asking questions and posting the answers, instead of just gathering information from other journalists.

It will likely take them many years to realize hey that Phil guy is making a lot of money doing that thing we said doesn’t sell, we should get in on that.

But I don't think it's fair that a significant portion of female graduates hold these kinds of degrees (guys do this too, as a disclosure), then can't get a job, THEN complain about the gender gap when they have to settle for something that can't pay the bills.  At the end of the day, college is an investment.  You have to strike a balance of what you like and what is actually useful.  Degrees like Media Production are ones that are generally easy to get and therefore aren't valuable.  TLDR; chase your dreams, but don't complain about it when it doesn't work out.",8년 전,0,

Even if you tried to soothe the masses saying that the show would not go anywhere, you dropped enough hints to ease everyone in the new direction you wanted to take the channel. Yes, it was no surprise that you wanted to create what you think the people need. An unbiased media outlet, with no strings attached to major corporations that could influence the legitimacy of the news reported. You know, what we expect from the media, but they've proven time and time again that they are not that. On a personal note, I was kinda expecting this video to be more of a ""this channel wont feature me anymore, and I'm moving into xyz channel with my team, with my new vision and project"" themed announcement.  I'm sorry to say I cannot afford to be a patreon, but you'll have my sub if need be, and my view, whenever your content is out. And if technically I can help you out, since tech is kinda my area, be sure to reach out and I'm glad to lend a hand.

@BrokeredHeart,"Looks like I'm putting my money where my mouth is. I have long touted the importance of subscription fees, and the necessity we create as consumers for businesses and media that represent us and our concerns. We want accessible media, accurate news headlines, investigative journalism that doesn't have an agenda, and well-written entertainment. But nobody is willing to pay for it. Be honest, like me, it stems from the laziness of knowing there are other sources that siphon off original content and deliver it to you for free, all while selling out to advertisers and private investors who care about their bottom line. It's the sheer convenience of free media that keeps people from subscribing to print sources, websites with monthly fees, or even donating one-time payments to publicly funded stations (like PBS).  I think that after 6 years of watching Phil's Youtube channel change and evolve that I'm prepared to pay in for a non-partisan news station. This is one of the few places I come to for daily headlines and the occasional BAMF of the Day, and I think that this is one of the simplest ways to get involved in a project that can instigate positive change in the news media landscape.

Don't get me wrong, it's important to have an opinion on something, but news is supposed to give you the information without attempting to sway you one way or another. That's my favorite part of this channel, Phillip DeFranco tells you the news as unbiased as possible before sharing his opinion, and even when he does, he gives it in such a way that makes it possible to disagree without feeling like the bad guy. So thank you for doing this independently to ensure it stays that way, and congrats on this huge step forward! :)",8년 전,0,

@HyuugaCrim,"I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black men/women, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each others' happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.  Greed has poisoned men's souls; has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge as made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in man; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all.  Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say ""Do not despair."" The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.  Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder! Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men---machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have a love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural.   Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it’s written “the kingdom of God is within man”, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power.   Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill their promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers! To do away with greed, with hate and intolerance! Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness.  Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!  Charlie Chaplin final speech in The Great Dictator",8년 전,0,

@laughingachilles,"Dear Phil.   I know you have an ocean of comments and so my single drop will likely be lost, but I do hope someone on your team reads this and presents it to you.   I have followed you for a long time, this account is much younger than yours but I assure you that I was watching your channel from the first year that you created it. At the time channels like Katers17 and communitychannel were huge, I saw you arrive and have watched ever since. I have always respected the balanced approach that you took to reporting, an approach that the mainstream media had abandoned long ago. You always seemed to go out of your way to put aside your bias, which is exactly what a decent journalist should do.   With all of that said, I think it is important to note that simply talking about a topic is not enough as the facts we have available are often filtered through official sources. What is needed for a new media platform is an open source approach to the sourcing of material. If you want facts then they must come from direct on the ground sources, rather than analyzing the sources which are presented to us from the mainstream media. I wish you the best of luck for your new platform. From what you have produced over the years I believe that you will indeed create a superior news source.   All the best to you sir.",8년 전,0,

@takealisten3104,"Man I'm so excited for this campaign, you, and your team that you build! I like when you said you're bringing in ""New faces and old, making old formats better, and introducing new"". Obviously, at this point I don't know what that means, but it's got me SO excited! I've been with you since 2008, watching your videos when I was a sophomore in college at ECU. One of my friends told me that somebody that went to ECU had a YouTube channel, so we started watching. I was there when you tried to act like Dane Cook, every video thumbnail had a hot girl in it, and I agreed with you more often than not, but also at times thought you were a bit of a douche. But always entertaining. And now I've seen how much you've grown from then to now, and how much you've built. I was also a fan of SourceFed and SourceFedNerd. Since you're only a few years older than me, I felt like I've grown up right along with you. You've opened my eyes to other perspectives and I respect your opinion a lot. Hopefully with this new campaign it can allow you to extend your reach to more people and do more great shit! I'm so proud of everything you've accomplished and you inspire me to do more! I'll say it again, I'M SO EXCITED FOR WHERE THIS CAN GO!",8년 전,148,

""Don't have friends? Buy some from Japan""  In an era where ""fake news"" and bias floods our ability to get proper sources and reliable sources, Source Fed chose to post stupid shit that bit them in the ass.

Phil, since you have the following you do, how does using patreon benefit you and your organization?  I'd have allot more faith in your network remaining impartial if you simply accepted support through your own merchant account through your own website, instead of placing another biased, corporate influencer in between your financial supporters and your organization. Seriously, I do need that to be explained, because Patreon is just another corporate roadblock that uses your money and attempts to control your narratives by threatening to ban you if you report things they don't like. It's already started happening to others. Using Patreon makes me wonder why, since, at your level, you'll obviously be generating more traffic for patreon that patreon will ever generate for you.",8년 전(수정됨),9,

In the beginning it was honestly just an annoyance - all of those damn clickbaits :P . But recently (last two years or so), I've followed the channel more closely. I've personally been annoyed with many news sites and commentators - everything has their personal point of view coloring the story, sometimes glaringly so. However, I don't really see this within the channel. He makes it clear that what he say is his own opinion (even stating that it is just that: his opinion, not fact), and there's an actual attempt to be objective (and something I think he succeeds at). And most importantly: he gives you both sides of the story, and I actually think that his goal is to find out the truth - and this isn't just something he says, but something that has been apparant in every episode I've seen. I actually trust what he says - which is hard to do, because I'm extremely cynical... So yeah, this is actually great for journalism. An actual news site with some damn ideals!

@TechTubeCentral,"I hate when people say ""let's hear both parts out"". Some topics, one side is so ridiculous with their beliefs that putting them on the same level does a disservice. For instance: You shouldn't discuss climate change with Bill Nye, and someone who says ""God is the answer to everything. He will keep us safe & climate change is false"". By having a discussion with someone who is clearly wrong and completely irrational, you're propping up a fake narrative that a topic like this is up for an actual debate, when in reality it's settled science. It's like Bill Nye says: If you're going to discuss a topic such as climate change, you can have a ""skeptic"" on as an ""expert"" or someone to ""debate"", but then you should also have 33 others that disagree with them. Otherwise you're weighing them as equally valid opinions.",8년 전,0,

I see a lot of news organisations do that, and it's not a good segment: It doesn't reflect public opinion, doesn't add any new information to the story, especially since most people you ask won't be properly informed, and personally, I find it very unprofessional. It comes over as if they couldn't find enough content to fill time, so they fill it up with random people. It also tends to be biased, since they generally show the people they agree with (although I suspect and hope this won't be a problem with you).",8년 전,0,

The media's determination to ""see what both sides are saying"" has led to a nonsense debate that has possibly put the world past the point of no return in terms of fixing damage done to the planet by man-made climate change and given a platform to people where there should have been none (and I say that as someone who advocates for free speech in almost all circumstances).  So please, for the love of God, let there be a conversation but DON'T fall into the neutrality ""two-side"" traps that have plagued mainstream media for decades.

For someone who advocates for free speech in almost (of course there's an almost) all circumstances, you sure like the idea of not giving a platform to people with opinions that you disagree on.

@dimavasilev5342,"+Lim Stefanic So how about allowing people to carry on saying smoking doesn't cause cancer and presenting it as a credible second side to the discussion? Unless Phil's news show goes ""well here are the two sides, but let me be absolutely clear, this second side is dumb as fuck, factually wrong and might make things worse if people hear it and believe it, but gotta have two sides, what you gonna do?"" then it is an issue. If his show actively debunks the bullshit second side on air in real time and makes paid-off ""experts"" from pharmaceutical/oil/whichever companies have to disclose on-screen the money that backs their views and ""evidence,"" then I'm all for it, let's pretend two sides all the way. But the likelihood of that being the case is unbelievably slim. EDIT: And by the by, I'm talking in the case of debunked, factless opinions not being given air time. People can air their opinions all they want, but when it's something the equivalent of ""gravity isn't real"" or ""alcohol causes no health issues"" and the person saying it isn't presented as dumb/lying/extremely-very-wrong, then that is the ""almost"" for me - a case where it is empirically wrong, there's no room for debate, and allowing other discussion drags society back when progress is essential. Just try and say letting people believe smoking is good for you isn't dangerous, go on? You wouldn't allow a kid who insisted ""1+1=3"" to repeatedly spout that view in a class which has already understood and is trying to move on, since that kid would get in the way of the other kids learning and making progress. You'd take the kid to one side and explain one-on-one why they're wrong and pray they got it eventually, but you wouldn't let them prevent the other kids from progressing. You don't drag everyone backwards for the sake of stupid.",8년 전(수정됨),0,
@l.s.8201,"Dima Vasilev Well yes, I'm all in for allowing people to carry on saying smoking doesn't cause cancer. It doesn't matter what you think makes things worse, if people believe it, if it's a big issue etc. Free speech isn't just some weird thing to fap around whenever you feel like it, it's a principal. And no matter how stupid, bad meaning etc. someone's views are, everyone, as a principal, should always have the liberty to express their views. I can see that based on your comments about ""not letting people who deny man-made climate change to have a spot on the show because it's dangerous"" you don't understand that free speech isn't just the freedom to express yourself, it's the freedom to make a fool out of yourself as well. Free speech is free speech, it's a principal that cannot be bent and cannot be broken. Even the most stupid views must be able to access the public forum so the public can savagely rip them to shreds.",8년 전,0,
@dimavasilev5342,"+Lim Stefanic Like I said, I'd give those people a platform for those debunked, factually incorrect opinions, provided that as soon as they were given, they were immediately fact checked, debunked and had it made sufficiently clear that the person spouting that belief is a liar/paid off/thick as two short planks. I don't trust the average person to listen to a confident well-versed oil-paid politician talk about climate change not existing/not being man-made/etc. and remain completely unswayed. Family members of mine who are college educated are still swayed on the climate change nonsense because they don't find out that the charlatan onscreen is an oil lobbyist. Broadly speaking I think we agree on picking apart stupid views through debate, but the media have done a piss-poor job of making it sufficiently clear how backwards some views are or where they're coming from. Treating facts as opinions, to me, gets into a very dicey area of free speech - you can have opinions on the slant of those facts, but acting like they aren't facts is highly detrimental, and the news (a venue where you're meant to factually inform yourself) should not allow that to be possible. I want to trust Phil to be the news channel that will lead the way in debunking stupidity and exposing vested interests live, but ""let's hear two sides"" worries me based on the history of the news. I guess it comes down to ""how much faith do you have in Phil and his team to do the right job in highlighting facts?""",8년 전,0,

One suggestion though, I really wish you had a website. Not only would it be good to know that your content is somewhere on a space that is yours, but I would also love if you had a Careers page. It would be awesome to have the knowledge of openings the Defranco company has and know what you're looking for in hires, and in the meantime, I would love to see other people from the community joining your team!

@FuckItSnoopy,"I sometimes worry when you talk about these things. It sounds great the way you present it, but I see a lot of downsides to it. First, it seems like you are very prone to being bias. Not toward the left or the right, but the middle. Putting two people with differing opinions on each side of the table to debate each other is good if there's really a discussion to be had, but that also leads to a false equivalency in certain topics. Climate change deniers vs climatologists, conspiracy theorists vs scientists... If the overwhelming amount of evidence favors one side of an argument, then acting as if both sides have equal weight to their points does a massive disservice to the viewing public who will think there is no truth to get to, it's all just opinions. Second, you talk about mainstream media the same way a lot of people talk about experts in any given field with a certain amount of distrust or downright disdain for them. The WSJ has published some silly shit in the past that were clear mistakes, same with Rolling Stone, Time, and any other outlet that employs actual journalists, but that doesn't mean you can't trust anything they say. I know you need to try to brand yourself as being different from the sources because they have such a stink on them right now (at least as perceived by other people), but just try to keep that in mind when you actually start your network.

@98areece,Jonathan they do polls on these things,8년 전,1,
@98areece,"THE POLLS WERE RIGHT!!! They had her up by 3-5% points with a 4 pt margin of error. That's what happened. You can't ignore the facts. Phil doesn't do good journalism. He makes false equivalencies between the left and the right all the time (ex. the Berkeley protestors were compared to Trump and Phil said the left & right are equally at fault) . He also only promotes the full context of a clip when it fits his narrative (he made a jab at TYT before and didn't play or link to the full context of the clip). Also, he only talks about a story when it blows up (good journalist will spotlight smaller stories to draw eyes to it). Also, he (like most of the media) won't talk about an issue, but the debate around an issue. He NEEDS to find facts about what would actually solve problems and go from there, not rely on those speaking out for solutions. I genuinely want him to succeed but he needs to do it the right way. I'm trying to help",8년 전,1,
@98areece,"Btw, an independent poll isn't an echo chamber. You have presented no evidence of the polls being biased either. Learn the facts please",8년 전,1,
@98areece,"You honestly don't know what you're talking about. TYT presents multiple viewpoints and give their take (usually discrediting them). Phil gives viewpoints that fits what he thinks, he regularly leaves opposing viewpoints out (I assume for time). There usually isn't a left vs right thing going on, theres a lot of gray. He presents info as if the gray doesn't exist at times. Btw he SHOULD look up to TYT. They have been independent media for 15 years, and they just hired new investigative reporters, using the $2,000,000 they just crowd sourced. Just because TYT takes a side doesn't mean they aren't news, they offer there opinions (multiple opinions). It's just Phil on camera, you don't hear from multiple people. HE decides the narrative and what facts are presented. I'm saying this needs to change so he can have more credibility.",8년 전,1,

@ODST_Parker,"That's a great way to think about news, but as someone often (not always) on the opposite end of your views and values, especially concerning politics, I feel like I should say you can be very condescending when discussing people who don't share your side. ""Facts"" are only facts if they're as unbiased as possible. Change up your sources, since there are so many that don't fall under that category nowadays. If you find something, always see if there's something that says otherwise. Don't ever take ""facts"" as facts just because someone says that's what they are.

@Locknesss,I would like to thank you Philips defranco and everyone and everything that goes into making your show. I have depression and I used to self harm. I have had suicidal thought but people always told me It was selfish to take you own life and end the pain. I have been called selfish and a Faker and liar about my depression and because of that I stopped looking for help. I nearly killed myself a few times and I haven't been happy . that all changed when I found Your channel and a few others. I watched through tons of your video and they made me smile.  Thank You ❤,8년 전,0,

Instead it's a gesture to say you are one of the people I respect in this world.

Phil, since you have the following you do, how does using patreon benefit you and your organization?  I'd have allot more faith in your network remaining impartial if you simply accepted support through your own merchant account through your own website, instead of placing another biased, corporate influencer in between your financial supporters and your organization. Seriously, I do need that to be explained, because Patreon is just another corporate roadblock that uses your money and attempts to control your narratives by threatening to ban you if you report things in a way that they don't like. It's already started happening to others. Using Patreon makes me wonder why, since, at your level, you'll obviously be generating more traffic for patreon that patreon will ever generate for you.",8년 전(수정됨),2,
