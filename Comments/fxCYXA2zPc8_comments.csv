@kyjo72682,"Flat keys are good for constrained environments like laptops (which you only use as a temporary/backup solution until you can get to a proper desk with a proper keyboard). They are unusable for productivity. So Apple Magic and MX Keys are out, right off the bat.. plus they both have stupid layout, like the F-keys all smushed together with no grouping, and the media keys mixed in with the F-keys. Media keys are nice to have but as a programmer I definitely need to access the function keys much more, and I need them to be physically separated into groups for more intuitive access.  Sound/noise is an important ergonomic consideration (the quieter the better) but RGB underlight is definitely NOT. If you need underlight on your keyboard you already have unhealthy workspace and you need to switch on proper lights. Working in the dark, especially against a strongly lit monitor with high brightness/contrast will damage your sight. Again, the only acceptable use case for underlight is constrained temporary environment like laptop.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

I'm a woman so I have smaller hands, and that could honestly be the reason, but I would definitely discourage other people from getting the same one if they want to type for extended periods of time.

@blackimp4987,"very technical and accurate review. As programmer, I really appreciate it. My everyday keyboard is standard Lenovo, Italian layout, with big L return key, and I love it. It's not too noisy, all its keys - except for the space bar - are concave which helps to center the finger on the key and not pressing the wrong one - something that happens very often with Apple keyboard. You explained very well exactly what I thought and felt about Apple keyboard which I had to use many times for programming iOS apps... until I ""found out""  I could use a window keyboard with an Imac. My fingers need at least 3 mm for exhausting their force when pressing . A lower range key means my fingers feel traumatized when the key reaches the bottom.  I'm searching for a quiter and backlighted keyboard for programming at night, but unfortunately most of them are wifi and I don't want to waste my time and money with batteries or recharging them.

The huntmans in comparison has really good quality keycaps and I love the sound when typing.

We won't be shaking or carrying our keyboard. most of the time it sits on the table or desk while programing. We are focusing for programmers so WPM is just an icing on the cake, we are more like codes per minute where we type a lot of special characters.

The logi G915 has a soft click that I find more tactile than the tactile keys. It's not obnoxious like some gaming keyboards.  I tried it out at a best buy near me before buying. I bet it's still on display as it's a popular keyboard.  When my first one stopped holding a charge, it was replaced by Logitech quickly.   Logitech had always been the king of ""budget"" hardware accessories. The top end of the cheaper stuff that has 90% of the features for much less than the luxury or niche, purpose built stuff.   I definitely recommend it. It's a nice feeling and looking keyboard.",2년 전,0,

@KTMcaptain,"So my max typing speed is about 90-95 wpm on my craft keyboard (which is very similar to the mx keys). I recently switched to a huntsman and I was so inconsistent down to 45-65wpm with high error rates. I returned the huntsman and got a G915tkl tactile and now I'm up to 80wpm without errors. . You say the G915 tkl is rattley, but honestly my huntsman was far more rattley. It's interesting to see you typing test because the ones I use have numbers, punctuation, and longer words. I really don't like typing on mechanical keyboards, but I can see what you mean by the extra distance means you don't have to bottom the keys out very often. For me, the shorter keystrokes of the scissor switch allows me to keep errors down and just glide to the next key.  . Ultimately I am extremely happy and agree with you that the G915 is like a hybrid of the huntsman style and craft (mx keys) style keyboard. It's low profile enough where I don't need a wrist rest, but it does have far deeper keys.",3년 전,0,

Logitech also sells a super short wrist rest for the mx keys.  I just bought the mx keys and am testing it out in comparison to the Logitech K800. The main issue I have so far with the mx keys is the low key travel, which makes it harder for me to mentally ascertain that I actually pressed a key and move on to the next key. So while my tested typing speed is still very high, I sometimes doubt I've pressed a key and might accidentally press it twice.",4년 전,0,

@dominictripodi4777,"I totally agree about the typos on linear razer keyboards, I have the blackwidow tkl with linear switches and it can be problematic. One you didn't look at, that's even cheaper, is the smartduck xs84, I'm a big fan, it's an 75% layout, so like the TKL but a little more snug, the home cluster runs up the right side of the keyboard, and the arrow keys cut into the right shift key(which can be annoying) the software for smartduck is also a bit clunky compared to razer synapse (I'm only using these on Windows and Linux).   One thing I wish you had gone over for these is macro programming. Maybe I'm spoiled with razer synapse, because it has a macro shift capability, which lets you map macros to every key of a shift, and I use this all the time for double-click copy, double-click paste, and full paths to repos I'm spending a lot of time working with at any given time, formatting and commenting shortcuts for specific editors like vs code and ssms. With the smartduck software you can switch between profiles to get something similar to the layered shift macros in razer synapse, but every time you switch profiles it caches the old profile in memory, and starts pulling tons of RAM if you keep switching back and forth until you stop and restart the software.  I'd consider trying the steelseries (and replacing the keycaps with PBT caps) if it had the ability to program on a shift like razer does, and I personally have to rule out the G915 because I can't put PBT caps on it.  Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I feel like I'm kind of stuck with razer for the macros, I could function without them, but I feel like they play a bigger role in my coding efficiency than WPM which, admittedly, is negatively impacted by the linear switches.  Just my 2 cents, but overall I really like the video.",4년 전,1,

The mouse is ambidextrous so can be used with either hand - I use mouse left hand. I especially like the keyboard as its got a number of multimedia keys for sound, video and web. I especially like the calculator key which I'm forever using. Decent amount of key travel, smooth and quiet enough key presses. No backlighting though (though for me, its white only I ever use in other keyboards). Price-wise its also pretty affordable.  I've recommended this set and they've come back with very positive comments.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

I use Kinesys keyboards because I had begun to develop Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and the split keyboard cured it.  I also migrated from QWERTY to Colemak.  My fingers travel 30% less than QWERTY so my finger muscles are much less fatigued at the end of the day.

Gotta stop, gotta analyze, gotta think, and I certainly cannot do all those so fast as to make that speed count towards anything during programming. If the type of programming one is doing is so reliant on pure mechanical speed prowess, I question why some sort of automatization procedure has not been placed in use to produce what I can only imagine to be boilerplate code and/or manual copy+pasting, which demands near to zero thinking and then can make that typing speed come out. The only alternative I can think of is it's not boilerplate, it's just that people in the industry are pure geniuses that can think that fast while typing, in which case, well, FML, guess I chose the worst career path for a single threaded slow thinker like me.

This does not make any sense to me, nor why Logitech would go this route. I realize this is a specialized switch, but making the light pass through would have made this board a top-of-the-line choice for programmers. As it stands here, I do still love the keyboard, but it's hindered a bit by that poor decision of Logitech. I'm not the best typist, so I do often need to see which key I'm hitting, especially aside from the main keys, and the lack of back-lighting really just hobbles an otherwise phenomenal keyboard.

Using an old desktop keyboard always increased my finger fatigue and number of typos. Soon I realized that the problem was the travel and key size. It just felt much faster and easier for me to move around on the keyboard when the keys weren't very tall. But the notebooks had real keys, not these ""apple style"" keys that almost every notebook has these days.   So basically, they had this same layout of the Logitech you just showed. I still own an old razer lycosa and they keys are perfect (just a bit stiff because of age) and im considering the move to get something like the Logitech you recommended.

Took a couple days to get used to, then never looked back.  I personally use a sculpt and its been very good to me, but I was wondering what your take on them was. . In the same line as the ""mid-height"" mech keys there's the Keychron picks.  I have a K1V1 and it's too sensitive and travel too short/abrupt, was hard on my fingers so I don't use it.  I have yet to try the v4 though which supposedly fixed both of those things.  Maybe I'll pick one up.  They do have terrific RGB effects as you mentioned multiple times you like that, and they're wireless if you choose.  May be a good alternative to the K915, suggest you try it at least.

The killer thing I like about the Logitech MX line is the Flow feature that lets you switch back and forth between two computers.  I haven't seen anyone else do anything close to that.

@bradarnett8632," @theforbiddenone2926  Your best bet is to look for a switch tester that has them in it.  Gateron testers are cheap, but finding one for the creams might be hard though.  Gateron Yellows basically feel like Reds that have stiffer springs in them.  There's not much nuance to linear switches except for how far they go down and how much force it takes.  Also, at the end of the day, it's kind of just his opinion if he doesn't like browns.  People hate on them often, but they're fine switches that are perfectly capable of functioning as intended.  You can enjoy a youtuber while still not necessarily needing to latch on to their every word.   Try some new switches if you're curious, but don't feel pressured into it by others.

@nicholash8021,"The best thing you can ever do for yourself as a programmer is learn the entire keyboard and never look at it. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to watch someone type with their head down and with only two fingers, then a minute later look up and have to go back and fix stuff. I've even seen people land on different screens and keep typing. You'll definitely save more time by thinking your design through very carefully ahead of time, but when it comes to writing it, knowing the keyboard will save you countless hours of programming and will help you focus better and relieve stress as typing becomes second-nature. My keyboard has no symbols on it (solid black keys) because I figured I don't need them anymore, and it deters people from using it. For what it's worth, I started programming in 1981 and never stopped, so I'm saying this from experience and hoping I can convince you to make touch-typing your #1 priority as a developer.",2년 전,0,

(Laptop keyboards are among the worst for the health of your hands.)  I have a separate numpad for those rare occasions when it might be helpful. In general, there are a lot of really great mechanical keyboard switches out there right now; the trick, however, is finding the switch that fits your needs and typing style. This can take a long time: some switches seem initially appealing, but are less so after several weeks of use. Also, you don't have to build it yourself. I enjoyed building my own; the soldering required is just old-school through-hole soldering. There are even what are called ""hot swappable"" keyboards that allow you to change switches without soldering. Even if that sounds like too much for you, you can find craftsmen who will build a custom keyboard to your specifications, though this is usually a bit expensive. Still, look at it this way: if you spend a significant amount of your life interacting a computer via keyboard, you want to make that time efficient and healthy, and a premium custom mechanical is a way to do that.",5년 전,1,

Points being not as much typos, confidence in keystrokes, and confidence in actuation. Also, when you’re pretty much 9-10 years into your profession, you’re pretty much programming as quick as you’re typing, it’s just natural. Most of your coding is going to be maintenance of other systems anyways so it’s just quick fixes. I understand custom mechs can much better fit your needs, but when you go low-profile, there’s not really any options for that. I personally prefer low-profile because it just feels more comfortable for me personally. Basically, a low-profile office keyboards is fine for me, does the same thing and is probably more comfortable than most custom mechs for me.

You definitely need to review an ortholinear and especially split keyboards, like ErgoDox, 'cause it's really hype driven in programmers community at the moment and it's really interesting to compare the input speed and ergonomics with ""average"" keyboards. So, please, make a review of some wide used ortholinear and split keyboards in one of your next videos! And thanks a lot for such a deep review in this video, especially for input speed comparison, and accents on input speed depending on key travel, low/high profile and actuation force - surely these are really important for input speed! PS: For me it's really hard to find a suitable keyboard, 'cause I'm leftie and ambidextrous, and my brain working in different way, and thus split keyboards are not applicable for me. For everyday work I personally use an external ThinkPad keyboard, 'cause it's really silent (and this is important for me), has a low profile, with low key travel, need a low actuation force for input (nevertheless it's not very sensitive), provide a comfortable speedy input, overall it's a great keyboard, and it doesn't break my habits & skills in input when I switch to the Thinkpad laptop integrated keyboard.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@GDPTD," @Sm00thieK  Its not so much the amount of research or optical switches its the build quality and attention to detail. When you experience a custom mechanical keyboard it becomes very apparent how cheap, rattly and mass produced other keyboards are. To me at least custom mechanical keyboards aren't just 600 dollar keyboards with brass weights and flawless finishes. You can really take an average mechanical keyboard from off the shelf and customize it. I did. Once you remove switches and lube them, select a custom spring stiffness, lube the stabilizers, eliminate sources of excessive play, wobble and rattle with little mods and get some nice thick PBT keycaps in a profile that suits you it is like a night and day difference how rewarding it is and how good it feels and sounds.  You will cringe when you go to the keyboard section at the local electronics store and feel what is on display.  The ping, rattle and slop you never noticed before will drive you crazy. The inconsistent mush of membrane dome switches will be a very noticeable as well. All the big companies don't put that much effort into their boards from the beginning because it would be too time consuming and tedious for the price they sell them for.

@zm7160,"My expectation going into this video: Techlead is going to mock us all for clicking a video about what keyboard is good for programming.  I bought a Ducky Shine 3 ~6 years ago for $80,  it does make a big  difference to the typing experience. No brainier investment if you spend like 20 hours+ a week smashing your finger tips against it. A good CHAIR is the most important thing; when you spend 60 hours a week sitting on it and its a big affect on your overall health. Get a serious office chair; e.g. Herman Miller.  As far as key types go I've had a lot of recent experience with MX Silvers (1.2mm travel, 40g, Linear) and MX Browns(2mm, 45g, Tactile[no-click]). Silvers on a Leopold FC750R, Browns on a Ducky Shine 3 80%. With the Silvers, I can vouch for what he's saying about the sensitivity of low actuation force linear switches: They are great for gaming, but they can be pretty challenging to type on. To the point of accidentally actuating keys with other parts of the hand. From what I've seen most everybody likes Browns for typing, they hit the right balance, you can feel the key when it activates. Typing accuracy and feel are an excellent balance.  Leopold and Ducky from Korean and Taiwan respectively: make fantastic keyboards at a low cost that just work, less dumb features, better build quality. My ducky has seen 6 years of constant abuse. But I would say the LEOPOLD is a league above in quality and a better investment (minimal price delta).",5년 전(수정됨),2,

@alaya_shiki_1,"Great video! I bought the Master Keys to go with the MX Master 3 for my first job out of college and I love it. I reach my average typing speed with it of 77, but it's good for me since I'm in HR and I don't type too heavily. But I love it's weight, the build quality, and the solid feeling of the keys. In addition, I recently bought the Apex Pro for my personal computer and while I did reach faster typing speeds in the 90 range, I could feel the distance my fingers had to travel. But I simply reduced the actuation sensitivity to counter than and now I just glide thru typing. I found the wristrest to be a bit too low as my wrist hurt after typing for a while. I think it might be my posture, but no other keyboard has ""hurt"" my wrists before.

This isn't a fair comparison at all since each keyboard is using a different type of switch, not to mention you didn't talk about anything programming related, why not show different sizes? there are programmers who use 40 percent keyboards, 60 or even full size, like everything it's all personal, and regarding the typing speed, usually, when doing anything other than typing tests the thing limiting our typing speed is how fast we can think and how well we know what we want to type, so I don't believe that those insignificant differences in speed have any noticeable difference when actually programming or doing anything else other than typing races.

@JinFX,Don't press the keys all the way down. You want to stop pressing the key somewhere after the actuation point at 1.0-1.5 mm and before the bottom at 3-4 mm. So longer travel past the actuation point is only a good thing because it gives you more margin of error before you hit the bottom. Different actuation points usually just takes some getting used to but of course as long as you are willing to spend money you can get all kinds of actuation points. If my job depended on not making typos even a Leopold would be a bargain.,5년 전(수정됨),0,

@fixups6536," @TechLead  None of the brands I mentioned produce custom boards. They manufacture high quality keyboards with higher standards than the ones you are promoting, and have been doing so for many years.  What's the point with ""Pro gamers""? These guys essentially need their ""keyboard"" to be a giant backlit joystick. Their needs are distinct and often conflicting with the needs of programmers.  There are places on the internet where enthusiasts and professional keyboard users have been discussing high quality keyboards for years, most of the time mechanical ones but not always. You will find them mainly on geekhack.org and deskthority.net. Logitech barely exists over there.  I applaud your push for mechanical keyboards. You are right, I too would recommend any programmer to invest $100 to $200 in a mechanical keyboard. It will last years and will make your time on the computer more enjoyable.  A reduced size keyboard helps a lot with ergonomics. Most programmers will do great with a TKL: it's a standard keyboard, but with no numbers pad, it allows the mouse to stay closer to your hands (you have shown several in your video). If you go small, never EVER purchase a keyboard that does not have arrow keys. That means no ""60%"" and no HHKB.  For people who do not care too much about helping you make money with your affiliate links, I would recommend to head over to mechanicalkeyboards, wasdkeyboards or keyboardco, where they will find plenty of choice (and no Logitech).",5년 전,0,

@tomywu,"As a programmer on MacOS, I would say the ideal keyboard will have MacOS software and function keys support (quickly switch between F1-F12 and Mac function keys). It will also have wireless connectivity so I can switch between Windows & Mac quickly. Its size will be TKL or smaller, so it is portable and can be carried to work. However, I also feel it helps to have dedicated arrow keys, so I won't pick 60% keyboard (and if you pick a 40% keyboard, I would say you are either a god or insane). If TKL is still too big for you, consider 64 keys or 65% keyboard with dedicated arrow keys. Silent red switch with added o-rings will be ideal so you don't annoy your mates at work with loud typing sound. Avoid speed switch such as Cherry Silver as their actuation point and force is too low for typing and you will make more typo than you usually do.

@loomi28," @webentwicklungmitrobinspan6935  I also didn't say that Stack Overflow is bad. I just wrote that I haven't used it yet.   In the past, developers didn't have the option of looking things up on the Internet. There were manuals (reference, user, architecture manuals), textbooks, expensive courses and seminars, and conferences for further education and exchange of experience. You asked your colleagues or someone at a manufacturer. If one had acquired competence in certain areas, one was also gladly asked, or sometimes called by colleagues of foreign organizations.  There was always someone who could do something better than you. The world of IT is also evolving. I feel that I spend 20% of my time on training. The limited environment of department colleagues and a shelf wall of manuals has become a global village. The principle of asking or reading up has remained, only the means have improved.  If I'm looking for something to solve a new problem, I first throw on a search engine. If I have a configuration problem, then I look for instructions. If I don't get anywhere by reading alone, then I ask the question in a suitable communication medium, where I suspect the most competent people for it.   Not every user of Stack Overflow is a good programmer. And not every StackOverflow denier is therefore a bad programmer.",4년 전(수정됨),4,

@Belgarathe,Just remember just because you have the best keyboard doesn't make you a better programmer. Especially if you can’t consistently hit keys like underscore or close curly brackets. Start of with decent keyboard that has standard keyboard layout epically focusing on size and placement of ctrl and shift keys. After a while once you got your speed up and can code without looking at the keyboard you can begin to see what you like. Try out your friends keyboard and go from there. This video is great for people who already at up there for speed but not the best keyboard will be the best for you. Some of my co workers swear by mechanicals vs other prefer to prioritize ergonomic. Probably the best is to build your own but that only comes with time once you know what you want,5년 전,0,
@go_better,"Thanks for the review! Making a workplace ergonomic, healthy, and efficient is so underrated, in my opinion.

I love changing the 'breathing' speeds for different activities: if i'm just chilling i'd set it slow,  if i'm working and esp on tight deadlines, faster.  My favorite lighting mode,  though,  is the one were the keys only light up when you hit them (then they slowly fade out)  - - -  I find this really helps with my typing speed improvement,  not to mention it helps diagnose problematic switches",5년 전,0,

I tried hard to find the magic sauce behind the price tag, but in the end I gave up and bought a simple Tesoro fullsize keyboard with Kailh blue mx switches and blue backlight for $70. I was super happy with the purchase. I use it for my CAD workstation with all the terminal shortcuts, and all my interoffice communications. I modded it with thicker aftermarket keycaps, then the lighting from blue to white LED, and then the switches themselves. I had the urge to do little mods as stepping stones, and it opened my mind to all the mech-keyboard options. It has been a fun journey since 2015, just like building PCs or woodworking.",5년 전,0,

@xander_allen,"Matt Waters you would only get noisier keyboards if you choose noisier switches. Membrane keyboards are normally louder than boards that don’t use clicky switches. You should see how quiet some people get their boards to be. The main appeal of mech keyboards besides them being a much higher quality is that you can personalize them however you like. You can choose switches that will wake up half the neighborhood, or you could go the more silent route. If you want your keystrokes to take minimal effort then you can do that, or you can choose to need a firm push in order to activate each key. The possibilities are pretty endless especially when you consider that every single key can be personalized to be completely different in a mech board. The scary part is how lost you can get in researching and customizing mech boards lol. I’ve only been talking about the switches instead of the numerous other factors including keycaps, plate material, stabilizers, and of course the almighty rgb; each of these factors and the many that I didn’t list can drastically affect the overall experience of using your mech board. I would suggest taking some time to look at r/mechanicalkeyboards to learn more and find out what you would like in a mech board.",5년 전,40,
