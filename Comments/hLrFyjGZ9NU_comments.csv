@Hassan_Rajput_PAS,"Summary 	•	**🏠 Extreme Housing Costs: Hong Kong ranks as the world’s least affordable housing market, with homes costing nearly 20 times the average annual income. 	•	**🧍‍♂️ Tiny Living Spaces: Hundreds of thousands live in “cage homes” and subdivided units as small as 75 square feet—smaller than a typical parking space. 	•	**🏘️ Subdivided Living Strategy: Larger flats are converted into micro-units sharing communal facilities like kitchens and bathrooms to cut costs. 	•	**🌳 Land Mismanagement, Not Scarcity: Although 75% of Hong Kong’s land is undeveloped, only 3.7% is zoned for urban housing, highlighting a policy failure rather than a land shortage. 	•	**💼 Government’s Role in Real Estate Pricing: The government owns nearly all land and leases it at auction to the highest bidders—often Chinese developers—resulting in skyrocketing prices. 	•	**💰 Low Taxes, High Land Prices: With minimal tax income, the government relies on land lease revenue, accounting for 30% of public funding—thus resisting reforms that could lower housing prices. 	•	**⚰️ Coffin Homes & Capsule Innovations: Some live in extremely cramped “coffin homes”; others opt for modern capsules by entrepreneurs like Eric Wong—still temporary solutions to a systemic problem. 	•	**⚖️ Need for Zoning Reform: Experts agree that lasting solutions must come from government-led zoning and policy reform, prioritizing people over market profits.  Insights Based on Numbers 	•	20x Annual Income: Illustrates the profound unaffordability. 	•	75-140 sq ft units: Tangible proof of how cramped urban living has become. 	•	3.7% of land zoned for housing: A shockingly low figure in a densely populated city. 	•	30% government revenue from land sales: Reveals why the system persists—land auctions are a fiscal lifeline.",5개월 전,1,

I had to move out of a comfortable appartement because the upstairs neighbors were importantly noisy and I couldn't sleep or have any peace of mind. I thought it was temporary maybe for one year but then it was very hard to find another place and it too not far off ten years. The advantages were almost non existent since it was only 200 francs less expensive than the big apartment in the same building I left. There was more light. The disadvantages were; extremely hot in summer on the top floor, 16 degrees in the winter due to faulty heating, noise through cardboard thin walls from the next door neighbors, the shame of not wanting to let people know that I lived in such a tiny place. A kitchen and bathroom without windows. The kitchen was so small you could touch all four walls by simply stretching your arms out. The bathroom was small and grotty. There was only one room although of a decent size (4.5 x 5 meters). . Watching this programme I feel so sorry for the occupants of the tiny apartments. Every day I entered my ex small apartment I tried to feel grateful for having a clean and safe place to live and conceptualized it as a hotel suite. I think that every person and family should have the right to affordable decent housing because if you don't have that it seriously infringes on human dignity, psychological health and people's social lives perhaps even their physical health.",1년 전,0,

And that is the most unlikely thing of all.  If the government gets a good whack job from failure, maybe then it will be forced to adopt a more humane policy.",2년 전,0,

@alanc6416,"I'm not surprised when all of the media fail to recognise that around 50% of HK's population lives in public housing and subsidised housing, which has an area of around 300 sq. ft. on average, and monthly rental of public housing ranges from US$300 - US$500.  Fun fact, the intro of your video is one of the most famous public housing establishments names Choi Hung Estate, that rents for US$300-500, and you still managed to ignore it right in front of you.   This is one of those phenomenon where one poorly researched and misinformed reports went viral, and nobody does anything about it once they have reached the intended moral high ground.   Now I'm not going to deny ""private housing"" is expensive in HK, but the situation is extremely over exaggerated. Why would you include the income of the 50% population who lives in public housing into the calculation, when they don't even live in private housing properties?   The cage houses on the other hand is in fact a problem, but these residents have also made a choice of not living in public housing because these cage houses are usually located in district centres. A lot of them sacrifice space and comfort for conveniences. Now there are a number of people who are waiting in line for public housing, and the line is getting longer and should be addressed, but this is not unlike any social problems all over the world, such as poverty, homelessness, drug abuse etc. But please don't relate cage housing with expensive living costs.

More than half of the buildings you see on your classic pictures of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon are on reclaimed land, and more than 20% of the population live on reclaimed land.

He said he'll no. Notice, he got used to commute long hour in Los Angeles. 20 minute bus distance in LA nothing,  but 20 minutes to HK downtown is not ok. Yes, bus in LA runs every hour, but bus in suburbs HK runs every 10 minutes. People get used to convenience. HK is small, but people can find cheaper n better housing in New Territory. Yes, when I visited HK, I stayed in a hotel in New Territory, the one I recommended my friend to go. The room was bigger, and hotel cost was cheaper. Getting to restaurants,  shopping centers,  residential area without cars was easier than any places in LA. The problem is after that 20 minutes to downtown,  you still have to catch buses, subway, taxi. He just did not want to spend that time. Yes, he commutes a lot in LA, but he couldn't stand that commute time in Hak. I guess that is Hker mentality.

After that, I pretty much have to use uber. I was lucky to find one job that was 3 hour ride. After that, I couldn't find anything less than 4 hours if there are any.

Government is at the root of the problem because it has found a lucrative source of renewable revenue. 2: As soon as the CCP steps in and raises those taxes anyway you won't have to worry cause business will leave and the economy will crash.

@bookaufman9643,Those capsule apartments are even worse than the cage homes. They're actually smaller if not the same size but you don't have space in there to do anything but sleep or lay on your bed and watch tv. A person needs a place like a desk and all of that and not a shared space but a private area. You're better off in a 12x12 room than you are in a capsule which is only good for sleeping. I don't think this is anything like an answer to Hong Kong's housing shortage. The real answer is the obvious one which is they have to change their land policy. Hong Kong is not going to go broke if they put a 1% tax on business to create more housing. It's entrepreneurial savagery at this point.,3년 전,0,
@bookaufman9643,"I'm staying with family now but before the coronavirus I used to live in various rooming houses throughout Durham, North carolina. Though there was some differences in the different places that I stayed quite often the room with nothing more than 8x12. You had room for a bed, a television at the end of the bed, a very small closet and a dresser. Then whatever you needed to place on the dresser. I bought a small mountable TV and that gave me some space but for the most part I was in a prison cell. These rooms in the last place that I stayed were in the basement so there was no natural light in the rooms. Not only that but these places cost around $125 a week so a total of $500 every 28 days. This is a really common way to live in the hood and when I leave my family's house I'll probably have to go back to living that way because Durham has become a very trendy place to live and all of downtown has been taken over by modern and expensive living situations. The hood neighborhood that I used to stay in was actually whitewashed and now there are no old houses that you can subdivide so you have to go into whatever neighborhoods, which get worse each time you're forced to move down. Tons of crime. Tons of drugs and prostitution and only grocery stores instead of supermarkets to buy your food stuffs, without having to get on a bus for a long ride and then carry your groceries back.

@alphaomega17,"1. Peace = when we place our hope in Him for eternal life  2. When we believe He is in control we are not afraid of our personal safety. His sovereignty rules over all. (If people disobey, God warns them and if they rebel they suffer the consequences) 3. When we trust Him to meet our needs this eliminates our daily concerns about not having enough. ""My God shall supply all our needs according to His riches""  Stop supposing. When we are obedient to God in His omniscience He will take care of ALL of our troubles. Not my load to carry. This society promises nothing. We are talking about real peace that passes all understanding. God wants us to be at peace with Him, His gift to us. Peace with others. God cannot lie. He promises peace based on our faith and obedience to Him. Can't be disobedient and expect His best blessings.  4. When we maintain a clear conscience we have peace. Why do they drink? To feel better. If not clear then conscience gnawing away. He gives us His peace. World can't substitute this peace. People do drugs because someone gave them drugs to feel better, not Jesus. People start doing things to forget things then end up in another place. 5. Accept the way God made you. Stop trying to change things out of your control. Accept the gifts God gave you. Can't have all the gifts. Stop trying to change things over their control because they start drinking then, get in wrong relationships, if we ""change"" we will get xyz. No. We can't be like others but he wants us to be satisfied with Him with what he's doing in our life. Happy, peaceful, growing us up, teaching us to be obedient. He forgives us and points us the right way. What did God intend for me? Must agree whatever He chooses for us is the best idea. 6. Sense of purpose this protects us from emptiness. We are his workmanship, creafed in Christ for his purpose: live a godly life. He intends to bless us and prosper us. So we can handle it. Our security = nothing but our personal relationship with Him. Stuff is not peace. O nly relationship with Christ. Think about emptiness. Many are unhappy, empty. They fill up the emptiness. Only one thing fills the heart of anybody and that is Jesus presence. That brings the ""fullness of the spirit"" Do you feel empty about your days? Something missing? Or look to Him to fill your emptiness? The closer we get to Him in our relationship with Him, the more peace we're going to have. Using the gifts He gave us, being close to Him, serving Him. 7. Adequacy. Inadequacy creates doubt. God wants us to feel adequate. He will never call is to do something we are not prepared to do. Spiritual gifts equip is to accomplish His purpose. Our witness and testimony. That Christ will equip us, He will provide, that we live in peace.  Somewhere along the line you've avoided the peace-maker. The only way we will have peace is walking with Him.  8. A sense of belonging makes people have peace. Rejection is inevitable, it hurts. Sometimes we feel rejection even when we haven't been rejected. Overcome rejection by looking at the cross. God nailed His son to a tree in order for us to have love, God's love. He can satisfy every desire and need.  It begins with humbling yourself, ask Him to forgive you, tell Him: I want your peace.  You don't have peace in your heart if you're living in sin. If you're willing to surrender yourself, your heart won't be troubled.   Thank you Father, I pray the Holy Spirit will work in the lives of those who need peace. We love you Father, in Jesus name, Amen.",3년 전,0,

So it must be people getting there although they know about the living situation they will be able to afford, that is scary and hard to understand.  But while this is horrible: Its actually one of the things I admire about such cities, that not all the land has been used to build, they are closer to nature, less polluted and therefore give you back something on a different level. That probably cant make up for having only a few square meters to live, but I would also be very sad if all of a sudden the gouvernment would decide to sell a lot of land and destroy this nature.

The reason they exist is this fills a need: they are the housing of last resort before homeless. The gov is not doing enough because of the lack of land and because land sales is one of the biggest income source of the gov, so keeping home price sky high is the goal and home affordability is the consequence of it. If you want low tax you will have this, so IMO increasing tax is actually good if this means more land (they are artificially limited to prop up the price) and more home affordability.",4년 전,6,

@taacccoos1618," @yoshtg  99.9% of people in poverty don't have the same mental/physical ability or education opportunities to make that much. most of us aren't even given the choice. due to rising living costs and how expensive getting a higher education is, we're forced into welfare and food stamps if were the luckiest, because that makes more money and has more stability than the jobs they dont want us to have. for the cage home people no matter how much they make they will never afford a home because of the intentional home scarcity in their country, and all of above. i just have 1 thing i want you to do. talk with people, kids, teens, and adults, in different countries, who are currently in poverty about their life. especially families. of course you can ignore me and live in an imaginary world where you can tell people ""just stop being poor?? duh. just go earn a million."" and feel accomplished and justified to say so. unless if you're an elaborate troll, if so you did good at looking disconnected from reality",3년 전,24,

@noth9617,"Women in china are already behind the 8 ball. For her to be providing for her child at all is admirable. She’s not so proud she refused to get a diagnosis and help medically for her son, and she has a roof over her head. Who will have the boy while she goes and gets an education to get a better job? And how much does she have to be earning before she does manage to get a house? They say in the video if she’s on 50k she’s looking at spending 900k on a mortgage. I don’t know a single person who would secure a loan for that amount. My husband earns 83k and we only got approved for $380k. The mortgage on that would be not fun to pay, for this lady securing a home would be crippling. I feel bad for the child as we have a large 5 bed home with a yard and multiple living areas and my 4 sons are at each other’s throats as it is. For the boy not even to have a trampoline or piano or bike or anything else to get his energy out at home. That would be so sad for any child, much less one with additional needs. But it’s hardly the mothers fault. It took two people to create the boy. His father is probably living it up somewhere without a care in the world.

They already own the land and it would be a direct income rather than taking some income from businesses. The government could offer this housing at a cheaper price to increase the amount of money a citizen saves. This would allow the citizens to spend more of their money within the market.

It's obvious thousands or millions of people want the change, but it's a matter of saying enough is enough because the ""benefit"" is not worth it anymore.  People need to have a change of mind that government isn't and shouldn't be the ones in control all the time because normal people should believe in themselves to know they can do better than what the government is willing to do or can do.

@saltviolet," @KitsuneSama  You seem to be laboring under the delusion that your answer is the “woke” one here, when in reality it’s deeply ignorant and insensitive.  Not everyone can readily accept that kids just aren’t an option. And anyway, that’s not even the real issue here. Contraception and/or legal abortion are huge expenses for those in poverty. Some people will inevitably get pregnant while living in these conditions and end up having to choose between attempting a dangerous home abortion, giving up their child, or giving up their home. The lack of dignity in that situation would be difficult for anyone.",4년 전,100,
@KitsuneSama,"​ @saltviolet  ''The real issue'' excuse me but yes the real issue is having kids... no kids means less population, less population equal to all of the problems this place gone. Humans are thinking beings, if the conditions are not right then simply do not have kids... even other species just simply do not reproduce if they see food and space are not enough. But humans simply do not seem to grasp such a basic concept, almost as if they need to reproduce without a second thought like they can't even think or rationalize that concept even for one moment. You know what other species on earth has that pattern? Like Smith said not mammals but a virus, yes a virus is that one other species that reproduces even when the environment is dying and not enough to sustain. Why would anyone even have kids when they live in a cage?! Such a selfish way to think to bring another life into this world just to suffer, yes we all want to have a family and yes we all want to be rich or at least live well but the conditions are not always favorable and we can not always have everything we want in life. If the conditions are not right like seen in this video then you simply do not reproduce, you go and take some pills to avoid getting pregnant you use condoms you use a friggin IUD which all are waaaaaay less expensive than maintaining a child. So don't  say money is an issue because not having a child is the least expensive solution. But no way to make a Karen understand such a basic concept, these people would reproduce even if they lived in a toxic wasteland, they give two fks about bringing another life to suffer they just care about their pleasure their commodity and themselves and not even wanting to invest a little bit of money on a condom or pills because deep down to the core thats just how 99% of humans work, they are no different than any other mindless animal and that's saying too much because even stray animals think more and rationalize more.",4년 전,25,

@DrAlbuquerque,"It seems that the people here did not understand. The Hong Kong government does not put market interests before people's basic needs; they put their own interest before people's needs. Hong Kong is so dense precisely because of its free market policy and low taxes - it attracts people there - most people's jobs and income depend on this policy because companies depend on it. But politicians want money anywhere, so they keep these people in that situation because it is profitable for them. Raising taxes would be unemploying people to give politicians more money.",4년 전,3,
@coindorni,"When I hear someone saying this is fault of greedy land hoarders my first thought is that they know nothing about the land issue in Hong Kong. To begin with around 30% of the housing in Hong Kong is provided by the state as a public matter and another 15% is subsidized, so it's not even run for profit on almost half of the industry, so saying the issue is due to companies running for profit is a huge misunderstandment. Plus Hong Kong's main issue isn't ""The rich hoarding land to bump up prices"", which doesn't mean it's certain part of the issue, but the government is the main reason. Some causes of high housing prices caused by the state: -Small House Policy -People's Liberation Army usage -Brownfield sites Without counting that an important part of the revenue from the Hong Kong government comes from housing. Then the reasons that can't be directly controlled by neither government nor the businesses: -Land scarcity -High demand; at least partly because of immigration of Chinese people (Around 150 a day) Then, causes of high prices due to private organizations: -Rural land hoarding But this is false because it's no longer an issue. The government seized 7.3 million square feet of land of these kind So the only and single currently land issue created by private organizations is the construction of private recreational spaces which take up space that could be used for housing. So before saying ""But, all in Hong Kong is run for profit and that's the issue with land"" remember that the industry you're talking about is curiously the most intervened one, while prices for other goods and services produced by much more deregulated industries are accessible in comparison to wages.",4년 전,1,

@ericg4915, Hasi Mausi  the problem in Hong Kong is not capitalism. Capitalism would solve their problem overnight. If they allowed the private ownership of land then developers would come in immediately and start building apartments left and right especially with the high cost of rent in Hong Kong. What would happen is all the new apartments would saturate the market and drive down rent to more affordable prices and give people a place to live. What hong kong is doing is the exact opposite of capitalism. The government seizing and owning private property is not a capitalist policy.,4년 전,0,
@ericg4915," Hasi Mausi  watch the video again. They are not selling the land, they are temporarily leasing it out. The government owns 100% of the land in Hong Kong. If u think this is a capitalist policy then u must not know much about capitalism. In free societies land is not owned by the government. That is literally like the cornerstone of socialism.

@zupermaus9276,"HK is that great economically libertarian experiment UK (and now China) never dared back home but that reaps in the wealth growth. Tax only small amounts to the upper 20% -and the result is the worlds freest economy, and also the worlds largest wealth gap of any OECD territory, and second only to NYC as the world's most divided city. Despite that 10%  of the population are now millionaires, high life expectancy, great infrastructure, healthcare and schooling a whopping 78% remain working class and 100,000 effectively homeless living on the streets, cage/ coffin homes and rooftops. Even across the border in urban China it's 75% middle class (and by comparison 50% middle class in US). The HK poverty line is set at only $5,000 a year (in the world's most expensive city), yet 1/5 fall into it. In any other city, unconstrained by being a small colonial island without British/ Chinese passports and confucianist society, life would have devolved long ago into crime, favelas and the rich fleeing. 1/3 of seniors struggle for their most basic nutrition and 1/5 of schoolkids miss a meal.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@blackearl7891," @Leadlight280  lowering government intervention in Hong Kong would cause the government to fall due to extremely low taxes, and China would use it as an excuse to take over Hong Kong since they would view it as a failed state. The laffer curve? Government taxation is already extremely low. That's the issue. Also what is your optimal tax for Hong Kong for the government to be able to sell land at a lower price, while maintaining a low tax. By laffer curve standards Hong Kong is way below the optional tax rate if they are forced to sell over valued land rather than at a competitive amount.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@Leadlight280," @blackearl7891  Actually i didn't mean Laffer curve it self, but the idea that lowering taxes gives more incentives to do business and, therefore, more noney, and you can tax that. But in this case im saying that they should stop making auctions and make it easier to make housing and, therefore, increase supply and lowering price, and taxing that. Actually almost all of HK economy are services, so you can use a lot of land for housing.",5년 전,0,
@blackearl7891, @Leadlight280  that would last for a while. Remember that Hong Kong is an tiny island so land resources are extremely scarce. It would also force them heavily into constant defecit to recuperate for the lost budget that they normally make from land sales to offset the low taxes. Even with an increased tax base that runs additional cost for the government as well. Normally it wouldn't be an issue but with a government already desperately using land sales to make up for the budget they would be obligated to raise taxes losing their status as a tax haven.,5년 전,0,

If the government increases taxes, it will be less attractive to businesses, which will lead to fewer jobs and less money overall. While it will make real estate less competitive, it will make the people poorer. In addition, considering Vox supports solving climate change and all, expanding the urban area further would lead to deforestation and increased carbon emissions, as more people drive cars, more industries open up, and each family unit takes up larger square footage. Hence, the solution you presented will come with major consequences for Hong Kong. A better solution would be the one you dismissed, building better architecture - taller buildings that utilize the available land efficiently. This solution does not require major policy changes, and it will actually attract more real estate developers to Hong Kong. This solution is entirely feasible considering the city's incredibly competitive economy. It's a win-win.",5년 전,1,

Plus Hong Kong's main issue isn't ""The rich hoarding land to bump up prices"", which doesn't mean it's certain part of the issue, but the government is the main reason. Some causes of high housing prices caused by the state: -Small House Policy -People's Liberation Army usage -Brownfield sites Without counting that an important part of the revenue from the Hong Kong government comes from housing. Then the reasons that can't be directly controlled by neither government nor the businesses: -Land scarcity -High demand; at least partly because of immigration of Chinese people (Around 150 a day) Then, causes of high prices due to private organizations: -Rural land hoarding But this is false because it's no longer an issue. The government seized 7.3 million square feet of land of these kind So the only and single currently land issue created by private organizations is the construction of private recreational spaces which take up space that could be used for housing. So before saying ""But, all in Hong Kong is run for profit and that's the issue with land"" remember that the industry you're talking about is curiously the most intervened one, while prices for other goods and services produced by much more deregulated industries are accessible in comparison to wages.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

Unless I'm missing something, it seems that that your final statement in the film regarding the necessity of the government putting the interest of its people above the interest of the market is not a proper conclusion based on the film's claims. I understand that Hong Kong's market claims to be the freest in the world. However, whatever index is used to calculate that is clearly overlooking the huge restrictive market effect of the government owning virtually 100% of real estate. That is definitely not a truly free market. I'm sure that there are thousands of investors ready to develop much more hygienic and humanistic housing projects if the government would simply be willing to lease more land or sell land. The issue is not that the government leases land (although that is odd), it's that it leases so little of it. Were the government to free up the land for more use, enterprising individuals would quickly develop more housing for the incredible demand. (The people desperately need it!)  In my opinion, this is an example of the effect of unhelpful government land restrictions, not a government that over-emphasizes the interests of the market. They are clearly overlooking the interest of the market (AND their poor citizens) by not letting the other land be developed. Obviously, not all the land should be developed, green spaces must be maintained, and smart environmental regulations must also be enforced. Freeing more land for development would benefit the market (more business), the people (more space! Have mercy!), and the government (more money, whether through income/sales tax or land leasing).  Overall, seems like a very silly and destructive use of land by Hong Kong.",5년 전,0,

The conditions are very sad indeed, but I'm strongly moved to say that I missed your explanation of WHY, paraphrasing you, ""government has no incentive to free up more land"". Presumably, doing so would lead to both more revenue and better living conditions, yet you claim there's no incentive.  (1) You said govt owns ALL the land. (2) You said govt land leases fetch VERY high prices. (3) You said housing prices are correspondingly VERY high. (4) You said govt owns LOTS of VACANT land. (5) You said govt land leases provide ONLY 30% of annual govt funds.  That list adds up to a substantial incentive to free up more land. How does it supports your claim that it does not?",5년 전,0,

@weixifu8306,"I think this is precisely the reason why people in Hong Kong are protesting. Democracy is just an excuse, but the underlying reason is that people are miserable, they need to vent out their anger. The story behind unaffordable housing in Hong Kong starts a century ago when the British colonized Hong Kong and owned practically all the land. After the British left, the Hong Kong government inherited this seemingly unsustainable practice of land selling instead of increased taxation. The rise in land prices is good for both the government which they can get more funding and real estate moguls which they can maximize their profits. This would also be potentially good for the population in which they see their real estate property values go up. It seems to be a win-win-win scenario for everyone. This would all be under the premise that the population can all get well-paying jobs and afford the places. Ever since the recent two decades of globalization, there is a huge gap between the rich and the poor. The majority of the population are not getting well-paying jobs. Even though Hong Kong is one of the financial centers of the world, but not everyone will be in lucrative industries such as finance or technology. As a result, common people are not able to afford housing while the rich are getting mega-rich. It really is a pretty sad reality and it seems like this is becoming more and more of a norm across the world.",5년 전,0,

These are all for free, and easily accessible if you put your mind to it.

They were self sustainable, everyone knew each other, but then the took that away. They then put in a big ferry to get to the mainland & outlawed the use of their boats. She immigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba with her husband after that. They moved back to Hong Kong & to Canada throughout my step-dads life but ultimately stayed in Canada.

You won't be solving any housing problems without more land to allocate citizens (unless you force people to stop having children and ban immigrants, then yeah, in a few decades you would see some improvement).   The thing is that the ""free"" market approach made HK overly attractive and they never had a large territory to begin with, so a housing problem was inevitable. But if HK had more area, people could live a bit further from the city and have more comfort while paying less money.  ""Oh but then people would live too far from their workplaces"" mhm yeah. My point is that you will never easily please everybody. Transportation issues are generally lessened by new technologies or local governments stimulating companies, but it's just too complex.

I have visited some of the residents of subdivided flats and most of them either feel fortunate to live in Hong Kong or are too depressed given the fact that they'd probably never be able to leave HK and live in a better condition so oh and plus the government is super corrupt and do absolutely nothing (that is practically effective) to help the grassroots.

As an introvert, having to always share 99% of my living space with not just my own family but several others, I'd probably mentally snap. When I was a teen, my family had to stay in a hotel room for three months. Two months in, I had actually packed my stuff and was prepared to run away because I couldn't take living in that crowded space much longer (my mom's tears brought me back...I'm usually very obedient so it was a shock for even me to hit such a breaking point). The house we finally moved into had no doors fitted on the hinges, no running water and no electricity without us running a generator (only in the mornings) but it was absolute heaven compared to that hotel room.",5년 전,0,

Nobody deserves a free ride, but in the lottery of life some people just have bad luck, and are born with or destined to suffer health complications that impede their ability to work, or through no fault of their own have the misfortune to experience any number of other complications in life. For example, in the 1950s and 60s when thousands of Chinese refugees started fleeing across the border every month in to what was then British Hong Kong to escape the chaos of The Great Leap Forward,  the colonial government instigated a massive campaign of building public housing, to ensure even the poorest members of society had somewhere to live.",5년 전,1,

@hotforge4569,1997年，香港首任特首董建华宣誓就职，在当时的香港，高房价引发的民愤铺天盖地，报纸媒体都在声讨香港的高房价摧毁了香港人的梦想，压制了香港的经济。没房的人在骂政府，想有房子住；有小房子的人也在骂政府，想买大房子；有大房子的人也在骂政府，想买更多的房子。所有人都在说自己置业难，买不起房，恩，和今天的中国人差不多。于是，作为首任特首，董先生想一举解决这个港人置业难问题，他提出了八万五公屋计划，想要让全港人都安居乐业，在这个雄心勃勃的计划中，董特首提出：1、每年兴建的公营和私营房屋单位不少于八万五千个2、十年内全港七成的家庭可以自置居所3、轮候租住公屋的平均时间缩 短至三年  十年内，让全香港人都买得起房，都有自己的住宅，香港人安居乐业，再也不用发愁住房问题，这是不是个好政策，好政策啊，全港人都拍手叫好，称之为大善政。那么董特首是不是打嘴炮光说不干呢？不是的，董特首说到做到，上任当年就大兴土木建设公屋，每年八万五的建设计划一点折扣都不打，第一年开建的房屋甚至高达十万套，新官上任三把火，董特首这是憋着劲要做一个大政绩。 从2000年开始，董特首的廉价公屋建成开始入市，这一下可不得了，巨量的供应瞬间摧毁了市场，1999年刚大幅反弹20%的香港楼价应声跳水，在巨大供求预期之下，香港房价一路走跌，在2004年跌至谷底，六年间跌了七成。 从1997年底开始，香港的刚需们抗了大概五六年，到了2003年初左右，扛不住了，陆陆续续的开始有人因为房屋被银行没收拍卖而自杀，在当时的香港，负资产者有10万户之多，95-97年买入房产的人悉数被套，不仅自己拿来当首付的一辈子的积蓄没了，还倒欠银行几百万元，一个月2万的月供让很多家庭不堪重负，勉强抗了几年之后几乎耗尽了所有的力量，当因为种种意外被公司辞退的时候，房屋被没收拍卖，然后银行通知你还欠几百万，以后一辈子都在还债的阴影中，自己还没有工作，自杀就成为不少人唯一的选择。 这个时候香港人才突然发现，他们要的不是便宜的房子，而是只允许自己购买的便宜房子，他们实质上要的是投机暴富，要的是洗劫别人的财富来达到自己富别人穷的目的。持有大量的房子的人不希望房价下跌，持有一个房子的人也不希望房价下跌，甚至只持有四五十平米蜗居的贫民，也不希望房价下跌，因为房价下跌切切实实的损害了他们的利益。只有那些彻底的无房者，才会支持房价下跌，但是工作一辈子连一个超小户型的房子都没有的人，又有几个呢，这样的人又有多少话语权和组织能力呢。 于是，2003年7月1日香港街头爆发50万人大游行，抗议香港房价下跌，要求港府救市，董建华滚蛋，八万五公屋计划是造成香港房价下跌的主要原因等等言论充斥媒体。没有人会承认自己当年是因为贪婪或者愚昧高位买入房产的，他们把一切原因都推给政府。挽救负资产者，拯救香港中产阶级，让房价上涨居然成了最大的政治正确。 于是，八万五公屋计划被实质暂停，大幅减少供地数量，董建华想让全香港人都安居乐业做一个大政绩，结果成了最大的行政败笔。 2005年，董建华黯然离任，香港在继任特首的带领下，房价就开启了一路飞涨的模式，到今天已经翻了五倍。香港人再度成为房奴，高房价让港人不堪重负，压制香港经济活力的论调再次出现在媒体之上，要求政府想办法让香港人能安居乐业，和1997年的舆论差不多，历史总是在不断的轮回。 但是这一次，有董建华悲惨的先例在，还有哪个香港特首敢让每个香港人都住得上房。,5년 전,0,

@fuckoffhackers8619, @DrunKao  whats a pedantist?,5년 전,1,
@DrunKao," @fuckoffhackers8619   austin sellers  a person being pedantic.  Being pedantic is when you go out of your way to take someone literally by their word at the expense of the point they are trying to make and correcting or pointing out peoples typos or grammatical errors   Instead of commenting on what they were trying to say, you comment on what they did say, to make yourself seem smarter.  For an example: ""pugs are a very unhealthy dog breed and by purchasing one your contributing to the problem.""  Instead of making a retort and productively engaging in the discussion, they'll simply point out the grammatical error in your statement. I.e; by commenting ""*you're"" because in the previous statement you had the misfortune of typing:  [pugs are a very unhealthy dog breed and by purchasing one {YOUR} contributing to the problem.]  Instead of [pugs are a very unhealthy dog breed and by purchasing one {YOU'RE} contributing to the problem.]  Being pedantic unironically only serves to derail discussions and insult the other person's intelligence.  It's usually a form of anti-social behavior and a sign of below average intelligence.   Because if you use your common sense and critical thinking it would be obvious that the original poster said ""government live in these conditions"", the original poster obviously meant ""people in government living in these conditions"" or politicians rather than normal people working in government.  You'd be better off commenting on what's obvious that the person is trying to say rather than correcting them.",5년 전,9,

@JustinHenryfan,"You know they justify these smaller and smaller homes by saying that ""people want to live simpler"" and smaller I guess. And that is true. If you look at it from the perspective of economic theory. The law of supply and demand. There is a huge demand even for small apartments. So therefor, in economic terms ""it must be what people want."" I think this is a brilliant showcase demonstrating the flaws of economic thinking in the first place. A lot of our modern world has been designed by economists with flawed theories. Perhaps we should've listened to psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists and other experts as well. They could've been able to explain the other side. Just because there is a demand for something, doesn't mean that that should be the only driving mechanism in a society. Perhaps the government should've regulated the minimum size for living conditions thus forcing companies to build taller or more houses so that everyone can fit, rather than smaller.",5년 전,0,

The hall where you walk in before going upstairs to apartment had enough space for cot, crib right beside, and mini fridge end of bed for $50. I did that for months.

The problem there is that their government is WAY to big. The have regulation after regulation, and less and less freedom. You think the answer is more government??? You aren't that smart. Countries need less government, and more following of the laws the already have. While allowing entrepreneurs to let the countries grow and compete. Socialism doesn't work at all. If Hong Kong actually, went with capitalism they would see more and more job growth and job creation. More wealth going into the community, and less poverty. The more rich people are able to develop their businesses, the more jobs that can be added. Also, with less of the government regulation of where people are allowed to build things, the more people can spread out to where areas are densely populated.

Business mind set is that if you control the supply, you can control the demand and charge as much as you want before the tipping point. Tell me why if I can product 10 homes and get 1mil for each, why would I build 100 for 100,000 each. That would me the profit is less with a lot more work hence SF will never produce a surplus of housing. Ideally we would so that we can solve other issues but unfortunately the greedy and selfish who run the world don't solve problems which are humane.

@chiguaguale1976,"Lacking of living space is the the most serious problem in HongKong right now, and it’s the hardest problem to be solved by the government. On the surface, government owns the other 75% of land in HongKong, the problem seems mainly comes from the government that wasn’t willing to develop the land, however, the government wanted to solve the problem since right after HongKong’s returning to China in 1997. HongKong has been served by four chief executives since returning to China. The first executive, , Mr Tung Chee-hwa, has proposed a policy address regarding the living space problem, called the 85,000 Housing Project, which means government will help to increase not less than 85,000 residential units a year. He hope that 70% of the households in Hong Kong can buy their own homes in 10 years. The average waiting time for public rental housing will be reduced from 6.5 years to 3 years. From 1997- 1999, the government sold a lot of land for the construction of residential. After the year 2000, the first batch of units built during the ""85,000"" project were launched, and 85,710 residential units were completed. In 2001, the total number of residential units were increased to 100,000. The ironic part is, Hong Kong's economy is heavily controlled by real estate developers. Before Hong Kong was handed over to China by the British, The Sino-British Joint Declaration limits the amount of land sold in Hong Kong each year, so that the colonial government will not sell the most important land resources of Hong Kong before the transfer of sovereignty, and then take the fiscal reserves away. In this context, Hong Kong's demand for real estate has continued to rise due to continued economic growth. However, Hong Kong's land supply has not increased. This historical issue resulted a bubble economy in the 1990s. Many people get rich by speculating on stocks and real estate. The financial industry and the real estate industry have become important pillars of Hong Kong's economy. According to statistics, the overall property price in Hong Kong increased by 68% within 3 years and 10 months in the peak period from January 1994 to October 1997. However, due to Mr. Tung’s 85,000 Housing Project in 1997, huge amount of housing supply destroyed the real estate market. Coupled with the Asian financial turmoil, it caused Hong Kong property prices to plummet. The majority of private properties have depreciated by 70% in about five years. Many middle classes have become negative assets and Hong Kong's economy is in a slump. The ""85,000"" policy became one of the most criticized policies of Tung Chee-hwa. At that time, many people thought that the ""85,000 Housing Project"" was the culprit in the decline in property prices. People hope that the Government will amend this policy to curb the fall in property prices. As a result, on July 1, 2003, about 500,000 people in Hong Kong held the largest anti-government demonstrations on the basis of against 23 legislation. Although Beijing has repeatedly indicated that it supports the Hong Kong government headed by Tung Chee-hwa, but one year later, on July 1, 530,000. People (FNL data) held anti-government demonstrations again. Since then, under the pressure of Hong Kong people, medias and the business community, in 2005, Tung Chee-hwa announced his resignation on the grounds of physical discomfort. After all these things happened, successive Hong Kong government has become very cautious to increase supply and lower housing prices. Since the early 2000s, the Hong Kong SAR Government has implemented a number of measures to reduce the supply of housing, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of newly built public and private housing. By February 2011, Hong Kong’s overall residential property prices have surpassed the previous highs of October 1997. Some newspapers pointed out that the rent of property prices has risen sharply, the public grievances have increased, and people's livelihood has been greatly affected. In 2011, the middle class found that they could not buy a house because the price was too expensive. In 2012, people began to think that Tung Chee-hwa’s ""85,000 project"" was correct. If there were no 85,000 in the same year, young people in Hong Kong can only live in cage homes and subdivided units. How to deal with this ambivalent problem? It’s a very difficult challenge for the Hong Kong government.",6년 전,1,

@LMSPetRescue,"Mimosa Kokko Hong Kong isn’t part of China. China and Japan may be over crowded in some places but they have very rural areas with not many people as well. China has a problem with famine in the past as well as lack of access to birth control, but wages and ability to travel are the biggest problems currently so many people are moving into tightly packed cities because they can’t travel to work if they live outside of it. Japan has the highest rate of terminal villages in the world, meaning the vast majority of people living there (I believe it’s if 70% of the people there) are over 60 years old, aka they’re getting old and passing away naturally so those villages are disappearing but the land availability is still there, it’s just not in the cities. That’s the issues with most places like this, it’s far to expensive to live in a city but people either want to live near their work or don’t have a way to get to their work if they’re not within walking distance.

@finze1,"Hong Kong is a former British colony and independent province existing in China. The protest (or civil war) that is being waged currently across the city is reflective of the exact debate you are all having above; Beijing ultimately wants to see Hong Kong fall in line as a full-fledged administrative region of China.    Some of you are saying 'China is a messed up place' and including Hong Kong in that statement, but if you had visited there just a year ago, you would have found a clean, safe, cosmopolitan society with excellent living standards and as much freedom of autonomy afforded to its citizens as those in the US. It was a hub of business, food, consultancy, trade and liberty.   Those who live in mainland China do not understand the ongoing protests. They have never lived with the same freedom of oppression that those in Hong Kong enjoy. Therefore, there is overwhelming pressure from citizens of the mainland to see their Hong Kong brothers join the fold, to maintain the peace. Whereas those in Hong Kong have witnessed the (sometimes brutal) regime of mainland China and want to protect their freedom.   Unfortunately, this is all pointing towards an explosive finish. The protesters in Hong Kong will never give in. They were protected throughout the cultural revolution and they didn't see their ideological leaders executed. Their backbones are still very much in tact.  But, when it comes to this Chinese government, if you won't bow, they you must break. We may be headed towards a repeat of the Tiananmen Square massacre.",6년 전,15,

I saw people struggle it out in local trains packed with people, trying to make ends meet, to get a home for themselves and a decent living... Over the past decade and a half, owning homes in the suburbs has become an increasingly herculean task.. The city is far out of limits of the middle class and is only something that the super rich can afford... Growing up, I always heard of the economic success of China and its regions being at par with the west and how they worked the miracle over the decades with persistent hard work.. However, this documentary speaks of the other side... Seemingly, the middle class slogged to make the rich richer and as the country's economy grew, so did the disparity and rich-poor gap... I have always admired the west for their consistent and equality for all that they have always advocated and realized... Here, you cannot find such poor quality housing areas, ghettos or pockets in any cities across the country.. While there is a grave problem of homelessness in major cities, it mostly can be attributed to drug abuse...

@SurprisinglyDeep," @jerrykwon8837   By ""house"" did you mean ""home""? With respect, while those 2 words are frequently used interchangeably they have very different meanings. A house only refers to a building that is usually at most only 1 or 2 floors high that is not a tower or skyscraper. Most houses are built to have enough space to hold one family comfortably inside them. Like a mansion would be a house but even a luxury condo would not be a house.  A home can be anywhere that a person lives (house, condo, apartment, factory dormitory, boat, cave, etcetera.)  Housing is a word thats used mostly by governments to describe how many places there are for people to live within a given region (like the government of the city of Vancouver might discuss how the city needs more affordable housing in order for the city's citizens to have afforable places to live.)",6년 전,15,

In 1995 when the Brits still controls hk, hk's housing bubble peaks, and every hker was hoping that mainlanders would move in in 1997 and buy their overpriced second-hand houses, and financial crisis came in 1997, the bubble broke, the mainlanders didn't come, the first ever chief executive of hk Tung cheehwa published his 85000 housing unit per year plan, the real estate price dropped. The furious HKers who spent all their money on houses protested due to negative equity. Then Suen mingyeung's 10 tricks came and brought the housing price back and HKers went to protest again. Hk's HOS program which builds flats for lower income residents was not resumed until late 2011 under the pressure of PRC government.  The current land management system under which the government owns the land was introduced in 19th century under British rule.  Hk's population growth rate has been well below 1% after 1997 hand over, while under British colonial government the growth rate is hardly under 2%.

Hong Kong is a facing a problem that is the lack of land. Even though there are land, property developer will buy the land and build luxurious houses. Hong Kong government build public houses but the construction work always delay and the demand is too high. No matter how hard you work, it basically impossible for people to buy houses for their future.

@havespacesuitwilltravel9607,"   Wow. There is a lot to unpack there. First, nobody cares about what you ""feel"". Tell us what you think. That's more powerful. Second, it is impossible for white people to uproot current tenants. Most of the white people are moving to the neighborhood for the same reason the current residents did. They can't afford to live elsewhere, because they work for a living too and have been priced out of their old neighborhoods by ""white"" people. Third, is the neighborhood really established by the current tenants? If the current residents own the houses they live in, then who can raise the rent, therefor pricing them out?  The property owner raises the rent, not the white people ""coming in"". Fourth, when white people move OUT of the city it's criticized as ""White Flight"". When white people move IN, it's criticized as ""Gentrification"". So what would you like them to do? Fifth, this really comes down to ownership. White people that don't own are going through a unique problem. They are constantly being priced out of their homes by wealthier people of all skin colors and forced to move to the next cheapest neighborhood where they are not welcome. Sixth, we don't go to Mexico and take advantage of the public benefits system that we didn't contribute to. That's a valid point on the part of 1024MegByte and the frustration is understandable. The problem there is that many immigrants, and their legal offspring, eventually do end up contributing lots of tax money to the benefits system in their lifetime and SHOULD be allowed to come here and work and live. It's very disappointing to hear such open racism and xenophobia coming from you, Karen Aguilar. Why not embrace outsiders and find an opportunity to grow and connect with humans?

@HaggisMonster,"20151004 uk he’s trying to express how hk people are being oppressed into this situation. Especially housing and other rights. I live in both Hk and Uk and travel between these two quite often.   Mainland China made HK’s government into a puppet state, which then allowed countless mainlanders to come into Hk and purchase Houses. With such demand the housing prices naturally increased to sky rocket high prices in the last 10years.   People who are poor don’t really have choices or control as the government in Hk ignores the wishes of its citizens, which is to limit mainlanders from coming into our city.  I am quite lucky myself as I come from a decent family so I had to chance to study in the UK and don’t have to worry about living issues in Hk.   This problem is actually happening in London too where wealthy Chinese and Russians are the main reason why London housing prices have increased this much.",6년 전,20,
@chiangsean9554," @HaggisMonster  well, seems like you pursued higher education in the UK, have the UK universities taught you to make an argument from statistics instead of rumors or prejudice? you can easily google the housing price of London. Yes, the price has been growing since 1996, however the growing curve has remained roughly the same from 2008 to 2019 when compared to 1996 to 2007 which means The London housing price have been increasing in a rather predictable way for the past 20 years.  Therefore, Your argument of "" The rich Chinese/Russians are the reasons of expensive housings in London right now"" is completely false. In fact, those major cities around the world, NYC, SF, London, Paris, Hongkong, Shanghai etc all share similar Increasing curve in terms of housing, and that's purely the side effects of Metropolitans.

@beast0blood,"Actually, there IS government housing in Hong Kong, and a considerable amount of it as well, so much so that areas such as Cheung Sha Wan are filled with these high rise government housing blocks.  The problem is the population that needs it vastly outweigh the market supply, and with the cost of land being extremely expensive in all but a handful of areas in the country (new territories is the only place where land is somewhat cheaper) the available land is often purchased by Private property developers as they can sell these apartments at insanely high prices to the affulent/high saving/expat market which makes up a large bulk of hk's professional workforce.  Another thing to note, salaries for menial/physical jobs are quite low in HK, making getting on the private ladder quite hard unless you're saving everything and have a partner doing the same. However, if you're willing to put up with travelling then you can get cheaper private accommodation outside of HK island and the main areas of Kowloon. Places such as Sha Tau Kok are fairly cheap at around £7-800 PCM for a three bedroom house.  However, if for some reason you don't have a great family structure in place, and find it hard to hold down a job (alot of cage home occupants have/have-had drug issues and other things that prevent them from maintaining a steady income) then even this aformentioned affordable rent isnt doable - and depending on your circumstances, your chances of getting a government apartment could be slim... Hence where these cage homes come in and exploit the gap in market",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Hong Kong is a product of free enterprise and little to no government programs. The only area government is still involved in Hong Kong is HOUSING and it's the only aspect of Hong Kong that is pretty bad.   And Vox turns it around and pushes the narrative that it's a market failure and they need government intervention. If HK's government unrestricts building regulation and sells land to private owners the housing problem would disappear and the free market would take care of it.

@normamimosa5991, @tommytam6433  Wow!  Thanks for the information.  That sounds as if it is not going to end well!,6년 전,2,
@normamimosa5991," @Amidat  - Cage spaces started in the 50s/60s as a result of a huge number of migrations from the mainland during the Chinese Civil War and a surge in birth rates in a successful economy.  The population increased from 2,015,300 in 1951 to 3,129,648 in 1961. In response the HK Gov. started building housing estates; however, the response could not keep up with the surge.  Cage homes became popular among migrant workers, as the rental fee was low.  They had a choice.  They didn't have to be there.   These cages still exist as the HK Gov. has instituted a single-person scoring system for public housing and lowered public housing quotas. New immigrants are required to wait seven years to become Hong Kong permanent residents. Poor migrants are often forced to live in the cages until they receive a Hong Kong ID card.  (Information from Wikipedia)   In addition to migrants are tourists.  4.5 million in 2001 to 47.3 million in 2014, mainly from Mainland China, outnumbering tourists from all other countries combined.  In 2017, tourists rose to 58.47 million, 44.45 million from Mainland China, accounting for 76% of the total.  (Information from Forbes)   So, what are the lessons here:  (1) We live in the days of the internet.  So easy to research information before you rattle off with half-true innuendos designed to demean a group.  It appears there are strong arguments that Hong Kong would be better off, if it were still under British jurisdiction, albeit the Chinese Government still grants it financial/commercial freedoms as a designated Special Administrative Region.  (2) An important lesson for those in the West, especially liberal politicians, because their culpability is great, about what will happen with open borders, and even uncurbed legal immigration.  Such an ugly scenario already showing its ugly head in North American western cities (sanctuary cities, such as Chicago, and cities such as San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, B. C.), except that in the West they litter the streets with their tents feces and drug needles.  No covered cage rooms for them.  I have always been flabbergast at the foolish British agreement to hand Hong Kong back to China. Hong Kong used to be the best place in the world for business.  Now it is the third best place.   So, you see there are multiple contributors to the introduction of cage ""apartments,""  but the singular most significant cause is the infiltration of migrants from China and a city struggling under massive overpopulation.  Next time, do your homework and become a commentator with credibility.",6년 전,3,

@normamimosa5991,"Firstly, only fools, the greedy, and uninformed thought real estate (in whatever form)  was a safe bet with almost zero risk of losing money.  Astounding, because the real-estate downturn prior to the 2008 collapse occurred not that long ago in the 1980's - in recent living memory.  Always important to drill down to ultimate causes.  Causes of the housing issues today:  (1) Massive irresponsible population growth (that is exponential/geometric, not arithmetic).  People today, still argue that people should have the right to as many children as they want, especially if they are rich and can afford the children.  They give no thought to world-wide competition for the same limited resources on a finite planet.  (2) Dysfunctional, inept governments in collusion with greedy developers, because each floor of, say, a 90-floor condominium building, produces a massive flow of taxes to waste.  (3) Migrations to the West and the need for more and more housing to accommodate immigrants and migrants.  How many of those living in cage homes in Hong Kong migrated from Mainland China?  (4) The domino effect of increasing house prices and rents.  If that neighbor just sold his house for $1million, then I better get into the market quickly and ask for $1.5 million for my similar house.  If that landlord can charge $2,000 for a small bachelor apartment, then I had better increase the rents for my rental suites, etc.  (5)  The move from individually owned, real-estate development companies, to huge public owned companies, but more troubling off-market private-equity and limited partnerships.   Having said that, we are already at population saturation point.  For sustainable living, focus must be on birth control, greatly curbed legal immigration and an end to illegal immigration.  If, say, Canada, where migration from China is huge, continues it's open doors, then Canadian cities will be the massively overpopulated new Hong Kongs. New capitalistic forms of commerce and corporations have to be developed to allow for higher wages, corporate ownership and job security.  Education will have to be dragged into that mix.

@eveveveve,"I live in Hong Kong and the limited land is definitely a problem, but most of the land is not actually owned by the Hong Kong government but actually land owners that make private homes, which is hard to free up space for public housing and places for people to live. Since land owners want to have profit from building residential buildings, they build them with luxurious materials which will lead to higher cost, therefore aiming for high income residents. Since all that land is used to build luxurious houses, people with low incomes cannot afford to buy any of the house, leading home owners to divide houses into very small subdivided flats. And with almost all land bought, the government can’t do anything.  Even if I don’t support having people living in these kinds of conditions, it is just the hard reality with the housing problem in Hong Kong. Even if I’m mad 😡that the government is not doing anything. I am mad 😡that the market is so high and that the income is very low for many people, many people have a dream that they want to settle in and buying a home, but a lot of people cannot complete that dream as their income might not be enough.

@Whoamitoyou306," @Amidat  NONSENSE? Did my comment mention that it didn't exist before 1997? i suggest you to watch the news and see how the Hong Kong government treats the ""NEW"" Hong Kong people versus native Hong Kong people. I am not saying the entire population of Hong Kong was not from China. Please understand that the reason behind the ""150 people/ day"" is a POLICY.   Also, please do the math. 150 people/ day since 1997. That's how many people from Mainland China have migrated to Hong Kong until now. When you said ""There is plenty of space in the new territories and Lantau"", I am pretty sure you don't know what is really going on right here. Please do some research on how Hong Kong government tries to solve this ""Issue"", and how the government tries to ""relocate"" the native Hong Kong people.   Lastly, please also understand how the policies (Education, Healthcare, Housing, etc) have shifted to benefit to those ""NEW"" Hong Kong people. Please do some research.

Very well developed urban area with wonderful skylines for the rich or people with capital from anywhere of the world, the same time a living hell for those ones who can't keep up the wealth growing pace. The poor are indeed surviving instead of living. You hardly see these in any developed economy. As the video creator stated, the Hong Kong government somehow willing to make things as status quo, well sometimes have to offer sort of benefits to those people who live in these cages to maintain overall stability. Well, in my understanding, it is just a trick to keep those people survive so rich ones can continue to live their urban life.

And the term ""State Capitalism"" is a term that was invented to describe a government that behaves as a private individual would under a capitalist system. It's not just another form of capitalism.

@kavalia2307,"In my opinion, the problem is firstly a lack of land and a conflict of interest between the Upper+middle and lower classes. As the video shows, most available land has already been developed, and although there are pockets of flat land up in the North, nobody wants to live there because its far from the urban center and property values aren't as good there...which brings me to the second point.  Unlike other places in the world, many Hong Kongers see their home as an ""investment"" which they expect to appreciate in value. This brings us to the conflict of interest point. The lower classes, who cannot afford homes, want property prices to go down. Yet they still yearn to own their own place, yes, to live, but to also have a piece of investment that will pull them out of the lower income bracket to the middle class, hence the unwillingness to buy places in cheap, affordable, but subprime regions such as the New Terrioties, Lantau, and surrounding HK islands. Demand is high, supply is low, and prices keep rising.   The middle class, who often own land, want their home prices to continue going up as 1. a safety net, 2. an ability to earn extra (and i mean a lllooott) of money on the side 3. jump up a social ladder to go from lower-middle to upper-middle to even upper class. It is in their interest to keep supply low, demand high, and prices rising. Therefore they will veto and oppose to oblivion anything the government does to fix the situation, as their entire livelihoods essentially depends on their single apartment.   The rich in Hong Kong, especially the property developers, will also not allow prices to depreciate as it will affect their holdings as well, and make the land less appealing to invest in for the middle class. They want to stay rich. There goes any move to improve the situation from the upper class.   In my opinion, government change is only possible when they have the support of two of the three (lower, middle, upper) levels of society, regardless of numbers. Currently, the middle and upper class are happy with the status quo, and hence any hope for the situation to become better.",6년 전,0,

And its slowly beginning to manifest even in the US... despite most Americans be so assured it could never happen here in the US.   It is why we are being conditioned to accept this future with tv shows popularizing “tiny houses” and hit movies so often depicting a dystopian future.. with movies like “Ready Player One” depicting a future US where people live in densely populated “stack-n-pack” housing...   Natural disasters/ weather artificially engineered along with increasing taxes, fines, fees, permit restrictions, zoning restrictions & rising food costs will be steadily implemented and utilized as a means to relocate people into urban housing areas,  and these tight, crowded & crappy residence will be a challenge for most to afford...   People will be told & made to think these growing enviromental/ weather events/ disasters are all “their fault”... due their “carbon footprints”....  And in the name of “protecting & restoring the environment” all the neighborhoods where we once lived will be deemed “protected wildlife refuge reserves” and be mandated & enforces as off limits areas to the public all in the name of “returning the environment to its natural state & beauty”.   Sound too far fetched....?   ....lol. only if you haven’t taken a look into the United Nations global Agenda 21.

Bank/wealthy controlled, yet sanctioned by the government is crony-capitalism indeed, but is distinct from an actual free-market. In other words, it's a recipe for expensive land pricings.

@heyitsfadoua,"I'd like to comment on this as myself and my family have been battling for good housing for years. We live in one of the most expensive cities for rent in Europe: London. As you know, Hong Kong is an extreme example compared to London, but trust me we are also suffering with the wait for social housing...However, what I have seen in this report is really upsetting...I did not know that people were even allowed to leave in such horrendous conditions, especially the space. In the English capital, we are clearly in for a housing crisis, but the government has given us affordable 3-bedroom flats to live in. They consider the living space for a family of 5 (like mine) and while I share a bedroom with my sister, we accept what our government has given us as temporary accommodation, because we have the minimum required amount of space a decent human should have to live in (even though we have nowhere to put our laundry, we use our radiators and doors to dry the clothes... We have been waiting in the list for more than 10 years now for social permanent housing since 2007. We have also been evicted twice from different properties, not because we did not pay on time, but because our lease ended or the landlord wanted us out, it is very common in London, and often vulnerable families suffer a lot. It is a period of uncertainty but at least in Britain, our wellbeing and mental health is considered in housing. It is not as extreme and while I am very mad at the housing crisis going on in London and the amount of long time we have been waiting as homeless, looking now at Hong Kong made me realise that while I will probably never be able to afford to buy a house in London, people elsewhere such as Hong Kong have it way worse....I am so sorry.

Why the west made pretty much every major scientific breakthrough post 16th century, like vaccines, cars, electricity, trains etc...

@amb3cog," @ohhNate85  It's not actually a free market though. It's completely rigged, and always has been. Not saying you can't work around it, if you try really hard. Many do. But it's not free at all. Not when big companies can use their lawyers to stop you from legally reselling their products for instance, just because you can't afford to fight them. And that's just one simple thing off the top of my head. I have a friend who had a cell phone reselling business. Doing well over a million a year in sales and growing fast. Sprint stepped in, and sued him, and a bunch of others like him. It was completely baseless, and in fact one of them had the money to fight. And won. But my friend had to quit after spending about 50k. And he lost his business, because of it. Does that sound like a free market to you? Don't kid yourself. There's nothing free about our market. If it were truly free. We wouldn't have such a huge wealth/income gap in this country. Truly free markets don't allow a handful of people to claim all the wealth.

@pickclawraider4206,"You must be a terrible pessimist and cynic, assuming that every person out there making money only wants to do so by abusing and scamming everyone else. While corruption is a sad factor in any economy ever, the ""Free market"" is the best system mankind has discovered. The problem in this scenario is both poor management (as stated in the video) and the artificial scarcity created specifically for housing. With such a small percentage of the land allowed for housing (permitted by governmental policy) and the auction/leasing structure of the residential-zoned land, it creates scarcity in housing amongst such a huge population in a small geographic area. Think about the diamond industry. Diamonds are not rare, and turns out are very, very common. The Debeers Group only allows for a very, very small percentage of diamonds into the market at a time in order to keep scarcity high, even though many, many more diamonds are actually available. In this case the diamonds released into the market is the tiny amount of land released into the market. If all of the available diamonds were released right now, the diamond price would plummet and everyone could buy them at insanely low prices. If the Hong Kong government released a lot more land for residential zoning, it would create much more housing and the cost would dramatically lower due to the abundant supply.  What you have here is a basic population necessity being controlled by the government to create artificial scarcity.",6년 전,0,

If you're in the camp of people that believe you should be raising a family on a cashier's salary, then you can't be helped. Mobility into the middle and upper class requires hard work and effort, but in a free market those possibilities are open for anyone willing to put in the time.",6년 전,0,

@amb3cog," @666m111  My friend, if a company falsely accuses you of something. Who pays for your legal defense? You do, even if you win. Like I said in my comment. There was one person, out of like 10 that were sued, who fought all the way. And he won. They all would have won, if they had the money to fight, but only 1 did. It cost the better part of a half a million dollars to win. So did he really win? In my friend's case, he didn't have the money. So he had to give in. No one was doing anything wrong. Except for Sprint, by using their money to squash the competition. It happens all the time in this country. You really need to wake up to the reality of how this country really works. You really think that these big companies don't file false lawsuits, if it benefits them to do so? You really think everyone is completely honest, and forthright in business? You really think all laws are fair? How could anyone possibly be that naive? Would you be interested in investing in an amazing opportunity? Is the latest thing in real estate. Bridge shares. Someone gets all that toll money right? Why not you sir? 🤑💰💵🤣🤣🤣",6년 전,0,
@666m111," @amb3cog  What do you mean bridge shares? I saw somebody else mention that, I am guessing you are talking about a toll bridge? I am from the UK and we don't have them, that I know of.   That is quite possibly why we have differing views on the subject matter which you re putting out. See, if this happened in England, the big company would most probably lose. EVERYTHING about a business has to be recorded in England, they would look at the evidence and no amount of greasing palms would stop that evidence from bringing the correct result.   It seems to me that in the USA there is not actually any straight bone cut and dry laws that everybody follows, instead each individual judge deciphers how the law is to be interpreted based on how heavy a wad of cash they can get from it.   In the UK, the small guys would go to the media and the big company would lose alot of customers over night, forever tainting their image. There is a shop in, I believe Liverpool or Manchester who will not stock a particular daily newspaper due to the fact they were once rude about a catastrophic event where people got crushed at a football ground and died. When David Cameron said he would step down if they lost the vote to stay in the EU, he did when we did.   Whilst England is not as free reign as people like to believe it is, we still have an awful lot of freedom due to the fact that it genuinely is that people that make decisions, not the rich and powerful.   Somebody once actually said to me ""If a credit card company of phone company threaten to take you to court for something? Let them, they will lose as most of the things that they do are breaking the law."" So, even if they have the right in a scenario, if a mobile provider has an issue with you, all you need to do is post it on social media and most of the time it will get cleared up in a few days and it will no longer be a problem.",6년 전,0,
@amb3cog," @666m111  The Bridge Share thing is just a gag I made up myself. A new style, of selling you a bridge. Get it? Like the old saying. ""If you believe that. I've got a bridge to sell you"".  And yes sir, obviously we're misunderstanding each other, because in the US a company can get away with falsely accusing you of copyright infringement (among other things), and you have to pay to defend yourself. With almost zero chance of getting that defense money back, if you win.  That's why I was having a laugh at your expense, because everyone that really knows the laws in our country, knows this. And unfortunately there's still a ton of rubes that don't, and will argue with you till the day they die, that they know. When they really don't. I have other friends that have dealt with similar things, including one who had Brown University in Providence RI try to work in cahoots with the owner of the building he leased. To basically steal the lease out from underneath him, despite the fact he was legally in the right. It cost him over $350,000 US to fight them. And he won too. But he lost in the end, because that killed that business, and others he had too. Because he didn't have capital left for the lean times. After spending all that money. He got no legal fees back in this so called ""win"". And that's the game they play to bully those that are smaller then them. They don't have all those lawyers to defend themselves. They use them to take people out basically.   He did force them to spend millions though, and there's a building in Providence RI that's not the shape it was originally designed to be, because of him. There's basically a corner section missing, and the building he leased is still there (they wanted to tear it down). He had to pay expert architect's to testify in court this would cost them over a million dollars to redesign the building, to prove their intentions. This cost him like $6000 a day plus expenses (he had to fly a guy in, and pay for food, and lodging, etc.).  So you're right. Our system is not fair. I don't know about yours unfortunately. But this was my whole point. There's no fairness in this country. He with the most money wins. Almost everytime too. That's why I laugh at the idea of a free market, at least in this country anyway. It's simply a myth, like just about everything else people here believe about our country. It's just patriotic, ra ra, BS that doesn't exist anywhere but in naive people's imaginations unfortunately. And if you ever see anyone on here saying otherwise. I can assure you. They've done very little in their life. Because anyone with any business experience at all. Knows this for sure.  BTW if you want to see the building I'm talking about I think it's 185 Meeting St Providence RI. If you look it up on Google Maps. You'll see it's an L shape, and there's a building in the L basically. That's the building they wanted to tear down. If that's not the correct address. It's the building closest to the corner of Meeting and Thayer St. And the back borders Olive St. The building is now Gourmet Heaven, or at least it was last I checked, and that's the picture they have on Street View too. That used to be Via Via Pizza, and that was my friend's business. Just put that address in and scroll towards Thayer street, and you'll see it. Then look up the staggering amount of property they own in Providence, and in the most expensive part too mostly, and ask yourself how that happens? It's not just because they bought them all fair and square. I can assure you. Hospitals do this type of thing too. They use their money to bully people. So it's not just corporations. It's anyone with the money/power to do so. Free Market my ass! I apologize if I was rude too. I thought you were one of those people, and didn't realize you were from another country.

@goldaria9228,"The colonization happened over 300 years ago and not by “The United States” but by “European settlers” Basically the same people but officially it can’t be said that it was the US government as you were already in the mix when the US government was formed. Also American Indians have their own reservations with their own laws etc but unlike Taiwan and Hong Kong which are self sustainable territories in the modern world, because your territories were overtaken so far in the past they could not survive on their own currently. I don’t really care what you guys do. I don’t want to force you to be American if you don’t want to. I will also still call you American if you want to be called American idk. But guess what as Native American you get a special pass on a lot of things in America like scholarships, special loan agreements etc while China is offering no benefits to either of these places except to take control of them and push chinese people in to dilute the population. I’m wondering if you would like that I came to your reservations and took up the land and separated you guys so your cultural practices became diluted. In 100 years your descendants would be completely integrated and there would be no reason to ever say that they deserve to have a piece of land and separate anymore than any other American does. It’s because the us government which you hate so much didn’t do this that you can even say stuff like this 300 years later. Also for perspective, all lands which were colonized in the past that had native/aboriginal people on them, are now part of the current country that is in that area. You don’t get to be special just because you were colonized on land that is now part of the US sorry. You already lost your wars    and have to come to terms with that. What I’m talking about is a modern day issue. Isn’t it odd that the people of Hong Kong would rather be ruled as a British colony than go back with their original brothers in China? Also if you are American Indian why the hell are you promoting the Chinese colonization of Hong Kong. So you want to separate from the us which you’ve been part of for 300 years but hong kong which has only recently been taken back by China doesn’t have any right to say they should have stayed separated?  That makes zero sense. Also Taiwan is its own country now even though it isn’t being recognized because China is bullying other countries in the United Nations to not recognize it as such.

Luckily you failed because since you aren’t even American Indian like you claimed, I know way more about their situation than you do. You aren’t going to convince anyone outside of mainland China that sending Chinese into honk Kong to drive up land prices and dilute Hong Kong culture is right. Go back to your chinese internet, and if you’re studying abroad or relocated, think about the fact that if you were in China your government wouldn’t let you see any of this. I have been brainwashed somewhat by my government but guess what if I can interact with foreigners and learn from their ideas then I won’t be brainwashed anymore.

@markuse3472,"""...put the interest of people above the interest of market [excessive riches]."" Poor people includes many between middle class and some middle class. Poor people are the majority. If the filthy rich were actually smart, intellectuals, they would realize, after putting all the obvious pieces together, that the poor will soon not be able to take it. They wont tolerate it anymore and they will protest, violently. This will happen worldwide because this greed happens everywhere. The poor are being forced out from their once-called home areas. They are being shoved away. They are being bullied. What happens when people are pushed too much or too hard? They fight back. Regardless if you disagree with this and don't like the opinion, the chaos is coming. And that is it. The rich and the greedy and selfish don't care. Wont care. Until its too late. The chaos is coming and then they will try to be considerate, thoughtful of the less fortunate, but it will be too late. The riches they have built will be burnt away to ashes. Many will die: can you actually not see it coming? Take a look around the world, much information, which humanity couldn't see for themselves before the internet and its explosion, is right here on Youtube and other websites. The world is going to tremble, all because the rich and the powerful were too selfish and too arrogant. Those who THINK they are safe in their castles, will find out such homes were built on sand.

This situation happens across the globe and every single country has the same complications...if building new accommodation for those who need somewhere to live was catered to, then we would have no free land or nature on earth's land either. People and organisations across the world are putting and backing legislation in place to prevent mother natures ground from being another plot of development. This isn't a isolated problem and most people have to make sacrifices like commuting and settling for housing outside of where they would prefer to live...we all do it and ruining what is left of undeveloped land is definitely NO SOLUTION because once that's taken up, there will always be a further demand of housing.",7년 전,0,

Yes perhaps we need to learn how to be more efficient (eat nose to tail, stay seasonal, don't turn your fields into shrimp factories) but the point is we only manage to feed our populations now due to advancements made over 1000's of years and to support 16 billion we'd need to advance further not regress.",6년 전,0,
@littlehorseyhorsey," @polla2256  You're kidding me right? We currently are able to feed all 8 billion people in the world. It's the markets and methods employed and how society as well as nation's economies are structured that 500 million people starve every day. Or are you saying all those corn that was dumped into a landfill by American corporations(during George Bush's era, I think?) was a good idea, it served a great purpose? What made you think ancestors was 'had' to be 5,000 years ago. I'm talking 2,000 years ago up to 1,500 years ago as well. And what you list isn't food management, it's food production. I have to point that out. The ""...simple farmers supporting tiny populations"" does not account for hunting societies and where farming only became the norm afterwards to address key issues, critical points of relying on hunting. Also not all were simple farmers supporting tiny populations. It's too great an vague and simplistic view on our ancestors. The left overs after the nose to tail eating you mention such as bones can also be used as natural fertilizer. A treat for cats? If they actually eat fish bones. Stay seasonal is a great way to follow tradition. I don't understand this shrimp factories thing you wrote. Might wanna educate me on that.   ""but the point is we only manage to feed our populations now due to advancements made over 1000's of years and to support 16 billion we'd need to advance further not regress.""  But there are still people unable to eat despite food being abundant. It's as if nothing has changed to when there were food around but people still couldn't eat 1,000 years ago as to now in 2018 when food IS abundant but it ""seems"" to not meet demand. The problem that is most critical isn't how to advance a food production system we have now but making it more EFFECTIVELY lean, how much more efficient we can be with utilizing the production methods with greater results. That in itself is furthering food production's cause. Being wasteful throws us backwards in time. Look to Europeans over 1000 years ago. They got sick from the way they lived. It's no wonder. And I have to write this as well. No, us Chinese did not give you the Black Plague. You guys did it to yourself. China had more advance understanding of medicine and treatment of the human body when the Black Plague came about. It's more likely that this was the cause.  https://www.google.com/search?q=black+plague&oq=black+plague&aqs=chrome..69i57.1543j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8  Read the start of the Black Plague  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe#Counter-Invasions_of_Europe  Scroll down to the end and it mentions the first year of the plague. How Europeans lived during these eras of squalor. Chinese cities were usually more clean and had ""imperial"" splendor. It's very unlikely we Chinese got sick and it transferred from Asia to Europe. It's more likely Europeans' naturally disgusting way of life finally caught up(great joke for some) to Asia and the rest of the world.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Everyone wants to move to places like these so raising the prices keeps people from moving into huge cities like these and everything goes to hell. Everything goes of balance and what not. It also forces people to move back into mainland China where homes are more affordable and more closely watched and monitored by the communist party. Chinese from mainland China are pouring in with millions of money to buy off the land. Slowly taking over and preparing for the day Hong Kong finally legally becomes part of China once again. Chinese military will move in along with Chinese authorities and ensure the transition for citizens of Hong Kong can make the proper changes into the Chinese way of life. Laws will change a little but not too much because the Chinese government doesn't want to change too much in Hong Kong and affect the money revenue coming in from this city alone. More profitable than other Chinese mega cities in mainland China. Just the citizens have to change and convert their citizenship into Chinese citizenship. I hope the Chinese government doesn't change to much on Hong Kong.,7년 전,0,

You could argue you still can use every car everywhere but there are actually some safety concerns with this. Anyways my point still stands it would be better for more people if they used the metric system which I keep believing is superior to the imperial system which works, but not as good as the metric system. Afterall there must be a reason for it to be the scientific and international system and more widely adopted. England actually tried to implement it (not so much though) but it didnt work out so well. Why are you so buthurt about it, its just to make comprehension simpler for more people.

We have the best of both worlds and use measurements the way we want. Get over yourselves and get on our level.  I’m sorry but if I learned chinese and went to a chinese website to watch a video and they used meters I would be positively ridiculed for asking them to change measurements for me. What gall these people have. Chinese culture even had all these traditional measurement systems that they use before globalization and now that info is almost lost because they conformed to the global standard. They also probably had good reasons for making the measurements the way they did. Nuances that no one in the world except old chinese would know because it’s dead now.

In communism the people own means of production themselves, and they don't pay for anything as value does not exist nor do classes, and there is no state either. In Hong Kong there are classes (you can clearly see economic disparities from people who live in holes and those who live in skyscrapers) a state (which even owns all of the land statally) value (goes without saying) and companies are 100% private, they're not worker-led or anything.  So while it certainly isn't Communist, it's actually far from being statist or authoritarian. The state doesn't have nationalized factories or such, it simply owns all the land because that's how it worked back in colonial states (like in America during colonization) and they just kept it when becoming indipendent.",7년 전,0,
@benb3316,"Early Capitalists criticized slavery, they were against it. Wages were much more efficient.

Even the chattel slavery America is so known for was inefficient and 'socialist' compared to the free market capitalism that came later.  Workers you can work and work and then fire when you make them ragged or if your business isn't working out just close down and leave.

Firstly, the population in HK are rising, but not because of birth problem, instead is immigrant. Many people from mainland come to HK for better education, working place, salary and e.t.c.  Second, the land problem in HK. HK isn't a big place. There's not much space for more buildings (There is once a land reclamation before). Third, the government help only the poor people also the immigrants. The people in the 'middle-class' can't get help from the government. Therefore, there are people who can't afford a flat (but they aren't too poor) and can't get help from the government. For instance, those people can't apply for public housing estate since they are above a line (I forget where that line is). In short, living in HK isn't easy. The competition in here is heavy which makes HK a stressful city.  Lastly, I'm just a secondary school student in HK. If I'm wrong, please correct me. Also, I don't know a lot in politics, so ya.

@shawnjia3709,"I live in Hong Kong. Let me explain this.  Everyone had a choice, and they made theirs. No one forced them to live in those crammed spaces. There are neighborhoods in HK with much lower price/sq.ft. and better conditions. For 2000 HKD, instead of renting a cage, he could have pooled with 4 other people and share a decent apartment with beautiful interior in another neighborhood. Those people chose the cage because they think where they live is more convenient (not necessarily true) or have sentimental attachment to the neighborhood. Don't blame the government and the rising prices. Their choice is to blame. HK's housing is expensive, but the people who live in bad conditions only account for a tiny fraction of the population. There are less of them than homeless people in NYC. By the way, homelessness is not a problem in HK. (HK1000 people vs NYC 61000). Think about that. There is nothing wrong with the idea of HK being a place for free market economy. The average salary is extremely high compared to most other asian countries. It is the place to make money, have a good saving and live somewhere cheaper after retiring. Of course it's miserably expensive after they've stopped making money or don't have  income. Staying in HK with almost no income is obviously a bad choice.  Policy makers' job is to create policies to benefit the vast majority of people. They have done an excellent job. Look at the city of HK compared to the rest of asia (Japan excluded). It still serves as a role model for many neighboring developing countries. Keep in mind that the kind of poor people you saw in the video only account for a tiny fraction of the population. They had and still have the choice to move. HK is big, huge actually. It's not as dense and expensive as how the video portrays. The video makes a point, but it only tells a tiny part of the story.  Don't generalize from it.",7년 전(수정됨),107,

Hong Kong's problem is with land shortage - we barely have land to live on, let alone public spaces like parks.

@miakate6167," @JiaRuAu  Based on this video, you're right, most of them definitely seem pretty minimal. And I'm not pretending to understand how life really is for these people, as I've never visited Hong Kong, let alone lived there. I personally live in a space as small as many of these pictured and find it perfectly suitable, homey, and prefered; however, I know that I've freely chosen to live this way, whereas many of these people don't have a choice. For that, I feel lucky and grateful, and empathize with those in Hong Kong who are unhappy with their living situation. I guess the main point I was trying to make was that such minimal square footage of a living space doesn't seem to be as bad in itself, as the other conditions associated with it- like them being crammed together in tight dingy buildings without natural light, etc. Lots of people this day in age are all about ""tiny homes,"" ""vanlife,"" etc. and love their itty bitty spaces - but they likely spend most of their lives outside of these spaces anyway; outdoors, out and about, etc. If the people of Hong Kong are working 2-3 jobs to make ends meet, which unfortunately I'm sure most of them are, then I imagine they likely aren't spending much time in their ""homes"" anyway, and it is literally just a space to sleep and store a few belongings. Not saying they should just suck it up and be happy with it; everyone deserves to be comfortable at home. Just was pointing out what popped into my mind after watching this video.",7년 전,7,

It means that if they were to look for a job, low specialisation jobs are widely available in most parts of HK.  If they can spend 2000HKD/month on rent, they have enough money to move. They have the choice of going across the border to China and live a much better life. You may say that they can't legally do that, but plenty of people do it illegally. At this point, they don't care. Since they have very little material possession, it's not too difficult to take everything.

My sister is living in a 100sqft room with 7 other people for hkd$4000! Sharing bathroom and kitchen area, the whole place is less than 600 sqft too.  PLEASE explain how can you find cheap places like that in Hong Kong the first place. Cause surely the salary is better than some other countries in Asia, but rent should only be 30 of your income, and when the rent is 50% or more it's not reasonable. Therefore, they are almost forced to live in places like that. It's not a choice anymore! Just to survive in Hong Kong, and not having a actual ideal living, that's the problem. So yes we should blame the government for such thing happening in Hong Kong. Oh and we just spent billions on a train to China?! Which could be funded for more government condos for new wedded couples/ family/ immigrants to purchase?  There's no homeless unless it's their own will to be one is because we have great benefits for low income people and they are actually better off not getting a job and just ask government to give them money to live.

@greenleaves8909,"HK is among the world's business and financial centres but by nature it's a hardly seen dot on maps.  Foreign investments means a lot to this mini piece of land.  Sources of income could hardly generate to a large scale if without foreign investments despite we are all along backed up by China with the supply of agricultural products and daily items at low expenses.   Low profit tax, low income tax and also its closeness to China makes HK appealing to foreign investors despite the payment of extremely high rents.  Great developers continued to dominate the property market and housing prices keep soaring high while the HK govt. depend heavily on land auction for its revenue and expenditure.   Housing policies brought down from governor to governor remained to be the vital criticism of the govt.  While living environment is congested and unsatisfactory, HK people pay low income tax and don't have the VAT.   Yet we have free education, free (for those in need)  or low medical expenses without making any contribution to medical insurance payment, free/subsidised home care services for the elderly and the disabled, free/subsidised pre-school education for day nursery, social security assistance and allowances etc.    Compulsory medical insurance by individuals was raised once or twice by the govt over the past years but was curbed by opposing voices.   There are pros and cons if we choose to stay here and at anywhere else while the govt. had the responsibility to make hk a better place to live especially for the low income groups.

@VarietyGamerChannel,"""Piece together an explanation for this trend"" = it's simple, there is a huge influx of mainland chinese into hong kong. most Hong Kong land is protected from development. This has driven up the cost of limited real estate you can build on. They tried to fix this by building lots of cheap housing tenements on freed up land, but the long term hong kong locals complained (was bringing prices of their apartments down) so the plan was abandoned. So now it's back to building condominiums for the rich and installing chicken cages for everyone else. It's a catch 22-hong kong needs more low income buildings on undeveloped land, but developing undeveloped land in any way brings value of developed land next-door down. Hong Kong's rich don't want this. Meanwhile more and more low income people come to live and work in the city.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

The auctions drive the prices so ridiculously high that any investor that could afford to purchase use of the land for 50 years isn't going to want to waste that investment on housing.

@markashurst8626,How is homelessness in HK? A space of any kind seems better than freezing in the cold and rain. No bathroom options better than behind the dumpster in the alleys. I wish there were an option like this for very low cost housing such as this in my community to help the homeless bridge out of homelessness. Apartments start at about $800 and can be very hard to find at that. Our zoning makes it near impossible to build more hosing and prices here are on the rise. I’m sure if there were places like this for people starting at $267 (maybe here it could be as low as $30-60) it would have an impact on homeless rates. I honestly watch this and get excited about what dollar a day housing could offer. Part of the homeless problem here is that there are no housing options between homeless and $800. Why not? Not everyone needs 900+ Square feet.,7년 전,0,

@Got2Bespoke,"Having spent over a decade in the emergency services sector, all I could think about while watching this was the horror that would result from a fire in one of these cage/coffin home buildings.  Dividing up homes like this leads to a greater risk of death in a fire not just for the residents, but also for the rescue personnel who may become lost or trapped if these divided homes are not disclosed (as is often the case when a home is divided up illegally). High rises are built to meet certain fire and safety requirements and the number of units and maximum occupancy play an important role in all of this. If there are 4 families living in the space that was intended for 1 family and this situation exists in every apartment, imagine the sheer chaos during an emergency on just one floor of the building and how the increased number of individuals evacuating will slow that process to a crawl trying to fit X amount of people through an evacuation route designed for a quarter of that number.  Suffice to say, there are so many safety concerns with this situation that I can’t even touch on them all without turning this into a complete diatribe.   It’s great that reform/change is happening, but these things often move at a snails pace until there’s a tragedy. As awful as it sounds, there are so many examples throughout history of tragedy being the catalyst for major change. However, it doesn’t have to be that way, especially in circumstances like this one where the danger is evident to all.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

But i can't help but think when watching this, that the government of Hong Kong is actually doing the correct thing here. If the goal here is to drive innovation through free marketplace of ideas, than reducing taxes and finding alternative revenue from corporations wanting an adress in a place that affords unfettered capitalism is exactly the way you preserve a city that can thrive in this aspect. The issue isnt the hoarding of land to increase its price, its actually the migration of people to Hong Kong who want to take advantage of its thriving marketplace. People are choosing to live in increasingly smaller places to take advantage of the economy and city structure. This choice is brought on by a need to forgoe ones basic necessities to achieve monetary gains that would allow one to survive  elsewhere. Its actually not Hong Kong that is at fault, its the rest of the world that is at fault. Our system of economics is beoken, abused, corupted and frail.

@zhaoxunyan4016,"Thank you for doing the homework. But I should say it is far from enough to cover the whole picture. I add three points, and hope them help. 1. Why does the government own all the land? It is a colonial thing. The British government acquired the land of the whole Hongkong after Opium War. And they could do whatever they want with the colony, the lands.  2. Did government ever tried to solve this issue?  Ironically the first general after Hongkong's return to China, Tung Chee-hwa（董建华） (yes the commy fellow of Jiang Zemin) did sincerely dwell on this issue. - He published new plans for bringing in talents and innovative industry, as well as dropping the land price and home price.  Yes exactly, dropping instead of taming the growth of the land price, or Rent in economic terms. The whole thinking is straight forward - since the joining of WTO, China no longer relies on Hongkong as a single trade port to the rest of the world, and Hongkong can no longer just take advantage of its pure identity and make  easy money through trade. The old way of distribution no longer works and Hongkong has to rely on its own industry to maintain competitive advantage. High rent is a huge obstacle to this because it only awards the old rich who simply sits and collects money as a sucker.  Yet guess who opposed him the most? The Hongkong middle class. Many of them lost job during the financial attack by a Jew Soros but have to payback the mortgage. They are angry to see the housing value now is just a half of their mortgage total value which was signed before the price drop.  And there came the first democratic movement, or street protest to be process. Tung Chee-hwa left his position with a bad reputation. And no general dare to challenge this status quo.  3. Will this issue be solved in the future? No, since the Hongkong people are stupid enough to blame everything on Mainland and believes democracy or independence will restore their prosperity like the era as the only port between China and the west. Their stupidity will not help them any on the soaring rent and the sinking economy.",7년 전,0,

The economic opportunity in Hong Kong is so massive that people continue flooding in despite knowing they'll be living in a coffin apartment. Also, many people are either only living in this housing temporarily while they climb the incredibly mobile economic ladder, or they stay in the terrible housing because the lower price increases the amount of money they can send to their family back in the village. Certainly there are people doing the bare minimum to survive, but most of those are due to personal choice. Lastly, I can assure you that the cage apartments are preferable to living in a Soviet Gulag. Capitalism will always be better for everyone than socialism.

@kianwilliams1152,"@OmegaTou I don't think this is an entirely accurate picture. While it is true that there is demand to live in Hong Kong, the population isn't growing very quickly. The annual population growth rate has only exceeded 1% once in the past two decades. For comparison, Australia, the country with the largest new houses in the world, has a growth rate that has exceeded 1% in all but one year in the same period. The difference between the housing markets of the two (a massive, mostly empty continent and a tiny pseudo-city state) is more in supply than demand. A more like comparison may be Singapore (self governing, highly commercial cities with similar densities), which has grown at a much faster pace than Hong Kong since the mid 1980's). I couldn't find data on average home size in general, but Singapore's public rentals are nearly twice as spacious as Hong Kong's. On a more qualitative note, I regularly hear about a housing crisis in Hong Kong and never hear about such problems in Singapore.",7년 전,0,

@ibmtpx24,"The policies mentioned in this video is the reaction to the small (~4%) build-able zoning area in Hong Kong. You don't want to have buildings on the mountains because they would require the trees and native eco systems to be removed, which can cause significant disasters (mud slides and alike) when a typhoon hits. When that happens, it's not just the houses built on the mountains that got washed away, all lives on the flat surface will suffer as well. I know this because my father worked for a government agency overseeing the housing development project proposals in the mountains and I have heard lots of examples of him receiving threats and bribe offers from the financial groups which eventually caused him to quit since he could no longer work in good conscience (it's either his life or all lives at the foot of the mounts that will be threatened because of the building proposal).   I am sure the community developers will not think like this and this video illustrated perfectly with the interviews from two urban development advocates. The basic rule applied here is that housing/building development does not consider long term safety, risks, and nature as high priority items. Most people want to be able to have a cheap place to live and that pressure can be high. However there is always a limit to everything. The nature does fight back pretty hard sometimes (e.g. superbug as a reaction to antibiotic abuse).",7년 전,0,

@yuantan9292,"Believe it or not, one of the possible solutions to this may be softening (if not slowly erasing) the Hong Kong-Mainland China border. Unlike any of the other cities that made the 0:19 list, Hong Kong don't really have a ""greater area"" or suburbs for less-than-high income groups to commute or move. In the case of New York, tons of people regularly commute from New Jersey to strike a balance between higher wages and lower living cost. Hong Kong doesn't have such an option right now. Also, Hong Kong is a great place to travel, but unless you really have 9-digit in the bank, don't think of working and living there. Almost the entirety of Hong Kong economy relies upon the stock market, real estate, and import-export, and there is practically no industry, no R&D, no natural resource for harvest, and few tech companies. The economic structure in Hong Kong fundamentally can't support good living condition for all of its 7+ million citizens, most people have to seek financial opportunities elsewhere, which means either going to another nation or move into mainland China.",7년 전,0,

,"I did the math on this. So the median price for a property is 19.7 times the median income according to the figures used here.   If a person started working at 20 years old, and earned median income for the entire work life, and the property bought also stayed at median price, and each month 1/3 of the gross income goes towards the mortgage, the loan itself will be repaid well after this worker's 70th birthday, but we haven't even considered interest yet. In this scenario, a lot of people would have to work 'til they drop, and still there may be outstanding payments. They could increase they share of their income they put towards the mortgage, but of course this would significantly impact on disposable income and their ability to save up.

@yticivam,"They should model their housing after Singapore's HDBs. ""HDB History and Towns The HDB story began with it taking over from its predecessor, the Singapore Improvement Trust. Persevering through challenges, HDB has since established public housing in Singapore as a benchmark of excellence.  Beginning Blueprint In 1960, there was a housing crisis in Singapore. Many people were living in unhygienic slums and crowded squatter settlements. Only 9% of Singaporeans lived in government flats, while others yearned for a place to call home.  The Housing & Development Board was thus set up on 1 February 1960, tasked to solve Singapore’s housing crisis.  HDB sprang into action, and in less than 3 years, it had built 21,000 flats; 2 years later, that number was 54,000. Within a brief span of 10 years, HDB built a sufficient number of flats for Singaporeans and resolved the housing crisis.   Supporting Pillars For HDB to successfully meet the difficult goals set out, it needed a sound public housing strategy. This strategy was defined by 3 crucial fundamentals:  The concept of a sole agency A sole agency in charge of public housing enabled more effective resource planning and allocation. This concept made it possible for us to secure the land, raw materials, and manpower for large-scale construction to optimise results and achieve economies of scale. A total approach to housing By adopting a total approach covering planning and design, land assembly, and construction, the housing task was carried out as a seamless whole – through allocation, management, and maintenance. Strong government support Support from the government in the form of political and financial commitment, complemented by legislation, helped put early public housing on the right track quickly, which made housing the nation that much smoother and fruitful a journey. Landmark Housing HDB is now home to more than 80% of Singapore’s population, across 23 towns and 3 estates. Having completed more than 1 million flats and housed an entire nation, we believe there is more that we can do to build new-generation housing and smart, sustainable towns. We will continue to serve to the best of our abilities to create the best possible living environment where communities can thrive."" https://www.hdb.gov.sg/",7년 전,0,

@nthperson,"The British colonial authorities had the right idea regarding land ownership, sort of. Community ownership of land rather than private ownership of land is the right starting point, IF the members of a community embrace the principle that the earth is the birthright of all persons, equally. Nature is rightfully the commons for all to share. At the same time, everyone needs to have a secure access to some location on which to constructed a residential property or a business property. Again, the British authorities came up with the right approach by awarding access under a leasehold arrangement. However, to achieve both equity and economic efficiency, the leaseholds require specific characteristics that have not been adopted.  The economics are fairly straightforward. Every parcel or tract of land has some potential annual rental value. This value is created by actual and perceived locational advantages. Some advantages are created by nature directly (e.g., direct access to a harbor or other natural resources, or even a scenic view). Other advantages are created by the aggregate public and private investment in infrastructure and amenities. When leaseholds are awarded by competitive bidding, market forces will result in the full potential annual rental value coming to the public treasury. The terms of the ground lease must provide for periodic adjustment in the ground rent charges as the market ground rents rise (or fall).  Ideally, then, all buildings should be exempt from taxation. Buildings are private assets. They depreciate over time and require a constant infusion of funds for maintenance and systems replacement. This is consistent with Hong Kong's ""free market"" strategies. Selling the land of the community is not consistent with free market principles; selling land, or leasing it at below market ground rents distributes ""rentier privilege"" to those who hold land under these conditions.  Hong Kong's government has created a system that begins with a good idea but then creates a whole set of incentives and rules that have made it impossible for market forces to construct decent, affordable housing for many of its residents. Zoning should permit mixed-use development so that high rise buildings could contain commercial space on the ground floor, some office space on higher floors, and residential units on other floors. This can be accomplished and also provide land for parks and recreation. A combination of public collection of the full market ground rents and exemption of property improvements will do the rest.

Capitalism isn't defined as ""anything bad that has to do with money"" Capitalism is defined as the free and wiling exchange of goods and services, no more no less.  When you involve a central authority that can and does create rules for trade and collects taxes on ""behalf"" of the people to redistribute that is now socialism.

And you're right there's no corruption here or lobbying with the government, this is just the basic nature of the market called supply and demand, just like how we need to eat, sleep and breathe, it's just as simple which boggles me how a lot of the folks just jump into conclusions saying the rich are manipulating all this land scarcity or something similar.  But the fact is there are super rich groups of mainland Chinese investing a huge chunk of their money into HK's real estate market causing this bubble and just reselling it for a profit.  While the truth is a lot of these money from mainland Chinese are stolen through corruption of the government officials or large companies.  While as long as mainland China remains politically communists(though technically capitalists atm but just with 2.5x higher taxes than HK) people don't know how long they can keep the wealth they've earned and they're desperate to put all their money into some where there's a safe political state for storage, and can even earn money from it, which is investing in Hong Kong property market.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

It's the only sort of economic structure that allows such socioeconomic flexibility, China and more importantly Hong Kong's well being has increased exponentially because of capitalism. For the first time in their lives most people in those respective countries are not being relegated to living in a single caste of society they have the mobility to move from being dirt poor to filthy rich.   Chinese people do not really respect the distinction between Hong Kong, Taiwan and China though they see all those regions as China and if you were to make that distinction with someone patriotic you'd quickly offend some people in China.   Someone nailed it though, Hong Kong/ Chinese real estate owners aren't buying property in their countries that's why they're buying land in countries like Canada or Australia. 2.5% of all farmland in Australia now is Chinese owned and that's increasing exponentially. It creates a problem here in Australia because Chinese farm owners do not hire Australian workers,  I'm sure something like that is happening in Canada too with farmland.",7년 전,4,

Since you said yourself that it's the main source of revenue for the government, if one were to decrease this allotment, the next logical thing to do would be to raise balances to make up that deficit. Now, theoretically, you could do this with corporate tax, but chances are that a corporate tax would get pretty much nowhere thanks to the corporate lobbying powers or the threat of a pull-out and scare of an economic downturn. That leaves an personal income tax, which, if incremental sounds like it might work. However, the citizens here are clearly already squeezed for money because of housing costs. Chances are that whatever pricing effects housing policy reform enacts will be slow to percolate through the market, and housing costs would still be extremely high. So in the short/medium term, you'd be putting the squeeze on the average citizen from both a taxation stanpoint and a housing pricing standpoint, albiet maybe a few dollars cheaper a month.",7년 전,0,

Recently the Hong Kong Government has just reveal a policy to reduce the rate of people living in these cage homes by reducing prices of the public housing hoping to get the people to move homes, but the market does not get lower. As the goverment is pusing to get the law set up to the private housing for built but not selling the housing (which is the case where im living right now, not all flats are having people living in) to impose taxes on them, the prices of the housing is seemingly not lowering but its going up. For the past 3 years, the house prices has been doubled, goverment tries to set up laws to deal with the situation, setting up taxes, which is still not working. I bet the goverment knows the problem the landuse but refused for reform.

The major issue comes from the ultra wealthy Chinese developers who create these high rises that are going to be inherently way too expensive to live in.

@syw5261,"HI @liang Qiao, in Singapore family/people who is buying 2nd home is taxed 12%-15%, foreigner is 20%  Company/entities who is buying residential apartment has to pay 15% tax.( I considered is quite low). But this reduced the buying momentum abit. The rental cash collected from landlord is not producing any high productivity back to the society. Hence, even the GDP is high in Singapore but the productivity is lower than years ago.  Subsizided public housing is now hitting higher prices (half million = USD 350k for 900-1000sqft and the lease only last 99 years or less if you buy a second hand house).It seems affortable, but mind you, this is public subsidized housing. The average income per couple is about SGD70k/80k per year ~USD50k-60k per year. Monthly payment could be ~ USD1000 depending on the payment years.",7년 전,0,

We have public libraries, public swimming pools, public sports centres and public sports grounds that are free to use or extremely cheap. You can find these things everywhere.

I grew up there and as a kid had the privilege to live 'rich' in a 'huge' 2000sq ft apartment at the top of a hill. Later my family left HK but I stayed to work in my late teens without help from parents. I lived in a tiny room that only fit a queen bed - no kitchen, but very lucky to have a tiny bathroom the size of a washing machine with a plastic hose as a shower. Sitting down to use the toilet, it was so cramped that I had to shift my knees to the side, because the wall was in the way. When it rained, water would drip from the ceiling onto the bed. My window opened out to a view of an alleyway piled up with years worth of garbage lol lol. The place was so small, I used to have to leave my shoes outside my door in the communal area, only to one day wake up and find some bastrd had stolen them - so I stole my neighbour's shoes so I could head to work. Now live in Australia in my own 4 storey townhouse with 3 bathrooms and a forest in my backyard.   Living poor / average in Hong Kong, most people spend as much time as they can outdoors. I'd only eat out, and the only time I spent at my cramped apartment / room / shoebox, was to sleep. I love Hong Kong. It's the best place in the world... if you're upper middle class / rich. If you're poor / working class, Hong Kong is the biggest sh*thole ever. Social welfare is non-existent, so you're on your own really if you lose your job. Health care is great there though, and it's the safest city in the world at night.   Hong Kong FTW!",7년 전,15,

@ruedelta,"A lot of the ""ghost city"" myth comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of how housing works in China. When you buy a house, you rarely get it fully furnished - instead, you wait a long time, sometimes up to a year, while workers do interior renovations. You then move in after it's done. This is also exacerbated by the fact that Chinese city planners actually have power and use projections to plan ahead. What usually happens is that they end up creating large residential complexes ahead of the actual wave. In a sense, it's like how stores will stock up in advance before the Christmas sales. Taking photos of a ""ghost city"" is like sneaking into the warehouse and claiming that there are wasted goods.  HK people can freely move to neighboring Shenzhen, but they just don't. This isn't an availability issue, nor is it a blockage issue. It's just preference.

After years my grandparents (mom's side) now lives in a small apartment with 2 bedrooms very small, no air condition, A tiny kitchen and a small living room which doesn't have a sofa its a bed. I always wished to help my family and do my best. Its expensive to buy things there now since my mom couldn't afford things that she wanted in HK to bring home. She had to take care of her family over there while both of my parents moved to America which we're happy now but hoping that HK can lower there prices just for people with less money and and not let them live in a small cramped area with barely any room. I've been to HK A long time ago and It was very expensive to even get a plane ticket to go there for one person. Now my Aunt wants to see me in HK when I dont think we can go.

@Teddypally,"@Random Youtube Idiot I think a Socialist policy is when the government owns what gets produced, generally through taxes and redistribution, which can result in better living conditions as long as there is no obstruction of what gets produced.   A Communist policy is when the Government owns the land and rents it out, which can result in better living conditions depending on how well people use the land.   A Capitalist policy is when the Government protects the citizen property and taxes to fund such protection which can result in better living for the people if the people become wealthy and look after each other.  A Fascist policy is when the Government owns the land and owns what is produced and protects itself which can result in better living conditions for the people if the Government is very capable.   I think the cycle is that it starts off Capitalist, then when the rich don't look after the poor, the government becomes Socialist as the Government steps in. Then it becomes Communist because there isn't enough tax money to help the poor and the Government tries to let only effective people have access.   Which works as long as the people don't go elsewhere to work. Then the Government become Fascist for as long as they have capable people who will make sacrifices. When that runs out, the Government start enslaving and running out of the local population who will make sacrifices usually means they have to go to war to get land and people from other countries to enslave.  Then if they win and after people are assimilated, the Government can become Capitalist again.   I think Governments are trying to break out of the cycle through and it's interesting because it seems like having some mechanisms of the previous parts of the cycle present can keep the Government from progressing to the next part of the cycle and there might be some formula for that. But it also raises the question if such progressions are necessary to evolve to a higher level of development, assuming that each cycle make things progressively better. And the danger that the next evolution leads to extinction.  Or I may be completely wrong. It's just interesting to think about.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
@meandmines3245,"nokeechia no the government owns everything in Communism. They then decide who gets what. The problem with Communism is the corruption. Lets use food for an example. All the food in the country is delivered to the Government. The government then decides who gets what and how many. It's SUPPOSED to be shared equally amongst the people. But the politicans would keep all the good stuff for themselves, like the steaks, chicken, lobster, crab, and then give the common people the leftovers and scraps.

@amihartz,">""Corporations don't own all the land in capitalism.""  They own the land that they have purchased. There is nothing in the definition of capitalism that says corporations can't potentially gain a monopoly over all the land.   10 corporations in the US own over 2 billion square feet of land and corporations grow larger every day and gain more of a monopoly.   Separating government ownership from corporate ownership is arbitrary.   >""There are millions of people that own their own land. I can go buy 40 arces next week if I want.""  Yes, but you have to buy them with the prices that the private corporation sets. Same with the government of Hong Kong. The corporation is just the government, and they have a monopoly so they can overcharge.   Again, having a monopoly does not mean it isn't capitalism. Capitalism naturally produces monopolies, which is the reason most governments have antitrust laws, since you need government intervention just to prevent monopolies.  >""In Capitalism the land is owned by multiple groups.""  Again, no. The land just so happens to be at this very moment owned by multiple groups. Again, there is nothing inherent in capitalism that says you can't have monopolies.  >""People, Government, and Corporations can buy and own land. In Communism only the government can own land.""  I think you need to look up the definition of ""communism"", as communism by its very definition is a stateless society.  >""I'm not a corporation and I can go and buy land whenever I want. I'm just a regular guy.""  Because prices are lower in the US due to better competition.   >""Do you guys live in a communist country? It must be a big surprise to you when I tell you people can buy and own their own land in a capitalist country.""  They can in capitalist Hong Kong as well. The prices are just higher due to there being a corporate monopoly on land.  >""But it's the truth. If you have the money you can buy it. It's cheap too. The average price in America is around $3000 US Dollars per 1 acre of land. Sucks to be y'all. lol""  I find it strange how you call yourself ""an average guy"" but then say $3000 is ""cheap"" and ""a regular guy can pay for it"" when literally the majority of Americans don't even have $1000 in their bank account...

There was never a society that followed any of those authors other than Russia until about 1925. A society following their writings won't be a hellhole. It will be an enmancipated society where the worth of the individual is above everything else, where all economic contradictions have been eradicated and therefore no state or government is needed.  Stalin wasn't a socialist or communist. He was a counterrevoulutionary. You can tell me that I just try to disown the negative consequences of my ideoligy. But it's not me doing that. Read ""A revolution betrayed"" by Trotzki and you will understand that Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot and many others weren't socialist or communist in the slightest but used the name of a popular ideoligy (in the case of Russia the ruling ideology) and removed every single key feature of it.  Lenin tryed to warn Russia about Stalin before his death and Trotzki was exiled and killed by Stalin. They weren't on the same political page. They were on opposing sides. The one winning the fight simply used the name of the other side to not have to justify contradictions between Marx' and Lenin's writings and teachings and the actual system.  Scandinavian countries aren't socialist by the way. They're social democratic - big difference. Their economic policies don't have to do anything with statistics of sexual crimes. I would tell you a little bit about the actual reasons (if your statistics are right. A source would be useful.) but I can't imagine that you are actually interested in learning how that's working. Otherwise you would have researched yourself and would understand that they have systems that distort the actual number of sexual assault casses.

These Oversea Chinese moved to other countries over the last 100 years. They don't have education or proper skills so what they could do is to open Chinese takeaway shops and supermarkets.  The number of oversea Hongkonger is not very big because most of them emigrated only in the 90s (after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest). These Hongkongers are highly educated and could speak English so they usually work white-collar jobs (especially second generation oversea HKers) But recently the number of Hong Kong people moving oversea is on the rise too because of reasons explained in this video.

There are Chinese people moving overseas nowadays too, but they are mostly moving to developed countries where they can work in white-collar industries. This is especially the case for Hongkongers.  And yes, overseas Chinese are richer than other immigrants because Chinese people have a hunger for success. 1st generation oversea Chinese are willing to sacrifice everything for the successes of their sons and daughters, so 2nd generation Chinese are usually very academically and financially successful.

Here in Germany e.G. we have in the big cities like Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin, Hamburg etc. tonnes of empty houses and apartments owned by private investors while prices are skyrocketing. Thats because these investors earn more money whith 3 apartments for 1.5 times the normal rent while leaving one apartment empty instead of 4 apartments for just the normal rent (you get the concept right).  And all that BECAUSE the government is not involved in there anymore. We ha a social housing program years ago that asured people got affordable appartments but these programs were canceled and the houses were sold years ago.

@ClearOutSamskaras,"Instead of researching the matter and taking some clues (in this very thread and in the video) to serve as a point of departure for your research/investigation, you simply double down on the incorrect position, and make no mistake: it is indeed an incorrect position. Quick videos like this are eye openers, not educations, stuff gets left out that they think is too nuanced or boring.

Doing so bludgeons your capacity for curiosity and learning.

The word Capitalism is not what any SJW or envious poor person wants it to mean on an ad hoc basis.   Also, remarkable is that you could have (at least) looked up the definition of Capitalism from a ruputable and authoritative source BEFORE making a comment, and come to some basic realizations on your own but you did not do that. It would have taken you moments to poke around on an economics website (in this era of thinking the internet is the knowledge messiah, it is not, but that's a separate topic and too large to address any further) and look at the glossary section but this minimal thing you chose not to do; I hope you are not a parent.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Capitalism, as Adam Smith expressed in his ""Wealth of Nations,"" follows the theoretical practice of laissez-faire economics - essentially, ""let-it-be"" economics. In this case, the government is obliged to not interfere in the free market. This agrees with your 'solution' that a government should ""lift the strict regulations on businesses and cut taxes on the rich."" What you fail to grasp is the notion that capitalism only functions with an upper class and a lower class. The upper class will exploit the labors of the lower. This is self-evident: pick up a history textbook and read the genesis of the Industrial Revolution, especially in Great Britain. This disparity of authority is specifically what implored Karl Marx to write ""Das Kapital,"" one of many stepping stones towards the road of socialism. Fundamentally, as the rich get richer, the poor get poorer. The horrors of such a capitalistic climate resulted in the British government to institute socialist policies like mandatory education, regulations, and healthcare.

The fact that that hasn't happened yet shows his argument has serious flaws- and this was something known even back before the dawn of the 20th century.

@Ask_a_Geoist,"Hong Kong's revenue policy is correct, but here are Hong Kong's problems:  1. Their revenue policy doesn't go far enough. Did you notice how in the auctions, the land sold for fixed dollar amounts, and not periodic ones ($x per month)? Those aren't leaseholds. They're 50-year (or 99-year, or whatever) freeholds. There should be no up-front, fixed selling price for land because ""government"" should be leasing out the land at full market rental value.  2. What does the HK government do with the revenue? Does it return it as compensation directly to the people? No. Bad things happen when the government gatekeeps the money supply and makes people work for it. Did you hear the narrator say, ""This is great for the government, but not so much for the people..."" Yeah. This is what we geo-libertarians keep trying to tell people. Without a Residents' Dividend (RD), what the hell is the point of public land rent collection? To make ""government"" -- whoever owns that, because without the RD, the people don't -- better off.  3. Zoning, but this isn't as important as the video implies. Of course, leasehold land title auctions can only cause land use efficiency on land the government allows to be used. This might result in bigger rooms -- temporarily, anyway -- but it won't make people economically better off. The above points -- getting land rent in the hands of the people -- will.   Misconceptions perpetuated by this video:  1. Small living spaces are bad. There is nothing good or bad about them. It's an indication that an area -- in this case, Hong Kong -- is in high demand. When a small location like Hong Kong is put to full, market-demanded use, the result will be small living spaces. If you don't like living in a small space, move out of Hong Kong and make way for a land user who is willing to live in close proximity with other people.  2. Changing Hong Kong's revenue model will accomplish something good. It won't. If you start taxing businesses, they'll start moving out of town, and Hong Kong loses. This is what every other place on Earth does, and right now, everyone goes to Hong Kong. The answer is to keep doing what they do (recurring land title auctions); do it more and better (collect the full rent); and spend the proceeds correctly, returning it as compensation to each resident, directly and equally.

@jef922002,"As a Hong kong citizen, I think there are more reasons behind the ridiculous housing market.  1 - we have 0 inheritance tax (doesn't matter if the property is owned by a company / personnel) - this leads to many wealthy from all over the world buying properties in Hong Kong as a way to pass on their wealth onto their next generation.  2 - For the last 10 years or so, Hong Kong has super lower interest rate, with the global boom of money supplies, many hot money (from all over the world &/ China has gone into the system)  3 - As part of China (but not really China, since we have our own government, legal & tax system), many Chinese investors feel much safer to have their money 'park here' in Hong Kong instead of China, thus making it a very popular spot for investment.   4 - Except (3), Hong Kong has also been a very popular spot for mainland Chinese to relocate to - since we have much better government benefits and health care system, as well as free education up to year 9. This directly leads to more than 1mil increase in population, where we only had roughly 7mil before 1997, which is a 1/7 increase over 20 years, the rest is really demand and supply of the housing market.  5 - Policy - I agree to the point of which the video makes, however, i do not think it is entirely because they do not want the price down. Hong Kong, as part of China but not so part of China, may seem to have our own system. But in reality, government officials are merely dolls of the China's highest officials. Since Hong Kong has returned to China in 1997, our government has been rubbish. In Hong Kong, we have a saying for Hong Kong's official's culture ""The less you do, the less could go wrong. The more you do, the more could go wrong"" - leading Hong Kong to slowly die out in comparison to other international major cities in the world, not only in the real estate market, but in many aspects, such as healthy care, legal, technology, etc.  I think there are some more reason but imo, these are the main ones.

@gtmc,"Which would you sacrifice?  Green space for building houses? or Houses for green space?   Before you answer, I'd like to enlighten you with some details on each choice. If you choose to sacrifice green space to build houses, environmental NGOs will complain to the government, start protests, and create riots within the city. If you choose to sacrifice houses for green space, citizens will complain about the land problem. The problem is, whichever choice you make, you still *can't win.* If the government got rid of green space to build houses, we'd eventually run out of space again. What do we do? Get rid of more green space! Until there's absolutely no green space, there will be citizens complaining about how the housing prices are still ridiculously high. If the government saved the green spaces for environmental purposes, we'd have no choice but to fill the ocean with land ""填海"" or else people will complain about housing prices. Filling the ocean is not the best idea either. It is costly and drives away precious sea life which live in Hong Kong's surrounding waters. I think the government is trying their best to achieve ""雙贏"" (win-win) solution for the housing problem. For now, there IS no win-win situation. So the government must choose to sacrifice either our green space, our housing space, or our sea life. That is my opinion on this. Thanks for reading this long paragraph.

@eirianerisdare80,"Just a little add-on note - Vox probably didn't have time to cover this point in a 10-minute video but another reason that the prices can keep rising and rising without ever falling significantly is that many of the buyers for new apartments are now not from Hong Kong. Since the vast majority of people in Hong Kong can't afford to buy a new apartment, you'd expect that eventually the price would fall when they get so astronomically expensive that buyer numbers drop - but since there is a never-ceasing influx of wealthy buyers from out of Hong Kong, especially from the mainland, the number of willing and able buyers never drops, no matter how high the price continues to rise.",7년 전,0,

@thomasraahauge5231,"I read a sci fi short story a few years ago. It was published in the late 70ies, and described a dystopic future, where people lived so cramped, that they could barely walk on the street. Most housing units were a few square meters (thus smaller than a parking space) or two slightly larger ""flats"" stacked on top of each others. The land lords were vicious, greedy, corrupt, and prone to even the most horrifying suppression of their tenants.   Little did I realize, that this was becoming true, and worse: even worse. I am so grateful, that I live in a small market town in rural Denmark. I can afford a 74 square meter (800 square feet) two bedroom apartment/flat, and it even comes with fairly cheap district heating, a small supermarket just across the street, three playgrounds, a laundromat, and free parking spaces.   The only (really minute) downside is, that the linoleum flooring in the kitchen is butt ugly, and I have to pay a floor layer out of my own pocket, if I want to replace it. Seriously, it was butt ugly back in the mid 80ies, and it hasn't aged well. But that is all the bad things there are to say about it. Goodness, I feel lucky after watching this.",7년 전,0,

Capitalism also allows for individual ownership of property, not leasing it from the government.

Look at what's happening in all the big metropolis in the world these days, the prices are off the roof! Cities that are doing better in providing housing are primarily because there's government intervention or extensive projects to build public housing or housing for the masses.

First... capitalism in the rest of their system did not cause the government to choose to own the land as their source of revenue generation. There are other options to generate revenue that does not require Government full ownership of land... thus the capitalist success in the rest of the system is not at fault.  And the government also chose to regulate housing... for their financial gain, through controlling the market... rather than letting Free Market supply and demand naturally regulate the market to what is actually fair. Thinking that, when given the opportunity, government will choose to be selfless and fair... that is foolish thinking. That is what every proponent of Socialism says... when they speak about the Socialist system failure... they merely say that they didn't do it right... if done right Socialism would work great.

But evolution from ameba to human is ridiculously improbable if it just develops by chance (said my PhD-biologist friend and I as a mathematician would confirm it). There are plenty of example that show evidence for a creator. Just Google non-reducable form (I think this is the correct expression). Or Google the Cambrian explosion, which evolutionists have not found a good explanation for. Evolution doesn't prove the non-existence of God. Actually I think, the genius mechanism of evolution is a great evidence for God. It's always a question of your perspective - whether you want to see it or not.

So long as the place is kept nice and not a danger to people or the environment. This isn't a problem with the market it is a problem that the government is IMPOSING on the Hong Kong capitalist market. Everyone also wants to flee communist China for the more capitalist Hong Kong and are just weighing their options, horrible housing prices are obviously a better deal for them then any surrounding area without Hong Kong's economic policies.",7년 전,0,

Hong kong's population is 7.437 million. Dividing the useable land to each person, 270,000,000 sq. m divided by 7,437,000 equals 36.3 sq. m per person! Assuming only one third of it is used for residential and the rest is for roads, stores, etc., each person can still have 12.1 sq. m of land! If a family of three live together, they can have 36.3 sq. m house! Then hong kong buildings have around 1 is to 10 floor area ratio. Meaning a 12.1 sq. m lot can have ten house stacked on top of each other so 10 people can live in a 12.1 sq. m lot while still having a 12.1 sq. m room per person making the useable area ten times as big. Now look at all those buildings. I'd assume they are probably more than 50 floors and have around 1000 units each building.

@tirkizs,"You’re right HK’s housing problem isn’t exactly land scarcity. But as you can see from the video, available land for developing housing can be scattered and disconnected from central business districts. Developers have brought land from more rural areas just to stock up their land reserve and wait for the right time to develop. But without adequate infrastructure to support, private developers won’t have the incentive to build housing. There’s been suggestions about how a public private partnership can work, like government providing infrastructural support to unleash the potential of  private land in rural districts. But if you’re familiar with HK politics(which i assume you’re not), public is very sensitive to gov collusion with big businesses, especially these property tycoons. So this suggestion doesn’t garner sufficient public support. Another suggestion is to have the government to resume these private land from property developers to build public housing (there’s a law where gov can take away land if they do it for public purpose and compensate the developers fairly). Yet again this is a tricky thing to do, because it involves challenges against private property right (which HK as a free market take pride in) and what constitutes as a “fair” compensation can result in very huge amount of money, which may not necessarily be the best use of public revenue. So as you can see there’s land in HK, but it’s not a simple matter of mathematic calculations. I have only listed two of the many obstacles for developing housing here, and it’s already complicated enough that the city doesn’t exactly has a solution for",7년 전(수정됨),1,

Of course there is a bigger political incentive behind this - ultimately China want to achieve this so-called ""one hour living circle"", in this way they can completely fuse Hong Kong into China, and use it an excuse to demolish the border between Hong Kong and China early before the promised 50-years of political stabilliy.",7년 전,0,

That's not the right conclusion...The problem identified in the video has nothing to do with markets - the problem is government policy. The zoning policy doesn't make market sense. Yes, the value of a single lease is higher because supply is limited. However, the Hong Kong government would make more money if it simply leased more land. The higher volume and larger demand would make up for the lower margin.",7년 전,0,
@sklarks,"Nice video. Only one thing to remark: ""put the interests of the people above the interests of the market"". That makes no sense. The market IS the people. The current policies are for the interests of the STATE, the people in power. It's only them that can offer protection thru licenses for the new building companies so the companies are able to spend that much money on new land: because the state enforces the limitation on selling new areas, so the investment is protected. The corruption lies in so many land area owned by a government. At least they probably don't lie about common people owning that land, like it happens in the western countries.

It was just 20 years ago that it is usual to see three generations of people living under the same roof together, now, each generation demands and tries to buy their own space, and particularly demands in the core urban areas. This growth in demand far exceeds available lands and what zoning law changes can provide.  Also, another point that makes this a poor research is. There are reasons why the HK Gov't is unable to designate lands in the suburban areas, there are a lot of flat lands are entitled to the descendants of original villagers living in the areas prior to the British took over in 1899, and for the rest of the flat lands, most of them already bought up by major developers in anticipation of zoning changes. So, the HK Gov't is left with two choices, either violated inheritance rights or being accused of channeling profits to friendly developers.",7년 전,0,

As stated in the video, only a minuscule 3.7% of the land is zoned for housing. Sure, 75% of the land on the island is unused, but out of the land that is used, the fraction used for housing is tiny. Running the numbers, residential zones make up <1% of the island. Free up just 1.2% of that unused land and zone it specifically for high-density housing, and you've doubled the housing supply.  If I'm missing something here, someone let me know. Maybe zoning in HK doesn't work how I think it does.",7년 전,0,

They should also have a 2 child max policy and not let too many people come unless there is a trade of people since the island cannot sustain more than it currently is handling. It just doesn't make sense to waste green space unless they can justify a very optimal (BUT HELL NO to cage) living which can be then divested back to green space in a few years when the population gets lower (only incentivise children if it's a negative for more than 2 consecutive years),7년 전(수정됨),0,

@snowmanckh,"Why does Hong Kong have the most unaffordable cost of accommodation? This should be a good question to the UK government! There have been structural problems of land supply shortage in HK due to the  'high-land-price policy'. Before the returning of HK to the mainland China in 1997, HK kept implementing the 'high-land-price' policy so that the cost of governance of HK by the British HK government could be minimized. The government can be benefited from High land price through high tax revenue from land auction and stamp duty. The British HK government actually colluded with a few major real estate developers in HK to monopolize the land market in HK. The government collect high profit tax from the high profit earned by land developers. The high land rent cost is actually a kind of implicit tax on every HK citizen. But ironically, the despicable British HK government kept saying HK is a tax paradise with low tax rate. HK is indeed a tax paradise with simple tax laws if you only regard the explicit tax which can be 'seen' but it is not the whole fact if you also consider the high 'rent'.  All these were time bombs setup by the despicable British government before the returning of HK to the mainland China. And now this high-land-price bomb is hard to be dismantled because major part of the wealth were in the form of real estate for most of the landlord class in HK. Any policy that would lower the land price and move their cheese will have a horrible effect and political risks to the HK government now. So.... Who are brave enough to be this superman??

It would also address the overcrowding problem. Typically, with a market economy you’ll end up with the opposite problem where all of the land is used and the government must set some aside for public use.  The government here is profiting itself, but it also makes the rules. This is not capitalism.",7년 전,5,

Usually, due to current politic situation, most of the public housing are left for the Chinese immigrants. So every year, we may have more than 50000 people to come to Hong Kong. Thirdly, those 75% lands are green lands or country parks which we proud of and adore. In Hong Kong , we have beautiful country sides and they are world famous. That’s why the British didn’t building housing in the there. Also, it provides clear oxygen for so many people everyday. Fourthly, we have browns lands, which are controlled by wealthy people and government. Those lands are suitable to fit thousands of families but the wealthy people doesn’t  want to give in.

@benjaminbuljevic7977,"when my parents and my grandparents lived in ukraine in the 90s, they werent very wealthy they lived in a small apartment on the ground floor i think it was 5 people living in 40m2, that makes 8m2 per person they lived in harkov, at the time the city had 800 000 residents, now its over a million but they rarely fought with their family or even their neighbours,  on the contrary: whenever she could, my grandmother would invite all of her friends in the apartments over her to come eat something and drink a tea ( and maybe some vodka )  it was usual for the guests to bring some food with them, like for example a box of cookies, a salad or some saussage they were basically living like a family, not like people who ""have to get along"" the story was very similar when they came to germany in the 2000s my grandmother, grandfather, my mother and her future husband lived together in a small ""immigrantenheim""  basically germany gave them a place to stay until they learned the language and found work to be able to afford their own place again, they didnt have much space and they lived in the same house with total strangers from diffrent countries just 2 doors away my father also lived in that house, he came with some other people from his country, he didnt know them tho  he only talked serbian but the langauge was rather similar to ukrainian/russian so he and my family understood each other ""good enough"" in this situation, with next to nothing and strangers all around these days in my generation it would be a fierce battle but they had a great time! every day they would bring a table outside and drink tea / try food from their neighbours they basically didnt understand each other but it was enough to say "" come outside were smoking "" my parents say it was great fun and they got along very well  i dont think that could happen again these days ive never seen anything like it.",7년 전,0,

Why do Hong Kong people not move to China  - Most HKers don’t like China, in fact most Chinese don’t like China, that’s why there’s 150 people/day moving from China to Hong Kong, not the reverse. And why don’t they like China? Limited freedom of speech, press, politics, intolerable customs, you name it 2. Why do Hong Kong people not move elsewhere (other than China) - To move to another country, you probably need at least some savings in case you can’t find a job immediately, and not everyone have that amount of savings. And you need to speak the language, tolerate the discrimination, leave your friends and family etc. Life in another country is also not guaranteed to be better 3. Why doesn’t Hong Kong develop more land? - The matter is mainly in the hands of the government. And due to 1. crony capitalism 2. The government officials themselves hold various property, government officials have every incentive to keep to keep the housing prices higher. Not lower",7년 전,177,

And finally real estate prices over the border are rising fast, which limits the incentive to move for poorer HKers.  If there's a Schengen arrangement between HK and China I'll bet you a very substantial amount of HKers will pack up and move north. Freedom and democracy are difficult to justify if HKers living up north has a substantially higher standard of living because of lower house prices. This is also why no one in Ireland or NI wants the return of a hard border with Brexit.

@dixonlai5379,"The housing problem in Hong Kong is a multi-layered problem - and its giving these cage homes (most of which are illegal in one way or another) a chance to thrive. Lets look at the average salary of a person working a graduate job or a low-skilled job. It hovers around the 13000 - 18000 HKD mark. One of those tiny cages cost 2000-3000 HKD to rent. If you're looking at those smaller subdivided apartments - at least double. With poor hygiene, poor maintenance of the flats (look at the collapse of one such building at Ma Tau Wai Road), having to share communal facilities, it is terrible living conditions for the lowest-earners.   The Hong Kong Government advocates that public housing is the best way to solve this problem, whilst staying out of the free-market. They are simply building them way too slow. The average wait for a public housing apartment has gone up to five years. More and more people are applying for them and the queue is getting longer at a rate which the government isn't building fast enough. For a city that has a massive budget surplus, it is disappointing that welfare for one of Hong Kong's biggest social problems isn't the priority for the government. It means that graduates like me have to continue to live with my parents well until my late-twenties (until I start earning enough to move out) and that poorer people are praying that they will be picked for public housing sooner than the five year wait.  Estate prices are now at an all-time high in Hong Kong's history, and with it the government has unsuccessfully tried to implement market controls to stop the inflation by limiting Mainland Chinese investment by implementing tax for short-term sales of property. But it doesn't work because many of the investors choose to hold onto the properties, renting them out at this ridiculous rate and knowing that it will be very profitable in 5/10 years time. My Grandma's apartment which sold two years ago at 10 million HKD, now has a value of 12 million. This is not sustainable and this also further limits the affordability of cheap housing for low-income earners or those relying on government support.   The government is making extremely large amounts of money by leasing land, and such a large part of the economy relies upon estate pricing to remain high - it will seriously damage Hong Kong's economy (as it has done before) if the market crashes.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the market nor the government is doing enough to help the poorer people of Hong Kong, and it's a problem that will likely get worse in the future as they don't have a big incentive to.",7년 전,0,

When I lived up there I found boarding houses where they would take a three-bedroom apartment and subdivided into six bedrooms. That was actually pretty common thing. I also found mobile homes/ trailers where they would subdivide bedrooms and the living rooms into  two bedrooms. They would even frequently make mudrooms, porch, garages and car ports into extra bedrooms. Most places I found that were subdivide like that typically would charge anywhere between $200 a month per bed up to even $700 a month per bed. Some times it was even common to find bunkbeds in these accommodations.  It is also common to find these types of accommodations in  college towns and in vacation beach towns, and not just for vacation rentals. They were mostly rented by single  men with low incomes as a step up from being homeless or having to stay in homeless shelters.  In cities here in the US where I've mostly found these types of accommodations the average studio apartment or 1-bedroom apartment were going for more than $800 a month.",7년 전,0,

The influx has caused residents to move further and further away. Just for some insight the affordable properties at the moment is approximately a 1-1.5 hr drive to the city in minimum traffic, however during mornings and afternoon periods travel times may exceed 2 hrs. The state government of NSW has horridly has spent a large majority of its funds on hopeless projects that actually made no difference on the transit times to and from the city to those places and has also slapped a sky high toll on those roads or you risk a 3 hr commute to work. So the average person who can afford a house has to fork out even more money on transiting to and from work . Also our public transport is hopeless at its best, trains are rarely on time and during rush hour travel prices increase as well. Such for purchasing and owning a home closer to the city when renting would be cheaper and commutes wont be as costly.

It's caused by the fact human beings aren't able to give themselves a minimum set of things to strive for. People are too pragmatic to demand better living conditions. Amsterdam, the Netherlands is a good example of it. It's surrounded by a lot of flat, empty space. The political will is there to build in the empty space (just see the creation of man-made nature, that 6-lane airport called Schiphol and new suburban housing projects). However, two factors are blocking the ease of the housing market; A government that's terrified of urban sprawl as can be seen in their surrounding nations. This would increase crime, the chance of terrorism and losing its purpose for a big chunk of Dutch citizens (not handy when everyone's loyalty is needed under the sea) and with that a lot of tax money. The second factor is the citizens of the Netherlands themselves which just doesn't know better than the status quo, egocentric NIMBYs and the (social-democratic) technocracy sheeple.

As stated in the video, a disproportionate amount of fiscal revenue is based on land (around 70 - 80%) if I’m not wrong, this would account not just the lease but also property tax, rental income, etc. Opening up more land (increasing supply) will significantly depreciate fiscal revenue. It would put pressure on the infamous flat tax system of the region and the governments ability to provide assistance (i.e. public housing). In a roundabout way, I’ve heard people say the reason why they shouldn’t do drastic change is by redistribution through assistance which is ludicrous. Another thing, the lease system incentivise property developer to build luxury housing which is bought for investment purposes (mainly by Mainland), so it’s not just housing that is scarce; it’s affordable housing to be exact.   P.S. IDK if this is TL/DR, but as someone who lived there for four years, I would argue that living condition is damn near unlivable even for government approved minimum dimension, which says something.

It's not that diamonds are that easy to get, it's that they're so valuable they're ridiculously more sought for than their free market value would suggest.
