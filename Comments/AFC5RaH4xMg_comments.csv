@marcello-m1r,"MVP 투표는 1위표 싸움이지 행여 그 선수가 타지 못했다고 곧바로 2위가 타는게 아닙니다. 실제 1위표 경합은 로즈와 르브론이었고, 복합적인 요인으로 1위표는 압도적으로 로즈에게 쏠렸습니다.   이 경우 로즈가 못받아도 2위인 하워드가 받았을거다라는건 맞지 않습니다, 차라리 반론을 제시하려면 하워드 얘기가 아니라 로즈의 임팩트가 원체 압도적이었다로 끝맺음 되어야 합니다.  비슷한 예로 05-06시즌 MVP 2위가 르브론이었는데, 만약 내쉬가 아니었다면 2위인 르브론이 MVP다라는건 어불성설이죠. 실제 내쉬와 1위 경합을 한 (최종적으론 4위) 코비가 타는게 MVP 투표 시스템이고, 1위표가 압도적이라면 2위 이후부터의 순위는 사실상 의미 없습니다. 말씀하신 코비vs폴이나 러스vs하든, 야니스vs하든처럼 1,2위가 또 압도적이라면 3위 이후의 순위 역시도 곧이 곧대로 받아들일게 아니고요.  또다른 예로 사람들이 폴조지의 MVP 3위를 종종 거론하는데, 그 당시 야니스와 하든 두명의 1위표가 압도적이었기에 3위 이후부터의 순위는 의미가 없어져 버립니다. 그냥 최상급 기량을 펼쳤다 정도로 봐야지 MVP 3위이기에 4위보다 잘했고 둘이 없었음 그가 MVP다라는 점 역시 성립이 안됩니다.",2년 전,0,

@sounanjoelkone5745,"If a person with whom you have sinned comes back to you, you will see a dog or a snake in your dream. And if you push that person away, you will see in your dream that you have killed or injured that dog or that snake. Eating a lot in a dream expresses that you are carnal, but eating just enough expresses the attribute of a sin or something else that is not related to a sin. Small waters symbolise the word of God or of the devil, depending on whether they are clean or dirty, whilst great waters are the worldliness or the worries of this world.  Nothing can chase the one who walks according to the Message of the living prophet of his time, for the Angel of God encamps around him. When you are chased or immobilised in your sleep or have sex in your dreams, it means that Satan has power over you and you will go to hell if you die in this state. And deliverance is only in the Message of the living prophet of your time.  🇬🇧#Download: The app ""Prophet Kacou Philippe (Official)"" on Google and App store or https://prophetekacou.en.aptoide.com/app or go to: www.philippekacou.org/en   Contact : Apostle Yanick Aka  +2250757585000",2년 전,0,

He’s been on camera and swarmed over literally thousands of thousands of times, I guarantee he is not thinking about if the camera is on him in these situations he genuinely wanted to be part of the crowd and the shirt thing, and I think it’s cool he seemed to be sitting in a normal area.

@darsanprakash27,"To the person who is reading this, you are precious and valuable even if you don't feel so. Jesus loves you ❤️ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose again on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment for our sins, in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. He saved me from three death traps. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He is able to give you peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. His blood will cleanse us from our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing.  We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. It is appointed for men once to die and after this the judgment. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have a chance to repent till we are alive on this earth. This decision which we make in this present life will decide where we spend our eternity. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. If you humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true, he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.",4년 전,0,

I advise you to contact Herbalist  Kham the caregiver and get cured from your Herpes disease once and forever!, His herbal medicine is the best! trust me, I have no doubt about doctor Kham herbal medicine cause his herbal medicine is so powerful and effective. I’m talking from experience because I was cured from my HSV2 by this great doctor within just two weeks of me using his medication. Forget! about Modern Medicine and Use Herbs, Real medicine comes from the Earth and not from the LAB. For getting rid of your herpes within just two weeks, reach the Herbal doctor on email dr.khamcaregiver@gmail.com or WhatsApp him with his contact info +2348159922297 or +1(717) 455 0305. For more enquiries,     Herbal Doctor KHAM is my lifesaver and i love him so much for getting me cured from my long term genital herpes (HSV2) and i vowed  and promised him that i will keep testifying about him and his good work till my last days on EARTH.

@hypatiusedwards626,Hey! Are you looking to be prominent on Instagram? I've happened to be in need of an effective way to now become famous on the gram for a while now. I managed to develop my brand by using this trouble-free strategy of acquiring followers. I founded a watch company a long time back and my fiancee just eventually left the company on the grounds that we were doing so negatively. I had tested out just about everything until I found this. It managed to get me to over 100k followers and therefore instantly I'm retailing 25 watches on a daily basis and have a truly solid clear profit. I also expanded my private account to over 50k followers and instantly all my pals envy me. It is usually incredible to show it off to the fine ladies that I meet at nyc pubs. I will have to provide help to do it as well as you decided to take a look at my story. Simply pay a visit to the web-site showing on this vid and then enter your trusty old IG username. ➡️ _Just search this here on Youtube_: biginsta5000 (NO SPACES),7년 전,0,

@avooloavoolo7986,Hello! Do you need to be well known on Instagram? I've happened to be interested in a good way to get known on the gram for quite a long time now. I managed to evolve my business by using this effortless strategy of earning followers. I founded a watch company awhile back and my husband in all honesty abandoned the business due to the fact that we were doing so inadequately. I had had a go at every thing until I stumbled onto this. It managed to get me to over 100k followers and as a consequence currently I am offering up 10 wristwatches everyday and have an exceptionally dependable salary. I likewise grew my personal account to over 50k followers and at this point all of my close friends envy me. It's incredible to show it off to the wonderful ladies that I interact with at nyc pubs. I am going to help you do it too since you decided to read my story.

Just when every guy's tongue was scraping the floor.....  Jack stands up and jokingly takes a bow, as if the cheering was for him.   The whole place erupted in laughter !!   The young woman blushed and quietly sat down !

Then decided to join the greatest regular season team ever that was up 3-1 on the cavs and minutes away from winning a championship.

@Miss_Loving,"Dear friends Jesus Christ is ALWAYS WITH YOU! Upon accepting this truth, these 3 words will become like a safety net for you, protecting you from falling into despair. Because we are human, we will always have ups and downs in our life experiences. But the promise of the Presence of our Lord and Savior limits how far down we can go. Sometimes you may feel as if you are in free fall when people or things you had counted on let you down. Yet as soon as you remember that JESUS IS WITH YOU, your perspective changes radically. You can look to Jesus for hope and help. Dear ones, not only is Jesus with you but He will hold you by your right hand, guide you, counsel you, and take you into His Glory. All you have to do is say YES to Him this very moment and receive the promises of his unfathomable love. ❤️❤️❤️ (Zaphaniah 3:17;  John 6:55-59;  Psalms 73:23-26;  Luke 1:37; Ephesians 3:20-21; Psalms 23:1-4;  Ephesians 2:6;  John 14:27;  Matthew 14:28-32;  Matthew 24:30-39;  Matthew 16:27; Psalms 34:17-19;  Deuteronomy 31:6; Isaiah 41:10;  Psalms 86:15;  Romans 8:38-39)",7년 전,0,
