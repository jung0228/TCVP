@Wendoverproductions,"Sorry for doubling up on aviation videos! Normally I wouldn’t do two videos of similar topics back-to-back but the video I was going to do just ended up not being interesting enough so I scrapped the script. I didn’t have time at that point to do a research-intensive video so I decided to do this topic that I already knew a good bit about.   Also I know this is a pretty loose interpretation of economics, but hey, I liked the title.  Also, one clarification on something I realized might be confusing during editing: airlines absolutely had first class in the 60s and 70s. It just wasn’t anything like the long-haul first class’ you see today. It was pretty much like domestic US first class today. The impact of the Concorde was the perceived competition it created for the highest-class of traveller. Some airlines decided to close their first class cabins and not compete while others improved their cabins in order to compete. Lie-flat seats or even angle-flat seats really didn’t become ubiquitous until the last 10-15 years with the demise of the Concorde.  Also, first.",8년 전(수정됨),4.9천,

@decklundy,"What is said in the video doesn`t fit with the conclusion that economy is just there is fill the plane. It is stated that two thirds of the revenue is from classes other than economy. Well that inmplies that economy represents 1 third of revenue i.e. a massive chunk of revenue. I would barter that without that third of revenue most flights would not longer be profitable therefore no longer viable. So the revenue from economy is vital for maintaining the viability of the route.if you just expanded all of the place to be premium, busniess or first class they would not sell all of those seats and would probably reduce the overall revenue of the flight. I would say the data presented supports the conclusion that all the classes of seat play a role in getting the revenue to cross the threshold into profit and the exact ratio of them has probably been optimised to do so",4개월 전,0,

Lets face it, 9-10 ours flying gets tiresome in the last hour, regardless what seat you are in. I was in business class once close to a woman with a screaming baby.

@FirstLast-n5b,"My take is very simple - carriers still making money on economy seats, they do not sell them below the cost. Therefore premium seats and especially so Premium Economy that in nutshell still economy with little bit more space are enormously profitable for carriers. And reason why they cost so much is incredibly simple - it is sheer greediness of majority of passengers that happily flying in sardine class just to save some dollars. Many decades aviation is driven not by comfort, but by price - herd wanna fly for a dollar and searching cheapest tickets without any consideration of aircraft, transit point or carrier. So to fly SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper in business class everyone must stop buying economy and it is never happens because low of the herd.",6개월 전,0,

@jerryrobinson7856,"✅ You’re missing something… Robert Crandall CEO of American Airlines Circa 1990’s had a one page letter to passengers in the onboard AmericanWay Magazine in every seat back.  He justified retredded tires as perfectly safe as new ones, talked about hub and spoke because of bigger planes and justified prop planes for the spokes as they were less maintenance costs.  And In one article he explained the economics of air travel. He said, Yes, they made a lot on First Class and yet, the flight could never exist with frequency convenient to the first class passenger without the passengers in the back creating the economic demand.  The overhead must be paid.   He also explained in some countries it was all first class and very expensive per ticket and perhaps only one flight a day or two.  I.E. The AAmerican model was superior offering more frequent choices and lower costs per seat to the passenger’s.  Today let’s face it, today there are far more self entitled people on board.  Years ago I was on a flight to Nashville and one passenger was totally loaded, drinking a final beer before dragging his sorry ass onto the flight.  He was clearly drunk, but the air crew said nothing and he kept to himself and sat next to his wife and daughter.  Seems the addition of entitlement these days makes for a crude mix of jerks.    Today the reason business class in the US especially are expanding are for two reasons. Business people often work on the flight and needed room and the cramped seating in Coach was too restrictive.  Furthermore the economics of business had eb and flows of economic ups and downs.  Bushinesses could justify the Business Class seating more and the very front first class was for top executives, especially on trips greater than three hours.   Another issue occurred. US carriers definition of First Class was really Business Class on upscale airlines about the globe.  This shrank First Class and Business Class grew for people not wanting to be on a ‘packed’ Coach flight, especially for longer flights.  Furthermore many flying first are not paying a dime more.  They have miles built up.  I had over 3 million miles as a business traveler (company credit cards gave a mile for each dollar) and I never paid for first class I elected for long trips.  In fact many trips were free which a business person saved for family vacations.    The problem with this video is that it talks about every seat cost Economics without free travels even considered.  If you look carefully airlines lease all their planes, the cash flow model is often rather bare.  In fact the miles programs are frequently used as financial bowering leverage if you read up.",6개월 전(수정됨),0,

@MyMileageMayVary,"Missing from the analysis is the economics of people who sit in premium classes by means of upgrades or points. I'm sure the airlines themselves have done this analysis but it would be hard, I think, for an outsider to do so because there are so many hidden considerations. First and foremost how many premium seats are actually paid for in full versus how many are gotten by upgrades or points. Let's say some platinum member buys an economy seat and gets upgraded to business class based purely on status. This is basically a cost that the airlines incur because if they didn't ""comp"" this passenger the fear is that this passenger would take their business elsewhere to an airline that would do the upgrade. So to do a proper analysis you'd need a breakdown of how many premium seats are ""comped"" and for those seats how do you assign the indirect income the airline realizes due to these actions.",6개월 전,0,

Airline companies operate in an oligopoly market - so they would have the ability to set prices. They also need to have the ability to segment the market, each having different PED (price elasticity of demand) values. Resale of airline tickets in the dearer market must also not be possible.  For richer people, airline ticket prices make up a smaller proportion of their total income, hence demand for airline tickets is price inelastic, so airline companies will increase the price of airline tickets as this would lead to a less than proportionate change in quantity demanded of airline tickets, causing a rise in total revenue for the airline company. On the other hand, for ordinary people, airline ticket prices make up a larger proportion of their total income, hence demand for airline tickets is price elastic, so airline companies would charge a lower price as this would lead to a more than proportionate change in quantity demanded for the airline company.

It usually costs about half the difference between the two classes if I bought the higher class online initially, sometimes less. If it is more than half, I don't upgrade.  I find the difference here the best in terms of bang for buck. Seats with your own arm rests, much more comfy, more more leg room, unlimited complimentary beverages and the staff is always around to refill.   Fails if the upgrade class is full or is in such high demand (only a couple seats left) that it is not discounted much at the airport. Then I just take prem economy.   Also if you fly internationally for business and your company limits you to economy, typically prem economy is still covered, and the same trick works, I just pay for the upgrade out of pcoket.",2년 전,11,

However on the way back, I had to change at Toronto.  Westjet knew all along, that they do not have business class seats from Toronto to Vancouver, however, they allowed me to book it (also, I spoke to booking clerks in person on the phone and none of them mentioned it either). To add to that, my plane from Gatwick to Toronto was late and I missed the very close run connection at Toronto.  So I had to get on the next plane. There was only economy on that plane.  So Westjet owes me money.  Have I been able to get that money back yet?  No, because it takes them far too long to even get around to it.  AFter all we aren't very important, are we?",3년 전,1,

@henritomic,"Another reason for economy class is that it makes business feel more luxurious, if there was no comparison and no one to feel superior over, a lot of the value of business class comes from that. Like, what’s the point of priority boarding if everyone has it. If business was the new standard then there would be business premium with priority boarding etc.  Also another reason for business class success is middle option bias. Psychologically if there is a cheap option and a premium one we go (of possible) for the middle one, hence if first class is unavailable these people take premium economy rather than business. So in the end to have choices and having high and low end offerings always promotes the middle option - the most lucrative one.",3년 전,0,

If you want the food, drinks and amenities offered in first class then just save your ticket money and go to a top tier restaurant followed by a shopping trip when you arrive. Even the price difference to business class allows you to do this.  Business class on the other hand is often well worth the price if you can afford it. It can be the difference between a stressful flight requiring days of rest to recover from, and a nice experience you can continue straight into your normal routine from.

A medieval king and its peasant? Weren't so polarized. Were like an associate manager and a junior manager.,2년 전(수정됨),22,
@AgnumMD," @sheet-music  I just don't think that claim has much historical merit. The pharaoh and king had say over every aspect of the slave's and peasant's life they were interested in, including ending that life if they chose. The slave and peasant worked their entire short lives with no hope whatsoever of upward mobility. The pharaoh and king were born into wealth, did not labor, and wanted for nothing, at least in terms of amenities of the day, with a gallery of personal servants to wait on them. I'm not saying that the economic divide today isn't significant, but I certainly don't think it is functionally any greater than what they lived through. That being said, so many of the problems that have plagued humanity from its most ancient times have been solved or mitigated in most modern societies, while this one really hasn't seen that much improvement, or has seen significant backsliding from generations when it was somewhat improved. And as such, it stands out to many of us, in a way that it might not have in historical settings. And a slave or peasant wouldn't question, at least openly, whether their king or pharaoh deserved their luxuries. Today the lower rungs are much more educated and most nations don't foster the belief in a divine mandate that allows for such privileges at the top, and so this disparity is noticed and questioned, and appropriately, often resented.",2년 전,133,

I discovered online that it was cheaper to buy a RT to NYC ($350) and a separate RT ticket from NYC to AMS ($400). However, when I tried to buy the two RT tickets the phone agent (2002) kept refusing to sell them that way because, in his words, it was impossible for that to be cheaper than getting a combined ticket. ""A combined ticket will always be cheaper"".  I kept asking for my two RTs (a ten day trip, STL>NYC>NYC>STL with a trip in the middle of the week, NYC>AMS>AMS>NYC),  and going through the process of telling him what I wanted and he repeatedly kept coming back with a price of $1,800. I would pause and ask him to repeat the itinerary to me and he would reveal he again entered STL>NYC>AMS>NYC>STL. Maybe once he entered STL>NYC>AMS>STL.  I explained that he gave me a bunch of One-Way tickets which are almost always more expensive then RTs. After half an hour I hung up, called back, and got another agent.",1년 전,1,

This was about 3 times the economy fare and a great product.  However 3 years later the same ticket is nearly £2000 and nearly 4 times the price of economy.  Therefore I have decided to Fly to New York on Virgin Premium Economy for £812.

Again: Service costs are not the same for every flight regardless of the cabin config you have on your plane (as you have claimed). There is a difference if you pay a staff of 50 people or a staff of 20 people. The amount of staff you need depends on the classes of seats in the cabin. Service costs for a business seat are higher than service costs for a eco seat. The reason for this is that you need more time to service each business seat. And perhaps you even need higher quality personnel, which is more expensive too.  Now I get the point you were trying to make in your initial response (even though you were wrong), but even for that point you just talked way too much.

@shazmeister2005,"Interesting video.  The way I see it first class is disappearing because most (in my experience) first class passengers aren’t paying customers.  A lot of first class travellers on any given flight in my experience are regular business travellers cashing in air miles for a cheap upgrade to treat themselves now and again.  The ticket fare for first class is so expensive that only super wealthy people can afford it, with the super rich getting super richer all the time I think there is actually a decreasing market for this kind of people for airlines, these people fly privately. A lot of business travellers now aren’t allowed to travel business class (unless you are very senior) due to the cost, you’ll get premium economy if your lucky.  The era of all expenses business trips is very much over, it lasted from the 80s probably until around 5-10 years ago.  So basically premium economy is now the real business class, business class is rich people or people lucky enough to work for a company that isn’t solely run by accountants and economy is for everyone else.  Covid / climate change will be the final nail in the coffin, lavish business trips are already a thing of the past, business trips period will be a thing of the past soon. That’s my tuppence worth anyway.  I have to caveat that by saying last time I was on a long haul (couple of months ago) flight all the classes were full so what do I know…",3년 전,8,

@seaninherts,"Indeed. What you are describing is the economic concept of utility. If you filled the plane with only first class, you would not fill the plane. Your 222k example for First would not be sufficient.  I can, if I really wished to, book the more premium tickets, however, I’ve literally booked a London to New York flight - 7 hours 50 minutes and used Amex points plus $417 for two passengers round trip. Essentially, I’d rather have a few thousand dollars more in my pocket at the other end.Business class will be covered by higher end businesses. To each their own - if you are a multi million air, absolutely, first class is great. I’d do it myself if I were a billionaire or a multi, multi millionaire.

Not to mention everything the airline gives people in the higher class sections like really good food and unlimited drinks.  Just adding up a ticket price and the number of seats on a plane really doesn't get close to actual figures.  If anything they probably make more money from economy class by selling expensive drinks and meals which aren't free and marketing to them with credit cards for upgrades and free miles ect.

That might be why tickets cost less.  The smaller planes like the 737 only get 50 mge because of the low numbers of passengers. The 747 and A380 get about 100 and 105 mpge.  This is only if the place is are filled to 100%.  Obviously, at 70% capacity, then mpg drops back to where it was in 2000. However, back then, the average capacity actually was about 72%.  So, move back then was actually between 28-ish and 55-ish mpge.

@A_MOISTER_OYSTER,"Late to the game but some observations from a long time airline pilot (who flew for both US and the other subject airline Etihad)  -Business fare is the cash cow for most airlines, however another caveat is loyalty/mileage programs which have had a profound impact (both good and bad) on ticket pricing and probably deserves its own video. -Future bookings are still a huge part of airline economics, especially now that many carriers have different aircraft that can fly the same route (or the same aircraft with different cabin configurations).  Premium cabins still tend to be booked closer to departure, but steady revenue from economy helps plan with operating expenses. -Speaking of operating expenses, Fuel accounts for 50-60% of any airline’s budget.  In other words half of your ticket price is going into the gas tank. -Weight costs gas.  I’ll say that again, for every extra pound of anything you put on a plane it requires more fuel for that flight.  While gross revenue for 30 business seats may be more than economy, the weight of 120 economy passengers and their baggage costs more in fuel, time, airport ops, etc.   -This is why many airlines have begun unbundling what is included in a ticket price in lower cabins, such as bag fees and cabin service.  Not only is it more expensive to carry extra bags and service options, it is also heavier which means more fuel. -Airlines like Etihad offer a much improved economy class, with better dining, complimentary alcohol, more generous baggage allowance etc. in an effort to gain market share on crowded routes. -Other low cost airlines like Spirit unbundle all of these costs.  They are often maligned because passengers think they are being “cheap” for all the add on charges and fees, but in reality they allow customers to select and pay for what they wish to use.  As in the video, the basic product is going from point A to Point B.  If one passenger just needs a ride, no check luggage, doesn’t care which seat, brings his snacks, and is capable of checking in and has the boarding pass on his phone, he is much cheaper to fly than say a family of four with heavy bags, airport check in, needs to sit together, gate check strollers, slower to board, and generally needs more customer interaction costs more.  In other words it’s a pay-by-the-pound buffet vs. a one price all you can eat. -Space is at a premium onboard, however the maximum number of seats on a plane is a hard limit.  This is not determined by size, but how long it takes to safely evacuate.  Once this number is determined through testing in production, it cannot be exceeded.  With this in mind, very few airlines actually have the maximum number of seats allowed on board.  This is always true if there is a premium cabin.  (For example, the British Airways 777 in the video could carry double the 220 seats) -Ticket prices are not constant.  Unlike the video example, the price can change from day to day.  This can be for so many reasons it hurts my brain, but demand, seats left, and time remaining are just a few.  After 20 years flying much of it still remains a mystery. -Some airlines still augment routes by carrying commercial cargo and mail, but not all.  Even those that do, not every airplane is able to carry cargo. This also changes the economics of a route greatly.  I could go on and on, but the airline business is as complex as it is interesting, and every day I learn something new.",4년 전,0,

@paladinhill,"Well Comrade, I doubt you traveled much in the 1960's and 70's. As an airline employee, I did. RT coach JFK-LAX was $329; first class was $556.  Student and military standby was a lot less as was one week ""excursion"" fares. You could check 2 bags for free, carry on one in the overhead rack and one under the seat for free; all food and non-alcoholic drinks was free in coach; alcohol free in business and first.  Free games for the kids, blankets and piliows for al free; FA;s would give you aspirin or tylenol for free; passed out magazines for free, etc., etc, etc. The competition was based on quality of service and on-time performance.  Airline folks were very courteous, passengers were civil, even cordial, to each other,; altercations were virtually unheard of... except for the occasional drunk businessman.  IT was the Golden Age of Commercial aviation. And the maintenance on the airplanes was top notch, resulting in mostly on time departures except for WX delays. It is unfortunate you never had the chance to experience it as I did, or your attitude would be much different.

Yet people talk about how ""airlines treated you right, and you had more space, better meals, etc. in those days.  Now they pack you in like sardines and give you pretzels.""  What everyone fails to take into account is that the same experience as the 1950s-era is still an option, and in the same adjusted price range - if you want the ""old fashioned"" experience, you have to pay ""old-fashioned"" fares and fly modern First Class!  What people don't appreciate is that Economy classes were ADDED to the business model in order to allow more people the experience of flying.  But the minute those reduced fare passengers get on the plane, instead of being glad they can fly for an affordable fare, they grumble because they have to put up with fewer comforts.

@rockethead7," @simon7790   YOU SAID: ""Both Air France and BA both reported making a profit on Concorde, albeit not huge amounts after the 1970's oil prices rises.""  == Then why did they lose money like crazy and need so many subsidies to stay flying?  Or, did they report profits AFTER the subsidies?  YOU SAID: ""But there were other benefits. Who needed an advertising budget when you had Concorde.""  == I'm not sure what entity you're talking about.  YOU SAID: ""And no I don't mean domestic flights. There are other destinations you can reach in the US from Europe that are not on the east coast, such as the west coast cities,""  == Pfffttt.  Let me get this straight... you think the Concorde had the range to go from London to the west coast of the USA?  Sorry, with a 4,000 mile range, if you're talking about west coast flights, yes, you're talking about domestic flights.  There's no way an international flight was going to get to the west coast.  You obviously don't know what you're talking about.  YOU SAID: ""but if you are not licensed to fly to them it removes your market opportunity.""  == Yes, it's a strange dynamic, such that outside carriers cannot fly domestic, and USA carriers can't fly domestic in other countries, etc.  But, Concorde has/had nothing to do with that dynamic.  That dynamic exists with or without Concorde.  YOU SAID: ""The US government focused on ensuring Boeing had an advantage so closed the market by banning supersonic flight over land.""  == Just Boeing, eh?  Good grief.  What ARE you talking about?  The ban on foreign airlines flying domestic flights has nothing to do with supersonic or not.  And, this is just silly at this point.  If it was the way you're talking about, any number of things could have happened differently.  Boeing (or any USA manufacturer) would have just built supersonic airliners.  Domestic carriers would have just bought Concordes (just like they buy Airbus planes today).  Sheeeesssshhhh.  The ban on supersonic flight is mainly because they don't want sonic booms making all that noise over cities.  YOU SAID: ""Concorde was the first and last iteration of its type,""  == Except for the Soviet version that was actually first, right?  Did you even know they had one before Concorde?  Or, are you just making this up as you go?  Why are you calling the Concorde the first?  YOU SAID: ""no subsequent R&D was done to develop it and improve on it, such as develop more fuel efficient engines, or make a bigger cabin because the real market opportunity was closed to it.""  == Complete and total nonsense.  Utter garbage.  The Soviets didn't continue their Concorde copy either, and not because there was a ""market"" problem.  It was because flying supersonic is an amazing fuel hog, is hard on the equipment, requires far more expensive craft, and doesn't have a market of people willing to pay that much just to save a few hours of time.  Why are you so focused on the US market anyway?  Do you think none of Europe would want supersonic flights?  Do you think none of the Soviet Union wanted supersonic flights?  Do you think flights around Africa or Asia or South America wouldn't benefit from supersonic flights?  Or, hmmmm, is it because it's amazingly expensive to fly supersonic, and there aren't enough people willing to pay THAT level of premium to save a few hours?  Hint: the answer is the latter.  Develop a bigger cabin??  You are BACKWARD.  Bigger cabin = more drag.  More drag = even more expensive to fly supersonic.  They had a hard enough time filling the cabin they had, let alone a bigger one.  And, supersonic flight is not able to achieve the economies of scale in quite the same fashion as subsonic flight.  There are diminishing returns at those high speeds.  That's why the modern development of next gen supersonic airliner development is trying to go SMALLER, not larger.  And, as for more efficient engines, yes, that's always nice, but, I'm afraid there's just not all that much more efficiency to be had, that would make it that much more economical to make a difference in a large enough way to tilt the dynamics in favor of supersonic flight.  Look, there's a reason that nobody in the world has bothered trying to build a new supersonic airliner since the failure of the Soviet supersonic airliner and the Concorde, and it has nothing to do with USA's domestic policies on supersonic flight over land, or protection of Boeing, or anything else you are choosing to make up as you go along.  It's because of the cost of it.  And, yes, I'm aware that your argument is that further development could bring costs down.  And, back in the 1990s, some people were just as delusional about that as you are now, and actually funded a NASA program to try to develop EXACTLY what you're outlining.  The goal was to produce an airliner that would be more efficient, quieter, carry more passengers, and fly at mach 2+.  It failed miserably.  10 years of development yielded nothing.  Why?  Because of physics.  Flying supersonic is very taxing on the airframe, requires exotic and expensive materials, and burns fuel quicker than a meth addict loses brain cells.  This also kind of kills your notion that the USA was opposing supersonic flight, eh?  They spent the entire 1990s trying to see if they could pull off a next-gen airliner to do EXACTLY what you're outlining, but eventually came to the conclusion that it wasn't viable.  YOU SAID: ""The design stayed in the 1960's. Who knows which direction things may have headed if there had been a level playing field and some further development.""  == But, we already know the answer to that.  It ended up in the trash bin!!!  The ""further development"" was scrapped!!!  YOU SAID: ""Maybe there would be room for a more modern passenger supersonic aircraft.""  == Well, there are a couple of companies trying to do exactly that, nowadays.  But, they've scrapped the notion of doing it with a big plane.  They're trying to go small, like 20-50 passengers, max.  They know the market is quite limited for people willing to pay that much of a premium.  And, they know that staying small is the key to burning less fuel at supersonic speeds.  Personally, I'll be honest with you, I don't really think they're even trying.  I think these are probably actually investment scams.  They're raising money, hundreds of millions for development, and, it's quite easy to just have that money evaporate and then just say at the end that they couldn't make it work (pocketing large salaries and whatever else they can siphon along the way).  But, what do I know about it?  Nothing.  Maybe they're making an honest attempt.  I think probably not.  But, hey, maybe.  Will they make it work?  Well, I wouldn't hold my breath, but, at least they have a formula that makes more sense than what you're proposing.",4년 전,0,

Airlines can fly without having business class seats booking but it will not fly with its economy class empty.  So,  Airlines is not only a fight from point A to point B but also works an introductory way.  For example,  If you have booking at x hotel, you get x% discount or if you take x airlines then you get x% in hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions.  What airlines should sell is the ""ease of doing business.""  Imagine me booking a ticket on a plane and I get access to the club which would save me money and club gets a chance to twitching the air traffic to make it come in their doors.

In the early 1960s however Britain was more technically advanced than France, which was eager to gain access to their technical advances. That led to the 2 governments signing a cooperation agreement for the project, without which political cover it's extremely doubtful that the project would have survived its succession of cost and schedule overruns, and as both UK and French governments got what they wanted from entering the agreement, Concorde has to be considered as being a success.",2년 전,0,

China went from under 0.5 billion to 1.4 billion.  Tiny Bangladesh has 20 million more people than Russia, the biggest country on Earth. Heck, it's almost as big as the livable spaces in Africa, yet has 1/10rh as many people as Africa.  That's why African wildlife is all endangered.  It's not hunting, it's agriculture!  Tiny Indonesia has 250 million people, which is as many people as the US would have if the US didn't have 80 million immigrants since 1950.   Half of every country from Mexico to Chile, including Brazil, has multiplied by the same rate as every African nation did since 1950.  They have all multiplied between 5 and 6 times.    The US and Europe haven't even doubled if you subtract immigration.  Gee, I wonder where the immigrants are coming from?  Place that can't stop multiplying.   Just like the rare family in the US with ten kids, they are poor and their kids don't get a good start in life.  Countries are the same.  Ask Greta Tundberg how global warming has reduced crop production in the last 50 years, and why everyone is starving.    Could it be that all non-US and non-Eurooean nation's have added 5 billion people to the planet, living in poverty, and that's why they are starcing?  I saved my lunch money (given to me by my HARD working parents) in high school and sent it to feed the poor, starcimg Africans.  I ate crappy, bleached-white flour bread sandwiches instead of the expensive pizza I could have bought.   What did the Africans do with my money?  They didn't create infrastructure or build houses or make tractors or irrigation , that's for sure.  They made a billion more babies!  Actually, over a billion!  Their life expectancy is much less than the 70 years it took them to make a billion more people. Therefore, they have made almost 2 billion more babies since 1950.

@pabloa2228,"Your video is great but unfortunately the content on this is just not correct. The Concorde did not have the impact you mentioned. In fact the IATA revenue management textbook doesn’t even discuss the Concorde. A couple of things you missed were loyalty programs which arose after the Deregulation Act of 1978. Airlines were subsidized before that by the government. The oil crisis had a much bigger impact on aviation than the Concorde. Airlines measure revenue in PRASM and cost in CASM (or PRASK and CASK) and not on a per seat basis. In fact taking a snap shot in time of a flight is not an accurate representation of the revenue of a flight. A large airline like BA adjust its fairs continuously and any given airline can have 30 or more fare classes. First and Business are not just the on board experience but the entire experience from check in to arrival. Connecting traffic and codeshare agreements play a massive role in revenue management. If BA charged 1200 for each economy seat it would never succeed. You also didn’t mention cargo, ancillary revenue, or other methods airlines use improve revenue. There are many successful airlines worldwide that operate single class aircraft without the need for business or first class revenue.

@jctakoma,"I’d quibble on one point: You say the “product” is the flight from A to B. I’d rather argue that, for example with British Airways in your video, the airline is selling four products: economy, premium economy, business, and first. Those four products have bundles of characteristics, and are priced by the bundles. When an airline sells economy tickets at different prices, then it’s closer to the truth to say, as you do, that airlines have figured out how to sell the same product to different people at different prices, though even then, I’d argue that one of the “sticks” in the bundle of a low-price economy ticket is “purchase 30 days in advance subject to a change fee” while the “stick” in the high-price economy ticket is “purchase whenever, change if you like”. But your basic point is very well taken: A biz or first seat today is priced about what all seats were priced in the 60s, so the evolution is in lower costs of operation, permitting the sale of economy tickets today, opening up travel on a large scale. When I was a kid, I could only afford the Greyhound bus from Baton Rouge, LA to Providence, RI to attend school.  I know very few kids who’d do that today, since air travel is so cheap.

For a truly 'academic' analysis, you would need to have examined the 'source' of the purchase of all of the tickets.

@vorong2ru,a lot of misconceptions... rarely even half of business class tickets actually sold... in the majority of flights probably just 20% of business class are occupied - that's why the cost is high to compensate the space on the mostly unsold product...so in reality economy class is a big piece of the profit pie and in most cases it's more profitable vs other classes. There are a few premium flight exceptions tho like Dubai-London etc where business class is always sold out..Also economy class tickets are sold on the different prices depending on the date and category within economy class itself - there is a limited number of very cheap tickets+ some more expensive+some medium rate etc so in the end economy class can generate even more money vs your estimate,5년 전(수정됨),0,
@judye4156,"The video was interesting but has some flaws.   The comprison should be about the actual PROFIT that the companies make from different classes, instead of the ticket price.

To run the special lounges at the airports, provide all the amenities, meals, cutlery, and also for the often empty seats...  Still the net revenue would be bigger for business/first, but the difference would not be as big as the video argues.

Even in a non-stop flight, the longest I can imagine being in one is 12-14 hours and it's not really worthwhile to spend upwards of $10k just so you can be more comfortable during that time--anyone with a shred of common sense would rather opt to spend that money actually at their destination (via more luxurious hotels, food, or experience) or via some other more tangible means (such as buying souvenirs).  The rhetoric for business class is understandable, considering these individuals often need to be presentable even after flights and employers willing to shell out the extra cash to incentivize what might be uncomfortable traveling, but that's it--no sane employer would knowingly purchase a first-class for an employee on a job since it's just so expensive and doesn't benefit them in any way. After all, the company is also there to make money.   And this is just for longer flights, I should mention. I wouldn't be surprised if companies forced employees to accept economy seats for shorter flights (< 6 hours) since even that might be considered luxury compared to ground transportation which can take much longer plus the fact that economy is much cheaper than business still, allowing the company to save money.  What's funny is the airlines who originally thought the concept of first class would work--can THEY see themselves purchasing first-class tickets? Maybe there may be some individuals on special occasions, but gambling on such a niche population seems too big of a risk to be creating multi-million dollar aircrafts without asking themselves this very basic question.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

They're the most economical for my purposes, but they don't really have classes at all. You can pay a premium for an exit row seat (for a little extra leg room) and for boarding priority (the seats are first-come, first-serve, other than the exit-row seats...and I could be misremembering about the exit-row seats being reservable).  My company sends me flying on American, and their domestic flights have economy and business class, only. My company won't shell out for business class for me.

@rodolfolasparri,"Simultaneous belief in Christianity (Judaism 2.0) and the Old Testament/Tenakh, is impressive mental gymnastics. (Christian leaders believe 100% of the Old Testament)  The Old Testament is clear, when Christ/Messiah comes, 1-  He will not be divine 2 - The entire world will worship God, and know he is the only true God...one God, not split into three parts, or gods. 3 - No other entity/being/person, can take the sins away of another aka scape goating.  True acts of repentance are required, and internal repentance too is required .....then God forgives, directly, no belief of/in a saviour required   I'm not claiming belief in either book, rather, what the Old Testament clearly states.  Big picture, I do celebrate a return to the core beliefs of Christianity ... for many who have worshiped the ""false gods"" of unbalanced pleasure, non-accountability, materialism, infidelity, etc.   37th chapter of the Book of Ezekiel.  This prophet, again in which Christians claim 100% validity, clearly teaches that we can recognize the coming of the messiah when all of the following take place:  the resurrection of the dead the building of the final Temple that will stand forever in Jerusalem the universal knowledge of God, and obedience to God are attained the return of the lost tribes (the Northern Kingdom of Israel whom Assyria carried off)  None of the above happened 2000 years ago/ Jesus fulfilled no prophecies Result? Church leaders after the year 100 invented ...""Jesus, The Return"" aka The Second Coming.  The ""Resurrection"" aka human sacrifice, then being brought back alive...was never confirmed. Regardless, it's never foretold, or required by, the Old Testament, which is deemed true by Christians  Ah, to my Black/Negro brothers and sisters.. Islam is not the path ....a religion ""revealed"" to a White pedophile, and owner of Black slaves...the males, castrated. The female Negroes were slaves or sex slaves…whose offspring were murdered at birth if deemed “too Negro”.  Allah be praised? - Regarding Luther: The date of the Night of the Broken Glass/Kristallnacht in Germany in 1938? It was Luther's birthday for a reason.   Bottom line...Mainstream Christianity is Paganism/idol worship...no problem...have at it.  Thor, Zeus, Indian gods, the three Christian gods (ah, and praying to dead men too aka Saints, as Catholics do),..whatever floats one's boat....and leads one to respect oneself and others.  Christian leaders reversed engineered their teachings to fit Old Testament...via a mix of deliberate and mistaken translations...and deliberate misinterpretations.",6년 전,1,

In the Old, belief in God and obeying some basic laws, are the only requirements for non-Jews to ""be saved>   For Jews, they need to follow 613 commandments...many are gender specific...So, less than 613 for men or women...or for those not living around the Temple.  I've no religious, Hebrew, or Ancient Greek training...but...from watching 20 plus debates with Rabbis and Christians...the Christian argument fails every time.

Even on an economy ticket, airlines will charge different amounts to sit in the exact same seat. Airlines sell according to booking classes that dictate the rules and price of a ticket. There are generally 7-9 seats on a booking class. Once these have been filled the next lowest available class that people will book is more expensive.

You can't expect people to believe that (even if your scenario was true and you did that) it is ""normal"" and thats how the 1% got super rich. Most of the rich are rich by inheritance, and their forefathers earned their wealth by questionable means (exploitation, speculating at stockmarkets about vital goods, etc)  What I'm telling you is that you can't possibly earn 1 million, no matter how important the job you do is. The case is that right now there are several people living above and beyond that line, stacking up money that could as well be invested in schools, infrastructure, housing, etc. If you are comfortable with living with that little money more power to you, but I'd say you could build up a sizeable investment with staying below the 1 million line and still participate in society, or if you want to shoot for the stars (and accumulate all that wealth) acknowledge that you don't really need more then 1 mil a year to live comfortably and try to use excess money to better the world around you. Or you can just frame it as ""irresponsible spenders trying to take my money"", which is reductionist, doesen't help to clear up the matter and overall shows no sign of social responsebility.",5년 전,5,

@segevstormlord3713," pine cone , without profit, there wouldn't be airlines. Hatred of profit is hatred of production.   If a man creates far more of a good or service than he needs, and then shares his excess with others, is he to be hated, or lauded? What if we could measure how much somebody was consuming vs. how much they produced and shared? And we allowed others who were producing and sharing to determine the value of what everyone else produces and shares? Wouldn't those who were measured to have shared far more value than they consumed be noble, good people, people who, perhaps, the community owed a bit more to to balance out these scales?  That's what money is, in the end: a measure of how much you've produced and shared, but not consumed. Yes, there are evil people who will engage in nefarious methods to get money without actually producing anything to share, but profit is merely the amount by which others value what you share over the amount it cost you to make it.  Without profit, there's no incentive to improve. The deregulation of the airlines led to affordable economy classes; prior to that, the ""fat greedy"" guys were the only ones who could afford plane tickets at all, and all planes had only economy-class seats (or worse). When the airlines were deregulated and profit was pursued, they found ways to increase the luxury of the common ticket price and lower the economy-class tickets' prices, which increased their profits.   It is pursuit of profit that has led to more comfortable seats on planes, and more affordable tickets for the bulk seats. So your hatred of the ""fat greedy"" guys paying for the bulk of the airfare, and the airlines for pursuing profit, is a hatred for your own ability to afford to fly, and for the increases in the comfort of all who do so.",5년 전,8,

@poppypuppy5372,"I worked on the pricing system for a major international airline. The picture you paint is a simplistic one, and incorrect. For any flight, it would be in the airlines interest to sell all the tickets in advance at the full fare, but that is not what happens. There may be 20 or 30 different ticket classes, each with their own price. The algorithms that determine the number of seats in each class are extremely complex and based on the probability of the seat being sold at a particular price versus the possibility that the seat may remain unsold. In the end it's better to have some revenue for a seat rather than it remain empty (subject to cost recovery for carrying the weight).  The pricing systems are dynamic, and can change the various tickets prices several times daily. As the date of the flight approaches, the possibility of empty seats increases and so ticket prices generally get cheaper. We all are aware of standby tickets, and that it is a lottery as to if they become available. That is a reflection of the ticketing software: if no standby tickets are available, it has worked to optimise the revenue for the airline.  As an aside, very few people pay for first class tickets. In my experience, based on extensive analysis of fares paid, most first class seats were either upgrades from business class, of airline staff. It sends a poor message to see the first class cabin empty.",6년 전(수정됨),31,

@esspro,"Great video. However, missing a key point regarding British Airways and how their frequent flyer program (British Airways Executive Club aka Avios) works. I should know... The vast majority of economy passengers on a trans-Atlantic BA flight are paying for a cash fare. However, many many many of the Business/First class passengers are frequent flyers who are utilising their Avios points (Americans call them frequent flyer miles) to fly in premium classes for no cost (except for taxes). Also, quite often premium classes will be quite empty because nobody really pays the cash fare. Of course premium classes make airlines more money per sqft of plane real estate at the RRP cash fare...  One other big point, British Airways business class has a high demand predominantly because it is based out of London Heathrow Terminal 5 - which means that the entire City of London (i.e. bankers, fund managers, accountants, hedge funders) will book flights out of LHR or LCY on COMPANY MONEY because it is convenient and they want to rack up status points at the expense of their employer. It removes price sensitivity from an already fairly price insensitive bracket. I should know, I once had to fly to Frankfurt and I booked a £700 ECONOMY return ticket because I wanted to fly BA (convenient airport, I had status which gives me lounge access etc) rather than save my company £500 and fly a sub-par airport and airline. Of course if it was my own money... well I would be hugging knees to my ears in row 34.   Also, as a rule of thumb - airlines are not great businesses and don't begrudge them the ticket price which you are almost underpaying for. Airlines are hugely exposed to fuel as their main expense, the price of which they have almost no control over, labour unions, massive capital expenditure on buying planes, and then maintaining them, battling for expensive landing slots at premium airports, prone to unforeseen travel disruptions (volcanoes, terrorism, ATC failures), and more!",6년 전,0,

@kenvererer,"There's a lot that's wrong with this video. For example, ""only six have first class"" trans-atlantic? Yeah, but, Air Canada's BUSINESS CLASS (not first) is basically what anyone would consider first class: lay-flat seat, great food and drink, all that. The distinction between business and first is largely glossed over by travelers, since it only exists on long-haul flights. For the most part, the terms are considered interchangeable by travelers, so much so that (United, for example) some airlines are rebranding international first as something else.  Also, you're not taking into account the weird pricing and awards system that first class became. As much as anything, first/business is about rewarding repeat coach customers with a perk, like a hotel upgrading you to a suite because you stay there a lot. Others yet are awards tickets.

@shinydavidhowell,"One really interesting example of an all-business class flight is BA's Club World London City flights to JFK, which actually use the Concorde flight numbers of BA001-004. Not only do they offer an all-premium experience, but a specific part of that value is that it uses London City Airport, which is far more convenient for many business travellers than Heathrow due to its proximity to both major London business districts. But London City Airport has only a 4,900ft runway and needs a steep approach due to high-rise buildings nearby. How does a transatlantic service operate from City? It uses an Airbus A318, the largest plane that can handle the takeoff at LCY, but it can't do it with a full tank. So it doesn't. It flies to Ireland on low fuel, and then refuels at Shannon Airport - during which time the passengers disembark and go through US immigration preclearance, meaning the flight can then be treated as a domestic flight at JFK even though it isn't. Eastbound, with neither the US security barricade nor handling LCY on a full tank an issue, it's a standard flight apart from using a luxury hotel in the business district as the ""arrivals lounge"" as LCY doesn't have one.  The flight had the misfortune of being launched into the teeth of the Great Recession, but still exists as a single weekdaily service (BA001 westbound, BA002 eastbound).",6년 전,0,

@mwperk02, @neb4587  After reading through this mess of a comments section I feel like putting my very silly opinion here.   What the OP is doing is most likely a crime or at least something he can be fired and sued for. However if this company in question doesn't actually care about these spending habits and isn't willing to press charges that is their decision. I do think what the OP is doing is immoral at the very least that is assuming he isn't lying out his ass anyway. Given that no business or country was mentioned whether or not this action is legally considered theft isn't clear nor is the internal company policies on this subject. So we cannot come to a definitive conclusion on anything.   I see a few likely scenarios here 1. Most likely I think OP is lying here as I don't see any company allowing this. 2. What hes doing is illegal and the company simply isn't requesting proof of ticket purchase or using some kind of internal debit or credit card. and is therefor unaware of the OP's actions 3 The company knows and simply doesn't give a shit for one reason or another.,5년 전,0,

I am reminded of someone who complained that his Ocean Cruise was ruined ""by poor people"". This guy, retired early, often complains that HE is poor. I pointed out that poor people don't go on cruises. They also don't fly on airlines. When working poor can afford to fly, airlines still make money on them. Your video on the Concorde pointed out the empty seats and that is the reason for failure. The working poor are once again, subsidizing idiots willing to part with more money purchasing less value just to be separated ""from idiots*. I wonder if they know that the private jet crowd is lauging at them?",6년 전,2,

@amcoats,"One major flaw in your analysis, most of not all domestic Major Airlines have an associated credit union. Why would an airline need a bank?  That’s because your “tourist” that buy 4 round trip tickets 3 months in advance gives the airline the opportunity to invest that money and make a profit on investment before the cost to operate.  The airline offers a service to collect revenue but it’s not just revenue - cost to operate = profits. Its, revenue (% return on investment) - cost = profits. This is also how airlines can offer lower ticket prices. They say well we need 3% growth, our avg ticket maturity time is 2 months, our avg % return is X, and now we solve for ticket price to be at the growth we desire while being as competitive as possible.",6년 전,0,

FOOD IS NOT SERVED WHILE PLANE IS ON THE GROUND!! which means its served once plane takes off... using this logic we can apply this to statistics that mention that most plane crashes occur very shortly after takeoff! OK? do u understand that now? well statistics also state that when plane crashed, most ppl die of head injuries! ok that makes perfect sense because using this knowledge we can identfy that once plane takes off, food tray carts come out to served the first and business class passengers FIRST! this is at the beginning of the flight after take off which is when the plane is MOST LIKELY GOING TO CRASH YES? so when food served plane is more likely going to crash!!!  (Only for first and business class) NOW we know this we can introduce the statistic of most likey injury resulting in death during a plane crash, which is head injury yes? now, if food is served their is sharp knives and spoons being offered to eat food, and when plane crashes their objects can hurt or CAUSE DEATH to passengers. meaning their is higher chance of death ok?

@robertzeurunkl8401,"Hey, Wendover.  Puzzle me this.    So, I fly often economy.  Well, standby economy because I work for an airline and can fly standby for almost nothing.  Downside is, I can get bumped (and often do) by paying customers.  And as standby, I always board absolutely last.  So, when I board, I have to walk through first class, where those who have dropped $8,000 for a ticket are sitting there watching all the riff-raff (ie, me) file by, looking at them.  Why don't airlines board first class LAST, so they spend more time in the Captain's Lounge, and less time sitting in their first class seat looking at all us poor slobs file by looking at them?  If I was flying first class, I'd like to spend that 45 minute boarding time sipping my gin and tonic in the First Class lounge, and then board last, about ten minutes before block off, and not have to sit there for half an hour watching people lug luggage past me on their way to the back of the plane.

@Curt_Sampson,"Economy class is at the back because that lets the business and first class passengers get out more quickly and conveniently.  That said, having the centre of gravity within a certain range is indeed critical in aircraft; it won't make a difference in how ""smooth"" the flight is, but a CoG too far forward or aft can cause an aircraft to crash. Getting this correct is normally handled by cargo and baggage loading, sometimes fuel loading (including in-flight transfer between tanks), and only after that passenger distribution. But passenger weight is a fairly small fraction of the total aircraft weight, typically not much over 10% even in the worst case of a short all-economy flight.",3년 전,2,

@TheOnePurpleGuy,"Why can't airplanes fly faster? If you look at modern jetliners the answer is because they would tear apart. Why? Because they are designed to fly in the transonic region, not the supersonic (e.g. Concorde). If for example, a Boeing fly's faster than it's max. speed (about 840 km/h // 517 mph) then a couple of sections of the airplane go supersonic which the aircraft is not made to do. And that ultimately ends in disaster. Why don't we build faster planes? The answer is also easy: The economics in short flying faster than the the speed of sound is inefficient and the airlines want a good speed/efficiency ratio, but that is not given with a supersonic airliner (at the time). There are plans to bring back supersonic airliners but they are still looooooong away from being finished.",7년 전,1,

@marcdavis7583,"The first point about Concorde needs to be corrected. It was a making a loss on an operational front due to the oil crises which pushed up fuel costs just as Concorde was being launched. Secondly, the noise meant that over-land flights could not go ahead so they never got any economy of scale in production and maintenance. Separately, the R&D was paid for by UK & France tax payers, not the usual investment by a Boeing, etc. so the cost of the plane never had to be accounted for, otherwise it would have been even more expensive.   Airfares were priced at a premium over standard tickets, but BA realised that the travelers had no idea how much the ticket cost as it was booked by their secretary: tickets were $5k but the passengers thought it was $10k, so BA put the price up and then started to make money.  Later in the life of Concorde, there were special offers, such as London - New York for $3,000 (one-way Concorde, return on 747) which were used to fill empty seats.",7년 전,1,

BUT they cannot. Why? Because there isn’t enough people who can afford their overly inflated first class and business class pricing. Business class is a farce. Charging whatever you want bc the customer doesn’t pay for it and the job they work for does is greedy. At the end of the day it’s the little people who fly. And without those little people and lower fares the airline would go bankrupt. Period. So tell us an actual cost per flight and redo the math.

@mwbgaming28," @linkfreeman1998  the 707 is definitely a primitive beast, but its a tough old bird and I have always wanted to fly on one  They definitely don't build em like they used to, pan am 843 (707-321b) lost almost half the right wing from an engine explosion and landed safely, whereas GOL 1907 (a 737-800EH) sustained very similar damage from a midair collision with a legacy 600 wingtip and immediately went into a death spiral before breaking apart   I suppose you could refit the 707 with more efficient high bypass engines, and modern navigational equipment, but I guess it depends on whether you want the fuel efficiency of the 737-800, or the toughness of the 707, in sure there's a nostalgia market for it   In regard to autopilot systems, I do partially agree that simple is good enough, flying is pretty boring if the computer gets to have all the fun, but the system should be capable of flying and landing the plane just incase both pilots are incapacitated (such as in the case of Helios 522, where the plane was unpressurised and everyone passed out, a modern autopilot system could've landed the plane assuming it was programmed to do so) Airbus has developed their systems such that some people refer to them as flying iPhones, but virtually all modern Airbus planes are capable of flying to their destination, landing, and exiting the runway with nobody at the helm",5년 전,2,

Therefore, Business Class IS First Class...and the airlines are FINALLY catching on, that they have two sections, where in fact, they only need one. As for the rest on the aircraft...wake up, it's just a 'cattle car' to get you somewhere that, within continent, you would probably got there in the same amount of time for less money if you had simply drove, or took the train.

@AMOGLES99,"I'm not convinced by these figures. For example, income is more than just ticket prices. There is also income from things like in-flight duty free or food sales. For example, business class travellers are typically frequent fliers so are less likely to go for any of the special souvenirs. I regularly fly between Zurich and Alicante by Swiss or alternatively Basel and Alicante by Easyjet. On Swiss they give me a drink and a small sandwich for free. I cannot get more, even if I offer to pay for it. On Easyjet I need to pay for all food but there are about 20 pages in the in-flight magazine of food choices I can chose from. I typically spend about 10 CHF for which I get three items: a drink, something hot and something cold. And I won't be hungry for another couple of hours. My estimate is that every second person will buy something. On a flight with say 180 seats, that is 90 people buying something or almost 1000 CHF of revenue. That probably covers all the costs of staffing plus more. I never buy duty free stuff but other people do. Lots of cigarettes, upmarket alcohol and whatnot sold. Probably revenue for that is higher than for food. But again, business travellers are probably not interested. There is only so much whisky or tobacco you can bring home. This is why Easyjet doesn't do business class. Business class passengers occupy more floor space and spend less on food and duty free.  When I fly Swiss, I will buy that something in the airport as I know I cannot survive on their miniature sandwich alone. So Easyjet is abstracting from the income of airport food outlets.  I don't know if airports have understood that yet or are upping charges to compensate. Because Easyjet has been giving Swiss a real battering on that route, Swiss fares are down to about Easyjet level for economy. This leads me to think that Swiss must be losing money on that route. Same fare, fewer seats, less secondary income.  Easyjet also offers SB so people can bypass queues and enjoy business-class style perks within the airport. But once on the plane, all passengers are equal. I think that is also eating into Swiss' business sector, as to be honest, on a short haul flight likethat, business class isn't worth writing home about. Much as I appreciate the style and comfort that Swiss offers, espacially at such low fares, my feeling is that this type of luxury is on borrowed time.",7년 전,3,

The difference between first class and business class isn't just a bit more room. It is also has other advantages as well. Casey Neistat has been showing off (and rightfully so!) these advantages in his videos. pre flight perks, shower time on board.  But these perks advantages are nullified when compared to private jet. And this doesn't mean people own their own planes (John Travolta does, though). But they lease or share private jets. Because you are right it isn't so much about as speed as it is with cost. Thing is though, when you travel with a private plane, you can have speed AND low cost, even more so if you are a very frequent flyer. Like some of the world's top DJs are. And that is the thing with first class. No ones is going to bother with First Class when you can have a private plane just for yourself with other advantages. Like being more flexible to where you travel. Cost maybe more or the less the same.  All in all, in the economy department budget airline companies are taking over with very low pricing. And in the top end private charted airplanes are taking over the First Class area. Leaving... well not much for the traditional airliners.

@DataJack,"While much of this is technically correct, in practice, some of it isn't. For example, I fly often, and due to my status, I am almost always bumped to ""Premium Economy"" or First Class for free. Many of the people around me up there have similar stories. That means that a large percentage of the folks up front paid the lesser coach amount, but enjoyed the First Class experience. Similarly, if you shop around, and buy early, you will pay a fraction of the costs that this video quoted.  And finally, business travelers (who, as you asserted, rarely pay for their own tickets) collect Frequent Flyer miles. In as little as 10 business trips, they can earn a free coach flight in some airlines. So I would say that most of the profit for an airline does come from coach, as many of the up front seating didn't pay up front costs.",7년 전,0,

It ain't all black and white kid! You need to go back and do a bit more homework on this, I'd mark this as a D, ""More effort required"".

@makromizer,"This video propagates the fallacy that premium seats subsidize coach seats. For anyone with some business sense, this notion is simply absurd. Just ask yourself, why are low cost carriers so profitable with their all coach configurations? And why are there almost no all premium aircrafts if these tickets are so much more profitable? The distribution of classes that are found on an aircraft is quite easy to explain. If seat A is more profitable than seat B, an airline will increase the amount of seats of type A and reduce type B, until the demand for type B enables them to charge enough to be equally profitable. There are various reasons that led to the wrongful conclusions in this video. First of all, most numbers are more or less made up. Instead of simply looking at momentary asking prices, one needs to assess the average price of sold tickets. Furthermore load factors play a huge role, which are generally lower in upper class cabins. And marginal cost as well as total operating cost of a given seat needs to be taken into account, which goes way beyond floorspace.",7년 전,33,
@flagship1701e,"You need to rework your economics brother, because it's just plain WRONG.  First off, your plane layout is WAY off-scale.  Below, Ash is correct in that most times, many of the premium seats remain empty.  Then,  although the 3rd class may get discounts of 30-40% off posted rates, first class often get rates at 1/5 the posted rates and often get inflated mileage perks. Then, you add all the addition space allowed on board for ""Premium"" travelers, the FAR better endless anytime food, the FREE LIQUOR, CHAMPAGNE, The ""Premium-Only"" on-board lounge area. The premium-only expanded larger restrooms and showers. Free entertainment (movies, concerts, sporting events) that 3rd class pays for. Then there's the FREE unlimited baggage with free luggage handling services (porters, expedited security) that 3rd class can't get or pays for.  There's the free limo service to and from home.  There's the multi-thousand square foot (at Mega high-rent per square foot) premium boarding areas and lounges with FREE food and Free Liquor and Champagne and movies and newspapers and magazines. The Double and triple mileage (Up to 10X) rewards given to premium passengers. The free cart or shuttle rides for premium passengers to far-out gates. Once you add all this up, the premium passengers get far more value out of airlines and it is the steerage class passengers that deliver the profit to airlines and cruise lines. It's been a well-know fact in the industry for over 150 years that 3rd class makes the profit. On the Titanic, steerage made the company 90% of their profit. I worked for Boeing for many years.  Even in designing and fitting out the planes, the 3rd class is designed for most of the profit per flight, even though most of the expense of interiors is spent on the premium areas.

@puppymcpupster1570," @kay0946   Its probably the lack of detail about certain circumstances being considered an exception that got the ideas already agreed with the be stated. Forgetting to mention these exceptions is common, though. This has a TLDR at the bottom because of my tendency to write monster paragraphs.  I am aware that freeloaders exist, but they shouldn't be confused with the legit poor people that make up a large percentage of those who are homeless. While multiple actions have been done to help lift the poor that are hard workers or stuck in their situation, the problem still persists. (This is not to undermine the actions)  Although law enforcement have been lowering the chance for this to happen, there still exists plenty of people who work hard on end on their jobs only to barely make enough money to supply themselves. Being poor is demanding, and often these people are forced to work hard anyway just to survive, taking any job they find even if it's a minimum wage job, and looking for any way to get food and water while on a low budget. Just trying to live while being poor takes up a substantial amount of time, and if the person is poor enough (perhaps the employer has found a loophole or the employee is ignorant enough not to notice it because there is less of an opportunity to learn about it if they are not aware/interested to learn about the topic within the restrained amount of time or they still weren't accepted into a job), trying to live would take up most of their time. Time, however, is a necessity for getting out of poverty since you need time to time to look for better jobs, time to get an education, time to find cheaper housing, etc. and with being poor taking away much of that time, it makes it harder for them to get out of the poor state.   Additionally, student debt in America makes up the biggest portion of debt compared to the other types individually, and with house and product prices in general is going up to make profit, the cost of living is expensive. It is known that university students often eat ramen because of the little money they have, since they are still trying to pay off their student debt. Now, while student debt is more of a problem for those who are geared toward going to college, these people are often those who care about their education and work for it, wanting to achieve something and are willing to work hard for it. While scholarships do help out with funding, not all of them is qualified for them and scholarships don't open themselves to all these types of people (due to the high cost of college). Plus, getting a degree doesn't guarantee a good job right away, as additional work and time for finding and being accepted into one is needed, and even with scholarships, they are there only to pay for education, not for daily expenses, and daily expenses is a big factor into all this.  The cost of almost everything generally goes up, minimum wage hardly does (there had been efforts to raise it, though). Of course, competition helps keep certain commodities prices low, but inflation rise prices up bit by bit each year. The problem with this, though, is that without minimum wage going up along with it, people who are teetering in the edge of homelessness that are part of these low pay jobs will soon teeter out into the streets once they can't pay to live there anymore. Of course, the person could try to get a raise, but in the case they may have an unsympathetic boss, giving the boss a possible incentive to make them jobless is not looked forward to.  And then there are druggies. Drugs are the alternative for some to make their lives better, but in the end, they make their lives worse. Starting to take drugs is mostly a choice, whether it be because the person is depressed and wanting to get a moment of happiness or from being pressured by social norms, but the chemicals in drugs often turns the brain to makes not taking drugs as hard as holding your breathe for 3 minutes; in fact, several drug addictions are defined as a mental illness in the DSM-5, a book that psychologists use to diagnose mental illnesses. These drugs, often being costly and ruining social relationships and education pursuits, runs many, many into poverty and to homelessness, and while the taker may choose to do the drug, once it's made, it's hard to choose not to do it, and that's a big reason why a push for a high regulation or outright ban of these products are made rather than only telling people to stop using it like people do for unhealthy foods. There are programs to help with drug abuse as there is with poverty, but again, drug addiction also takes up time, both to continue with it and to try to stop it, and it takes a mind of steel or a extremely tragic event to try to stop it by oneself and a community months to years, depending on the person, to help them. Addiction is a hard thing to destroy, and it can be harder if the person's genetic makeup makes addictions stronger.  Homelessness is more often than not a forced life circumstance rather than a choice, but if there is anything I do agree on, it is that poor people shouldn't be given money outright: money could be wasted on drugs or lottery tickets or some unnecessary vanities. I do believe, however, that plain food, educational material, regular appliances, or just tips and awareness should be given instead to increase their time and opportunities to dig themselves out of poverty. Some people may have dug themselves into this stage, but just as many, if not, more, couldn't help it, and they shouldn't be judged for the current stage of life they are in. =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= TLDR; Poverty demands more time, but more time is needed to get out of poverty (to search for a better job, to be knowledgable of ways to get out of poverty, to get an education, etc.) - College education is expensive and time consuming, and while scholarships can help, the problem of poverty is still present. - Inflation makes prices in general rise up, but how much money made from a job doesn't. Asking for a raise can be outweighed by fear of losing the job or involuntary ignorance. - Starting drugs is a choice, but once done, stopping drugs isn't, and that's the problem; it's extremely hard to stop, and depending on the drug, it could rewire the brain to be dependent on it, making it hard to move on with their life. How addicted someone can get varies between person to person. - Freeloaders and poor life choosers are out there, but so are those who forced into it via money + time problems. To help separate helping freeloaders vs helping those who need it, give the food and awareness straight up rather than can-be-spent-on-anything cash. Also don't judge people on current stage of life without knowing context/past (this may not apply to you).  -------  I am aware of the multiple success stories of poor people working hard to get out of poverty, but hard work must also be done to live and the person must be aware of the places to put additional hard work into. While people get lucky within their first few weeks, other don't and take years.  This is not to undermine the chance of those in poverty rising up and out nor the existence of those who don't want to try, but to say that those who are doing it can still be homeless and outside factors can push people into homelessness or leave them stuck in it.",5년 전,2,

@Jonas-cq5ph,"I have to add something to this video, which you left aside completely. On one hand you are basically right: airlines sell flights from point A to point B. But there is much more to it. I work for a major European airline and those are the two main points that were missing in my opinion.  Business Class tickets are much more pricey for a reason:  Weight: Each business Class passenger is allowed to carry 2x8kg pieces of hand luggage + 2x 32kg trolleys in the belly. The weight of the luggage alone is as much as an average person. Also, each business class seat, the immense amount of cutlery, plates, extra (premium) beverages (alcohol in glass- instead of plastic bottles) and extra (premium) food, the space you need inside the galley, more lavatories per passenger, special decorations and so on and so forth. Weight is a major issue in aviation (more weight = more fuel consumption), so there is that.  Extra service: staff costs have a huge impact on the ticket price. Letalone the great variety of exclusive lounges operated by my Arline in many different airports. As a business class passenger you can perform your checkin in person (vs. online checkin only) and with the help of our very kind service staff (and there are lots of them!). Usually Business Class passengers have access to priority security checks at the airport (which the airline pays for as well). Being on board we usually have one Flight Attendant for a max of 12 business class passengers for a more exclusive and restaurant-like service. Arriving at our home base, business Class passengers also have access to a special welcome lounge, where they can (once again) enjoy a variety of food and some exclusive drinks.  In the end, the demand (which we can't complain about) causes big fluctuations in flight prices as well.  Economy Class passengers are NOT there to fill the seats as an airline has a much less sophisticated job to do for an Economy Class passenger. A tourist-class only airline can compete with any other airline out there if done correctly.",7년 전,898,

@janaem.3685,"""A tourist-class only airline can compete with any other airline out there if done correctly."" I was just thinking that I was watching the video. Given the costs to offer business and first class services, and the fact that those seats take up more square footage, I was thinking about the economics of running an economy-class-only trans-Atlantic flight. I know that Southwest airlines, my preferred airline, does that with US domestic flights. The business-class ticket only guarantees your priority boarding and, I think, a security check priority. I'm not sure what their profits are compared to other airlines, but they've been expanding their services to places like Hawaii and DCA. And to me the service quality is better than what you get with United.",6년 전,15,

@dwightlooi,"I call BULLSHIT on premium economy being $2,600 on a flight where economy is $860. This is utter nonsense. Premium economy is a product sold to economy class travels on the notion that for a 30~50% premium they can get more legroom or a little wider seats. It typically involves removing one row out of six and hence costing the airline about 20% more per passenger. By charging 30~50% more it has better profit margins for the airline and remains an affordable and hence attractive option for budget passengers -- especially on longer flights. On a United Airlines SFO-SIN (16 hour flight) the premium economy seats are a $200 upgrade (each way) over the $1300 economy fare -- basically it'll cost you $1700 instead of $1300 if you want a generous 36"" pitch instead of 32"" on the 787-9. On EVA Airways's flight from SFO-TPE (13 hours) the premium economy seats are $1300 round trip vs about $950 for the economy product. These not only have a tad more legroom they are also wider (8 abreast instead of 9 on a 777-300ER).  So, yeah, good luck selling $2600 premium economy on a $860 flight. At $2600 those will not be Premium Economy seats -- those will EMPTY seats!  Now, as far as business class seats are concerned, today's lie flat business class products occupies about 4 times the real estate of economy class seats. They are about 1.5 as wide and about 2.5 times as long, plus the herring bone or staggered arrangements to accommodate the lie flat seats incur some wasted space. So each business class passenger costs 4 economy passengers not counting the premium food, service and staff ratio costs. They sell for about 5 times the price at about $5000 on a flight with $1000 economy seats. Again, slightly better profit margins, but nothing like this misleading video depicts.  You want proof of this? Just go on expedia and check out the ticket prices yourself! Besides, ask yourself this question -- how is it that there are extremely few ""Business Class"" only flights offered by any airline? And, these often fail anyway... remember Singapore Airline's Business only products SIN-LAX and SIN-EWR on the A340-500? They ended up quitting the routes and selling the planes back to Toulouse as part of the agreement to buy A350s.  And, the notion that the ""example"" flight commands high ticket prices because it is a direct flight between two high volume, high demand hubs? That's UTTER RUBBISH. The CHEAPEST fares are those between two big airports! Why? Because there is usually a dozen flights from half a dozen carriers on that route! COMPETITION moron! The most expensive flights are the niche flights between two small airports or long and thin routes between two very far city pairs. Usually there is only one flight and one airline doing it if you don't want to change planes and wait a few hours at the stop over. That is when you command $600 for a 1.5 hour flight. Try Columbus Ohio to Philadelphia (CMH-PHL) that's 1.5 hours and $599 ONE WAY. Look it up! Infrequent regional to regional is the most expensive.  This video is TOTAL BULLSHIT.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@vanaus6801,"Keep in mind, in relation to Airline Revenue; 50.7 billion in Revenue for the 3rd quarter in 2017 In the third quarter, scheduled passenger airlines collected a total of $1.2 billion in baggage fees, 2.7 percent of total operating revenue, and $720.2 million from reservation change fees, 1.6%, (percent), of total operating revenue. 54.5 billion in all of 2017 for Transported Cargo Additionally, you have Mail Transported by Air Carriers into the hundreds of millions each year. Clearly, there are a myriad number of items which bring revenue to an Airline.  Then you have a smidgen, as in only two examples of significant Operating Costs. Certainly, there are many more expenses, like Maintenance, for one more example.  Total operating expenses for all passenger airlines in the third-quarter of 2017 were $39.3 billion, of which fuel costs accounted for $6.8 billion, or 17.3 percent, and labor costs accounted for $13.6 billion, or 34.6 percent.

@klabkebash,"Not so sure about the theory you discuss saying how traditional airlines don't make their money from economy seats. Remember Singapore Airlines tried an all business class flight non stop from EWR to SIN on a A340-500, charged business class fares and ended up losing money and stopped the service. Figure the configuration on a A380 where there's 400+ economy seats vs 80 Business class and 20 First Class. They come out to about the same gross sales if you combine the 2 vs economy, if.... The First and Business class passengers are actually paying full price for those seats. Many times those are upgraded seats or severely discounted or even free from Credit Card Points that are earned. Then you said at the end, economy passengers are just there to fill the seats. If the seats aren't making money as much as business class, then why bother having so many economy seats? Maybe because Airlines know there isn't as much demand to pay full fares for all their business and first class seats. Maybe there's a 50/50 split in those paying full vs discounted / free for business class, and with all that square footage loosing money, they need the economy passengers to take up the slack.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@MS-xz6kh,"You missed the ONLY interesting thing about airline class economics:  Economy class brings the least profit, but the most value to an airline:  ""Everyone in economy is just there to fill the plane."" Is a weirdly toned sentence.  It gives the impression that economy class is being done a favor, and flying for 'free'.  When in reality, if there wasn't the designed to be uncomfortable economy class, there would be no demand for premium/business class, leaving the only slightly more profitable first class.  If economy was more comfortable, which if the other classes didn't exist, it would be, than people wouldn't choose a hypothetical premium/business class.  If only premium/business class existed they couldn't charge as much for them because there would be no advantage to being in them.   So the impression from the video that premium, business and first class allows the economy class to exist, is actually backwards.  The less profitable class creates the demand for the more profitable class- the airline couldn't exist without economy.

@MsJubjubbird, @jupitermars1974  I can only speculate but Concord may have been taking the market of the private jets. Especially in a period of economic downturn where you didn't have to pay the costs of a jet once you'd flown. Jets are one industry hugely dependent on the economy. The concord got you there faster than the technology of jets could offer at the time and you could be seen on the concord. However the collapse of the concord has probably been one of the factors in boosting the private jet market and increasing its advancement.  Private jets are currently doing pretty well. Most users are in Asia or South America.  They are the huge majority of passenger aircraft. People may use them less though than previous owners did because of communication technology and another economic downturn will bite the ever fluctuating industry.,6년 전,0,

Often if you cancel a miles ticket the penalty is much smaller than a restricted business class fare ticket.   But the argument that Economy passengers are there just to fill the plane seems not 100 percent true because I see the airlines advertising to Economy passengers much more than the other classes.  I've never seen many ads targeted to Business and First class passengers.   Emirates for instance keeps advertising how good their economy class is.

@John_Smith__,"Well the ""tourist"" class is not there just to ""fill the plane"". The economy Class is what Justifies the flight since by far most companies are reducing not only the first class as even the business class since say on short flights, lets say less then 4 hours, it makes no sense to spend much more on a business or economy class. It only makes a big difference in longer flights, like trans-Atlantic or longer. there one can notice the higher comfort levels the better space and so on. On short flights, like inside the EU or in the US there is very little business class and even less the rare first class. Makes no sense to pay triple just to fly for 4hours ...  To prove my point it is sufice to say that the Most Profitable companies in Europe are the Low Cost ones, namely the famous RyanAir ... Actually I don't even know if the big irons of airlines are profitable ... including BA, Luftansa, Swiss air, and the like ... the simple point is, there is no way to fill a 250 seat airplane with 120 business and First class ... but all flights with 250 economy/tourist class are filled ...",8년 전,0,

@mike22486,"Remember that the costs are astronomical. An A380 costs approximately $29 000 per hour to run (depending on the cost of fuel across countries). One of the many problems that SAA is experiencing is that they're aircraft are old and, therefore, less fuel efficient than newer aircraft. This has contributed to them reporting a loss of approximately R5 billion in the 2017 financial year. That's only an idea of the running cost of the aircraft. You still have to take in to account cabin crew, pilots, ground staff, runway fees whenever the aircraft lands and overhaul costs. The pilots also eat up a lot of the revenue since they are regulated to fly a maximum number of hours per week resulting in the airlines needing to employ a lot of pilots. After all of this is taken in to account, the profit margin for an airline can be expected to be around 4.5% (depending on the segment of the market that the airline operates in).",7년 전,9,

@DenSanAZ,"Right...just swimming in it. That's why there are now 6 major carriers in the US - all the other carriers - Legacy Carriers (Pan Am, Eastern, TWA, Northwest, Continental, Braniff, US Air, etc) and start-ups from the 80s after deregulation - too many to even start naming - are gone. Either bankrupt or bought out by other carriers (who, in turn, were bought out by other carriers). When the price of a barrel of oil doubled/tripled, that was the downfall of many carriers - they couldn't raise their prices enough to compensate (passengers would simply not fly if Coach class was too expensive - everyone got used to flying for super-cheap when their was mass competition), and I won't even go into fuel hedging during that time. An airline's 2 biggest expenses are fuel and labor. 9-11 was the end of even more carriers. The several days when the US had ALL airlines grounded cost them a fortune, not to mention the huge drop-off in travel once flying restarted, the public was too afraid to fly.  Since the great consolidation period over the past decade, airlines are have slowly been able to return to profitability. However, competition is still fierce. The big US carriers still have low-fare airlines to contend with domestically, they also have a huge amount of competition internationally against some carriers who are backed by their governments/Kings. Additionally, most airlines are updating their fleets to the newest airplanes (wide-body, long haul planes can sell for $300-500 MILLION dollars each), and they are always updating their cabin interiors to match the amenities of other carriers.   It's true that most US airlines ARE again making a profit (and they DO need to make a profit, just as ALL businesses in the world do), but I wouldn't say they're ""swimming in money"". No, I wouldn't say that at all. Not to mention, all it takes is a one penny increase in the price of jet fuel to cost airlines multi-million/billion dollar losses - and it's not so easy as just passing that cost onto passengers. Unless you're wealthy or your company pays your airfare, the majority of coach passengers will choose an airline based on price - which always makes me laugh when people say, ""I'm never flying that airline again!"", because when it comes down to their next vacation, yes, they WILL fly that airline again, even if it's ticket price is $20 less than the next lowest carrier.",7년 전,8,

With most Asian carriers, it is declared that a Flight Attendant's job is in part to look pretty and be attractive for the customers. Girls sign up knowing that it is something they do for a dozen years, get paid well (by local standards) and have to start a second career by their mid-30s. Also, when times are good money is put aside for fleet renewal. In the USA, when times are good, the unions want more money and leaves the airline with just enough to be in the black. When times are bad they go bankrupt from the labor contracts they can no longer afford. Also, the US is a very mature market with stiff competition, low prices and meager margins. If a plane is not flying with an 80% load factor it is probably losing money.

United Airlines, on the other hand, I cannot fathom what their problem is. They nickel and dime you way more than most airlines; they haven't upgraded their planes since the 90s, it seems; and their staff oftentimes seems unhappy for which I blame the airline's payment and benefits plans. The other airlines the OP mentioned (Singapore, Emirates, and Cathay) always seem to be out of my budget, so I can't compare the experience to those.

But it seems like it does it in the other direction, more money to the owner pocket and less to the people. If there is only government driven airlines it would be the same awful experience with no competition. The mixture of both types gives better competition. where the private sector will most likely try to exceed the experience of the government owned if the society is democratic of course. Otherwise on a non democratic society the government driven company would with high possibility use non fair competition methods for their own success. I think it would be something like that.

@Level84,"I travel fairly often for work and vacation and there are a few things in this video I don't agree with. For one, you are assuming all passengers in each class actually paid the full fare for that ticket. I've flown first class a number of times on various airlines and not once have I seen the entire cabin filled. On average, the cabin is MAYBE half full, and of those 6 or so passengers, I'd say only one or two actually paid for the full fare. The others were either bumped from business because of their status or are flying points/miles. Business is generally more full, but still very rarely completely full. Premium economy and economy is where airlines make their money. If first class was such a gold mine for airlines, they wouldn't be trying to phase them out in favor of more econ plus/econ seats...",8년 전,0,

Unless you have money working for you so well that you make a couple hundret thousands a day without moving a finger, absolutely not affordable.

Plus people from all walks of life know flying long-haul sucks. The big incentive for business/first class is a bed. You get that in business class for a fraction of the price for first class.

@nathansmiddy,paying for a seat on a plane is just the same as paying for a bed in a hotel room.  e.g why pay more for 1st class when you can pay less for 3rd class and not only that right you're all getting the same thing.  1: Flying from Point A - Point B 2: The staff and food service are just the same and nothing more. 3: When paying 3x the cost for 1st class you could really keep that money for something more during your holiday or need a good big meal at the airport when you land in case you really need a bite to eat or something to drink or maybe a gift for a friend or family member.  How to compare  Airlines to Hotels for costs?  3d Class seats are cheap but the food and service = the same as a hotel if you were in a 1 - 2-star hotel 2nd Class seats are avg price but food and service = the same if you were in a 4star hotel 1st class seats are higher price but food and service = the sane if you were in a 5-star hotel  The thing with the first class you get more food and drink wow :P but why pay more for that or is the fact you are sitting right next to a doorway waiting to get out first in case something went wrong lmfao,8년 전,9,

However, if there is some control and pilots tend to try nit to die lol, often the plane will skid, or bounce off the ground breaking off the tail, the front often gets demolished, and those near wings often have a fighting chance if not burnt to a crisp, as the fuel is stored in the wings. In my years of watching Mayday, the front is most often TOAST.

@trackmaster152002,"I understand that the amount of money that some people have is exponentially higher than the middle class, but I still can't understand how you can justify paying that much more to have the same flight be nicer. It's only several hours of your life, and you'll probably sleep through most of it anyway. And, if you are really that rich that you're paying nearly $20,000 for the flight, why even fly commercial? I thought that really rich people looked down on people who don't fly in a private jet.   Perhaps this is why, is the video said, the first class section is disappearing. I also think that a pretty significant factor is that corporations are getting much more budget conscience. Not that we're in a failing economy at the moment, but corporations are very profit driven. If they have 10,000 employees, and 1,000 travel on a regular basis for operations, and they see a chance to to save $20,000 a year per traveler, that's $20,000,000 that they've saved that will go to the shareholders, and improving the stock price. Some start-ups that I've seen are frivolous with their travel budgets and end up going broke. Most companies are pretty tight with their travel budget, and the stereotype of the employee booking their own trip and some HR person rubber stamping everything are pretty far from reality.

It would have been nice if you had mentioned cargo because I work in the industry and some flights of some airlines (not going to name drop) only just cover costs with passenger fairs (business/economy) and only make money on the cargo they are carrying. Cargo is where the big dollars are. I have even known some ""not so nice"" airlines to offload passengers baggage so they can take more cargo, if this has happened you would know because there would be a big bunch of people waiting at lost baggage on arrival. Some airlines ship live sheep to Muslim countries and that's the only way they make money, they even block seats at the front of there planes so they can load all the sheep in the foward hold. and also should have mentioned the fact that most airlines don't have 100% load factors, especially during quiet periods of the year where most are lucky to be getting over 80%. most airlines need over 80-90% load factor(so 80-90% of seats sold on every flight) to make profit. which isn't easy, if you have ever been on a flight and there's lots of empty seats then that flight isn't making money.",8년 전,0,

This is just something BA do, they oversell their economy massively... So clearly, it's where the money is at. Also your pricing is way off. A ticket to Tokyo return would go for about 500-1000 depending on the season and business (yes, I once paid for business on that route) is about 3,500 return. It's a much longer flight, so either the Washington flight is an anomaly (i.e. seats are very scarce due to regular travellers) or you're looking at a very weird time period. Like if you try to book a flight in advance or something. Guess what, most flights don't work like this.

Nearly 98% of all air travel costs are subsidized by various levels of local, state, and federal government subsidies.

If airlines had their way, they'd fly only few dozen first and business class passengers without the burden of catering to the ""common"" passenger. They'd be happy to fly fewer passengers and empty planes. But they can't do that or lose that 98% subsidy in infrastructure, technology subsidy, loan guarantees for buying the airplanes, training subsidies, air traffic control, and a whole host of money that airlines extract out of the ""common"" passenger before he evens sets foot in the airport.   All the pricing innovations this video suggests are nothing more than clever manipulation of the economics of the welfare system. Even simple things like security clearance is now subsidized by the ""common"" passenger through government employees and other functions at the airport that airlines don't pay for or pay the full costs.   Then in times of national emergencies we pay again to bail out the airline industry as a whole. Every generation, the entire private investment in airlines industry is injected double or triple the capital from taxes paid for by the the ""common"" passenger. As an investment, airline stocks are some of the most bottom feeders of any stock in the open market. This indicates a lack of return for comparable investment in other transportation systems.  Lastly, the level of subsidy now is so high, that airlines dispense with even common courtesy. Recent videos of abusing passengers is an indication of this entitlement mentality. These things did not start overnight, nor are isolated incidents. They have roots going back to subsidies and free money without proper obligations.  Bottom line, without the 98% subsidy provided by the ""common"" passenger, your plane is grounded.",8년 전,0,

@florianvanderharten7281,"Business class may look empty, but most of the time it is not actually empty. Business class passengers are very likely to not show up to their flight firstly because they probably didn't pay for the seat, their company did. Secondly, as they are business passengers they are quite likely and allowed by the airline to rebook or change their flights around. Business passengers most of the time then may still pay but they might have an earlier meeting or some other unexpected turn of events meaning they actually get on a different flight. This is also why business class fares are actually pretty irrelevant to most BC passengers, because they didn't pay for it and their company can do with a rebooking or another flight in BC, so dropping the fares might not attract EC passengers as it's still a high jump. I personally mostly fly business because I value the extra comfort and rest that you can get while travelling the world.... : )",7년 전,66,

The price is however lower if you take the ticket long before it, and vary depending on the season, day, etc..

It's a bog standard (if not even below par) business class seat and the layout in e.g. a few of their A332 is the same as you see with AY or even LX which are cramped and not very spacious.

You just have to book a month or so in advance and usually make it a 2 leg trip.

@EOTA564,Air NZ gives passengers the option to “bid” for an upgrade in advance of a flight. I don’t know exactly how it works but presumably a number of the highest bidders are selected for an upgrade. We were upgraded to premium economy on a recent flight after bidding only a small fraction of the cost of the actual ticket. I assume that premium economy passengers were allowed to bid for business class tickets.  I have also seen some airlines removing First Class on certain routes perhaps because there is insufficient demand and the fact that competition in the lucrative business class market has driven up the luxuriousness of business class travel. First class has to offer an even higher standard of luxury and there simply won’t be the demand for it on some routes. My premium economy seat on Air NZ was pretty much the equivalent of a business seat of 20 years ago.,7년 전(수정됨),1,

@TedBronson1918,"Wendover Productions !!!!!    How about talking about some of the hidden dangers of flying in cramped spaces like economy class ???  It promotes blood clots and a number of passengers die every year in mid-flight from it.  I haven't flown in decades now because the last 2 or 3 times I did, I ended up in a hospital for blood clots.  The economics is interesting - they've made economy class the Steerage passengers of the air.  To hell with everything except their basic human needs and lock em below if the ship sinks !  Just kidding about the ""lock them below"",  but dead serious about basic human needs.  They do not provide enough space for passengers to fly safe from the possibility of blood clots- no leg room to stretch and you're not allowed out of your seat except for the bathroom.  The last time I flew I stood up to stretch my legs and do a few squats/leg lifts to make sure the blood wasn't just pooling in my legs.  They asked what I was doing, told me to sit down and then acted like I had gone all allahu akbar for not being a good little sheep and staying seated.  They weren't too keen on me citing the blood clot problem in front of other passengers either, when I responded to the stewardess's questions.  How nice of them to endanger people's lives by packing them in like sardines !  Who needs a crash to get killed by flying?  Try doing a video on this subject and maybe it will save someone's life, or even cause changes in the amount of personal space given to economy passengers.

Only time I ever fly 1st class is when someone gave it to me, which I told him I didn't want to do that, that's expensive by he insisted, yes it was military and yes I had crutches, but it was a training injury nothing special, or taking an overbook offer.

@M12Howitzer,"Good video! yet you mix up airline economy and marketing. Airline economy operates based on weight unit \ by distance unit calculations solely, including all amortization costs, returns on investments, running costs, operational costs etc. - try browsing commercial leaflets of new and used airliners and business-jets - they all have one economy figure cost per ton, airlines boil down all thier workflow economy to simple number of price per ton and that's how all airlines all over the world work. Marketing on the other hand, is tool to justify 3/4th empty business class by mass sales of economy class tickets... only charter-flights and low-costers (like Ryanair) manage to get full loads of their economy-seats only fitted aircraft. The same marketing stuff goes for fares and free-cancellation periods in tickets. The same effort (used by each and every airline in the world) is overbooking practice - selling more tickets than seats in airplane. Those all are marketing measures, but all-in-all (and that would be nice to mention in your otherwise great video) the economy of a given flight boils down to cost per ton; routes have annual stats that are well measured over seasons and months of year, so basically the impression of 'airlines can set whatever prices they want' is utterly incorrect.

@MrGusisawesome,"So much bullshit in this video. First of all, Routes from Heathrow to USA are all about frequency and not about filling seats - thats why it can be more expensive - its about attracting commercial business. A lot of flights are half empty - on some, first class is completely empty. Half of BA's revenue comes from COURIER SERVICES. and the next biggest chunk is from economy class passenger fares. 40% of their fleet does not have class differentiation. Premium and Business do not make them significant amounts of money. Its about branding, its about long term customer retention.   N.B. My sister works in Operations at Head Office for BA",8년 전(수정됨),49,
@sabriath,"Technically you are correct, given the assumption of 100% occupancy, but this isn't the case.  The cost associated with flying is say $4,000 per hour of flight, so a 7 hour flight between London and New York would cost the airline roughly $21,000.  Let's round this up to $50,000 just for the sake of argument with additional things.  This means they only need to sell half of their economy seat to make up the cost of the flight in total....and none of the other seats have to be filled.  Now we move onto the sales part of the journey......seats are sold based on the average saturation limit within those class assignments, and first class is usually less.  The reasoning is that it is far easier to upgrade passengers from an overbooked flight for a few extra dollars or flyer mile credits than it is to downgrade someone.  You will usually find that economy class is usually around 110 to 120% sales, premium economy around 120%, business around 100% to 135% and first class is about 70%.  With cancellations in some sections and upgrades in others, you tend to have airlines with a somewhat equal distribution across the plane.....and as long as the plane has at least 30% capacity throughout, you've paid for your flight in costs.  So it's not entirely accurate to state that all airlines want to sell is business class, just because it profits more per square foot.....there's more to it than that.  If they overbook business, then they will have to ""upgrade"" to first class, which is a loss, but they are forced to overbook based on the average of high cancellation rate in business class......so selling that class alone comes with risk, and that's why the cost is higher.",8년 전,0,

@noahkimmel,"If you were based in London, you might want to fly BA - they have more destinations and flight times available. So they charge a premium for that nonstop and that flexibility. If you are based elsewhere and have to connect to your destination, you probably care more about price and schedule that you do if you connect in London or Paris. So the airline has to price more competitively which may mean your whole journey is cheaper than just the london leg of the trip. The airline likely makes money on both situations.  Airlines price based on demand, not cost. They are competing with other airlines for your money.  If they assume they wont fill the plane on local traffic only, then it makes sense to accept the discount if it is still profitable. As the route adds people, the airline can use a bigger plane with a lower cost per seat and exploit economies of scale or become more attractive by offering more flights per day. Most customers wont look at all the combinations, they look at their route and compare prices on the route they desire. So airlines usually get away with it without customers really noticing.",8년 전,1,

@TheUnsafeshooter,"There are some realities that most will not understand when it comes to how airlines run things. As hinted in the video it is all about the numbers in being profitable in the airline business.   Complete occupancy is the goal for any flight and to achieve this booking agents will over book a flight knowing that a percentage will miss their flights either due to missing a connecting flight, or due to simple human error. To keep travelers from killing ticket agents at the gate the agents have a few valuable tools at their disposal. This includes the free perks to hand out for being on the standby list.  This can include upgrades to first class, hotel rooms, meal and drink tickets at the airport.   The longer you wait the more perks you can get if you know how to ask about getting them.  If you are in no rush to get to your final destination you can end up getting a bunch in perks and upgrades even to the point of getting free tickets for your next time to travel . I paid for a direct flight to LAX from BWI to see family out on the west coast.  I was going to stay the summer and ended up in travel hell due to the plane being over booked I got a flight to Colorado out of BWI in business class and ended up in Vegas for a 3 hour standby .  Due to delays I missed my connecting flight from Vegas to LAX and ended up getting a free room for the night and 100 in casino chips. Due to the extra miles, upgrades and other perks I was able to get first class tickets for free on the ride back to BWI.  I ate good on that flight.

For my 7-week ""chase Miku Expo North America"" trip in 2016, the tour I was chasing changed after flights were already booked, forcing me to additional cities. This in turn meant I had to change some of the flights. Some airlines just did it. Others refused to reschedule the flights at all, even though the seats were clearly available. In one particularly bad case, there was one flight where United Airlines refused to reschedule or cancel the flight, so I was forced to simply book another flight and not get on the United one. Later, as I was asking where the rest of my itinerary went, they asked me why I didn't get on the plane. (""Because I wasn't going to that city at that time anymore, you dumb fuck,"" I thought to myself.)

@worldcitizenra,"Actually, not so much socialism. As mentioned in the video, the bulk of the airlines' profit for international flights comes from business class. But a big part of the reason for that huge profit contribution is that economy class passengers cover all or most of the fixed costs and route specific costs of operating the plane. Without that coverage of fixed and route specific costs, the airlines would make a lot less profit from the business class seats.  One way that airlines are trying to squeeze even more profit out of business class is by providing the same general amenities for business class passengers (better food, lay flat seats, comforters, better entertainment systems, and enough space between seats so that if you need to work while in flight you can do that), however, providing those amenities in tightly engineered compressed compartments that have a smaller footprint on the floor. Look at almost any of the recent redesigned business class areas. More business class seats are being jammed in by creating what looks and feels like a Lego blocks stacking system. Business class sections are following the route of apartments in ultra high cost of living cities, such as Hong Kong - very well appointed, but much much smaller room cubes that used to exist in high end residential units. I found this on Emirates and Etihad, for example, in the limited number of times I was able to fly business class on company trips. However, I've seen it on other airlines, as well.  However, even with the additional profits being squeezed from business class, the people in the back of the plane are still making their contribution by covering either all or a significant portion of the basic fixed and route specific costs for the airline.",8년 전,10,

They are simply selling it for more because they are providing more, more space and more services during the flight. It’s most definitely capitalism and certainly not socialism.   It’s no different than me and my buddy going to a restaurant and he orders a burger with a water and I order steak and lobster and some craft beer.

What you should actually do is calculate the earnings /m² of floor space (so take the whole business class, only take the percentage of seats usually taken, divide it by the m² they take up, deduct service/maintenance and capital cost. Then do the same for economy). And not taking the m² of floor space for each individual seat, but also for the space in between, as usually with business and first class, not only are the seats bigger and nicer and everything, but you ""waste"" space in between, because one more just doesn't fit). The net result might be in the same direction (business class making more money than economy), but the numbers will be vastly different, and the net earning ratio will be very different as well. Maybe in the end, the economy might as well mean more revenue, especially factoring in the low demand for business and first class.",8년 전,2,

@dopeintegra83,"I'm sorry, but that is not even close to how airlines price their tickets. First problem is that you are assuming the fact that every seat in a specific class cabin is the same price. This is not true. The second problem is that you are not taking into account the demand for a specific seat, which is how airlines actually price their seats. I'll explain. When a flight is first published for sale it has no seats sold. The airline will already have a few seats set aside for frequent fliers to use their miles or rewards so it can limit the number of free trips, and will also factor in cancellations and no shows. This is why there are sometimes over booked flights. Lets just use 100 economy seats as an example. Since the flight has every seat open the demand is considered low. So lets say 10 people are looking at this flight with 100 available seats, they will be able to purchase at the lowest cost. We'll say $120 one way. As the flight date gets closer 10 more people are looking at the flight now with only 40 seats left. The demand is moderate. If they want the seat they will have to pay, lets say $280 for the one way seat. So now it's only 2 days till take off and 6 people are still looking to fly but there are only 2 seats left. The demand is very high now, so they will have to pay $450 for one of those seats. This is why you notice it is cheaper to purchase farther out. So you bought your tickets 6 months ago for $120 but another person bought theirs 2 days ago for $450 and they are seated right next to you in the exact same seat. Of course this is just an extremely basic explanation and yes all airlines are different. There is a very complex method the airlines uses on when to bump the fares.",8년 전,0,

They are upgraded frequent flyers who paid a much lower fare. Thus the amount of revenue per flight, and the proportions between each cabin, can be quite different than what is shown in this video. However, in sacrificing some revenue on a given flight by giving frequent flyers some perks, airlines are making more money over the long term from passenger loyalty. And I think that's another major reason for the disappearance of first class. You only need a business class to really secure that passenger loyalty.",8년 전,0,

@paulusescariot,"You speak like airlines behave honestly and with integrity. This is very much not the case. The easiest way to demonstrate this is next time you are on an aircraft ask the passenger sitting next to you what they paid for the exact same seat that you bought. Guaranteed in 99% of cases they paid a completely different price with the spread, in some cases, being huge.  There is also the fact that in most cases tickets are cheaper from third party outlets than the airlines themselves, which given that those third party outlets also have to make money, I am afraid makes a mockery of your logical and rationalised arguments over ticket pricing.  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, currently the third largest low cost carrier in Europe is hopefully going to give the industry a long overdue shake up. The average business class tickets generally costs in the region of 5 times that of economy without sacrificing 5 times the floor space. It obviously commands higher profit levels. Norwegian however are now selling Premium Economy seats that are equivalent in space if not luxury to many airline's business class and they are doing this for around 1.6 times the price of a standard economy ticket.  Having experienced both the worst and best seats in international travel it is easy to criticise the levels of luxury offered by Norwegian when compared to a more conventional business class seat, but the truth is you are paying thousands of dollars for that glass of wine before take-off, the presentation of the meal and the fact that staff know your name before you're seated.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@dhruovbhatia5891,"The information you are providing can be misleading. First of all, you are only taking routes across the Atlantic, which are generally really expensive (compared to inland flights) because you can't really do layovers in the middle of the ocean, thus distorting the price, and the cost of the airline to provide the flight. Then you go on to assume that every flight is fully booked and all seats, even the upper class ones, are fully booked. I don't claim to have much experience in flying, but in almost every flight I have been on, the seats in the upper classes (i.e business +) are rarely more than halfway occupied, whereas economy is almost completely booked. Then there's the factor of which countries or cities the flight is between. For example, there is very little demand for anything higher than economy in most flights in Asia, simply because that region is full of middle-income people that want the best deal possible. Hence airlines operating there keep business class sections smaller than most planes in Europe. People in Europe/North America are more willing to splurge on a flight for the sake of comfort. There are several other factors, although I don't want to spend too much time on writing this.",8년 전,0,

@boeingb17,"Ticket prices change, so while this is directionally accurate, you can't just add up the ticket prices at a given time and assume they are what's paid.  Also, many premium economy, business class, and first class seats are filled by frequent flier upgrades.  Effectively selling those better seats at the same cost as an economy ticket.  Tickets are discounted early, and go up drastically the closer you get to travel date.  The term is ""revenue management"" and there are millions invested by airlines in dedicated revenue management departments handling those very prices.  Also, it's a bit misleading to say first class is disappearing.  What airlines may ""call"" first class will probably go away, but business class seats today are far better than what first class tickets used to be.  They just call them business class, when in reality, they are first class.  It's all perception.  Also, it's generally much easier to get a corporation to allow business class travel, but far harder to allow first class travel.  So airlines just change the name.  I'm very glad to see you break it down into a price per square foot, though.  Even though the prices vary by time, it all comes down to real estate and opportunity cost.  How much would you have gotten for that space if it were in a different configuration?  Even then, prices fluctuate by demand, so it's not always the case that a business class seat will bring more revenue than the equivalent space in economy seats.  That just happened to be the case on the flight you looked, at that specific time, without knowing where the airline was on it's over-all booking curve.",8년 전,0,

Domestically, airlines are starting to sell upgrades much more competitively than they used to recognizing that the seats wont fly empty anymore so the old idea of one $1000 ticket vs 10 $100 tickets is now a real tradeoff they discuss. Internationally, the goal is still to push people to pay up.   Premium economy is a great middle ground.

@kye9687,"Ok yes what you are saying is largely true but when passengers are upgraded it's only because not all FC or BC seats were bought so the airline upgrades there loyalty customers because they know these are returning customers and end up spending 10s of thousands of dollars over many years to the airline so they are willing to do that. When passengers of the loyalty programme use miles to upgrade themselves it is the same reason from the airline as they know they are bringing in more money than the one time flyers and will continue to bring money into an airline. Upgrading does also improve an airlines reputation which help attracts more customers and future ""frequent flyers"" this leads to more money. The upgraded seats while they don't earn as much money it's better to upgrade a total of maybe 5 people from BC to FC and 10 or 15 from economy to BC as then there are more seats to sell in economy which is a lot easier to sell last minute which they also end up raising the prices when selling tickets last minute.

It helps large airlines stay profitable but at the end,  the true cost for any airline company is totally dependent on two things - Cost of fuel and taxes .

@rbcoair737,"Fares are much more complicated than that. Like others and you have said there are different fare classes within each cabin (F,A,P) (D, C, J, I) (Y, B, M, V, S, etc.). The biggest matter not discussed and why First Class going is going away is due to airline FFP's. The airlines have a demand to fill their premium cabins they just fill them with their leeches of 1K's, Executive Platinums, Skymiles Medallion. On average about 1/3 of premium cabins are filled with paying customers. The rest go to upgrades from the next class down. Also US carriers (except AA just this year and VX) don't sell their premium economy as a separate fare class. Then there are the award tickets altogether that have yet to be accounted for. If only airline revenue management were that simple but it unfortunately isn't. There are many reasons for airlines getting rid of First Class and most I place ultimate blame on the passenger. They're cheap. Ever since deregulation it's all about the lowest fare not the best service. Airline fares are the only commodity that has deflated in the last 50-60 years of rapid inflation. We are selling airline fares for the same exact dollar amount as we did when the jet age began. That's why passengers have to pay for a bag or to change a ticket or other things that seem appalling to them these days.

@DESOUL3003,"This video has extremely inaccurate and misleading information. It seems like information from the perspective of a bystander that only has superficial information on the matter how this whole system functions, without actually knowing the details.  First of all, you made these calculations based on the fact, that you think that all the tickets in Economy, Premium Economy, Business class and First class cost the same. That is far from the truth. Those 122 seats in Economy, 40 seats in Premium, 48 seats in Business and 14 First class seats, are further divided into booking classes, which will determine the cost of a ticket for that specific class. Once a specific booking class is bought out, or locked out by the airline company - the next booking class costs more, which means that seats within the same class, will have different prices depending on how the airline company wants to handle the case.  In economy, the cheapest seats for British Airlines are marked with G, which will be sometimes marked as Basic Economy, which are even more restricted than Economy seats and do not allow you to bring luggage to check-in. The next seats are for normal economy and range from O class to W in a particular order such as G>O>Q>N>S>V>L>M>K>H>B>Y and then  Premium Economy starts. Then they go from Y to T>E>W>I>R and end there, after which business class starts that might be something along the lines of D>C and then J for First class - if a first class cabin is even available. Not all Aircrafts have first class, only a few specific ones and not even all of the same planes will have first class in them.  The prices for for these booking classes will vary greatly, the lower you go into the available seats.  For example, as i've said with Economy, the cheapest is O, after which the next cheapest is Q , then N and S and so on. Lets say if O class is 674$, then Q after that will cost 724$, after which N is going to be lets say 50$ more and so on and so forth. Usually Q/O share the same price, as does S and N, but for example purpose lets just assume that each booking class is priced differently. The airline decides how many seats are going to be dedicated for every booking class and they will also increase the price for these seats with time, or even make them unavailable in general, the closer it is to departure date, to maximize profits if the flight route is popular. Alternatively they can also add extra seats for a specific booking class and sell it for cheaper if there are too many seats left in the plane.  This booking class different pricing example also applies to both Premium, Business and First class, so the less seats there are in a specific class = the more expensive they are going to be.  You are also very wrong to assume that Economy is not the greater income source, because often times - economy will be booked out but there will be seats remaining in Premium Economy , Business and First class, which means that the airline might even offer free upgrades to passengers from Economy to Premium Economy just to be able to sell more seats in economy which is always in demand - same applies to premium, business class seats and First class Cabins.   All in all, its difficult to determine how much money a flight will bring for a person who doesn't have access to the booking and reservation system of the specific airline, because of how complicated the pricing and booking class system is but i will say, that Economy is definitely a great source of income for the airlines, otherwise there would not be as many seats dedicated to it and free upgrades offered just to sell more economy seats and fill up the plane.  A lot of things will generally affect the price of the flight, and i hope this information will be somewhat useful for people who wonder why last year they were able to travel with the same airline for half the cost in the same class compared to this year.",8년 전,336,

And I think ths video delivers that.",8년 전,39,
@dreamsky018,"That's what I thought.  Something didn't add up when I was watching the video.  If the economy class was just to ""fill"" the plane, then it stands to reason that those needs are not necessary for the airline to make money.  While it is true, on a fully packed flight, the economy class would only contribute to a fraction of the income of the other premium seats, the question becomes how often are all your seats filled?    If on any given flight, 90% of economy is filled, and only 10% of the premium seats are filled, then you can see that the ""gravy"" income doesn't come from the premium seats but rather the economy seats.  Airlines adjust their seats pricing based on the average fill rate of the different seats.  If anything, the economy seats are priced to have the flight make an expected set profit margins based on average fill rate.  Some might even price it to to break even to stay competitive, and the premium seats are basically the profit margins.  Depending on the average fill rate on the premium seats they might use it towards the base expense calculations too to lower the overall price of their tickets to stay competitive.  Think about it, if the economy seats are just to ""fill the plane"" than wouldn't it not make sense that on peak seasons where the airline knows that a great majority of the premium seats will be filled, that the economy seats will be at average or below pricing?  But we all know that's hardly the case.    In fact it would stand to reason that's quite the opposite.  At peak season, the economy pricing easily doubles.  And the premium seats gets filled because of the spill over from the economy.  That's because if you are paying for half the price of the next tier, you are more likely to be willing to pay more just to make the flight and ""fly better"" while your at it.  So no, the economy class is not just to ""fill the plane"" but rather they are a system in place to keep the planes flying and pilots paid, so that when the premium ""aka profit"" seats are filled there's a flight in place already.",8년 전,13,

The difference between actual business class and first class tickets paid does usually not reflect the additional space needed, let alone the need for maintaining a separate cabin and service wrap. Most business travellers are not eligible for first class under their company policies, so first class is mostly for the super rich private travellers, but the competition from private jets in that segment is strong. Airlines end up filling first class seats by upgrading their elite status passengers.  Relative to space used, business class tickets are much more profitable, and THAT's why many airlines are phasing out first class.",8년 전,0,

I know our cargo section was always full (to the point where some goods were left on the tarmac waiting for another flight). There were two flights each week, and each one had a standing order for two large containers of goldfish (in water), with the rest of the cargo consisting of anything someone wanted to book space for a week or so in advance. The seating config was 90% economy and flights were usually less than full.

This doesn't make any sense since only BA and Air France actually had the Concorde and only on one very specific market (Europe to East Coast) so why did other airlines (and other routes) not have the first class? I don't see a very strong relationship between the presence of the Concorde and that of first class products in standard aircraft.  Your video about the 787 vs. the A380 as you admit yourself  is biased towards Boeing, ignoring the A350. But it also advocates for the spoke to spoke model as the future model ignoring how often the 787 is actually used on Hub to spoke (or vice versa) routes quite substantially.

@shhs5853,"6:46 - are you joking?  Three things didn't happen.  One thing happened.  One thing.  It's the last one you noted: deregulation.  Over the history of the United States, nothing has done more, on average, to negatively affect consumers than deregulation.  Sometimes it is great; in many, many, many, many instances, it's just a new way for companies to get away with gouging consumers.  Just look at current airfare rates - gas prices spiked, so airline prices spiked ..... then gas prices steadily declined over the next several years and yet, over that entire time period, airfare rates have remained the same or increased.  The prices have nothing to do with supply and demand or the actual cost of business, instead it's just about ""what can we get away with while no one is looking or telling us what to do.""  It's just like how gas prices go up every winter, so they can ""come down"" in the spring before they ""peak"" in the summer - realistically, the oil supplies never really change, the suppliers just carefully manipulate what's available so that we're paying the most for gas during the two three-month periods when we use it most.   Similarly, you seem to applaud the airlines for providing (and I'm paraphrasing b/c I'm not rewinding to find the exact quote) ""the same experience for less cost"" - except they don't.  I'll concede to your analysis that the higher classes make up the majority of profit, but at the same time, the airlines are consistently downgrading the bottom-tier experience and still profiting wildly.  (As a side note, this regular lowering of the bar certainly increases the incentives to spend more money on the ""profit-bearing"" sections of the plane, arguably further articulating the sectionalization into a statement on privilege and what type of treatment the rich/poor ""deserve."")  A perfect example is a recent consideration by certain airlines to make economy seats into basically fold-down bicycle seats positioned on tavern-style bars.  I'm sorry, but sleeping in a personal two-square meter of space on a reclining, highly padded seat for 20+ hours while being offered multiple decent meals, hot towels, and free drinks is in no way an experience that can be compared to 20+ hours on a bicycle seat with no leg-room, freezer meals, and expensive ass hotel-fridge sized bottles.  They're not offering even remotely similar products - one version is Boss technicians personally installing a state-of-the-art sound system; on the other hand, you have your half-drunk nephew jerry-rigging sixty year old speakers into your ten year old TV without a third of the required wiring.    Realistically, ""economy"" passengers are relegated to the modern version of baggage space while the profits from the other sections of the plane pad the pockets of these companies so they can afford $10+ million CEO salaries and parachutes every other year.  Think I'm wrong?  The CEO of Delta --- DELTA --- DEEEEEELLLLLLTTTTAAAAAA -- the punchline of every shitty airfare joke -- made a little over $9 million in 2015 after considering salary, bonuses, stock options, stock gifts, and other compensation.    Excuse me .. why does the airline need to pocket $1+ million per flight from London to NYC, again?  Oh, that's right, it doesn't ... it's just that the government stopped paying attention, so now even remotely comfortable travel can become a luxury good again  - just like a living wage and retiring before your body physically breaks down.

@mrbear-fo8vd,opqwf not true. most survivable crashes are crash landings where the plane was still somewhat controlled before impact a nose dive into the ground is going to kill everyone even at the back. Let's assume the crash is survivable most likley upon impact the airframe will break up. The section of fuselage between the wings is the strongest area to be sat the front and rear are likely to crumple and disintegrate,8년 전,7,

@mrbear-fo8vd,opqwf most crashes today aren't nose dives they are mostly aircraft overshooting the runway wheels often the collapse and the fuselage can break up. the wings on a commercial jet are connected under the floor by a large structural wing box this gives this section more integrity than front or rear and is more likley to hold together.,8년 전,6,

@mrbear-fo8vd,BariumCobaltNitrog3n  since the 70s? we're not in the 70s 80s 90s now are we? in recent years all types of accident have fallen apart from runway excursions which now make up the vast majority of airline accidents. If you are in a crash TODAY it's most likley going to be a runway excursion in which case you want to be sat in the strongest area of the fuselage. So to sum it up the best place to sit with the best chance to survive the most common type of crash TODAY is between the wings.,8년 전,0,
@BariumCobaltNitrog3n,"Clearly English is not your strong suit. Or aviation. Runway excursions are a type of crash analyzed in the study. They make up 92% of all crashes, when a plane is landing or taking off. Landing is more dangerous than taking off. This is not a recent phenomenon. Here's another study   Ed Galea, a professor and fire safety research group leader at  London's University of Greenwich, found that seating arrangements can help people escape the aircraft safely after the initial impactPublished in 2011, Galea's analysis concluded  that seats close to the rear of the plane and aisle seats were generally safer after analyzing more than 100 plane crashes and interviewing 1,900 survivors.  And another from Time looking at crashes from 1985 to 2011""The analysis found that the seats in the back third of the aircraft had a 32% fatality rate, (less death) compared with 39% in the middle third and 38% in the front third. Looking at row position, we found that the middle seats in the rear of the aircraft had the best outcomes (28% fatality rate). The worst-faring seats were on the aisle in the middle third of the cabin (44% fatality rate)."" So to sum it up the worst place to sit with the worst chance to survive the most common type of crash TODAY is between the wings.",8년 전,1,
@mrbear-fo8vd,BariumCobaltNitrog3n nice ad hominen attack there you do realise that inccorect grammar and spelling do not reflect the validity of one's argument? You can find statistics to show anything. Your study only looked at 100 crashes what type of crash? Could be 99 nose dives and 1 excursion. In that case that would show a bias for rear seat survival. Probably wasn't but 100 crashes is nothing considering the number of variables exist The study also states that people's actions just prior and after impact have more influence than seat position. It even goes to say survivors are often spread around rather than concentrated in one section. Also distance from an exit is a factor. Fact over the wing box is the strongest area least prone to break up. Fact sitting between the wings puts you near to 4 exits. All things that would help in a survivable excursion acident. I work in the Aerospace industry for one of the largest aircraft manufacturers. You point out grammatical errors as if this somehow demonstrates your point.

And not individual crashes but trends. Of course it wasn't 99 nose dives and one excursion, that is statistically impossible. The topic is seat position and the rest of your comment strays from that.

The same ticket was available for $4,000 but we bought it through another Airline as an Economy + Business Upgrade.   Many more customers are using miles.  A ticket to Japan is about $800 Economy or about 30k reward miles.   A business class ticket is 60k reward miles.  So it's about equivalent to $1,600 worth of reward miles.   If you bought that ticket though it's $5k.     Airlines use their premium cabins as a perk to reward their best customers.

If you're flying for business, where 100's of thousands or millions of dollars are at stake, $5k is nothing. If an exec is going to Europe, you figure not ONLY his flight time, but door to door travel. The exec travels to the airport. Gets to the airport 1-1/2 - 2 hours before departure, for check in and boarding. Flight time depends on where flying to and from, let's say 8 hours. Then there is deplaning, getting baggage, getting through customs, getting your ride, then travel to the airport. An 8 hour flight is now 12 hours or more door to door, home/office to hotel. Let's change the scenario a little. The exec does an in/out blast. He/she works at the office all/most of the day, let's say Monday. Drives to the airport and catches a 6pm flight from Chicago. That flight arrives at 8:30 am Tuesday, in London. The exec showers, dresses in fresh clothes and is off to the client/branch office, for an 11 am meeting. The exec does their business and leaves the office at 5 or 6 pm. Maybe they do a business dinner and finally checks in to their hotel at 8 or 9 pm. They get up at 6am in the morning for an 11am flight. They  have breakfast, catch a 1 hour ride to the airport, arrive 2 hours before, check in and finally board. Their flight arrives at 2 pm and get home at 4-5 pm Wednesday. That $5k seat is cheap, to make sure the exec is fresh for the meeting and relatively comfortable for the trip home.

To me, if they would let me pay half of the price of an economy ticket, I would sit in the cargo hold of the plane...with all of the suitcases.  Cut that price in half again,..and I wouldn't even request a chair to sit in. I'd sit on the floor. To me, flying is about getting to the destination. Screw all of the fancy stuff.

Now go and look at the other 99% of airlines on planet earth and assess their cabin spaces and I'm guessing you will find business/first class make up a tiny proportion of the seats sold and don't even come close to the revenue generated from standard economy.

@Dowlphin,"I didn't know there's premuim economy. So far I have only encountered three classes. I've flown intercontinental, but it's also nice to know how much plane class seating is being optimized for a route. What I find absolutely nuts about airline pricing and which seems to be the norm is that merely by wanting to have some flexibility with return date and thus booking one-way flight, you pay way more for that one-way flight than for there and back combined, even if you book much in advance. I'd assume people would book two-way and just not board the return flight. Even the penalty for that seems a good deal. Pay it and just book another two-way in the other direction. The pricing based on classes is, in a way, a socialist aspect inside capitalism - making everybody pay according to their means - high-income passengers paying for low-income to be able to fly and getting a certain comfort bonus. (That's not to say other systems couldn't yield better results.) It's not unlike Kickstarter-funded projects these days. This tiered pricing is also quite common - used in various other areas and very often based on the novelty of a product or service.

The A318 Departs from London City (Much closer to Canary Wharf) with US customs processing in queue-free Ireland. Of course Brexit and London's uncertain future as a financial hub will have an impact on demand.  And For BA World Cargo, it still exists. BA outsourced World Cargo to GSS running dry-leased Atlas Air 747s, with BA crews flying on GSS contracts with lower pay (But a faster career path to Captaincy). GSS closed a few years ago and now BA leases both aircraft and (American) crew from Atlas Air, still carrying the World Cargo colors. Dedicated freighters like the 747-400F are now going out of fashion because the cargo capacity on passenger 777s is so good that it's cheaper to simply chuck cargo onto passenger flights, than to fly dedicated freighters.",8년 전(수정됨),2,

The more airlines expend the LESS profit they earn. That means less income to equity holders in the airline... pensions, medical coverage for workers and the retired or disabled.

You pay for the business/first class so you can rest, and once you land you can immediately proceed with your activity without feeling so tired. Assuming that you need X day of rest after a long flight, you can calculate how much you make money in that X day. If the amount is less than paying for a business class, then yes it is probably a waste of money. But if you make more than that, then it is absolutely worth it.

The statement that a very rich person wouldn't stop and buy an economy seat instead of a premium is false...rich people do fly economy all the time. Same as rich people owning cheap cars and cheap clothes....its all due to tastes and preferences. The only diference is this rich people may take nice vacations several times a year..go wherever they want or spend on something else a median or low income person can't do, because of their lower burget. Some rich people dont give a fork and like to be all cramped in a coach seat...yet they are rich and can buy whatever they want.

@hejamodo,"Nice video, but your'e missing a few reasons why it works like it does. Economy class is of course a result of the airlines recognizing that private travel is a huge market they want a piece of.   If we are talking about network airlines there are much more to a business class ticket than seating onboard.  A few things you need to know first. There is a difference in Cabin class where you find Economy Class, Premium Economy, Business class and First class, it tells you where you will be seated onboard. Then there are the fare classes (price and fare rules) that is indicated on your ticket by a letter, F- first class, C- Business class, Y- economy class. These are the basic IATA fare class codes, but every airline also have their own set of fares and letters to indicate fare class for those tickets.  If you are travelling on business between London and Washington as per your example and buy your round trip ticket with BA in IATA C-class it's not just a nice seat. For instance if you need to rebook that return and BA have no available seats you can use that ticket with another IATA airline without loosing your fare since they are transferable between airlines. Same goes for First class using IATA fares, but as we saw in the film there are not many airlines with first class left. The ticket is valid for 12 months, so if you have an unrestricted business class or first class ticket you can miss your flight without calling ahead, and still use the ticket later. You just call the airline and say, I want to use ticket 125 xxx xxx xxx and they'll book you using that ticket. Try that with your average economy ticket. Not to mention that you can have the ticket refunded if the meeting is cancelled, or reroute to wherever you need to go. The airline recalculates your ticket, reissues and you're on your way  Another thing is that you usually have some form of fast track security and check in and can arrive much later at the airport and doesn't have to stand in line for hours to pass security. And if your'e early you have access to business lounges where you can work, have a bite to eat or read newspapers. If you're travelling First there's even more ground service than that, and I would say that the seat in the plane is nice, but it's the other things that make business men (or women) buy the Business class fare, or First class fare for that matter.",8년 전,1,

Plus you also have to factor in how heavy business/first class seats weigh (those flat beds are much heavier than your recliner in economy class). Airlines also gets significant amount of revenue by carrying cargo in the cargo hold, they will fill up as much cargo if the Maximum take off weight allows. To some extent that is why some airlines use bigger Boeing 777 with plenty of empty seats on 4 hour short routes that can be flown by a Boeing 767/787. A 777 with full cargo and passengers can't fly 18 hour long flights. They have to sacrifice cargo (payload) to carry more fuel/reduce fuel burn.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@Live-Life-Freely,"I'm 39 and I've been flying on international flights since I was 21. I have been doing the same thing since then, because they're long flights, I force myself to stay up the night before my flight, no sleep. It's not that difficult to not sleep.   Like clockwork a few hours before the flight I always get a jolt of energy, possibly nervousness of missing my flight, and this powers me all the way to the time I take my seat onboard. Once I'm settled in, I crash and most times I don't wake up until  we touch down.   I have also been on first class during an international flight. 1st class is highly overrated, the best part of it, is telling people that you're flying 1st class.",8년 전,0,

@danielgrey2994,"I think one variable that you should re-consider is your analysis of square footage.  Because of aisle configurations, looking at only how much space one seat takes up isn't accurate for planning out a plane configuration.  You either need to do a per row basis, or to really get accurate, a per ""set amount of volume analysis"" that can be evenly divided by all fare classes.  As you know, you cannot just pack a plane with seats, but rather aisles are present, and their set up revolves around the type of seating.  Thus, configuring a plane, or comparing revenue per sq ft as you did, would be accurate from a planning and microeconomics perspective.",8년 전,0,

A quick check of international flights reveals the ratios are much lower.  First class (lie flat seat/bed) is 2 to 3 times the cost of economy with a great deal of variability depending on what day of the week.  Maybe if you are searching for flights a couple days before departure time the ratios jump that high? I don't know.  I would argue that for most airlines and most routes that economy is the real money maker, not first class.  Again this could change depending on route and time of year with ratios swinging during heavy demand tourist/travel seasons.",8년 전,0,

@HermannTheGreat,"The Concorde didn't fail.  The quality control engineers and safety supervisors failed it.  It made a ton of money within a few years of it's use, and the only reason it crashed was because of faulty cheap tires that exploded on the runway.  Not only that, but they were warned about the cheap tires that needed to be reinforced due to take-off speeds and forces, but those in control didn't listen and upgrade the tires. The concorde was a great success, but laziness leading to safety in something as simple as a better quality tire is the reason we don't have supersonic flight today.  There are thousands of high level business executives who would gladly be paying $10,000 for a 3-4 hour luxury flight with stratospheric views from London to New York that would be available every single day. 14 hour flight with jetlag and delays vs a guaranteed 3-4 hour flight that's safer at a higher altitude than all other flights and can get an exec to a major destination any day of the week he wants to go across the world.  Easy choice for any huge company exec.",8년 전(수정됨),0,
@brinckau,"HermannTheGreat Then why did British Airways and Air France decide to stop operating the Concorde, if it can be profitable? What you're saying is theoretical, but in practice, two airlines tried and it ended up not being profitable for them. The problem was not only the tires. Other modifications had to be made.  Also, a 3.5 hour flight can be less interesting than a 7 hour flight (it's not 14 hours, by the way, but 7). Because with the 7 hour flight, you can have a bed. You can leave New York at 10pm local time, sleep in the plane, and arrive in Paris at 10am local time. You need to sleep 7 or 8 hours anyway, and it's a waste of time anyway, so why not do it in a plane ? If you leave New York at 5am local time with the Concorde, you will arrive in Paris at 1:30pm. Much later than with a non-supersonic aircraft. If you leave New York at 10pm with the Concorde, you will arrive in Paris at 6:30am, but you will not have slept. So in practice, you can save more time with the 7 hour flight than with the 3.5 hour flight. I've heard that it was one reason why the Concorde became less and less popular and it makes sense.",8년 전,0,

Furthermore, in the future, if that traveler is debating which airline to fly, he might be willing to pay a little more for that airline if he knows there is some chance he might be upgraded.

@MikedieONE,@isiTsotsi this is correct. i once was upgraded into businesclass on a Finnair flight to Tokyo. They told me that they did that because i did buy the ticket very early(like 7 month or so in advance) and they are overbooked in the economy.,8년 전,27,
@kahrpistols,"I don't think it's either. The 787-9 weighs 284,000 lbs at its empty operating weight. Let's say the average American male weighs 190 lbs as is suggested, and let's also assume that the plane is entirely full of American men. The same plane has roughly 120 seats for economy, meaning a total weight of 22,800 lbs in human flesh and 4,800 lbs in carry on luggage. Total weight would be 27,600 lbs, or less than 10% of the total weight of the airplane. I do not think that this would affect the characteristics of the plane overmuch, and a majority of take off accidents involving weight distribution are caused by the payload moving. As people are seated and belted, their weight would not move.   As for the second point, as an economy flyer who was upgraded to first class once from Paris to Newark, I can safely say that I will never buy a first class ticket simply because it's way too expensive. It was a very pleasant experience, but not worth 10x my economy ticket.",8년 전,16,
@hejamodo,"No, not just for weight distribution. But flights are regularly overbooked in economy class. It's based on a calculation on how many will be a no show (late from connecting flight, or just late in general) so that they will leave with a full cabin. Sometimes everyone arrives and there you are with 5 pax more than available economy class seats and they then upgrade five pax to Business class. Upgrades usually goes to the frequent travelers rather than your normal holiday-once-every-three-years traveler. Celebrity's or journalists are also upgraded before average Joe is.   Another reason is equipment change i.e. have to use an aircraft with a different configuration. Then they either pay someone to take a later flight or someone is upgraded.  There has to be enough catering in the class you are upgraded to, otherwise they fly that seat empty.",8년 전,14,
@hejamodo,"Almost. If you have 36 business class seats and only 10 is booked then you order catering for 10. If you upgrade somebody you have to have the catering to go with it, so it's not just a consideration on filling the seats. Usually there is some margin, but not to much since they don't want to toss catering for 26 passengers every one way flight.  And if an upgrade are going to be appreciated you wouldn't want a stale sandwich wrapped in plastic and luke warm coffe when the rest of the cabin eats a steak. So they have to have service for those upgraded.",8년 전,14,

There are very strict rules about the order in which such upgrades are allotted to premium pax at varying levels of ""eliteness"", the fare code basis (price paid), travel companions, and when a pax has checked in.  Many airlines also offer paid upgrades (with $ or miles) up to a point, sometimes right up to the time of boarding, so that pax without status can buy up at less than the cost of an upgraded seat would have been, jumping over status pax who don't pay for complimentary upgrades.  Given all the competition to retain premium tier pax, there re practically no free upgrades anymore to anyone else,  and due to the lrge numbers of premium pax, it is extremely unusual for any space to be available in Business or First.",8년 전,1,

@Kisai_Yuki,"The weight distribution problem is more a factor for Cargo than passengers, and few airline disasters actually involve moving payloads, rather the damage caused to the plane by something in the cargo space catching fire.   Generally airlines just overbook the economy class, knowing that not everyone will make it, and if they have to they will move people to the other classes. This is really only going to happen on direct trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific flights due to the larger planes being configured as such. Most domestic flights (eg Alaska Airlines, Southwest airlines, WestJet) use planes of all one configuration and any first/business-class seats they have are part of the standard plane configuration of the time (see Seat Guru.) So they don't reconfigure the plane on a per-flight route level.",8년 전,2,
@19bootsy68,Jared Jeanotte Airlines try to over book economy...they know that passengers fail to turn up for various reasons. If there are passengers in economy with elite loyalty status with that airline they will be upgrade if the economy cabin is overbooked. The best way for a free upgrade is to travel in premium economy...the reason for this is if economy is overbooked and they need to upgrade non loyalty passengers they will upgrade them to premium economy then upgrade premium economy passenger/passengers to business class. Not all economy passengers will be upgraded...this all depends on the pricing code of that seat he or seat has purchased...there are around 12 price codes for that one seat. If the flight is totally full the airline will ask for volunteers to take later flights either later that day or the next day offering money and a hotel stay if it's a flight the next day. Though this is sometimes difficult when on a codeshare ticket meaning let's say the ticket is booked with Virgin Atlantic but there is a connection flight with Delta. If the Delta flight was cancelled or delayed enough  for you to miss your connection flight with Virgin Atlantic...Delta will not pay for overnight accommodation in a airport hotel since the ticket was booked on a Virgin Atlantic  ticket. I'm a semi regular flyer who uploads some of my many flights on YouTube. I fly in all classes and have had elite status with Emirates where I have been upgraded on a few occasions. They don't upgrade with Youtube volgers...this has only happened to Casey Neistat which was a brilliant move by Emirates to upgrade him from business to first. Casey Neistat generated more views in first class than what Emirates could of ever done on YouTube to showcase their first class products. As for dress sense and cameras on you to gain a upgrade...British Airways used to do it...but I think in general it's not the case with other airlines unless you look a total scruff.,8년 전,2,

If supersonic flight hadn't been banned over land, routes like LA-NY, Perth-Sydey, Moscow-Tokyo would have been possible. The sonic boom was way overrated. In many region population density is ridiculous (take the whole mainland Australia in my Perth-Sydeny) example. And corridors for super sonic flight could have been established, over areas with close to none population.  This routes would than have boosted development of new SST, more efficient ones and with longer range, enabling long trans-oceanic flights...

Their computers have determined when they can squeeze even more money out of us during probable high demand periods and they've learned how to sell a seat to one traveler at one price and the same exact seat (and often a more inferior seat) to the next at double the price.  I've learned to loathe the airlines, hotels, cellular service providers, internet providers, etc... Their service typically is pitiful once they've gotten their money from you!",8년 전,1,

The additional 'Unique Selling Point' (USP) of being the most luxurious/sumptious is the main reason why businesses can add so much value to the provided service/good. Besides, the main reason economy seats are even offered is to be sold at minimum profitability to cover the cost seat/airplane maintenance. That is why they are so cheap as when the seats are vacant, the company will still have to pay expenses to maintain the seats/airplane. To offer a 'marginal' experience is flawed as consumers will more likely just prefer a cheaper or more luxurious flight ticket. Furthermore, it would drastically lower the profitability for the venture so there is no real reason airplane companies should pursue this market segment.",8년 전,11,

So while your idea isn't bad inherently it just doesn't have the demand, you have to remember airlines are running dozens of flights per airport a day, there is no way you're going to be in such a good location that you aren't going to have the frugal AND the 'elite' both missing, they will naturally go to another airline that offers what they seek.",8년 전,2,

Normally I wouldn’t do two videos of similar topics back-to-back but the video I was going to do just ended up not being interesting enough so I scrapped the script. I didn’t have time at that point to do a research-intensive video so I decided to do this topic that I already knew a good bit about.   Also I know this is a pretty loose interpretation of economics, but hey, I liked the title.  Also, one clarification on something I realized might be confusing during editing: airlines absolutely had first class in the 60s and 70s. It just wasn’t anything like the long-haul first class’ you see today. It was pretty much like domestic US first class today. The impact of the Concorde was the perceived competition it created for the highest-class of traveller. Some airlines decided to close their first class cabins and not compete while others improved their cabins in order to compete. Lie-flat seats or even angle-flat seats really didn’t become ubiquitous until the last 10-15 years with the demise of the Concorde.  Also, first.",8년 전(수정됨),4.9천,

That's why they are always trying to put more seats in economy.  If they made money on First or Business, than they would just outfit the plane for these 2 classes.  Some flights First class sections aren't full and some are even upgrades, if that plane even has First class seats.  There are also flights where people get bumped to Business(no extra revenue) and they selling that seat for people on standby.",8년 전,2,
