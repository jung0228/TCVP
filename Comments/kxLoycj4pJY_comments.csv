@funnythief3330,"I know I very much have a fear of needles, especially because I hate getting any kind of blood drawn or shots. I even cried the last time I had my blood drawn and a needle in my forearm. That was for my wisdom teeth removal. I very highly doubt I would ever get a tattoo, but if I did, I would want something meaningful.  I do find it actually very nice and very mentally comforting that this guy was able to feel the needles first without having a tattoo done. I think that if I were to have a tattoo at any point of my life, I would politely ask if I could feel the intensity of the needles first like this guy did so that I can have an understanding of what I’m getting myself into. I hope that if I ever do have that in the future, I will leave updates and give you guys some feedback about how a tattoo works. Especially by the words of someone with a low pain tolerance and a very bad mental issue with needles. I might not even be worked on at all, I don’t know. I will admit that I am undeniably very curious about tattoos and I really wanna know, but I’m just not going to until I find a tattoo I would actually want and it would be meaningful.",2년 전,1,

@TSIRKLAND,"In college I read a book by Pen Jilette (Of Penn & Teller), where he described getting an ink-less tattoo.  The idea being, you could experience what it was like to get a tattoo, you would have the design for a while as the scar, but once the scar healed, with no ink left behind, it would disappear.  That sounded interesting to me, so I tried it.  Went to my local tattoo parlor in the college town where I was, asked them if that was something they could do.  They had not heard of that, but were willing to try.  I got some simple line-work dolphins on my left chest.  It was painful- like getting pinched over and over again- but not terrible.  The design stayed for a while, but the scar healed and faded rather quickly, so after a few weeks you'd never know it was there, and by today 20+ years later, there's nothing but the story.",2년 전,4,

My colleagues have only seen my tattoos for the first time in 5 years of work at the office last summer and they could not believe that I had an entire sleeve full of animals.  There are people like me who have personal tattoos with personal meaning and you have people who just tattoos whatever is trendy and Try to flash em as much as possible.,3년 전,0,

@O_btree,"Regarding the pain.. Your mind will let you build-up or break-down any anticipated experience, based on what you experience/know added with what external information/perspectives you are willing to accept before having gone through a given experience. I was never bothered by the pain of tattoos because annoyance of the pain at first releases hormones that dull it naturally. But I will say my anticipation on my first tat had me take a pain pill before my first tattoo. Now having broken/fractured close to 20 bones, I believe that pain of a first tattoo one anticipates is worse versus the pain you unexpectedly go through in an accident. Night and day. My first two tattoos were on my left wrist and right inner forearm, and they of course sucked for how long they took and trying to keep still while the artist did a great job.   The time I shattered my left hand with 2 broken bones and 5 fractures was a fun laugh.  Oh how the mind works :)",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@jolllyroger1,"Actually that's not true the microscopic scratches on the needle actually grabs the ink and drags it into the skin.... needles for tattoo are not polished they are ground to a specific grit which leaves the necessary texture to carry the ink into the skin.....I did tattoos about 30 years ago and used guns that I made myself....yes they are guns.... ...and anything that anyone wants to call them...I made the frames for my coil guns my rotary guns and I even made some linear guns....I experimented with many different types and settled on rotary as I find them the most consistent easiest to adjust and maintain..... back in those days most reused needles after thorough autoclaving .... I made my own needles my own tubes and all my own equipment because this way you would get fantastic quality that wasn't really available in the markets and you could make a specific needle set in a few minutes versus waiting a week to month for shipping... I experimented with different grits of grinds as well on the needles, if you polish the needle to much you don't get enough ink into the skin if you grind to coarse you tear the skin I found I got best results regrinding my needles more coarse than they came bulk then polishing just the very tip to a super sharp fine polish which I did on ceramic hones of 8000 grit.... this gave excellent penetration with less pain and far less trauma to the skin and the coarser grind behind the tip Carried much more ink into the skin so I could get far better color density in only one pass.... the coarse grind was done linear to the shaft with a slight gentle twist ... I even experimented with progressive twist on the grind.... yeah I took my art extremely seriously .... the micro grooves left from the grind would grab the ink carrying it into the skin ..... a highly polished needle would barely carry ink if it carried any....the needles which I bought in bulk and then soldered onto shafts with silver solder and my own homemade flux .... my preference is still a single needle liner in a very small gauge for getting amazing detail... I loved doing tattoos maybe I should get out my rotary guns (yeah guns)  ...and get back into it.... the Is something about leaving your mark on someone for life.... of course the governments have gotten involved to a ridiculous degree just so that they can tax and control the people.... I hate governments controls.... ...and I feel that because of those controls many fantastic tattooist don't do it anymore.... so the instant the needle pierces the skin blood begins to flow out of the hole left and this blood would push the ink out preventing ink from going in.....I don't know where you got this idea that the ink flows into the needle hole but there is much more science to these needles and tip of needles than most tat artists know....I think these days that comes from the fact that nearly all use throw away tubes shafts and needles and they are available in massive bulk this way for extremely cheap prices plus the time spent making things takes away from tatting time which is money.... back in the day i would never take a needle to a client without inspecting the tips with a microscope to be sure I had a sharp even point ..... the last time I bought needles was probably 10 years ago and they were bulk throw away.....I would say after inspecting the quality I found that a good 30 percent had bad tips with about 8 percent actually having hooked tips or bent tips..... ...and I'll not say the company name because that was 10 years ago..... never put a needle in a gun without inspecting the tips with at least a 10 power loop I prefer a 60 to 100 power microscope.... seen to many that don't and used hooked needles on their client... there are a lot of meat grinders out there.... also you should learn everything you can about the dermal layers they change thickness depending where on the body.... also the size of the cells changes as well as how hard or soft the layers are.... everyone has had calouses .... you must penetrate the dead layers but not go all the way thru all layers .... learn everything and never stop learning",4년 전(수정됨),63,

@mahamali8773,"pretty much the same, ink into the skin.",4년 전,0,
@theevilgood,"This isn't true. The ink is absorbed by macrophages (the body's natural response to outside invasions like bacteria) which are then too dense to be able to exit the dermis, trapping both themselves and the ink within the second lair of skin. What you're describing would cause the ink to bleed out over time, whereas the common misconception of the ink just existing in the skin would mean your tattoo would disappear within a few years.   This is why tattoos don't actually disappear over time. Your body constantly tries to replenish the macrophages as they die, which in turn causes the new ones to absorb the ink that was in the old ones as they pass on. It's why the ink stays in the dermis for as long as it does. If it was just in the skin, it would flake off. But it's being passed along by your body's immune system :o",4년 전,8,

Humans can survive without all of these, none of these are needed- humans have lived without them for 100s of thousands of years. Yet, before all of these, Tattoos, bodily markings and piercings have existed for at-least 14,000 years-possibly more.

And also why do you think God said that marking your body is not acceptable because it is his body. He gave us the body to take care of it, not to add things to it. As human beings we are created by God by the way there are scientific prove that God exists. But anyway as human beings who are created by God, we must learn that body we have is not ours. We should not use the Body God that created to destroy it by adding tattoos for pleasure. We must TAKE CARE OF IT. Just because you make think it looks nice, doesn’t make it okay. God wants us to know the when he tells us things are not good and we should not do it, we shouldn’t harden our heart’s, as the scripture says, to gain pleasure because when he tells us it’s wrong he knows why.

For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.”  and romans 10:9-13: “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”  so God is coming at a time we least expect, and if we put our faith and trust in Him He will gift us His grace and clothe us with the righteousness of His blood (but of course death could not hold Him, He is risen!) and we will have eternal life in His kingdom where there will be there will be no more death, or sorrow, or crying. there will be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. because He loves you so much! (romans 5:6-8) but if we deny and reject Him and don’t repent from our sins to follow God, then we will have our part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. so hear these words, repent and believe the gospel! accept Jesus Christ and confess your sins to Him so that He will forgive you and give you a life with truth, love, joy, and peace. which will never fade away or perish. God bless!",4년 전,0,

@eugenio5774,"the best advice I can give you is: learn how to control your breath. do yoga if you can, because it will teach you how to keep an even, slow breathing, and you will need that while under the needle. it helps entering a sort of meditative state where you will feel the pain, but it will also feel detatched from you. some areas will be way more sensitive than others, so at a certain point the needle will strike a spot that will hurt worse and will break through your concentration. even then, keep breathing evenly, do not hold your breath, do not pant or hiccup. your body will need the oxygen.  second advice: drink plenty of water, and eat a hearty (but not heavy to digest!) meal beforehand. you will need the calories, and bring calory dense snacks such as nuts and dried fruits to prevent yourself from going through a glycemic drop. do not give in to the temptation of curbing a potential anxiety with intoxicants of any kind, if the artist is any good will absolutely refuse to tattoo you if you are under the influence of alcohol.  last, but not least: research extensively the tattoo artist you want! if you save on the tattoo, all the money will end into a removal.   roses are beautiful flowers, so please do not let yourself be daunted :) it's a few hours of pain for a lifetime of beauty!",4년 전,12,
@taompons,"the best thing you can do is get a really small tattoo to test the waters and if it really hurts that much, i wouldn’t advise getting a big tattoo. but to really prevent yourself from being bothered by it when getting a tattoo done, best thing you can do is  1. take lots of deep breath, slow and steady  2. don’t focus the needle or the pain. distract yourself. i see people watching movies or listening to music with their earbuds in to distract themselves.  3. eat a lot. don’t get a tattoo with an empty stomach.  4. a lot of people are against this and idk why, i never used it before but you can use a numbing cream. it definitely won’t make you feel pain completely but will eliminate most of that feeling. but be careful on the type of numbing cream you have because some are glycerin based which makes the surface of your skin super slippery and hard to tattoo. 5. don’t take painkillers because it will thin out your blood. 6. don’t drink. maybe, if your artist doesn’t mind it and you know how you react... maybe you can do cannabis. i know a lot of people don’t like it when their clients are under the influence but if you’re a pot user and you’re a lot more chill, maybe you can do it. i was high during mine and i was really chill.",4년 전(수정됨),3,

@thefiresworddragon927,"I think I could get a tattoo. I know I have Erhles Danlos Syndrome, so it will get in the way, but I do think I could take it. I mean, I can take multiple needles without flinching. And the only time I ever felt faint, wasn't even cause of the needle. It was my body reacting to the vaccination. I think it was for chicken pox or something, but I do remember taking two vaccines, and I almost fainted. Didn't faint in the end, but I almost head desk'ed the reception desk :P.  So rule of advice; if you ever take a needle that isn't for the flu, wait a few minutes to see if there is any reaction. If there is, have the doctors just have you lay down on a bed for a good while. If you're fainting, you might as well do it where you can't fall.  Oh, and in regards to what tattoo I want, I want one like Hanzo from Overwatch. What? I like dragons. And I'm right handed. If I can't use my left arm after I get the tattoo (theoretically, I think I could lose the use of my arm, due to my velvety skin. I strain could, because it might not even be likely anyway. But just in case), then that's fine.  Just a question though; does it help having fat on your arms when you get a tattoo? And is it a bad idea to get a tattoo on your arm if it is skinny? I'm going to say yes, but I'm looking more at ""would it bleed more if it was skinny?"".",5년 전(수정됨),0,

Size, complexity, different colors, different textures, all add to the time. 5 hours isn't actually a lot of time for a tattoo--they take longer than you think. 5 hours isn't going to get you a sleeve, or a backpiece, or anything like that. A back piece can easily take over 20 hours (over multiple sessions of course).

@junioraltamontent.7582,"The interesting part of tattooing is that it's not like drawing at all really, as it has to be perfect the first time. The classic ""Sailor Jerry"" style is made for this by stringing together easily replicatable shapes like teardrops, circles, hearts... The more shapes you put down, the easier it gets, as you can draw in relation to  what's already there, having a benchmark for size and shape. Instead of sketching and refining it's more like layering and connecting carefully outlined cells of varying shapes and then shading or coloring them in.",4년 전,3,

@gnarthdarkanen7464,"Okay, admittedly Dustin only experimented on his forearm... AND all be it sensitive, there was plenty of flesh between skin and bones there... BUT I think I can expect his agreement, really it's not particularly egregious with flesh under the skin. It's next door to nothing until the soreness sets in, and your skin is raw from the abuse...        However, the more intense sensation will happen if you get into territory where there's little or no flesh between skin and bone, like your shins, ankles, knuckles, or elbows... There it's a little more like cutting in with a razor blade or similar...       It's still not the most horrifying thing to feel. You CAN also take breaks when it gets too intense for you. The first step in tattooing is to establish the pattern on the skin for the line-work, so something similar to a plain sketch is applied. It will stay there until you actively engage in washing it off. Thus, the tattooist can work for a while, and sit back for a break and go back to work without losing any of the design, the features, details, etc. Some clients are known to even make multiple appointments just for shading and color. This also can be arranged to allow the tattooist to touch up older work in a piece while they're at the next level of details and effort. A full back piece that obviously has the kind of work to take a week isn't something some dude just walked in off the street and got while he was drunk... Most artists don't even service someone while they're drunk, and in some states it's illegal to do so. ;o)",5년 전,0,

@visionthroughthc,i have a few tattoos. my first tattoo is a 2x2 skull i got on friday the 13th. i got it on my forearm and it hurt like nothing else. i took several breaks for that and at some point i almost passed out. but since then i've grown to enjoy it. i got a completely shaded in fallen angel on the same forearm yesterday and it didn't hurt at all. it was the most pleasurable experience i had. i talked to my artist 95% of the time and we took no breaks. after shading for a while it started to feel a bit numb so i guess that helped with the pain tolerance significantly.,5년 전,0,

Get it in places where there's very little or nothing between the skin and bones underneath, like ankles, ribs, wrists, knuckles... and it's best described as ""similar to cutting with an Exact-O or razor blade."" Still not really terrible, just not exactly what I would call pleasant.        Obviously, in some cases the artist should warn you where it's going to be more intense, because a lot of people (especially first-timers) don't know... AND at any point, if it gets too intense for too long, you can take a break and resume... They shouldn't start without a ""pattern"" to establish where the line-work should be before they even turn the machine on...

@kerennaowens6499,"Not saying “gun” is the first thing I learned when I started, and something that is important to me.. I correct anyone anytime they say it. Artists are trying to get rid of the negative connotations that come with tattooing. using the term gun for a tattoo machine and saying I’m about to shoot a tat is negative and seem scary, and so these terms are not typically used in a shop by professional tattoo artists..",5년 전,48,
@zeronegative3108,"How is calling it a gun a negative association, I don't mean to sound like a prick but seriously a tattoo gun have no clue association to an actual fire arm at all. Some people are taking this way too far and being way to sensitive and snowflaky about it. You can call a gun a machine too because THATS WHAT IT IS. And professional firearm instructors don't get all butt hurt when you call a gun a machine. I am all for removing as many negative associations from tattooing as possible but I think this is a bit much to be honest. I get that gun violence is a huge issue in America right now and it separated alot of people based on their opinions towards guns but I don't think that should apply to how you refence the tool you work with. It's toxic if people need all these safety nets and the whole world to be bubble wrapped just for them to feel safe ... Life is going to be rough, ignorance is not Bliss and we need to face and embrace reality for what it is before this snowflake political correctness gets out of hand and leeches into every facet of society. I mean no disrespect and I am entitled to my opinion just as much as you are entitled to yours. And that makes you point of view no less valid. But at the end of the day I'm going to continue to call it a tattoo gun and if I need to sugar coat it then maybe you don't need to be getting a tattoo if you're that sensitive. It makes no sense to me. Again just my opinion, no disrespect and I'm willing to discuss this issue like an adult if you're interested in trying to change my mind and show your perspective on the situation because I honestly don't see the big deal like... At all. And I'm a victim of gun violence almost got shot in the head by my supposed best friend. So yeah.",5년 전(수정됨),27,
@kerennaowens6499,Zero Negative no I don’t really want to argue It’s totally cool if u want to call it a gun and I called it that until I learned to tattoo and started In a shop I just personally don’t call it that because we tattoo a lot of people of all ages older people see tattoos like they are for criminals and people all ages come in TERRIFIED... then they get their tattoo and it’s not as bad as they thought.. I really want people to realize that tattoos aren’t scary or for criminals.. that is why I don’t use these terms.. if u do okay that’s fine and your decision you know.. I’m just not going to use them myself and nor does anyone at the shop I work at.,5년 전,23,
@zeronegative3108," @kerennaowens6499  Ah you know what that actually does make alot of sense I didn't even think about it like that. That is a very interesting and logical perspective. It's very true that sooo many people think Tattoos are only for Criminals, Druggies and Scumbags and it's such an unfair way to discriminate against not only the people who's skin is adorned with such lovely art but it's negative association to the Artists, the art form and culture as a whole.

I don’t know why anyone wants to argue with me lol.. u won’t convince me other wise , I won’t convince u otherwise and that’s fine we are all humans who have opinions based on expieces. Using the word shot is also still just a slang word that still makes no sense because ur getting and injection of some sorts. (Just like tattooing) So ya still scarry but ya I’m not in the medical field so I have no idea how I would feel on this completely separate subject. But also would like to say that getting vaccinated has never been associated with “criminals”, “prison”, etc. and tattooing has been in the past and we just don’t want that “negative connotation” 💕",4년 전,2,

Took a while to find a studio willing to do what I wanted)  Finally finding the right studio, made the appointment and looked forward to the day.  I was even counting the hours on the final day.  But I'll tell ya, something deep down inside me was screaming not to do it when I pulled into the parking lot, and it took several minutes to talk myself to get out of the car and into the studio.  😄  But once I walked through the door, the apprehension fizzled away,  and I haven't ever regretted the decision!",6년 전,1,

@Ashuowl,"It's not that bad honestly. For those that haven't got tattoes, the lining is more of a sharp feeling and the shading more of a burning feeling. I personally didn't think it hurt overall, there was some spots where I certainly could feel it more, like knuckles and some other parts.. But generally didn't really hurt? Which is kinda funny, also in the video the needles suprisingly barely penetrates the skin, didn't know that, but I do like watching the tatto being made whenever I get one.   I guess I might just be odd, but to me personally I did not think it hurt. But on some spots it was uncomfortable to say the least, not pain, but just really not comfortable feeling, like if your foot falls asleep and it feels like needles..it's not pain but it feels really not cool, not saying it's the same thing but just comparing so you can understand better hopefully",6년 전,0,

@anonymous6331-w2f," @ifullyunderstandwhatyoureg3298   How young exactly? I haven't thought about posting them cause I don't have any accounts on social media but let's see! Actually, most of my work are ones that I found on the net like I just traced it onto a paper and then drew it for others so most of my tattoos are not my own creations sadly. One more thing about my tattoos is that I do mostly writings and fewer tattoos of drawings so the only drawings I do is some simple ones and if anyone I'm tattooing on has an idea of how their tattoo should look like in their mind, I can only do it properly if they draw me a rough sketch of it so that's not great.

I see a lot of unique looking tattoos on the Internet, I couldn't do any of that myself.. I think might be able to just draw it?. I know what you mean about them having to sketch it out on paper. Oh, Instead of tracing I just draw smaller tattoo designs that I see on a lot of tattooists art portfolios, drawings like bugs, skulls, hands, flowers, I'd just practice from that.. Until I find a style I like, Helps me design bigger tattoos, I think that'll help you too!. Also I'm the opposite, haha.. For me its my writing that's not that great.

@anonymous6331-w2f," @ifullyunderstandwhatyoureg3298   I don't think it's a good idea to mention your age on the internet but I was around your age when I began taking an interest in tattooing. Also, I meant how young are your pals that you can't tattoo on them, if that's what you meant to say. Did you mean that you can't tattoo on them because they're too young or you're too young? Also, don't worry, you have plenty of time to improve on your skills if you wish to. Just to point out, I meant tracing as in seeing a picture on the screen and copying it onto a paper, not like using tracing paper or anything hehe. Could you tell me more about tattooists art portfolios and how it'd help me?   I don't have any tattoo artists I like or anything, I mostly just search up something or just make up a simple tattoo. The type of tattoos I look for... well, like I mentioned before, I'm mostly into texts and wordings so I usually look for tattoos with different fonts which are available on the net but the requests I get are also just the names of the people I do the tattoo on in a font they prefer so I do custom tattoos as well. So, basically some nice quotes like 'Live. Laugh. Love.' or names of a band or song or something and moving on to drawings, I go for small aesthetic tattoos like simple ones that either hold a meaning in them like a heart and a colon or the sun or some simple drawings that are more of just shapes and not like the sketching and drawing kind.   I also have these few, small sheets of paper where some of the tattoo ideas I liked from surfing the net are copied down there so that I can show it to people if they want a tattoo so that they can choose what they like i.e if they liked any of them. So, I'm a fan of the band, BTS so I have a lot of BTS tattoos so I do get a lot of people for drawing tattoos of BTS related writings or drawings. I also have this tattoo album in my phone where I have saved a lot of tattoo work which I liked and I also almost always take pictures of my work after I'm done and have it saved to my mail for myself and also to show others before they get a tattoo done.",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@anonymous6331-w2f," @ifullyunderstandwhatyoureg3298   Oh, you use henna? Actually using henna is different from tattooing using pen. Henna isn't considered as tattooing but it's equally hard, I agree! Also, you must be pretty good too and I don't find myself that good. I mean, if others started tattooing, I'm pretty sure they can do tattoos like I do... atleast, that's what I always think when people comment on my work..    As for what I use to draw tattoos, I use black ballpoint pens most of the time like I mentioned earlier. I never prefer to use gel because it can spread easily in my skin but one time I used it, people said that the minute spreadings made the tattoo look more real! Also, when I do tattoos, the nib thickness matters depending on what kind of tattoos I'm giving, like if it's a thin writing or a thick and dark drawing if you get what I mean. Basically, I use ballpoint and rollerball pen- sometimes only. I actually used to have a tattoo pen earlier, like a pen only for tattooing, which was waterproof and with a particular nib size but I had stopped tattooing for some time and it had dried up! Anyways, I'm back in the business again so I gotta buy one!!   What kind of pen do you use to do your tattoos btw? Also, I hope this doesn't sound weird and I'm definitely not framing this well but which all body parts have you tattooed on? Have you tattooed on yourself and your pals or others?",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@ifullyunderstandwhatyoureg3298," @anonymous6331-w2f  yeah, I wanna try using a pen instead of henna, it would be so much easier! because the henna I use isn't the pen version. If your pals think Your tattoo's are real that must mean your great though, just keep practising!    I'm gonna look on the internet for pens that are made for drawing on your skin, instead of buying pens that are then gonna spread, or smudge. What was that pen you used? was it a real tattoo pen?   I just draw my tattoo designs on paper, I haven't tried drawing on my skin, I've only used henna, drawing only just wee patterns. I've tattooed myself, family and pals, well.. it was henna I used. Haha! nah your fine, Normally my hand and up my arm, what about you? and you've tattooed someone ay?",6년 전,1,
@anonymous6331-w2f," @ifullyunderstandwhatyoureg3298   Actually, I meant, if you use henna for tattooing, it's not exactly considered actual tattooing, though there are henna tattoos. Also, I will, thanks! You should keep practicing too and you'll achieve your dream one day! Also, I'm average... one of my friends loved one of my tattoo work so much but instead of asking me to do the tattoo on her hand, she found an image of it and did it on her own and she also did the same one for few of her friends too... The pen I used wasn't a tattoo pen but it was a waterproof pen used by artists. I actually HAVE read that pen tattoos are harmful and I have heard of pens that are specially designed for tattoo drawing but I still stick to black ballpoint pens...  Also, did your family members or friends comment on your henna tattoos?  I have also done only on my hands and up my arm too, basically my entire arm but also, I have done sometimes on my foot when I got bored, like in the ankle area? (I don't know the name of that place hehe) And yeah, I have tattooed on plenty and PLENTY of my friends and even on my mom (it was just a pen tattoo but she said it hurt XD) and the maximum number of tattoos I have done a day (even if it's not an actual job of mine) is 15 and as I have said before, rn, I have a list of people I have to tattoo on!

@thenoddistsdisciple,"Actually do your research, please. Some brands who make tattoo pigments use carcinogenic ingredients, but the majority of them (the popular ones) stay away from those ingredients. A tattoo parlor is as sterile as the doctor's office, it has to be. They're basically giving you a large, shallow wound.  Getting a vaccine is more invasive than a tattoo, the needles only pierce to your dermis layer when it comes to tattoo needles.",6년 전,0,
," @thenoddistsdisciple  I imagine 17yo youngster just eager to tattoo something on him wondering about cancerogenic and HIV stuff. That all causes inflammation anyway. One vaccine does not make som much wound as a tattoo. I heard You, but You are advocating what is not possible to control. I could be an artist, but never consider to touch any skin for money....never. It depends on mentality, self-esteem to even do such a job.

@TheMasterOfNone,"Btw even though it looks like it doesn't even pierce the skin it very surely does. It's just the fact that the needle doesn't actually have to go deep at all to get past the topmost layer of epidermis. Tattoos aren't nested deep inside you, they're literally in your skin. Fun little fact: If the needles are dull and/or the machine doesn't get enough power to puncture the skin it actually hurts way more compared to when it's applied properly. It causes a small scale ""blunt force trauma"" which is really painful",6년 전,0,

But the band logos didn’t hurt.

I filmed it in slow motion with my galaxy s9 and each setting of brightness seems to have its one strobe rate and isn't continuous light. Im just very curious as to why it does this. I would have thought it would be a steady beam but it isn't.,6년 전,0,

@oseanpower,"Billy Perry  Deuteronomy 10:17 For Jehovah your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the God great, mighty, and awe-inspiring, who treats none with partiality and does not accept a bribe.  Revelation 1:8 “I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga,” says Jehovah God, “the One who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.”  Nahum 1:2-3 Jehovah is a God who requires exclusive devotion and takes vengeance; Jehovah takes vengeance and is ready to express his wrath. Jehovah takes vengeance against his foes, And he stores up wrath for his enemies. Jehovah is slow to anger and great in power, But by no means will Jehovah hold back due punishment. His path is in destructive wind and storm, And the clouds are the dust of his feet.",6년 전,0,

Matthew 7:21 21“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. 22Many will say to me in that day: ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’ 23And then I will declare to them: ‘I never knew you!

@iheartart9954,"yah, you’re probably right so people who want to get tattoos should just make sure they don’t inject too much of those carcinogenic toxins that are known to cause cancer.  And If everyone just stayed away from that certain amount, we’d all be cancer free today!",6년 전,0,
@extrastuff9463,"​ @iheartart9954  I have to strongly disagree with your ""Once it’s there, you have cancer"", it being there does not mean you have cancer. It just means an elevated cancer risk depending on how much, where and how long it has been doing its work messing with biological mechanisms. And also that ""we'd all be cancer free today"" statement has some major issues too (see below).   Carcinogenic substances are just one of the potential causes, others include just the natural process of cell reproduction going slightly wrong, radiation (high energy UV. ionising radiation, etc). That said limiting these substances as much as is reasonably possible is definitely a good thing, if I'd have to guess though given how little pigment really goes into the skin and how long it takes for a tattoo to fade over many years that the total amount leaving your visible skin going elsewhere in the body is pretty minimal. There are many other things I'd be much more concerned about (like what is in my food, medication later on as I get older and what not).  Getting rid of the flaws in the natural process will be impossible, radiation sources can be mitigated with sunscreen and the already strict control on radiatioactive materials. But you'll inevitably still have the background radiation which varies a lot based on location and altitude (significantly higher in flight, not sure if its bad enough to be a cancer risk for pilots/airplane crew as a passenger it's fine however).  Oh and with radiation there is a mechanism too that could potentially be beneficial, haven't seen conclusive enough evidence for it yet that I would say with full confidence how much radiation is a good thing. But basically it comes down to above a certain radiation threshold repair mechanisms seem to kick in that deal with damage to DNA. Good luck figuring out where the ""ideal"" level of radiation is though (and what type/energy level), it'll probably vary between populations as well where it works better in some people than in others.",6년 전(수정됨),5,

@SoFar_SoGood_SoWhat,"Lauren Taylor You'll be fine. Remember, everyones pain tolerance is different. I had a 12 hour session over Monday and Tuesday (23-24 july 18) doing a flame sleeve from wrist to elbow. Painful? Yes, on the inner arm, the inside of the wrist and near wrist bone. Hot firey pain. Outer arm/forearm wasnt as bad but it still stings. A few day later its scabbing over and the itch phase is kicking in a little now. Keep it clean and try to get a decent tattoo cream for immediate aftercare use. Im currently using 'Tattoo Goo' (original). Stay away from fragrance based creams, alcohol based creams and dont go swimming or submerging it in water and wear loose clothing. You might also wake up with ink on your bedding, too. Also, dont use towels (even newly washed ones) to dry your tattoo. Use paper towel and dab, dont rub. Dont let anyone else touch it and do not pick the scabs as that can pull out ink. Keep it clean by gently washing it with suitable warm soapy water and dry as mentioned. Dont apply any cream until its fully dry. You could trap water under the broken skin and it cant evaporate so you may get water blisters forming. Dont pop them let them dry out naturally and they should die down. Remember, a new tattoo is basically an open wound. Treat it with respect. Stay out of the direct sun. Its a tattoo killer. Once its healed, sun is fine but the sun will slowly fade the tattoo. Aftercare creams will help keep it looking good for a long time if you look after it. Anyhow, enjoy your new ink!",7년 전,2,

Honestly it doesn’t feel like much of anything else. I needle felt and jabbing yourself with one of those single needles is a lot more painful than tattoo needles because they’re not stabbing in very far at all.  If you want the tattoo, go for it!

@caitlinpeters282,Charlie I wasn't saying that she couldn't have an opinion. I was saying that there's a difference between stating your opinion and being bully.

@alan30189,"No matter if your are doing it to yourself, or if a professional is doing it to you, tattoos are ""not a good idea.""  A recent report came out that says tattoo ink, with all the metals, etc that is in it (aluminum, chromium, iron, nickel and copper), winds up in your lymphatic system. Being the largest organ of your body, your skin tries to expel these toxins, and the lymph nodes is one area they wind up. They don't know the long-term effects yet, but your lymphatic system is a very important part of your immune system, so good luck with that.

It's my only real passion in life.   Don't let pain or ""regret"" fear-mongerers stop you. You get sunspots and scars throughout life anyway. Your skin changes, people change, but there are fundamental things that will never change - get a tattoo of something like that.",7년 전,2,
@user-ro8qv7ob4v,"Isaac Boaz I snapped my leg in half once. A tattoo is nothing compared to that. I have a few stick and pokes and supposedly they hurt worse than professional tattoos. They didn't barely hurt at all. I'm fact it was quite satisfying and I hate pain. Trust me, if you really want one, get it.",7년 전,0,
