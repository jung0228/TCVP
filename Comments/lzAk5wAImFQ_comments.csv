@aragusea,"Some updates since I made this video: 1) I have been going with a wetter dough lately. Wet doughs, counterintuitively, seem to get crispier. I figure that's because they're more pliable, which allows more steam to escape during cooking. If you want a precise recipe with weights, look elsewhere. I don't like getting out my scale unless I have to. I can judge hydration pretty well by feel, and I reckon you can too with a little practice. I still think 2 and 1/4 cups water + 5 cups flour is a good starting place. Add more flour until it reaches a stickiness that you can handle. The only downside to extra hydration is that the dough becomes sticker and harder to work with. Part of the reason I went with a pretty dry dough when making this video is that I was worried about the pizza sticking to the peel while I got all the shots I needed. 2) I have started not only taking my tomatoes out of their packing liquid, but also washing them off under running water in a sieve. It's crazy, but that really makes a difference in a raw tomato sauce like this. The packing liquid is just so bitter. And I've been experimenting with different tomato brands. With really good tomatoes, I don't need the tomato paste. I would rather not use paste. 3) Many commenters have mentioned some affordable home pizza ovens that intrigue me. I think I'm going to give the Uuni a try and report back. Ultimately, my pizza still lacks the very distinctive flavor you get from baking at a thousand degrees. 4) If you have thoughtful, constructive, evidence-based advice for how I could improve my recipe, please give it to me. But if you're going to tell me I'm doing it wrong simply because you've always done it another way without interrogating why, please keep it to yourself.",6년 전,2.3만,

@aragusea,"Maybe you'll have better luck with the steel, but I tried cooking in my Weber with a stone several times, several different ways, and it was always a bust. The bottom comes out amazing, but the top doesn't get nearly hot enough, even with the lid on. You see this in all of the Weber pizza videos on Youtube — the cheese is never brown. There is one after-market product for grilling pizza on a Weber that has a stainless steel plate suspended over the cooking surface, and that seems to get the top hot enough.",6년 전,360,

@sechay9328," @aragusea  As you know fermentation and hydration have a big impact on color and text, etc., so I won't get into any of that. Besides I use my sour dough rather than commercial yeast a lot. So just in terms of techniques and tricks I have found success with for browning in a home oven, here are two: 1) I always use a steel, but as you have likely observed, it frequently outpaces the oven's ambient temp. One trick is to put your steel close but not too close to your broiler (if you have a top broiler). Then you can start in convection and finish with the broiler, or if your oven is hot enough and your dough cooks evenly you can do the whole pizza under the broiler. That has worked well when I am working in a 48 hour, high hydration naturally leavened dough. 2) A much less fussy and way to do it and more reliable with my ny style dough that uses commercial yeast is to use both the steel and the stone at once. Put the steel on the bottom rack, and one rack higher put your stone. Start your pizza on the steel, and then around halfway check on its bottom crust. It'll probably be taking on good color and dark spots but not be done yet, but the top will need more time than needed to finish the bottom. Then pull the pizza and transfer to your stone on the top to finish up. Bottom will have that little extra from the steel but the top will manage to finish cooking. I find it pretty hard to burn the bottom of a pizza on a stone so this has yet to fail me. Feel free to reply if you want to keep talking pizza, I find that there as many great pizzas out there as there are ways to make them. I have never tried doing pizza in a weber with a steel though but I suspect that it will always conduct its heat far to quickly for the rest to cook. This is probably why hardcore pizza ovens stick with tiles and stone. There is these:  https://www.kettlepizza.com/kettle-ovens/charcoal-grill-inserts/ but I haven't heard much about them since they came out so I can't attest to the quality.",6년 전,54,

When I tried grilling on a stone in my Weber with just the normal lid on, it was incredible; I couldn't even get my cheese to melt all the way, let alone brown.

@mcarson5184," @aragusea  Adam nice video, I've been on a similar pizza journey for a few years now too and settled on a very similar recipe and method but we are still playing around with cheeses. I've found punching the dough down after an overnight rise and then dividing it into balls and allowing a final proof for an hour or two closer to room temperature gives a better crust both in terms of being extremely thin but sturdy under the sauce and cheese and puffy on the outer edge.  I've found a single proof often results in a dough that is less ""sturdy"" and ultimately one that deflates and can't hold the air bubbles as well so tastes more dense. I also keep my pizza stone on the bottom rack all the time as we have an electric oven and it helps to evenly disperse the temperature during our other baking and cooking.

I think this more approximates what you'd get in an oven that was twice as hot. You're right about the dough being wetter the better, so long as you can handle it!

@PaulTMaack0,"Good job. I worked pizza for 14 years, several of which were at the New York style places (which are from NY), and I gotta say... That's about it. Doesn't get much better than that.   The places I worked at had us age the dough for minimum of 16 hours, but 24 is a good sweet spot. I also found that the wetter the dough, the crispier the crust. I personally don't like having browned cheese, so I tend to use more moist cheese, or you can add a bit of olive oil on the top to prevent the browning.   Only thing I'll say is that you should probably work on getting the dough sealed up nicely on the bottom, otherwise that seam on the bottom can turn into quite the air pocket and cause some real uneven spots later on. If I had a camera, and some dough on me, I'd show you what I mean, but I'm sure you get it. It's just a little effort to save a big headache.  When we were training new guys, we'd show them how to stretch the dough over the edge of the table, and that's something people who aren't confident with holding it in their hands can do too. Basically you'd just lay it down on the edge of the table, and grab the top, with both hands and rotate it around so gravity does the work of stretching it over the edge. You can do that while pinching out the crust for efficiency if you like. Again... If I had a camera and some dough... :) Your pizza looks super tasty!",6년 전,41,
@TheLobstersoup,"Oil and salt are natural enemies to yeast, so it's good you add the salt later, but I would add it to the flour (not to the water). To leave the dough on top a base of oil and coated in it is also not helping the process. Ideally you'd let it rise in a warm place for the first hour and place a wet towel on top of it. Then you can knead it down once and let rise the same way again and then cover it and put it in the fridge. I also like to coat the dough (which I form like you do) with a coat of olive oil before putting the sauce on. It prevents the sauce from soaking into the dough; you do put a lot of olive oil into the sauce though so that might work similarly. As for oven - I think your steel is too hot. You want a hot air temperature and hot steel of course, but if it isn't a time-lapse your pizza gets very dark fast. You have to let the flavours develop, too. Some fresh chopped basil on top of it would be my choice to give it a finish. The three colors of the Italian flag translate to cooking: white, red, green - mozarella, tomato, basil ;)",6년 전,17,

Also, you can always ""play"" with you sauce to try to reach what suites your taste.

@aragusea,"@TheLobstersoup How is oil an enemy of yeast? Is that claim based on anything remotely scientific? You're seriously telling me to not add salt to the water, but instead to add it to the flour, which I will then immediately add to the water? This will delay introduction of salt to the solution by approximately 5 seconds. That makes zero sense. Ideally I would NOT let it rise in a warm place for an hour. A full cold fermentation, in my experience, results in better flavor and a finer bubble structure, and I am far from the only baker to come to the same conclusion. What makes you think I'm having fermentation problems in the first place? I'm not. My dough balls have tripled in size by day four or five. There's plenty of fermentation going on.

@leonardopab5,"​ @aragusea  every yeast is different. Some strains and species of yeast do not like oil so much, but our cooking neutral oils usually do not kill them in low quantities.   I imagine that the oil coating the dough, only in the outside, may be positive because it prevents the contact of the dough with the air, allowing fermentation to happen.   About the metal, you cannot say that it is bad nor good for yeast growing. But remember that acids react with metals, and fermentation usually lowers the pH, making it acidic. Yeasts produce acids. Therefore, if you want to be sure, better not use metals.",6년 전,14,
@vadimika,"@Adam Ragusea Hello from me, great video !  1)I tend to have a ratio of 1 flower and 1/2 water and after play with depending the humidity. For the home pizza (home ovens with stone) i tend to make a higher moisture ration my dough because it takes longer to bake from a wooden or professional oven ( home oven 6-9 minutes / professional 2-3)  so you need more moisture so it will not be completely dry. As for handling the dough with higher moisture, just be quick with putting the ingredients (from the moment it touches the wood it takes like 10 to 15 seconds until it will stick on the wood )   As for the things you can try are:  1) in older times for the classical american  dough they were using sesame oil (it was removing some taste of the flower) you can give it a try and see. 2) for the tomato sauce, from the moment you wash the tomatoes try to avoid using sugar and add 1 tea spoon of white vinegar ( it reacts with tomato sauce and makes it  sweeter )  i personal put a clove of garlic , thyme and red cracked pepper . 3)For the cheese ( i live right now in slovakia so  it is very difficult to find mozzarella cheese with less moisture if you are not in the industry of restaurants)  for home i buy some normal mozzarella and i am cutting it and leave it to dry in the fridge for at least 24 hours, i make it for 2 days, ( i put in a plastic open container  with some grills on the bottom so the water will not touch the mozzarella and add some fat sea salt ) take care only not to have in the fridge anything with strong smell.

@Dannemon,"This is a great video and I agree with using wetter dough. I've tried many different methods of making pizza over the years, including refrigerating the dough over 5 days,  and finally settled on No Knead Pizza. More like neapolitan style pizza as well wich is amazingly chewy and flavourful. Skip the olive oil, I find it only greases the gluten I think to not be as chewy. I use the ratio 2 parts water against 3 parts breadflour. I think thats how you say that. So throw dried yeast, sugar and salt in the water and add the flour. It will be really sticky so add some more flour so its easier to handle but should still be really sticky. Don't need to knead much at all, just tumble it a bit and let it rest in a plastic covered bowl in room temp for at least 12 hours. I usually do this the day before. Letting it rise in room temp like this without olive oil creates great flavour and chewiness and the smell is intense when you take it out. It will be sticky as all hell, so when you remove it you'll need alot of flour on the table. Tumble it abit in the flour so the sticky surface goes away and let it rest an hour. Then do the usual with the pizza peel and pizza stone, but add alot more flour on the peel because it will stick easily,. I even bought pizza steel wich is way better at transfering heat to the pizza so it gets crispier underneath and you don't need to heat it as long or have the dough in the oven as long.

In an acidic environment your stainless steel becomes stainless ions, if you know what I mean.   It does not require much knowledge to know that. If you let water for some hours in a stainless steel bottle, eventually it will alter its taste. But if you do a quick research you will know that, even though stainless steel does not ""stain"", it still oxidizes. And this makes sense because it is an alloy made mostly of iron.

@oukid2633," @aragusea  Baking  at 1000 degrees does not give you any distinct flavor. It makes the dough chewier and softer because you are cooking it much faster, allowing the dough to retain much more moisture.    Also get a scale, no baker uses cups! You have to start using bakers percentages, it will save you time and it be much easier to record results.    Also most of the distinct flavor comes from the cheese after lots of experimenting I've found some whole milk to cheeses to taste better than others. And letting the cheese age in your fridge for a week or two gives it a distinct flavor thats slightly acidic, that distinct flavor tastes just like the pizzas from my local pizza shops so I assume that they also age their cheese too.   You mentioned to not use moist mozzarella, you're missing out dude. You have to use the broiler, so that the pizza is able to cook faster on the top. It's like simulating a real oven where they cook from the top and the bottom.   Also one last thing, like what the other guy said the longer you have your dough sitting the more flavors it developes. But you have to make sure that you use very little yeast and less 2% salt, flavors in the dough are the result of flour enzymes which are impeded when you have too much salt.   here's a pizza i made it's a been a bit over proofed https://imgur.com/UPosjSh  and another one https://imgur.com/oMnqPsg",6년 전(수정됨),8,

There is a significant flavor difference. And I have a scale. I use it when I have to. I don't have to use it to make pizza. As I said, I use volume measures as a starting point, and then I add flour until I get the hydration I want, which is easily judged by feel. I am not ""missing out"" by not using my broiler. I have used my broiler before, many times. With this particular oven, I have found that the convection roast setting directs more heat to the top of the pizza. It's nice if you like fresh mozzarella, but even if you can evaporate the excess whey during cooking, I still prefer low-moisture mozz for pizza.

@lostsolcollective,"Great video, simple, concise and a good looking pizza!     As an owner of two NY pizzerias may I suggest a few things to play around with to give more depth to your sauce and pizzas.    For your sauce, you can try  adding in some salt, (we dissolve the salt and sugar in water before adding it to our sauce.)  Black pepper, chopped garlic and we use basil instead of oregano, its a more mild flavor.   Working with the dough when your ready to make a pizza, dont be afraid to roll the dough in some flower.  You dont want any moisture on the dough when your working with it, that way you dont have to put as much flower on your peel, the less the better.     I hope some of this helps",6년 전,15,

@Inverted314,"You mentioned your pizza tasting different from a 1000 degree oven, but only Neapolitan style cooks at temperatures that high. The average floor temp for a classic Bakers Pride deck oven NY slice pie is 450-550 degrees (depending on how busy the shop is) so I would ask which style of pizza are you most seeking to emulate? A wood fired bake or a deck oven bake?  Washing off the canned tomatoes is something Jeff Varasano noted on his popular pizza making website. I'd suggest using commercial #10 cans of tomato products if you have access, as the quality and value tend to be quite better. Personally I think it's very difficult to get a small pizza to eat like a larger one, IE: a 12"" NY pie never seems to bake or taste the same as an 18"" slice pie in my experience. It wasn't until I started making larger pizzas that they started tasting more like a slice.

@oukid2633,"Adam Ragusea   I have read no evidence on cheese that states high heat resulting in flavor, the flavor is produced by the microbes. The more you wait the more flavor is developed by the microbes.   Also the only flavor that is developed in the oven is through browning aka maillard reaction. Its actually a contradiction assuming that you get more flavor in a higher temp oven, when in reality you get more flavor in the lower temp oven because you get more browning.  Using a scale is vital when it comes to fermentation the difference between 4% and 1.5% will result in an extra day of fermenting and overly salty pizza crust. It will also result in lower water content in your dough because of the likely hood of mis measuring flour.   You asked for a better way in the video, you seemed to be asking for critiques yet your too stuck up and arrogent to listen.  Heres my criqitue of your video: *Too much olive oil. *You should never ferment dough that long, if it tastes like sour dough that means the bacteria have started to grow and eat the alcohol from the yeast. *Your dough is too stiff and it needs to relax more so it can be easily stretched. *You over cooked the pizza.  *Its way too thick, its got the thickness of dominoes. No pizzeria makes pizza that thick, unless if cheap takeout.  *And no one spins pizza in the air, thats just for show.

@randomuser2461,moister dough should let it rise more because it has more time being soft. Not sure why water makes it crispier. I've noticed that. Maybe the lack of fats relatively. I know fats make it crumbly and seperate. maybe water thins this out and makes the opposite. Water normally makes something get crispier as a coating on normal breads while milk fats make it softer and oils make it much crisper but not in the same way. But moister bread makes it stay soft longer for greater rising. I have no idea what is going on with that as logically it seems like it must be something more complicated.,6년 전,2,

@iroveashe,"Have you looked into diastatic malt powder in place of sugar?  And since you asked for feedback, I want to encourage you to use a scale. For one, you clearly care about pizza, so I don't think laziness can be excused. The pros maybe don't need a scale but they make hundreds of pizzas everyday, that's experience that can't be achieved at home even if you bake several times a week.  But if you want to improve, then consistency is key. How can you improve on the dough if you don't really know what you're modifying, and by what amount?  I bought a jewelers scale just to measure yeast and DMP, and I use it for the salt, oil, etc, anything under 100g. A cheap one is good enough  Furthermore, baker's percentages are essential for scaling up or down the recipe and for sharing with other people. If you've looked into baking at all you probably know that cups are a really bad way to measure flour. It's okay although uncomfortable for water, but for flour it's a horrible idea in baking (again, if the focus is learning). You say that you're good at judging hydration by feel, but you're probably used to your flour's absorption. Someone with different flours will have a different experience, and if they're meant to go by feel (a feel which they might not even have in the first place) that might fuck up the whole recipe.  ""The only downside to extra hydration is that the dough becomes sticker and harder to work with.""  Lastly I don't think this is accurate. More hydration means longer cooking time. Ideally with the highest heat you can get, and with the browning agents in the dough (sugar/malt) the goal is to cook the pizza as fast as possible in your home oven. This means the extra hydration will be working against you. Higher hydration works well for sicilian.",6년 전(수정됨),2,
@aragusea,"@iroveashe You're entitled to your own cooking philosophy, but this is mine. I don't like measuring, and I don't like having my head in a recipe. I like getting a sense of generally what the food should look, smell and feel like, and then using my senses. It takes fewer dishes, it's more pleasurable, it's more resistant to interruption (i.e. kids), and more conducive to creativity. Part of the reason I don't bother with scientific precision is that I think, within a certain threshold, all of the possible outcomes are good. I like this dough when it's a day old, I like it when it's 9 days old. It's different every step of the way, but always good. And no, I haven't thought about diastatic malt powder in place of sugar. I'm not interested in filling my kitchen with speciality ingredients unless they're going to make a big, big difference. In case of this style pizza, having low-moisture full-fat mozz makes a big difference. Regarding hydration, in my experience, the wetter the dough, the more water escapes during cooking. Yes, obviously, there will come a point where the dough is so wet that it won't crisp up in time, but I think such a dough would be so sticky and loose that you wouldn't be able to stretch it in the first place. If people want baker's percentages and such, they have J Kenji Lopez and a hundred other people. This is how I do things, and if people like it, great.

The achieved char and flavor of the crust is something that definitely brought a smile to my face after years of baking in my home oven (like you). However, if a NY style pizza is what youre looking for, with a slightly floppy yet stable crust, then wood fired ovens at 800+ degrees isnt for you.  I think the real trick with the flavor at those staple NY style pizza joints is that their stones and deck ovens have usually been seasoned for decades.  It is possible, however to regulate the temp of the uuni more precisely with the new gas attachment, that way you can keep temps in the 550-750 range, and avoid the ""smokey"" flavor that is meant for neapolitan, as well as cook the pies thoughoroully to get a crisp, yet soft crust.

First, yes, I too am experimenting with wetter doughs, and they seem to work really great with hot temperatures and not too thick pizzas. Getting them huge bubbles like pita bread. Second, consider a steel plate instead of a stone. I broke my stone and started looking for more durable stones, and then found this to me holy grail of baking steel plates. I forget the numbers, but they retain massively more heat than stone and they never ever break. I've tried making pizzas in less than two minutes with oven grill on and thin Margheritas, Heston style. It's fun, but insanely wasteful in terms of energy. Anyway, steel beats stone, try it. Third, try reducing your tomatoes yourself instead of adding paste. It's relaxing and easy. Just keep the temperature on the low end, and use a sieve instead of a lid to let the moisture out and keep the tomato splatter off your walls.",6년 전,3,

@originalchannel321,"Looks really good! Where do you live? Honestly string cheese is delicious and I use it for stuffed crust pizzas a lot. I must say I’m impressed with the fact that you mentioned fermenting/aging the dough for a week. I found 9 days to be similar to Pizzeria Regina. I mainly make a Boston style which is very similar to NY.  Couple of things I’ve found:   1.  I use less cheese for a more NY blending of cheese and sauce and like to cook for a while to get that perfect orange color.  This is tougher at higher temps so 500-600ish°F works best for this.   2.  I found an effective hydration (total hydration of water and oil/other wet ingredients) of 70% to be really good but NY is usually 50-55% hydration, I believe.   3.  Your cornicone and bottom crust looks awesome. I use the Ooni/Uuni Pro and it will give similar results, but more in line with 700-900°F which is closer to Neapolitan or Lucali in Brooklyn. You can mod the Ooni Pro with a flame guard to prevent flames from touching the side of the pizza, with temps sitting around 640°F from slump charcoal. But what you made now is pretty typical NY around 500-550°F and probably the nicest crust I’ve seen from a home oven.   3.  I’ll have to try your sauce. Here in Boston we have Greek style with Greek oregano, and Italian with basically Italian oregano and a thin watered down sauce of only ground tomatoes and sometimes basil/Romano cheese.  4.  I love that fact that you mentioned cutting it bigger. I found cutting two giant slices is also fun. You can make 18” equivalent slices from a 16” pizza. Think of it as cutting out a pac-man size slice. There can be many many ways to cut a pizza that I haven’t even tried.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Maybe you should try not to shoot down so many ideas (unless you can get NASA or a resurrected Stephen Hawking to verify the science). Don't forget that pizza dough is made on a really large scale compared to what we do at home. That along with the huge machines they use and the amount of physical energy and time that goes into kneading the dough is just one example of why getting a good pizza is difficult for us.  My wife and I moved from New York to Washington State and finding good pizza here has pretty much been impossible. They really don't understand how to make a good pizza or even what a good pizza is.

@pmberkeley,"While I appreciate there is a lot of superstition in the culinary world and push back against it myself, as a scientist, a lot of your attitudes and beliefs make my head hurt. I won't go over them all, just the two or three remaining disputes in the comments.   1. It matters what order salt is added in. Mixing and chemical reactions, and availability (or requisite scarcity) of a chemical to an organism depends on the order of the process/reaction. This is like high school chemistry and cooking 101. Like, it matters whether you add water to chocolate or chocolate to water, and in what ratios, because the behavior of the chocolate molecules in relation to the water molecules is different depending on local availability of the molecules. When you add the salt to the water, you make ALL the water in your dough a saline solution. If you let the water molecules mingle with the flour and yeast first, the water is not all attached to NaCl. It's scientifically a different process, dude. You may not mind the difference in results, but you can't argue that it's chemically the same process, or that it ""doesn't matter"", because it's not and it does.  2. Same goes for stainless steel. You may not mind the difference, but it doesn't mean the difference isn't there. Glass is the easiest way to avoid the question.  3. Density has nothing (directly) to do with the heating of the stone, and it will NOT take an hour to heat it thoroughly, give me a break. Specific heat capacity is what matters to how long something takes to heat and how much heat it has available to conduct to the food. The thermal mass of the material you cook on (which depends both on the mass/density and the heat capacity of the material) affects the rate of heating and the stability of the temperature, but not much else. It doesn't make it hotter.  4. I'm not too sure about this (these reactions are not my specialty) but the hotter temperature reactions you seek may not actually exist or affect much of the flavor. The main one humans care about/notice is the Maillard reaction, which occurs at 330 F. So it all comes down to the rate at which you achieve this reaction relative to the rate of heat transfer to the other parts of the food. E.g. a scorchingly high temp oven will create surface Maillard reactions while leaving the inside of a thin pizza relatively unaffected. This is the more likely source of flavor complexity than additional reactions at higher temperatures.  5. Use a scale, if you want people to take your pleas for ""scientific evidence"" seriously. The inconsistency and fuzziness of your measurements IS totally acceptable in the kitchen, but this is the same ""space"" kitchen myths live in, which you hate so much. You have to pick one. Either accept people saying salt and stainless steel affect the dough within the uncertainty bounds of your fuzzy measurements, or use precise measurements.",6년 전,16,

For example, you can stick your hand in a 212* oven and it'll feel warm, but if you put your hand in 212* boiling water, you'll immediately burn your hand. This is because the water in a pot is much more dense than air in an oven, so despite being the same temperature, one cooks much faster than the other.

I don't have to wait around for it to rise at room temperature, and I don't have to time it for two hours before I want to have dinner. I just make it, toss it in, and forget about it. Then any day over the next week, I can come home straight form work, turn on the oven and make dinner, really quick. For my lifestyle, this is far more convenient, and I doubt I'm alone. 2) I really do think the dough tastes better after a long slow rise instead of a quick rise.

@pmberkeley," @TheRety20   I have my PhD in this and I'm currently teaching this subject. You sound like an idiot.   You're talking about several different things here. The 212 F oven air verses water temperature not only is different because air and water have drastically different SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITIES (per/mass absorptivity and emissivity of heat, to attempt to put this into lay terms), but water at 212 is ALSO undergoing phase change, so if it's close to the steam side of things, it has all the energy associated with the phase change included in it at the same temperature. Air does indeed have a lower density than water, but it ALSO has a much lower heat capacity. (Water has a heat capacity of 4.18 kJ/kg K, while air's is less than 1, so even if air were as dense as water, it still wouldn't absorb or give off as much heat).   Volume for volume, steel's heat capacity is only double that of clay, so twice as much clay would put steel and clay on the same heat capacity footing. It's completely unlikely the reason steel is better for the job is because of heat capacity alone ,though - steel has a much higher thermal conductivity than clay/baking stones, which means that all the heat contained therein is much more accessible to the food.

I can totally see why you wouldn't want to do this, and there really is no wrong way to stretch if it gets the job done (for the most part). There's a million different ways and some work better than others at certain stages of the stretching. Except tossing it in the air of course, like you already mentioned!     If you don't mind making a bit more of a mess - before you start forming the cornice, place the dough on whatever surface you are working on and start flattening the dough in the very center and work outwards using the tips of your fingers up to the first knuckle. The theory is that you are pushing the air bubbles out towards the crust. How much impact this actually has on the outcome probably isn't very significant, but depending on how delicate and how much you are able to stretch the dough before forming the cornice, gravity can also help do some stretching. It can also give you a bit more control over how big/small you want the crust to be. I know this is a very insignificant detail but just thought you might be interested.

@OferRotem,"Adam Ragusea The bitterness of the tomatos comes from the seeds (depending of the species), either they are cooked for more than 15 mins, or ground.. to avoid that you can add more sugar (thats basically what you were doing with the tomato paste), but thats tricky because you taste it pre cooking and post cooking. You can also deseed the tomato before blending the souce. Some people like a little seedy taste, its your choise. Maggie tomatos for example have sweet seeds. Maybe you can find a similar specie..

@samwaldorf8777," @aragusea  The wetter the dough the better. Also, in my experience, salad oil helps for a better stretchier dough. Next, to help with achieving a wetter dough, try stretching your dough over the back of an 18 inch pizza pan, then flipping it over onto a floured peel. These tricks have helped me. Now onto some advice that I haven't tried but may help. Try getting some tap water from Brooklyn. Im not sure if it actually matters, but some people swear the mineral ratios add to the flavor. As far as voiding your homeowners insurance, I can only think of one solution. Buy a second hand oven off craigslist or what have you, cut the lock and set it up outside. you can then modify it for pizza only. The only catch with that is that you'll need a free 30 amp breaker(or install one) and you'll need to run a 220 line out to where your pizza oven will be. It wont be free, but even if you build your own brick oven, it will still be similar if not cheaper in price. Definitely cheaper than buying one, or having one built. Oh, one last thing. Try throwing some fennel seed in with your sauce. I personally enjoy it.",6년 전,0,

@xDubstepify,"just a tip! i work at a pizza shop and have been making pizzas for almost 2 years.  I would say to chop the cheese as finely as possible as it gets everything cooked evenly as opposed to the inside of the small blocks you were using being less cooked. also your cheese doesn't reach the crust on your pizza, this will make the cheese way more likely to fall off when you are trying to enjoy it.  what I do is sprinkle cheese all over the sauce to the best of my ability, being able to see the sauce in between little holes.  if you cant see the sauce it is too much cheese. inevitably you will get a decent amount of cheese on the crust and that is ok.  Next you are going to ""fluff"" the crust.  go around the edge from underneath the dough before it is cooked, and flick the cheese back onto the sauce so that no cheese is on top of the crust, but rather next to it.  This will make the cheese stick to the inner layer of crust, and not fall off when you enjoy it.",6년 전,2,

@oxbowmonster8614,Ok so i finally tried making pizza at home and these are my conclusions: 1. Needing the dough by hand is a nightmare. It's stressful and it take a shit ton of time.

I didn't have a pizza stone and if you don't want to buy one i just took a pan and flipped it upside down. No you don't get tge same browning but its still better than nothing. 4. One big mistake i make was putting too much flour on the pan. You really don't need to much and is going ti taste horrible if u add to much. 5. The pizza came out pretty good but i definitely need to work a bit more on my methods. I'm going to update this comm as time goes and i learn new tricks.,6년 전,0,

@louism.4495,"Hi Adam , good video. My own recipe is alot wetter but I use living yeast adapted from my mums recipe from matese region. Buy 100g FRESH yeast , put in the freezer. then get a jar 500g jar with lid, fill 1/4 with filtered water , 1/4 with ap flour (cheap one) and about 1tsp of the yeast . Leave for 12 hours on table top (might overflow). When you make your dough take 1 big rounded tablespoon and mix into the water or milk a little bit. Now put a little more water and flour into the jar and put in refidgerator. Every 3 or 4 days remove 1 tbs and replace replenish with water and flour, this keeps a living proper yeast mix for about 3 months, although even when it looked dead I found it it still worked as well!

You are arguing when you don't even live here. I can tell you all the sauces that are used. Normally most pizzerias use Stanislaus 7/11 (ground tomatoes) or Alta Cucina which is a plum tomato and you have to grind them down, mixed with either Saporito, Full Red or Super Dolce (tomato paste) or the other big company is Escalon which the is normally used 6 in 1 ( ground tomatoes) mixed with Bonta ( tomato paste) they also make fully prepared pizza sauce which is Bella Rosa. Stanislaus and Escalon are both from California and are literally across the street from each other. You normally do not want to cook pizza sauce twice. It gets cooked on the pizza. Also we make 40 gallons of pizza sauce every other day so imagine places that do even more volume trying to cook 40 to 50 gallons of sauce a day. It becomes less efficient and less profitable.

@PizzaSteveNY,I'm not saying it's a fact but most pizza places don't cook their pizza sauce. Your listening to articles written by people why not ask people that are in the industry. How about this I am very good friends with a few of biggest distributors in NY. Ferraro Foods and GDS. I can ask them what majority of their pizzeria are using. I would say almost 80 to 90 percent use Stanislaus. The rest are either Escalon Sam Marzano or Don Pepinos. Their are a couple smaller companies out their but most are using the canned tomatoes. NOW if you are talking about fresh tomatoes where you are peeling them yes you have to cook them but most places need to be efficient to keep up and that is just not. The famous NY pizza recipe has always been 7/11 and Saporito. Now Margherita pizzas that is different alot use crushed tomatoes and San Marzano sauce. Go on PMQ forum where other owners actually talk about this and you will ae most don't because it's not necessary NOT SAYING ALL DON'T but majority will say they don't. Just like putting eggs in the dough has become a thing of the past. I get upset because you say you read some books and that makes you know everything about NY pizza.

My Pizza guy worked at Ray's Pizza one of the most famous Pizzerias in the City and they did not cook their sauce either. The volume at that place is insane. There are certain coal fire wood fire places and they probably should cook their sauce because they cook a pizza in under 2 minutes.

@WITANStudios123,"​ @oukid2633  I've been reading this thread for half an hour or so and I don't really have much experience in cooking but I tend to watch a lot of videos. I'm certain that Adam's recipe for pizza isn't stolen, he has made many points throughout the recipe that tend to be thought through personal experimentation (for example: the packing liquid in the tomatoes). While his recipe may be similar to Kenji's, it doesn't necessarily mean that he stole it. Recipes are formed through shared knowledge, it wouldn't be surprising that there would similarities. Making baseless accusations just because it is similar is a little stupid.   Your earliest comment about the effects of different temperatures on pizza was really well thought out, so I'm not going to argue anything about it because I don't have any knowledge behind that.   I believe that the browning depends on environmental factors (what appliances are used, how well circulated the heat travels in the oven, stone/steel, whether the oven has a convection setting). From your comment, you state that the dough browns well enough without it, this means that sugar DOES help it to brown. If the person following this recipe doesn't have the same conditions in your cooking environment, they might need that sugar to help with browning. I don't see any harm in putting sugar if that is the case.   Referring to the other comments you have made, you seem to complain about him using a 'dough machine'. That's a stand mixer, it's a very common tool used in an everyday home kitchen so there really isn't anything to complain about him using it in this recipe. Adam mentioned this in one of his responses to your comments. A stand mixer is not just for bread, it's for many other things as well. We appreciate your thoughtfulness for caring about the people who don't have stand mixers but there is no need for you to bash Adam about it. If the person doesn't have a stand mixer, that doesn't stop them from using this recipe. Don't underestimate people who don't have stand mixers, I'm certain there are a couple of people that are capable of adapting the recipe to their own conditions. You complained about how having a stand mixer gets rid of all the hard work. Is that a bad thing? I certainly don't think so. That's all up to the person and their values. Don't lump your values with other people.   You're saying that Adam thinks he's 'too good' to use a scale. He's not saying that you shouldn't, he just doesn't use it because he believes in his own skills and that it is also a hassle. You see, he's not pushing his values and opinions onto other people like a selfish person cough *cough*.    ""No right minded cook actually uses cups for flour"", what do you hope in achieving by saying something so ridiculous? Using cups as a measurement is a standardized method for making bread and pizza dough. What's the difference in using grams and cups? They're both forms of measurements of WEIGHT, this means that they can be converted. Sure it's a hassle, but it's not the end of the world (especially with Google, everything can be done so easily).    I like how you advise people to use the no-knead method while showing pictures of the results but there is something wrong about it. The pictures that you show aren't New York style pizzas. They look more like a Neopolitan pizza, that's not what people came to this video for. Give the people what they want. I'm not dissing you about your pizza, it looks great! I would eat that in a heartbeat.   I'm not experienced with cooking so I can't compete against you in terms of cooking knowledge. However, from a general point of view, your comments haven't really been following through the rules of this thread. You have been saying what he does is wrong without any explanation. To justify your point, you need HARD facts. Facts with scientific proof. That's the only way to convince Adam, a perfectly logical person. He's not being a bastard, you're just being ignorant.    Feel free to reply to me with more hate but if you don't address any of the points that I have mentioned, that just shows that you don't receive feedback and criticism well.",6년 전,1,

@oukid2633," @WITANStudios123  The measurements of his and kenjis are exactly the same. It's not a coincidence, also it can be considered neopiltan if its cooked at a tempreature above 900F otherwise the texture won't be soft and chewy enough to be considered Neapolitan.",6년 전,0,
@WITANStudios123,"​ @oukid2633  That is inherently false. According to Kenji's recipe (https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/10/new-york-style-pizza.html) the measurements are not the same as what Adam has suggested.    Adam's Measurements for Dough: 1 teaspoon of yeast 1 1/4 tablespoon of sugar 2 1/4 cup of warm water 1/4 olive oil (AT MOST) 5 cups bread flour   Kenji's Measurements for Dough:  22 1/2 ounces (about 4 1/2 cups) bread flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar .35 ounces kosher salt (about 3 teaspoons) 2 teaspoons instant yeast 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (0.187 cups) 15 ounces lukewarm water (1.875 cups)   This information is directly extracted from Adam's video and Kenji's recipe with the same link that you have used to attempt to falsify Adam's originality, thus you can't argue that I faked this information. You can obviously tell that the measurements are similar, but not exactly the same. Try to check your evidence before you give out bold statements.   New York pizza can't be considered Neopolitan pizza because they're not the same thing, that's why they have different names. I don't care if New York pizza turns into Neopolitan at 900F. You can tell from Adam's video that his oven doesn't go anywhere near as close to 900F. Your point is irrelevant because it is about Neopolitan pizza. Also to add the fact that New York pizza is WAY thinner than Neopolitan pizza. New York pizza crust is iconic for it's crispy, thin and not chewy texture.   It's not just the dough stretching that is different, the cheese placements are different as well. Neopolitan pizza tends to come with globs of mozzarella however New York pizza has cheese that covers the whole slice except for the edges.   I didn't even need to address your point about how New York pizza can be considered as Neopolitan pizza but I still schooled you. That's like saying Cacio e Pepe is the same as Carbonara. They're pastas and they're similar in some aspects but the execution is different. You could seriously offend pasta-purists by saying something like what I just used as an example.   You still haven't given me any proof on why using cups as a measurement is bad. This just shows that you are stating claims that you can't justify yourself because you don't have any articles, quotes or any other form of evidence in which can help to support your opinion. Just from the fact that you didn't address that point, it shows that you are ignorant and are simple-minded.   Including how you tried to convince me that New York pizza can be considered as Neopolitan pizza has worsened my expectations of you being a person who is knowledgeable about pizzas.",6년 전,1,

@robshell5367,"Great looking pizza. The seeds from your tomatoes should be removed also, they can cause bitterness also. Too many people think you make pizza in a day. They don't let the yeast do what it is supposed to do, create flavor. I bought American Pie by Peter Reinhart about 15 years ago and never looked back. I have other great books too, but that was my first go to book. It is a lot more than recipes. It is a great pizza book. If you don't have it I highly recommend it. I like to use 2 stones, one near the bottom element, and one closer to the top. I start the pizza on the bottom stone, it tends to be hotter. Then I finish it on the top stone with the broil set to high, to duplicate the dome effect they do in a real pizza oven. I have accomplished pizza that looks like it came out of a professional pizza oven in around 3 minutes. My oven goes to 550. Like you said in the video, you really have to get to know your oven, that is where most people fail. They think you just have to get it to temp for a while and bake it like a casserole. The longer it takes to bake, the more flavor the crust loses. I finally broke down and bought a 1/2 steel slab, I think I can get to 2 1/2 minutes with the correct set up.

@AudioFileZ, @aragusea  I gather by reading around quite a few folks think by putting the salt in the flour and whisking it well dilutes the impact of the salt on the yeast while still giving the dough that zip it needs. I doubt there's any scientific proof of this though?,1년 전,0,

IS. TRASH. 🗑🍕💀  Floppy. Greasy. Folded over like a peasant’s napkin in the wind! One bite and I nearly dropped my crown. This isn’t pizza — it’s a culinary embarrassment dressed in mozzarella! 😤  But when His Majesty dines on pizza, he demands royalty on a plate: 👑 Chicago Deep Dish — layered like medieval armor, bold and unyielding. 👑 Tavern Style Thin Crust — square-cut and sharp like a knight’s blade. Crisp with every glorious bite.  New York-style? Pfft! Fit for jesters, not kings. Chicago reigns supreme in my court.

I know people from out of town and I no longer live in NYC wwnt downhill not the same NYC we all grew up to. But all the pizza places use La Grande Cheese. The BEST 👌 You can have it ordered to you no more strong cheese. La Grande 95% of the best Pizza Spots in NYC that's there Mozz.

But to your original question, yes. If you don't let the dough warm up, the yeast wont become active and break down the flour (its nearly inactive in the fridge), plus the dough wont be stretchable. Depending on how warm it is, the time out-of-fridge varies. My apt. is around 20 degrees celcius and the sweet spot I've found is 3-4 hours.",7개월 전,0,
@PS2XBOXBETTER,"🎪 Honk honk! Hold up there, Adam from Bensonhurst — I hear ya loud and clear, my friend! Raised in the closest thing to Italy 🇮🇹 this side of the Atlantic? That’s no joke, and I respect the roots!  But you know me — I’m Ronald McDonald, the big red clown who never backs down 🍟🤡  And listen… NYC pizza? Sure, you’ve got history. You’ve got La Grande Cheese (props where props are due — that mozz is top-tier 🧀👌). You’ve got legacy, tradition, and a street corner slice that used to be magic…  But not anymore. The city changed. The pies changed. Even the water ain’t what it used to be. Now? You’ve got dollar slice joints throwin’ limp triangles in greasy paper like it’s a napkin tossing contest! 🗑  Meanwhile in Chicago? 🔥 We’re out here with that deep dish thicker than a dictionary. 🔥 We’ve got tavern-style so crispy it snaps like a fresh fry in my golden arches. 🔥 We’re not folding pizza — we’re fork-and-knifing a monument of flavor!  So hey, even if you came close with that NYC-at-home setup — and I believe you did — Chicago pizza still eats it for breakfast. And lunch. And dinner. 🍕😎  La Grande? Solid. But Chicago pizza?

Yes, I tip my crown to the legends of the past... 🧀🗽  But I am THE KING. And I do not bend to nostalgia!  NYC pizza? Once mighty. Now? A shadow of its former crust. Too many flops. Too many grease-slick slices folded like royal decrees thrown in the gutter! Disgraceful! 😤  Now enter… CHICAGO. 🧱 Deep dish — a fortress of cheese and sauce. 🛡 Tavern-style thin crust — cut in bold squares like the King’s own battlefield map. Every bite? A declaration of dominance. A flavor throne where no New York pie may sit! 🍕  You speak of La Grande Mozzarella? Excellent. But cheese alone cannot reclaim a lost kingdom. In Chicago, the whole court rises: crust, sauce, toppings — a regal performance in every slice!  So I say this — with royal conviction: New York pizza is but a court jester in the presence of Chicago royalty.  👑 Long live the deep dish! Long live the thin crust! Long live the King! Now bring me my goblet… and a tavern slice! 🍷🍕💥",7개월 전,0,

DOP can also only be canned in their own juices. Which should resolve your bitter taste too.,1년 전(수정됨),0,

@noa_9863,No disrespect but I honestly feel like this is one of those things that just doesn't make sense to try and do yourself. If you run a pizza place and have lots of customers a day it makes perfect sense to keep balls of dough in your store's fridge for days. It makes sense to heat up a large oven for an hour if you will be using it for 10 hours. But doing all this at home just to make yourself a pizza doesn't seem sensible to me.,1년 전,1,

@TheJohnny1x,"Hello Adam. I have been using your original instructions from the vid. Except, I've always used the sauce the the tomatoes come in. And the 5 cups usually turn into 6.5 cups of flour. Mine also are a bit more sticky. But I used skim of flour to finish the kneed on my counter. Today I just made 4 more doughs and sauce for tomorrow. I seen you 2.0vid. Choose to stick with the original. I've made these for gatherings and B-day parties at friends requests as well as their dinners. 😆  I wrote you before saying I worked in pizzerias as a teen (50yrs)ago. Italian Delight in Maryland. The Priola family from Sicily. Best pizza I ever had and what I base all pizza on. But I Can't remember the sauce recipe. It was the San Marzzano tomatoes sauce and all. 1 batch was 6 large cans (gal) I think. But can not for the life of me remember the spices. Yours works well. Although I always add 2 pinches of parsley to the top of the cheese to finish. Try that once? Anyway thank you for doing these vids.

@NarutoFreak47,"There are two primary reasons, but it's always up to you how you want to approach it.  1) Out-of-season tomatoes typically taste worse than tomatoes picked during their seasonal peak. The tomatoes that are canned are, maybe not exclusively but damn often picked during peak season, ensuring a better taste. I have to confess, on this front, I'm not a connoisseur. I live in the desert so most of my ""fresh"" tomatoes are less good to begin with, I think, so I never noticed a stark difference between solid summer tomatoes and weak winter ones.  2) If you would prefer to do as Adam suggests and use San Marzanos from Italy, you don't really have a choice. ""Real"" San Marzano tomatoes HAVE to come from Italy, and canned is the only way they'll really make the trip. That said, I've had American offshoots and I think they're perfectly acceptable at half the price. Given my answer to the above question though, that may not count for much.  That all depends on you! If you like a different kind of tomato for your sauce, by all means go for it! If the concern is that canned food is ""lesser"" in some way (may or may not be the case, looking at you referring to non-canned tomatoes as ""real""), I understand the hesitation with some foods definitely having added sodium and the like, but canned tomatoes are impressively simple. They really are just normal tomatoes that have been made shelf-stable through cool canning tech. In any case, whatever you do, I hope you make a good pizza!

The paper WILL eventually burn at that temp but not for a minute or two so just pull the paper out from underneath after the pie has been in the oven for 45-60 seconds and the dough has already set. . Easy Peasy. The paper won't affect the doneness of the crust in any way.,2년 전(수정됨),3,

@donnerundblitzen1717,"It would be nice if Adam gave bakers percentages, such as 500g flour, 325g water (65% hydration). Then we could apply the correct amounts and scale the recipe. Not even Houdini could get out of the mess his directions are. Maybe by the time Houdini made pizza 6 or more times, he could escape from this how not to video. Even with ""5 cups flour"" it is uncertain how much flour that is. Should we follow the scoop and sweep method? Or the other half dozen ways to measure by volume instead of by weight. Instead, Adam adds whatever he thinks the dough needs, maybe a cup of flour or three more than the last time he made pizza dough, maybe a glob or two more or less olive oil than the previous time. No wonder it has taken him 10 years to supposedly get things right. Most commercial bakers are much more precise and CONSISTENT than Adam. If Adam owned his own pizza restaurant and he did his pizza dough as per this video, he would have been out of business in less than a year, not winging things, hoping for good results, over 10 years. Other pizza how to videos, such as by Kitchen & Craft, or Joshua Weissman actually give precise directions and metric weights.

@arturwittensoeltner8729,"There is no such thing as „NY-style Pizza"". It's just the plain old basic original  „Pizza Margherita“ from Napoli.  A pizza (pronounced [ˈpɪtsa], Italian [ˈpitːsa],) is a flatbread made from simple yeast dough with a spicy topping before baking from Italian cuisine. Today's internationally widespread variant with tomato sauce and cheese as a base comes from Naples. In 2017, the Neapolitan Art of Neapolitan ‘Pizzaiuolo’ was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.  18th century  Pizza, drizzled only with olive oil, and topped with sliced ​​tomatoes and oregano or basil, has been documented since around the mid-1800s when the tomato became popular in southern Italy. The name is probably older - the Apulian ""Pizza Pugliese"" or the Calabrian ""Pitta Inchiusa"", for example, contain not only yeast dough but only ingredients that have been known for a long time, such as olive oil, onions, salt or lard. Flatbreads similar to Ligurian focaccia have been common since ancient times. Since pizza should be baked at a very high temperature, which was not possible in most households, it was initially prepared and taken to the local baker unbaked until a separate branch of the pizza maker, the pizzaiolo, emerged, who made the dough and topped it himself.  19th Century / ""Pizza Margherita""  A pizza that corresponds to today's ideas is said to have been made for the first time on June 11, 1889, in Naples by the pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito of the Pizzeria Brandi, who is said to have been commissioned to serve a pizza to King Umberto I and his wife Margherita. He is said to have patriotically decorated them with ingredients in the Italian national colors: basil (green), mozzarella (white), and tomatoes (red). This is still one of the best-known and most common, if not the most common, pizza variants under the name ""Pizza Margherita"".  However, the legend has now been refuted by historians. The queen had pizza brought to the palace by other pizza bakers beforehand. In 1880, a newspaper article about this also appeared in the Washington Post: From a list of 35 different pizza toppings, she chose eight varieties, which were then baked for her. These pizza makers weren't just Esposito. He was merely the only one who kept the receipt.  Preparation  To prepare it, a simple yeast dough must first be made from flour, water, a little yeast, salt, and a little olive oil, kneaded thoroughly and after a rising time of at least one hour at room temperature (or better overnight in the upper compartment of a refrigerator) rolled out or with floured hands stripped thin. Experienced pizza makers pull the dough over the back of their hand and widen it by circling it in the air.  Depending on the recipe, the dough is then covered with the ingredients, not too lavishly, usually with canned tomatoes or salsa pizzaiola (a previously cooked, creamy tomato sauce that is heavily seasoned with oregano, basil, garlic, and other ingredients). This is followed by cheese (e.g. mozzarella, parmesan, or pecorino) and other ingredients, and finally some olive oil.  The pizza is briefly baked at the highest possible temperature of 400 to 500 °C for a few minutes. This is done in as low a chamber as possible. Stacking in drawers or separately switchable bottom and top heat is therefore not common. The traditional cupola oven is made of brick and the heat is generated directly in the baking room via a fire. Modern pizza ovens are heated with gas or electricity.",3년 전,0,

Use a red wine to deglaze the sautee pan.Put that slurry in a pot with the rest of your ingredients.  Ok, so far, anyone reading my comments are thinking "" Soooooooo ""? But all these other ingredients make a  VERY TOP QUALITY PIZZA SAUCE. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT FINISHED.  THIS GUY SAYS TO USE SUGAR TO SWEETEN UP THE SAUCE.  DONT USE SUGAR ! I HAVE A MUCH BETTER  CONDIMENT. ADD IN A TABLESPOON AT A TIME OF ""RED THAI CHILI SAUCE"" NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH PLAIN OL THAI CHILI SAUCE.  BIG DIFFERENCE.

@badgeshands,your flour to water mixture is WAY OFF.  2 CUPS OF WATER TO 5 CUPS OF FLOUR. i needed around 7 cups of flour. then the dough did not have any flavor because of all the flour.,3년 전,1,
@LordDrashanon,"on the peel, might I suggest rice flour, its less gritty than a corn meal and doesn't get absorbed into the  dough as quickly as a wheat flour so you have a little more time to build before it gets stuck. I use rice flour to  pound and stretch the dough as well as putting a little on the peel. I find using rice flour gives me a crispier crust than I get otherwise. Also, I prefer an aluminum peel, I'm not sure that makes it stick less or not, but the thinner blade on the peel is easier to work with for me.",3년 전,0,

I was wondering if Adam or anyone else can test a theory I have? It’s recommended to use low moisture cheese so the moisture doesn’t hinder the crispy dough. I had an idea to lightly brush butter or oil onto the dough under the tomato sauce. Since oil and water do not mix, I figure this would create a moisture barrier, where the moisture from the tomato sauce & cheese would not go down into the dough. Can anyone test this, doing one pizza normally & another with oil/butter coated on the dough under the sauce, and see if it allows for a crispier crust?",3년 전,0,

Your technique is one of the better ones I've seen on YT, well done my friend.  I humbly submit you don't really need to add so much oil to your proofing containers; that amount of oil will make the dough too ""short""; if you roll the dough balls in flour after shaping & put them in your proofing bowls that have been schmeared with only a very thin layer of oil (on a paper towel), you'll have no problems releasing.",3년 전(수정됨),425,

@ChuBonk,"New york pizza is one cup flour pinch salt no white pepper and you mix until it the flour clumps, THEN you add water, and mix until you can pick it up without it sticking, THEN you knead it until you KNOW you can make a pizza with it.  Tomatos diced and mixed into paste one per pizza, cheese is quater of a cup mixed with the same in milk and water until it clumps into mozerella with a teaspoon more salt so that it will be spreadable, but you don't spread it, you knead it into a circle just like the dough, and the other toppings you work out AFTER you can make New York Pizza. One cup flour, one tomato, quater of a cup of cheese, one pinch of salt and NO WHITE  PEPPER. IF oyu follow these steps you will get a pizza baked at 70C, that's 120F, that will actually after cooling on wood or a wire rack will be able to stand on a metal pan all day and not overcook. It's more work but that's why it's famous. If you try it at home you will scream at your roof once, drop it once, and realised what cheese is once, and that's it, the hardest part is mixing the tomatos into paste, becuase it's f i v e stages, not four as it looks like.",3년 전,0,

It can be done, and it has been done. I don't think it's a unique thing either, so I can't think of one particular pizza joint that's unique because they can make authentic NY style pizza. Yes, there is a lot of mediocre and just plain bad pizza out there. But just by paying attention to the details and caring will help a restaurant make great pizza. The main issues I see with pizza in L.A. is that they use too much dough, and they don't get the sauce right. There are toppings galore, but that's not what sets New York pies apart.

@MrXaeb,"Just a couple pointers; A little less oil in your proofing pans, proof it in a warm room for 30 minutes before fridging it. You'll get a more pliable, tender product. Tossing is your friend. Start by pressing the dough out flat then lay it on a floured table and working around the edge pulling the dough with your fingertips and flat palms on the center until the dough is a third of the size of the desired finished product then start tossing. Centrifugal force is your friend. It evens the dough out perfectly because...physics. Once you have it stretched to your desired thickness (the tossing also lets you get the dough much more thin) the edges should have crowned themselves to a good height. Everything else you did is perfect.",3년 전,0,

@dablyputs,I was surprised you added the salt to the water with the yeast. Everything I know about bread baking suggests doing that actually kills some of the yeast. Watching your method I would intuitively add the salt to the flour before mixing. Your dough does seem to rise sufficiently though so this may not matter as much as I've been lead to believe. I would still be curious to see if the dough rises differently when the salt is added with the flour instead of directly to the water,3년 전,0,

And in the video the dough rolls out incorrectly, you need to roll it from the center to the edges, then all the carbon dioxide will collect in the sides and they will be hollow inside. The olive oil should have been added to the dough, not poured over the bowls.  The water should be used cold - the dough should not be heated above 21 degrees Celsius. Here is a recipe for pizza dough: 1 kilogram of flour, 500 milliliters of water, 15 grams of salt, 30 grams of sugar, 80 milliliters of olive oil, 7.5 grams of yeast.

I do know how to toss, but like you said, it's not really necessary lol. I also use a 15"" screen for the first few minutes of cooking then remove with tongs for the remaining cooking time. I usually cook it for about 10 minutes. Your pizza came out pretty nice 👍",4년 전,0,
@thetuninator1885,"Everything looked good until you added sauce, you forgot a thin layer of olive oil first (just a little, unless you like Greek style) - THEN add the sauce. No basil, paprika, rosemary, thyme, garlic salt, lots of pepper, and more oregano? You like your pizza quite bland I see. Anyway, then you add the grated cheeses, meat(s) if any, bake halfway, THEN add the mozzarella and more oregano on top, then bake the rest of the way. Stop screwing around with those half-ass cheese sticks and get yourself plenty of real shredded mozzarella non skim cheese, so much easier to work with - ANY grocery store should carry it, where do you live, in the jungle? About 8 oz. should do you fine for that size pie. Even store brands are pretty good, let alone premium brands - don't be lazy (or cheap), good pizza is worth it! Again, if you like Greek style, sprinkle a LITTLE olive oil on top of the cheese when you add it. Your technique is pretty good, it just needs a little work. Keep trying!",4년 전,0,

Romans 3:23  B-elieve that Jesus Christ died paying the penalty for your sins, and rose from the grave.  He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross. 1 Peter 2:24  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures... 1 Corinthians 15:3-4  C-all on the Lord Jesus Christ to save you, and trust only in Him for your salvation.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9  For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10:13  The moment you ""believe,"" or, put your trust in what Jesus has done for you, God saves you and your eternal destiny in Heaven is assured. You go from spiritual death to eternal life the moment you believe.

Since oil and water do not mix, I figure this would create a moisture barrier, where the moisture from the tomato sauce & cheese would not go down into the dough.

@Aderin.,​ @redcardinalist The word literally is a primary or ordinary definition of a term or expression.   In this case he's saying the 'the pizza literally changed my life' because he's trying to put emphasis on the fact that it did actually change his life.  I've also noticed that your puzzled by the fact that a pizza changed his life. Some people find cooking a hobby and everyone has different ways in cooking. The consumption of food after the process of cooking gives pleasure and releases dopamine. This pleasure is enough to change somebody's life and cooking is a regular part of life we do everyday.  So yes it did change his life and also that's a quick lesson on what 'literally' means,2년 전(수정됨),0,
@Villajumpy," @redcardinalist  It is not hard to comprehend how something can (literally) change someone's life. Especially a dish that one makes. Food brings people together, and pizza is a staple in many people's homes. This recipe IS, literally, life changing for this person, as they will continue to make it to sustain themselves and will be happier for it. They may have kids, and farther down the line, these kids may learn the recipe, as well, out of interest for a food they find to be fantastic. That's how it's life changing! Thanks. (:",1년 전(수정됨),0,

It is very reminiscent of pizzerias in New York where I grew up, but you will not get the classic crispy outside and chewy inside unless you use HIGH GLUTEN FLOUR (sorry celiacs). This used to be available at frou-frou grocery stores on the Shelf, but now I can only find it for order online. King Arthur flour sells 3 pound for about ten bucks. I know that's a fortune, but I guarantee it makes a huge difference in the pizza crust",4년 전,0,

There's loads of pizzas out there which end up soggy and oily because they overloaded it with too much high moisture cheese and toppings, sure it'd be ideal to use a slightly higher quality low-moisture mozzarella but for what you have available it actually makes sense.

@HateRedStephen,"semolina is the way to go if you make your dough wetter. u can handle a pretty high percentage hydration dough if you make a mix from semolina (40%), corn flower (20%) and normal TIPO 00 wheat flower (40%).the semolina is a larger grain flower that doesn't let the pizza stick so easily, while the normal flower is used to fill in the gaps between the semolina grains. corn flower does both. on tomatoes, you're best to either use good cans or fresh homegrown san marzano, and on the cheese, depends really what you like and what oven you have. i like the low moisture cow mozzarella, but you have to find one that is a bit of high quality, big block, no plastic cheese. also you forgot to top with some dried oregano, and that makes a huge difference, believe me. it's easy to grow, it's easy to dry and it's so much better than store bought crap.",4년 전,0,

@StefanoDiSilvio,"Nice video :) I make Neapolitan style pizza at home a lot and got pretty good at it over the last 5 years.  My tips, since you asked are: 1) You don't need 24h for the dough to rise. The slow rise in the fridge is something that restaurants do because they have to make lots of pizzas and need to manage their dough accordingly. If you want to make a few pizzas at home, 8h rise at room temperature is absolutely fine. However, if you let the dough rise at room temperature, be sure not to let it rise for over 14 hours or the dough will lose strength and the resulting pizza will be gummy and break easily (that's why restaurants prefer to use the fridge).  2) I don't know if the sugar is necessary, unless it's part of the New York Style. Sugar is only used to help activate the yeast, but even in that case I would only put one teaspoon. In the Neapolitan style, there's no sugar at all.",4년 전(수정됨),7,

@ihassquidhatt5219,thoughts to make the pizza better. one better water. water changes the flavor of the dough alot so make sure you use good clean water. u can also add a little bit of slat into the salt aswell but not to much. ontop of that i think theres still a bit to much oil especially when you put it into the bowl to wait. it ends up with the oil pooling at the bottom which can harm te flavor a bit. i think the biggets part tho is how liquidy the sauce is . i think having it be more solid either with less oil or other amounts of substance / less blending could help seeing as its very liquidy and overall allows you to add even more sauce onto the pizza if you like having more sauce. this is very noticible at 6:35 when you pull it out theres a lot of over flow and wat looks like oil kinda sitting there. another thing that would help is if you could get shreaded motzerlela expecialy with the whole oil department and spacing of the cheese but with the stuff you have its done well. i also recomend trying basil leaves. if you know the correct amount to put on for the size of the pizza and if you even enjoy them. i know alot of people who dont. otherwise great job and the pizza itself looks really nice.,4년 전,0,

@froggybear6200,"Some updates since I made this video: 1) I have been going with a wetter dough lately. Wet doughs, counterintuitively, seem to get crispier. I figure that's because they're more pliable, which allows more steam to escape during cooking. If you want a precise recipe with weights, look elsewhere. I don't like getting out my scale unless I have to. I can judge hydration pretty well by feel, and I reckon you can too with a little practice. I still think 2 and 1/4 cups water + 5 cups flour is a good starting place. Add more flour until it reaches a stickiness that you can handle. The only downside to extra hydration is that the dough becomes sticker and harder to work with. Part of the reason I went with a pretty dry dough when making this video is that I was worried about the pizza sticking to the peel while I got all the shots I needed. 2) I have started not only taking my tomatoes out of their packing liquid, but also washing them off under running water in a sieve. It's crazy, but that really makes a difference in a raw tomato sauce like this. The packing liquid is just so bitter. And I've been experimenting with different tomato brands. With really good tomatoes, I don't need the tomato paste. I would rather not use paste. 3) Many commenters have mentioned some affordable home pizza ovens that intrigue me. I think I'm going to give the Uuni a try and report back. Ultimately, my pizza still lacks the very distinctive flavor you get from baking at a thousand degrees. 4) If you have thoughtful, constructive, evidence-based advice for how I could improve my recipe, please give it to me. But if you're going to tell me I'm doing it wrong simply because you've always done it another way without interrogating why, please keep it to yourself.",4년 전,0,

Fired a lot of morons as they just refused to keep things clean and sanitary and food at safe temps and handling.  Now i say BRAVO to your Dad and his restaurant that is the way they should be run.  But come on you never go into the bodega on the corner oa a sub shop or deli and do not smell, see food safety violations. Now of course I am a food safety pro (40 yrs) and can violate at the wink of an eye.  One place in Phila a mob joint, I closed down and my life was threatened. I carried a .44 mag on my hip that afternoon.  When I went back they were still operating and I called the cops, no one would help me lock the doors only a black sgt.  I got a call and with a cop went to a meet. The person was what you call the underboss, we had a long chat and I said look get your place cleaned up and I can re open you up and I told him he had a great place, get a good chef in there and change the help around to keep it clean and safe and you will make tons of bucks.  Well he took my advice, opened up in a week, hired a great chef and staff and the food service and sanitation was outstanding. I made sure to visit weekly, to buy my lunch or buy my dinner to take home.  Never got shot, and actually got invitations to come when they had new ite,ms on the menu, which I paid for every meal, no discount etc.   So again BRAVO to your DAD in running a clean restaurant.

Topping it with mushrooms, garlic, onions, olives, maybe a meat of some kind, cheddar cheese instead of mozzeralla for some actual cheese taste instead of nice stretchy rubber also works well. If a pizza doesn't have toppings, its essentially cheese on toast, not bad just simple. For me what takes a pizza from good to great is the toppings, hopefully sliced thinly enough to cook before the cheese/base burns, but thick enough to taste. You can keep your cheese and tomato casserole though, I'm with Jon Stewart on that. (See Jon Stewart's pizza rant)",4년 전,0,

@Nobody4rpresident,"I use the same pizza/bread stone on the middle rack like Adam does here, preheated for an hour at 550°, with good results. Additionally though, and I got this from someone on line, I take my Lodge cast iron griddle and set it at the highest rack in the oven, just about 6 inches above the stone? When  heated for a full hour along with the stone, it radiates heat downward baking the pizza from the top as the stone bakes the crust from the bottom. Try it if you have a cast iron griddle. It gives about the best results you can get in a traditional oven. Like Adam, I am very interested in the Ooni Koda 16 pizza oven.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@utapao74,"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. John 3:16 -19  We're either saved by God's mercy and grace through the perfect sacrifice of God's Son at Calvary. Or, as the verses above clearly state, we stand condemned. No one needs to die condemned, holding on to their sins. Jesus bore our sins and has already paid the debt we owe for them.  Make a decision to accept Jesus today as your Lord and Savior.  Call on him in simple childlike faith and He will forgive you, and give you eternal life as a free gift.  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God  is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Romans 6:23  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves;  it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9  Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved... Acts 16:31  For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10:13",5년 전,0,

And thats how the ""Pizza Margherita"" was born and you can bet that it was without any canned tomatoes. Most of modern day recipees originate from there and even 50-100 years later when people had conserved tomates - there were no cook books with pizza recipees that included conserved tomatoes.",5년 전,0,

@contrabardus,"For better sauce use uncooked tomatoes.  The only thing that should go on a pizza precooked is meat.  If you're making a lot of red sauce for pizza, pasta, or whatever, invest in a moulinex [food mill]. It will up your sauce game considerably. I don't recommend ever using tomato paste, as it is essentially just overcooked tomatoes that have had all the moisture reduced out of them.  Chop up fresh oregano if you can get it, it makes a difference.  I don't know how you can call it pizza sauce if it doesn't have garlic in it. I'd use at least a teaspoon for about that amount. I prefer to dice fresh garlic myself, but a jar of minced garlic will do. I don't recommend garlic powder or garlic salt unless that is your only garlic option.  Optionally, red pepper flakes to taste. If you like a little heat on your pizza, it's best to add them to the sauce when you make it so the pepper flakes can soak their flavor into the sauce. Use less than you'll think you'd add as a dry topping to reach your level of spicy because it will heat up more than you probably think as it cures. If you have someone who doesn't like spicy, split your sauce up and make one spicy and one not. It's much better to have it in the sauce than as an added topping.  Once you put the sauce on the dough, put a light layer of 50\50 blend parmesean reggiano and pecorino romano cheese before adding the mozzerella and toppings. The secret of many a NY Pizza place is that it is a blend, and not one or the other.  If at all possible, get a block of parmesean reggiano and pecorino romano and grate them yourself. It does make a difference as the stuff that comes in the plastic jars is often gritty due to additives to keep it from caking up as much. A fine powder is best, but using one of those hand crank graters to shred it finely is also fine.  The canned stuff is better than not doing it at all, but should be a last resort option.  Also, be aware that relative humidity in the region you live has a bigger impact than you might think on how much water you need for baking. I live in Florida, which often has humidity as high as 90%, so I have to use less water than most baking recipes call for. In drier climates, you'll need more. The consistency of your dough is the most important thing, not following a recipe's measurements strictly.  Even the starting hydration mentioned in the video recipe is too much water for where I live. I need to start with about 1 3/4 cup, which is usually just about right and gives me a sticky, but still somewhat firm, dough ball.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@milanstevic8424,"my own self-taught practice of almost 10 years:  prep of yeast is on the track, I use the dried variant I use 600 grams of flour for 4 thin and crispy home pizzas I add salt in the dough (after blooming on sugar) -- it's a must, salt is what makes the final thing tasty, otherwise it's just papery I add enough water while working the dough to make it just about sticky so that it kind of annoys you, but it should peel of your hands on its own the final dough must be springy when pushed, but viscous enough so that it consistently flops down when left alone I also use the oil for keeping the dough in the fridge (yes 24 hrs works the best), everything this guy does is pretty much consistent sadly I don't have a stone but I'm planning on buying one  the sauce: I make my sauce custom, from fresh tomatoes I start by skin-cutting a cross on the bottom side of a tomato and grilling it slightly in a shallow stainless steel dish then I pour boiling water over it and peel off the skin entirely, throw away the water, it's not needed chop the blanched tomato into cubelets, add a slight amount of oil in the dish and reduce it until it starts resembling a thick sauce (regulate with added water if it's not done, but already starts to burn; don't panic if it does, it will only lend flavor if done slightly) you can add spices like pepper, oregano, salt, and other sauces to the final product  I occasionally make a custom pesto genovese sauce for my pizzas: you need 30-50 grams of dried basil, a handful of peanuts (or half that much pine seeds), cashew is also fine grated parmeggiano, two or three big garlic cloves (mashed), a cup of olive oil (don't be shy, it's a heavy sauce), finely cut olives (2 or 3), a quality mustard, lemon, salt -- the peanuts should be roughly ground, serving as an earthly base, I do that manually with a wide-bottom ceramic cup, but it could be done with a machine as well -- do not add too much salt because olives, and add lemon juice to taste, it brightens the whole thing up this recipe is probably 1000x better and around 50x cheaper than what you can get in a supermarket. mix it well before leaving it alone for a while  pesto genovese is an excellent sauce for pasta as well, do make a quantity of it, but definitely try it out on a pizza with some additional cheese or sour cream, olives and mushrooms.",5년 전,7,

@milanstevic8424," @peepusonionmeepus  I was like you for the longest time, but one day I decided that all pizzerias are shit. once I got my rucola (aragula) leaves completely burnt and the pizza (at any place) was consistently mediocre and overpriced. the irony is that Italy is just across the Adriatic sea where I am and my gf was disappointed with what she had in Rome compared to what is a standard here, so go figure. I've experimented a lot until I managed to find a recipe that suits my oven, and in the meanwhile I've eaten the ordered pizza maybe twice, and this wasn't at home. so I heartily recommend that we all learn how to cook properly, that's like the best way to avoid fucking cancer (for a multiple of reasons) and to learn to appreciate the good food and be able to offer it to others.",5년 전,0,

@whitealliance9540, @TheGreatCooLite  want new york pizza? Wrap a roof tile (clean) in some foil. Make a wet dough like the chef in this video said... Nyc pizza goes fast. I know a mexican who showed me the trick. 1 day raise dough recipe. Cheap cheese. Flaverful sauce. Crispy slice.   Tip. Make the pizza. Then re heat it when it's dinner time.  Nyc pizza is about the re- heat factor. Nice crispy crust.  Use the roof tile ( clean it please) wrap it in foil.,5년 전,4,

Also, sliced mozzarella is great too. I actually use both sliced mozzarella and provolone. I also agree, wetter dough seems to work better in a home oven. I have a Wolf, so it’s great at making pizza. One more thing.....I use a piece of granite for a stone. It’s heavy, so be careful, and it takes an hour to heat up, but it does a great job.

@נמרודנמרוד-ת9י,"Why is love according to the method of the ""baal hasulam"" The wisdom of Kabbalah,  is the solution to all troubles for humanity? Because all nature is a force, a feature, a system, a formula of love.  Of connection and unity between opposites, between hot and cold, hard to soft, white and black, male and female, sweet and bitter, light and dark.  In every atom and particle, in every inanimate plant and life, the whole universe and beyond, the whole reality is the result of a connection between opposites.  For humanity and the individual, one power rules from the day of birth, hatred of others and self-love at its expense, egoism.  By combining the power of love with the equation, man maintains the connection between the opposites and thus stops resisting nature, and enters into harmony with it, which is the goal of nature, to do good to creatures.  Until then, man will suffer great and immense suffering in order to recognize and submit to the demand of nature, He must strive in his power and choice in loving others. Thus he will acquire intellect and wisdom to connect the two opposites and will complete the nature that was created with unintentional intent, but rather man must complete it, and manage it, and bring it to perfection.  And why did nature do that? (Nature and God are the same gematria 86)  In order for man to grow and develop in his free choice and thus conduct creation as the conductor of an orchestra,   And if man had been created in advance corrected and perfected?  So he was like a perfect animal, dog and cat. But their rank as a robot is controlled with no free choice but absolute instinct dominates them.   After all, a real benefit from a father to his son is nothing but that the son rises and grows according to the rank of his father and even above him. We were to conquer nature just like the one who created it. And not when judging and living a dog and a cat.  If so the solution Is not in increasing the hatred from which it is not lacking and will never be lacking because that is how it has been imprinted on us from the day of birth (Media you do a very bad job just a pity a lot of beatings along the way !!!!)  Nor in the abolition of hatred because it is power is in nature and should not be abolished.  But only in the addition of love and connection and oneness addition upon addition while being aware of the process.  The people of Israel will wake up !!! Followed by the whole world !!!!!  Nature (G-d) requires connection and oneness and if not, he has every means to educate man and humanity until his surrender.  He will not rest or sleep until the purpose of creation is completed. To do good to creatures. Come, O Bnei Yisrael, you are the first to realize this study !!!!!!!! And when you know, you will teach your brothers the peoples of the world.  This is called light to the Gentiles.  And this is a job we do not deserve at all in the meantime.  ""For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples!""  Love friends only love. It is the solution for every individual and for everyone together.  how?  To do propaganda of connection and not of separation and hatred ..",5년 전,1,

The string cheese is kinda ghetto, but still works better than finely shredded cheese. Finely shredded is good for tacos, but melts and burns way too fast on pizza. The coarse shredded or flat slice mozzarella works best.  You never mention toppings. It's a mistake to put on toppings last after the cheese.

@evilqtip7098,Love your video I will give you my recipe the dough when I'm making it is exactly like you except I use 7-Up or Sprite instead of cups of water. Then I use bacon I cook bacon and I take the liquid fat and I take a brush and when the pizza dough spread out before the sauce is added I use the brush to spread the Bacon Fat along the edges of the pizza crust and a light amount all over the pizza crust itself then I add the sauce but in my sauce I blend baby spinach I blend the seasonings like you but not as much I blend a few other things for Taste I'll give you the details later but it really brings out the taste in the pasta sauce I use hunts sauce not the Italian Tomatoes I use the hot sauce it's excellent it really tastes good then the mozzarella cheese  I used SAPUTO. It's the best cheese in the world then I use slices of old style sausage pepperoni which I've cut myself pretty lightly cooked and then added the Italian sausage to the on top of the mozzarella on the pizza then I add micro slices of bacon all around the sausage to bring out more flavour and it makes the pizza outstanding and then once I cook that I add light sprinkle of sliced mozzarella and then I bake the top intensely to almost like a crispy Brown then I take out the pizza I let it sit and then I got it all the way through and place it only on a wooden board no plastic no dishwashing wooden bord hand wash... People love my pizza  3 layers of cheese in the end .. palmisano over the sauce then mozzarella then the sausage and the bacon pizzas cooked then a light sprinkle of mozzarella cheese to thicken the cheese on top heavy baked 500 Degrees till it's a Chrisp Brown very important Not burnt !!!!!,5년 전,0,

," @fishstew2573   Right on...   Uh...  How do you say your name?   @?  At?   Is that your name?   At?     Well, At, I am starting a pizza take-n-bake pizza chain in the US and I love watching videos to get ideas, but I've pretty much got my recipes down.   It wasn't easy.  In fact, I spent two years developing and perfecting my dough but I've got it.  When I got the ingredients and the measurements down, I found the order in which I added them made a huge difference to the flavour and consistency of the dough so I had to develop the manner in which to add the carefully measured out ingredients into the mixing bowl.   Believe me, it makes a huge difference.   I'm not saying one way is better than the other, but if you're looking for specific things in a crust, you have to take things like how and when to add your salt to your recipe.   I add my salt to the water because the water evenly distributes the salt much better because all flour will be moistened by the water.   I might not be using the best way to say it, but you get the gist of what i'm saying!!!  Are you in the States?   If so, I would like to invite you to Las Vegas and/or Seattle where we will be having test kitchens for our pizzas.   We have people come and try out several different types of pizzas.   It's actually really fun and really cool.",5년 전,0,

If it were not for COVID you could probably stop by your local chain pizza place and ask them to show you a few tips (preferably during the day when they are not busy.)  Most of the people I've worked with in pizza would be happy to show off their skills and teach you a thing or two :)",5년 전,0,

@TonecrafteLuthiery,"Careful not to use too much yeast when you're making dough at home. This is one of the few things in cooking where eyeballing your measurements really is a bad idea. It gives the dough a really unpleasant beer-ish sort of taste that makes it hard to eat more than a couple bites. It even upsets my stomach if there's enough of it in there. If you can taste the yeast immediately, it's probably too much yeast. Not a bad idea to proof a smaller piece of dough separately from your main batch so you can test it half way through proofing just to be sure. You don't wanna find out right before dinner that you put too much yeast in the dough and it's basically inedible lol.",5년 전,0,

That way you can use even higher quality taste mozzarella compared to the sticks.",5년 전(수정됨),595,

Now we going to get the dough, like on thr video lets divide it in 4 piece, making them circular, We knead it and make it flatten always to form a circle, or if you want to do it squarely but only if you have a pot on purpose, then we get the sugo And with a spoon we spread it over the pizza dough, after making this, we going to get the mozzarella, cut it in little pieces and take it over the pizza, now after making that Let's go bake it at 200/220° for 15 minutes or 20 (depends by the oven) after that we taking the pizza out the oven, we going to take the oil And spread some on the pizza, and we're done",4년 전,0,

@ZennExile,"Pizza stone is overrated, just use a big cast iron pan, put the pan in while you preheat oven, put it on the stovetop over medium heat to keep the pan from cooling while you assemble your pizza in the hot pan.  And if you keep burning the backs of your fingers, just flip the pan upside down.  Make sure the bottom of the pan is clean and well seasoned though.  This method is much faster, and provides the exact same quality as a pizza stone.  You can also modify this method slightly to make a deep dish, or a big fluffy homemade pizza.  And if you desperately want the burnt crust spots, you can heat that cast iron pan over medium high heat on the stovetop and get it tearin hot before you assemble your pizza in and finish under the broiler.",5년 전,5,

@LDTube-pz9fq,"you put the dough in the fridge because it needs time to mature but outside of the fridge it would rise too soon and then deflate, so in the drige the rising is slowed down a lot so the dough has the time to get its maturation, so you might not see any rising untile 10-14 hours depending how cool your fridge is",5년 전,0,

@eleanachristodoulou,It did but not to much I think. It did make a little foam but then it stopped. I left the dough 24 hrs in the fridge and nothing changed. Also I think the yeast I used was wrong.

@connorkenway09,"Despite risking your dough to stick a bit to the container, dusting or oiling your dough ball before putting it in the contain is one of the worse things you can do. You risk that your dough will become dry skinned or get soaked in oil. The way to avoid this is by kneading each dough ball instead of just squeezing it in your hands. If you do that there is chance you''ll have dough that doesn't want to rise and no gluten being developed.",5년 전,0,

@dansaniti3651,This is a great recipe and thank you very much for sharing. Both the crust and sauce are excellent. I had difficulties trying to stretch the dough thin enough. Tried it a few times and was not happy with my results. Then I really paid attention to the amount of flour and kneeling time. This takes some time to get it right. You said 5 cups of flour was conservative and it is. I’m sure my measurements would be more exact if I used weight. I spent 1 week at Kansas State University (KSU) taking a flour milking class. One whole day was in the baking lab. They used weight to be most accurate and consistent. But a good baker/cook and figure this out if not initially then overtime.  You stated that the dough should only be slightly sticky. This was my first mistake. I needed more flour but was afraid to add too much. I got it dialed in now. Then I can’t stress enough to kneed the dough long enough. Another mistake I made. You know when you have kneed the dough enough not by time but by look and feel. The mixer bowl will be CLEAN. All of the residue on the sides of the mixer bowl will get incorporated and the dough will be very smooth.  Thanks again for sharing! Dan,5년 전,0,

@idrow1,"I lived in the NYC area my whole life and have been making my own pizza for many years.  You're on the right track using the Cento brand of tomatoes, but try the Cento pizza sauce they make.  On it's own, it's not impressive, but something magical happens to it when you add a teaspoon of sugar, a teaspoon of italian seasoning (not just oregano, but a blend of oregano, basil, marjoram, etc).  I haven't tried adding olive oil to the sauce, but I will next time to see if that makes a difference.  I do use a lot of olive oil in my dough like you do, but I use a 3 times the yeast.  I'm going to try cutting it down and letting it rise in the fridge, I've never prepped it that way before.  I always thought it had to be a warm environment.  I have the exact same stone you have and have found that 15 minutes at 450 was plenty to bring it to temp.  An hour is crazy for preheating.  I always par-bake the crust for 3 minutes to make it easier to work with, I just know it'll fuse to the peel and make it impossible to get on the stone.  Now you're using a wetter dough than what's in the vid and I have no idea how you're getting it on there from the peel, but more power to you.  I'm not that confident or brave, lol.",5년 전,0,

@LDTube-pz9fq,"​ @christianlorenzon8116  Duccio Fabbri se siete scandalizzato è perché di pizza non capite un cazzo. Prima di tutto la maturazione in frigorifero è un processo normalissimo, usato in tutta Italia e da tantissime pizzerie, serve a fare coincidere lievitazione e maturazione. Secondo ungere il panetto con l'impasto è qualcosa che non cambia assolutamente il sapore (troppo poco l'impasto) ma evita la formazione della crosta quando non si hanno i cassettoni adatti per la conservazione. Infine, basta vedere il risultato finale per capire che quella è una signora pizza, se parliamo di produzione casalinga. Ho visto dozzine di italiani chiamare pizza prodotti biscottati, alti senza alcun tipo di puntinatura o colore e poi giustificarsi con il fatto che ""in casa non può venire di meglio"". Vi ricordo che la new york style pizza è stata inventata da italiani, o meglio campani, che una volta giunti a new york hanno deciso di aprire pizzerie ma, senza il peso di dover fare i conti con i tradizionalisti (e il tradizionalismo è una cazzata perché in realtà le ricette originali non sono necessariamente le migliore e anzi con il tempo abbiamo affinato tecniche e conoscenze per ottenere prodotti dal sapore migliore di quello che avevano un secolo o più fa) e cercando quindi di fare un prodotto con più formaggio, con un impasto più abbrustolito, con una cottura che sciogliesse pomodoro e mozzarella a differenza della tradizione che vuole il fiordilatte appena appena sciolto. Il risultato è comunque eccezionale se l'aveste assaggiato. Ci sono volte che ho voglio di una campana con il cornicione, condimento moderato... e a volte che ho proprio voglio di una pizza NY style.",5년 전,1,

@ducciofabbri9244,"LD.Tube prima di tutto se si parla di lievitazione si parla di una lievitazione a temperatura ambiente, quando si mette l’impasto in frigo si usa principalmente per una buona maturazione e conservazione. Poi a livello di gusto non puoi paragonare una pizza con morbidezza e leggerezza, con una grande qualità d’ingredienti sopra, rispetto ad un disco di pasta biscottoso con mozzarella finta. Detto ciò, ognuno ha i suoi gusti, ma devi tener conto che la lievitazione deve avvenire a temperatura ambiente, mentre la maturazione in frigo. Non come lui che una volta finito l’impasto e averlo riempito d’olio lo mette direttamente in frigo. E poi l’olio non è necessario, anche se non si hanno i contenitori giusti basta utilizzare una teglia con pellicola e sigillarlo. L’olio aumenta solo l’idea razione e rende l’impasto più “grasso”",5년 전,0,

This life is what, 78.8 years on average, but we can spend eternity (forever) with him in paradise. Even while still alive on earth he can give you a peace that passes all understanding and I can testify to that!  Jesus has healed me of an addiction that I had for 13 plus years. You can always talk to Jesus no matter who you are and what you have done :) he loves you.  And he can be a true mother and father to the motherless and fatherless and to those who have parents. He is someone who you can always confide in ! God bless and Jesus loves you ! Stay safe during this time. Don’t give up, throw in the towel on your life or end it, to the one reading this God has great purpose for your life!   Jeremiah 29:11 and God says:, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”  John 3:16 “ For God so loved the world that he sent his one and only son that whoever shall believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life”",5년 전,1,

@mussaratshaheen6951,Ben Dover don’t be so ignorant and respect others beliefs and do your research before u make such statements islam promotes peace and Islam does not condone what osama bin laden did Islam says that if you kill any innocent person you are no longer a Muslim although Osama bin laden claims to be Muslim he is NOT AT ALL since Islam doesn’t condone the actions he caused he only says he is a Muslim too put a negativity and hatred on Muslims it’s 2020 you should know that by now and as you say Muslims will set humans behind a long run the phone u are using right now to say negative things about Islam wouldn’t have been created if it weren’t Muslims who are of as you say “Islam the backwards religion” and I will elaborate Muslims created algebra which is one the most important things in math and humanity would be worse anyway with the algebra the Muslims created it turned into algorithms and with algorithms became phones . Muslims also created many other invention which are very important to humanity today and king Akrem don’t let his negativity put you down and like prophet Muhammad (PBUH) told us to educate rather than insult .and Ben Dover no said anything bad about atheism although it is false you decided to say bad things about Islam I mean can’t we just live in a world where people can have peace and can have their own beliefs without people like you hating on it anyway I suggest you read the holy Quran and hopefully that educates u on Islam anyway have a good day bye :),5년 전,1,

@shortsaleyoda,Try two pizza stones.  Cook the pizza on the stone on the top of the oven and the last two minutes switch it to the lower tone that will be very hot and crisp that crust up lightning fast.  Two stones work best IMO.  The finishing stone really crisps up the bottom of that beautiful pizza.  Enjoy!!!,5년 전,0,

@TheCaro2,"Tomato sauce: When you mix it with blender, you also break the tomato seeds which adds more bitterness to the sauce. Instead of putting tomato paste in it, drop the sauce to a stainless steel sieve - and turn it around couple of times -> water pours away and you are left with much more intense tomato sauce. If you want to have a bit more punch, add white vinegar (or for extra flavour apple wine vinegar).  For the dough: after first mix the dough can be quite sticky. Run couple of flap'n'fold rounds and let the dough rest. It will build up more viscosity and after couple of resting/flap'n'fold rounds it won't stick anymore :)",5년 전,95,

After the firs 4 hour make another dough with 640g flour, 400ml water, 20g yeast, and make it  rise/leaven/grow for 1 hour.  Than merge the first dough with the second one and make it  rise/leaven/grow 2 more hour. After that you take the dough and split in to some small buns 100g each.

@LDTube-pz9fq,"Yeah the true Naples pizza is great, with the fluffy round frame but I think this style of pizza, as shown in this video is great too and the result is amazing for a home-made pizza in a conventional oven, most italians at home make horrible pizza that looks like ""fette biscottate"" First of all, you don't use mozzarella for pizzas and certainly not bufala mozzarella, the worst choice possible in a pizza. You use fiordilatte which is low moisture but you actually make it even more low moisture by straining it in a colander for days, which is what they do in pizzerias even though often the pizzeria already buy low-moisture fiordilatte in bulk from the providers. This happens everywhere including Naples. The low-moisture fiordilatte is actually very close in taste to galbani low-moisture mozzarella sticks.  You don't get the milky, creamy, juicy taste of a fresh mozzarella because that's not what you would use for pizza unless you want it to drown in cheese liquid. So yes, a fresh buffalo mozzarella out of the dairy factory is clearly superior in taste to Galbani sticks BUT the kind of low moisture fiordilatte you use in pizzerias for the pizza is actually bland enough to be very very close to the galbani sticks. Most NY style pizza is even superior in taste to most sub-par italian pizzerias. Not even in Naples every pizzeria is good, far from the it. You can't expect everyone to be Sorbillo or Michele. And I agree with those that say that traditions can be improved. The truth is that most recipes taste better now than they did one or two centuries ago, because food conservation and our knowledge of food chemisty has improved. So it's not true that traditional recipes are always better and any modern modification is always worse.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@VinDcator,"I like fresh oregano, don't care about San Marzano and certainly don't need the excess acid. I do better with a combo  shredded blend of part-skim moz/provolone, then add Pecorino.

@pplo,"that's .... interesting. I've grown up in Brazil, with some friends of mine who had this old pizza recipe. We used to make parties - we also had a band - where we sold pizza slices and beer, along w/ the free (not so good) music.  well, I've learned their way and still doing it every month, at least. But we do bunches. At least 20 pizzas (about 3kg of flour and 1,5 kg of mozarela). I garantee you, it is very tasty. I actually improved the proccess and the recipe to my taste, so I can make 30 pizzas in about 3 hours - eating them as I make them. We do pizza parties, for about 15 people at my family's property, where we have a proper wood oven.  For me is funny to do your way, seems too complicated. Also I only use fresh tomatoes - not canned ones. No tomato paste. Also no oregano, because I don't like it too much. But I do use some garlic, sometimes onions, I like to do it freestyle. Well I'm just sharing my way, it's a very fun event , we do a lot of wine as well, and sometimes we do let people choose their toppings. I really like the classic ones - like this one on the video, but I also enjoy mushrooms and ginger. you'd be surprised. leeks are great as well. One thing I found great about my way is that we decide to do it in the afternoon, couple of hours later we are eating pizza.  One last fact is that my friend's father created a portable wood oven, made of mud, wire mash and some secret ingredients. It is small, heats very fast, consumes very little wood, and we took it everywhere. It comes with a kit - the stone, some tools and it's awesome.  anyway great video, and great looking pizza. I'll have to do one myself right now..",5년 전,0,

@prajeetachamlagai6668,"New York-style pizza at home  (Makes four 12-inch pizzas)  For the dough:  1 teaspoon active dry yeast 1 teaspoon sugar ¼ cup warm water  2 cups warm water 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon salt ¼ cup olive oil 5 cups bread flour, plus more as needed  Bloom the yeast in a stand mixer bowl with the teaspoon of sugar and ¼ cup water. When it’s frothy, add the rest of the ingredients and mix with the dough hook until a smooth ball comes together. It should be only slightly sticky; if it’s very sticky, add additional flour. Divide dough into four equal parts, roll each into a smooth ball and place in its own, well-oiled bowl. Age in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours or up to a week.  For the sauce:  1 28-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes ¼ cup olive oil ½ teaspoon sugar, or more to taste 1 teaspoon dried oregano 2 tablespoons tomato paste  Remove tomatoes from their canning liquid and discard the liquid. Squish or blend the tomatoes until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and mix until smooth. Makes enough for four pizzas.  For the cheese:  6 ounces whole-milk, low-moisture mozzarella per pizza Grated parmesan for dusting  Assembly:  Place pizza stone on middle rack and preheat oven on its maximum temperature for one hour. Use convection setting, if available. After pre-heating, stretch pizza dough and place on a well-dusted peel (stone-ground whole-wheat flour works best). Top with sauce, dusting of parmesan, and then the mozzarella. Bake for 5-6 minutes. Rest on cooling rack before slicing.",5년 전,0,

@gregcantelli594,"Here's a suggestion for the cooking. I've found it best to go to a flooring place and buy unglazed quarry tiles instead of a stone. They usually come in 6 x 6 pieces so buy 16. Put 6 on the rack your going to cook on, six on a rack above the cooking surface and prop 2 on each side. You're basically creating a brick oven in your oven. You get heat from the stones underneath, from above and on the sides. It really helps getting that browning on the cheese. Not to mention you can get the tiles for about a buck a piece and they'll last forever. IMPORTANT: Make sure the tiles are UNGLAZED.",5년 전,0,

@kevint5391,Are used to be a New York pizza guy when I was younger 30 years ago.When you take the dough out of the refrigerator you should smush it down and take the air out of it The more you do this the last bubbles you will get when you cook it. I also noticed that you should be making your pieces of mozzarella cheese much smaller.This allows it to melt more evenly I thought personally you’re a giant chunks were a little big.,5년 전,0,

@RealHankShill,"I can tell you one thing, from experience.  When you ball your dough, you want to stretch the dough across the top, then use your fingers on the bottom side to tuck all those bits up and inside the middle.  You do this a couple of times, and you wind up with a perfect ball that has a small entrance on the bottom.  You are almost getting the technique, but you seem to be doing it one hand at a time.  It should be both hands at the same time, once you tuck once you rotate the ball 90 degrees and tuck again.  Whole thing should take like a second.  Stop by a pizza place one time and ask them if you can watch them ball their dough.  You are right, the shape is absolutely critical to making a round and uniform thickness.  If you dont tuck it well, you wont make a round pizza, or even worse, you wont get a uniform thickness and usually will get holes pull through.",5년 전,0,

@danielm8151,"Fantastic video and very helpful.   One suggestion I can make to those who have trouble like me with the wood pizza peel from time to time,  if you build your pizza on a metal tray (with or without holes are both fine) then place that on the stone for a minute or two for the bottom to harden a bit, you can then slide the pie off the metal tray and directly onto the stone for the remainder of cooking.   I especially need to do this with more ingredients on the pie that can go flying if you aren't careful retracting the wood peel.    Downside is you open the oven again, but if you've heated the stone long enough it won't matter much.",5년 전,0,

@mario9133,"Your dough is way too dry compared to mine.  Mine is very sticky by the time I am done mixing it.  I almost have to scrape it off the bowl but, to each its own. I would never keep the oven on for one hour just to heat up the stone.  No way....  What a waste of energy. I place my stone at the bottom of the oven, directly over the burners.  It gets burning hot in 15 minutes max. The trick is...  I have to move it up to the middle shelf just before sliding the pizza on to it.  It can be tricky and if you prone to accidents and getting burned in the kitchen be ready, it will probably happen to you.  Be careful when moving the stone.  It is heavy.  At least mine is. Once I move the stone, I close the oven for another 5 minutes to let it get back to the temperature it was prior to me opening the door.  I cook my pizza at 375 ºF.  for about 15 minutes however, I have to say, I do check on it quite often during that time.  What I am looking for is a crispy bottom.  Once the bottom is crispy, I only wait long enough for the cheese to get a little brown.  That is it. Oh...  When I take the pizza out, I also take the stone.  That is, I take the pizza with the stone, and keep it on it while we eat.  It keeps the bottom nice and crispy and the whole thing piping hot.  Just the way we like it here at home. Honestly...  I have been to NY several times and every time, of course, I had to have pizza.  There is just nothing like it but, I must say...  When I eat the one I make at home, I feel accomplished and very, very satisfied and happy with the results.",5년 전,0,

@xAlcoholicGamer,Easier to just buy a round pan to start the pizza off in. Pull the pizza out of the pan when it's half way done cooking. Then throw it on that stone to brown bottom.  I'll even typically heat the dough + sauce before adding the cheese. Helps cook the dough to a nice crunch but keeps the cheese gooey. - I worked the kitchen in a pizza joint through college.,5년 전(수정됨),0,

I ate the pizza, with nothing but cheese, tomato sauce and doe (thats why I'm telling you. NY style after all is the 'same'). After eating it i was shocked, because I clearly tasted this fish sauce flavour. I later asked an italian friend if they had something like fishsauce in italy or why it tasted the way it did. She told me, they sometimes take one or two sardines, smash them with a hammer and add them to their tomato sauce. This might be worth a try for you to amplify your flavor even more.

Umh, btw I'm not a big fan of the fridge, you will a better leavened with dough in the oven off, for like 10 hours.   Sorry for the snooty comments, maybe it's super tasty but you can do much better!

@Kr1stmas,Really good video but if you let it rise for 2 days you can really go slow on the yeast and you definitely don't need to add sugar to the dough. Also if you want it more authentic you can cut up real mozzarella and leave it to dry in the fridge so it loses some of the moisture and doesn't water up the pizza in the oven,5년 전,0,

@TheUbner,"For the dough:  1 teaspoon active dry yeast 1 teaspoon sugar ¼ cup warm water  2 cups warm water 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon salt ¼ cup olive oil 5 cups bread flour, plus more as needed  Bloom the yeast in a stand mixer bowl with the teaspoon of sugar and ¼ cup water. When it’s frothy, add the rest of the ingredients and mix with the dough hook until a smooth ball comes together. It should be only slightly sticky; if it’s very sticky, add additional flour. Divide dough into four equal parts, roll each into a smooth ball and place in its own, well-oiled bowl. Age in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours or up to a week.  For the sauce:  1 28-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes ¼ cup olive oil ½ teaspoon sugar, or more to taste 1 teaspoon dried oregano 2 tablespoons tomato paste  Remove tomatoes from their canning liquid and discard the liquid. Squish or blend the tomatoes until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and mix until smooth. Makes enough for four pizzas.  For the cheese:  6 ounces whole-milk, low-moisture mozzarella per pizza Grated parmesan for dusting  Assembly:  Place pizza stone on middle rack and preheat oven on its maximum temperature for one hour. Use convection setting, if available. After pre-heating, stretch pizza dough and place on a well-dusted peel (stone-ground whole-wheat flour works best). Top with sauce, dusting of parmesan, and then the mozzarella. Bake for 5-6 minutes. Rest on cooling rack before slicing.   Thank me Later :D",5년 전,0,

My favourite pizza is with BBQ base, dough is filled with chese and covered in 5 different types of peppers including jalapenos. I doubt that recipe comes from ancient Rome....it is an originale ,even though it is an improvement on the recipe from Italy, if you would look further you would come to realise that the originale from Italy is an improvement from some other place, perhaps greece or malta or middle east and their pitta bread...who know? who cares?",5년 전,0,

Pizza in a conventional oven doesn’t work. You need a coal brick oven that gets extremely hot. And you have to have New York tap water.  The pizza when you hold it out straight should touch your wrist. The cheese should run with juices when you bite into it and be very chewy.

Skim milk is a nightmare and everyone should know you are going to make a mess if you use it for pizzas, calzones or lasagna. Also the slow rise of your dough in the fridge is very important.

@typingcat," @ojgimpson  The thing is I do not have an oven. Many people in East Asia do not have an oven. Only a gas stove and a microwave oven. Gas oven is expensive and heavy. Electric oven is smaller and relatively cheaper, but the problem is that electricity pricing is ""progressive"" in Korea. That is, the pricing is not directly proportional to the amount of usage. Something like that if you use twice as much, than the price gets 4 times as higher. This system was made to discourage people form using a lot of electricity back in the 1970's, when oil was very expensive, but have not been changed since then.",5년 전,0,

If you cook your sauce then the sauce won't taste like actual tomato and it will be sweeter. Also to get an even layer of sauce, take a ladle poor in the middle and go around in a circular motion with the ladle to spread evenly. From a New Yorker that worked in a pizzeria, that pizza is pretty damn close, heating the plate is very important and I'm surprised you know that you should do it, if you don't want your pizza to burn, take the paddle and turn the pizza once or twice as it bakes.

Not terrible, but not worth the trip.   Home made is the way to go.  I don't have a wood fired pizza oven yet, but I have everything else so I'm about 50% there.  NY pizza is on the right track, but they lost their way many years ago.   It's not bad pizza, but it's terrible compared to other pizzas.  I'm going to cook a simple Margarita pizza tomorrow and have actual Italian Parmesan and a decent mozzarella.  My home cooked pizza blows away the NY stuff.  I'm not quite sure how they got a reputation of having world class pizza, but I'll take just about anything from someone who cares.  It's better than frozen, but absolutely not worth a trip to NY.   We will eat anything with cheese on some bread.  Most of us aren't too picky.  I drove 1500 miles for an award winning pizza that was no better than what I make at home.

@nonenoneonenonenone,"Looks very good. I watched the cooks recently at the pizza place in Penn Station. They drizzle the dough with olive oil before the Parmesan cheese layer. Often the Parmesan is mixed with some seasoning, probably oregano and pepper. In many New York places, the sauce is only chopped tomatoes, so it is light in color and sweet tasting, maybe they add sugar. To be truly authentic, you have to bake the pizza, then let it sit out for a few hours, then re-heat it. Then it's what you get in a pizza parlor. The one I know best uses half semolina flour and half bleached white flour in the dough. It is much more digestible than other places, and helps it have a good crusty bottom. They also use semolina to coat the bottom. So, in many New York pizza parlors, the satisfying taste really comes from the generous use of olive oil, and the melted fat from the cheese. The sauce is secondary. The trick is not to make the dough too thin, so it will support the weight of toppings.",5년 전,0,

@toxendon,"​ @silviannistor  Dude I am a follower of a pizza enthusiast site on Facebook and let me tell you, the amount of esoteric knowledge in the pizza-making world is insane. For example, I now know the tool for flour quality measurement is called “Alveograph Chopin"". Also the index of bread making capacity is called ""W"". I also now know how to apply the baking percentage formua.   It involves counting all ingredients as a percentage of the flour, where the flour is always 100%. If a recipe should have 1 kilo of flour, 65% water, 0.5% yeast and 3% salt, the recipe will be as follows: 1000 grams of flour, 650 grams of water, 5 grams of yeast and 30 grams of salt. This way it becomes easy to change the amount of dough. Because if you are going to use 1500 grams of flour (which is 100% then) you will need 975 grams of water, 7.5 grams of yeast and 45 grams of salt.  Yeah.",5년 전,38,

@d4c_solos07,"​ @toxendon  man you fucked up. see if you combine stuff, the combination of all that together is 100%, to make that combination you need 65 % water, 0.5 % yeast and 3% salt, which is 68.5 % altogether. The only other ingredient is flour. 100%-68.5%=31.5%(flour) So, if you want to make 1 kilo of pizza's ""bread"", you'll need: 650 grams of water, 5 grams of yeast, 30 grams of salt, 315 grams of flour. I used chemistry here, although i understand your comment. When you say ""Because if you are going to use 1500 grams of flour"" the flour goes for x 50%, to make perfect pizza's bread, the water needs to go: flour x 65%, yeast: flour x 0.5%, salt: flour x 3%. 1500 x 65%=975g, 1500 x 3%=45g, 1500 x 0.5 %=7.5 g  honestly idk why that pizza enthusiast fucked up the recipe, since its so fucking confusing, but I showed u both ways you can approach this. the 1st way is: how much pizza's ""bread"" you want, and the 2nd way is using flour as the 100%, aka pizza's ""bread"" is 100%(flour) + 68.5%(water, yeast and salt)=pizza's ""bread""   the 2nd way has no logic whatsoever in chemistry's logic, because that would mean the pizza's ""bread"" is actually 168.5 %, not actually 100%(all mixtures are 100%, no matter what their ingredients are)   Yeah.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

I've lived in the NYC area before and know proper pizza when I see it, and Me-n-Ed's was some of the best I've ever had.     So, the recipe Me-n-Ed's used was half white and half wheat flour for the dough, and half mozzarella and half monterrey jack for the cheese.

@aleksanderlarsen7943," @eemelinenonen4322  the dough wasent as elastic as in the video but thats most likely because of the flour. Just used something I found in my locas store thats called pizza-flour.   But I managed to stretch it out and take the parts with much dough and kind of push it out to the sides to make it bigger and thinner. Gave up expanding it in the air like our friend in the video and just distributed the dough on a pizza paper. Dont have a pizzastone either.  But even so, with lack of equipment I think the result was very good. It was easy too. I think the machine he used does make a muck better dough but you can get good pizza without it",5년 전,1,

@toxendon," Jeremy Owww my eye Stephens  Dude I am a follower of a pizza enthusiast site on Facebook and let me tell you, the amount of esoteric knowledge in the pizza-making world is insane. For example, I now know the tool for flour quality measurement is called “Alveograph Chopin"". Also the index of bread making capacity is called ""W"". I also now know how to apply the baking percentage formua.   It involves counting all ingredients as a percentage of the flour, where the flour is always 100%. If a recipe should have 1 kilo of flour, 65% water, 0.5% yeast and 3% salt, the recipe will be as follows: 1000 grams of flour, 650 grams of water, 5 grams of yeast and 30 grams of salt. This way it becomes easy to change the amount of dough. Because if you are going to use 1500 grams of flour (which is 100% then) you will need 975 grams of water, 7.5 grams of yeast and 45 grams of salt.  Yeah.",5년 전,5,

I couldn't find low moisture whole milk mozzarella so I just got whole milk mozzarella and it worked just fine for me, I also crushed the tomatoes with my fingers to give a chunky texture, and combined with the mozzarella with more moisture my pizza ended fairly juicy while crisp, and with a crisp dough the contrast was really nice. I aged my dough and ate it in 3 batches last time, 2 hours, 3 days, and 6 days. The 2 hours didn't work out and the dough wasn't nice. And while the 3 days and 6 days both worked the 6 days just tastes soo much better and smelled a lot better too.

@socksclub9103,You didn't season your pizza stone instead of the pizza?,5년 전,1,
@ElfGreatTree,"Note: Ive made pizza on and off for 35 years (first at home, then restaurants). I don't consider myself an expert at this by any means, but I'll share my impressions of the video as I watch.  1) Pizza sauce is good for 3 days after you make it, after that it should be thrown out. Don't go using old sauce; age does not improve it. If you didn't add any basil, you are missing out, IMO. A few shakes of crushed red pepper is also a nice addition but optional.  2) That first batch of dough looked a little too dry after you mixed it, or you just mixed the hell out of it. Cut that mix time back a little. Dough is alive, no need to kick its ass to make it do what you want - persuade it instead.  3) Like sauce, dough is good for 72 hours max after its been made, after that you are just fighting blown out pancake batter doughy crap and that wont get you pizza worth a damn at all.  4) Absolutely put flour on a flat surface, lay the dough on that, then stretch it there. Playing with dough in your hands is what little kids do. Watch some videos about how either Domino's or Papa John's stretch their dough, either method will work fine (they are quite similar).  5) Cheese: if you want parm on it, thats fine but consider that Chicago style can include provelone cheese. Little Caesar's mix of cheese is 2/3 Mozarella, 1/3 Muenster, all freshly cut in the store (not sure if they've changed that in the 25 years since I last worked at Ceasar's).  6) I would not shake the paddle with a pizza on it, just make sure there is plenty of flour or cornmeal to keep it from sticking. Also you might want to supplement your tools with a metal peel which will have a thinner edge on it for removing the pizza from the stone. Restaurant supply houses locally or online will have peels of varying lengths (not expensive, either...). Remember: Paddle for putting in, peel for taking out.  7) Even spreading of the sauce. I can't stress enough how important it is to start in the middle with 4-5-6 spoons of sauce, then spread it out in a spiral from the middle, checking that its an even coating all the way around. Keep the spoon flat! Then you can move side to side across the top evening it up after that. Everyone likes different amounts of sauce so experiment and find what your favorite amount is, I like 6-7 good spoon fulls on top, then made into an even layer and a consistent distance from the edge of the crust too. Practice makes perfect!  Same thing with toppings and cheeses too, start with flat stuff like pepperoni or ham, then work your way up to chunky things like bacon, sausage, mushrooms, onions, pineapple etc. Then cheese that sucker!  Some shops cheese on the bottom to make the toppings more prominent, some throw everything on the sauce, then cheese last so thats a matter of personal preference as well. I do it either way. A nice sprinkling of sharp cheddar over the top (just a little) adds some nice color as well.  8) Dollar Tree has a decent pizza cutter for a buck, depending on the size of your cutting board you might have to maneuver it a little to cut edge to edge, but meh...not a big deal. A larger wooden cutting board would be another nice addition to your tools.  That final result looks nice!   As long as YOU like it, then its the best pizza ever. I hope this comment can help someone who wants to make pizza at home - keep in mind what was said about that oven getting up to temp, he's absolutely right and especially since he used a pizza stone. They take a long while to get hot but thats how you get good results.",5년 전,75,

If you use mineral water in the dough it gives it a more New York feel for some reason. She also  used San Marzano tomatoes but she would stuff them with tomato paste and olive oil ( not sure the exact amounts). She would leave this in the fridge for a day then quickly sautée the outside literally for a second. After that the cheese she made herself, but that’s a whole other thing. Also having the pizza cook with a very light dressing of mineral water on top worked well, but too much ruins it. She would use a mix of grated provolone ( which I’ve never seen anyone else do and it has to be dry which might be hard to find at a store because I’m not sure if it’s a real thing, she made it herself again ) and Parmesan. Other than that it is almost exactly what she used to do!",5년 전,0,

@Fitz1993,"When you shape the pizza, place the ball of dough onto a well floured surface and then working from the centre you want to start pushing down on the dough pushing the gases outwards to form the crust of the pizza, at this point you can start to stretch the dough whilst maintaining that nice ring around the outside, doing this helps to keep those gases you just spent 2 days developing in your dough inside the crust instead of knocking it all out like you did. Also draping the dough over the back of your knuckles and gently stretching it out, will help you to get it really thin without accidently poking a finger through it as well.

Your simple sauce and dough recipe is what I need to try next.  I've always used the very simple pizza dough recipe in ""The Best Bread Ever"" book, a MUST have for every home kitchen because you can make everything in a food processor.

@AGENTARMES,One important Point not addressed in the video is how to measure the flour. Do not scoop the flower out of the container directly with the cup that will pack it in too much and add more than one cup of flour causing a dough that is too dry. Scoop or sift the the flour into the measuring cup with a smaller spoon and then even out with a knife over the top of the cup for an exact measurement,5년 전,1,

@bunstuffer1,"This is pretty close to how we made the dough in the pizza restaurant I worked in. You can also if space allows is brush a large sheet(cookie type) with oil, place your dough balls evenly spaced and cover around each with a clear plastic sheet that has also been brushed with oil (can also be re-used just place in a container in fridge until next use). We used blocks of mozzarella which we cut into strips that fit a meat grinder. We would rub the cheese after to break up the long strands into pellet size which was easy to spread over the pizza. When stretching the dough, we would create the rim as you did, then press out the dough from the center to the edges with our fingers. Then we would slap it from hand to hand turning it at the same time to get an even bottom (some of us could throw it in the air and have it spin but that was just for show for the customers). Final fit would be as you did with the stretching by hand.  Bake and enjoy!!!!!!!",5년 전,0,

I had a summer job washing dishes at a local pizza shop in 1972 and Pete who came from Italy was the nicest man you ever could meet.  I asked him about cooking a pizza at home and he told me to get a 1/4 thick steel plate cut to fit my oven and get the oven as hot as it can get with the steel plate for about an hour.  When you do this you are making your oven into a pizza oven - and he was correct.  That was 46 years ago.   Foot note: Lunch was provided and I took an Italian roll cut in half and made it a pizza.  Pete asked me what it that as it was crazy.  I said its Pizza Bread...I was ahead of my time! lol,5년 전,0,

@audiophilefroggy3842,"Hey Adam! This isn’t my recipe, and I’m not sure if you can even make this in your home oven, but I felt like you might wanna see this. Credit for this recipe goes to redditor u/erictheocartman.   I will update this if I find any errors or if I forgot any details.   Dough [63% Hydration á ~500g/15inch (thickness factor = 0.1)]   Ingredients	|Baker's-%	|Weight per ball (g)	 Flour (Caputo Pizzeria)	|100	|295	 Water	|63	|186	 Salt	|3	|8,85	 Oil	|2	|5,9	 Fresh Yeast	|0,75	|2,21	 Sugar	|1	|2,95	 Active Rye Malt Flour*	|2	|5,9	*Rye or wheat grain gets watered and left until it starts to spruce. Then it gets dried again and milled into a flour. Brewers usually use malted barley for brewing beer.  I used Tom Lehmann's Dough Calculator   Tomato Sauce (Leftover from last bake)  I totally forgot about the tomato sauce. So after I shaped the dough into a pizza I recognized that I forgot about the sauce. I quickly blitzed whole canned tomatoes with EVOO, salt, sugar, granulated onions, granulated garlic and tomato paste (triple concentrated). Surprisingly it was quite good. But yea, shame on me.  Cheese  I used pre-grated cheese since I can't get low-moisture mozzarella in blocks where I live (Germany). Pre-grated mozzarella is coated with cornstarch to prevent the cheese from sticking to each other and forming a big chunk. Therefore I washed the mozzarella. I wish I would have known about this earlier. The melting was much better.  Process  1.	⁠Mix Flour with rye malt (powder). 2.	⁠Dissolve the fresh yeast and sugar in the water. 3.	⁠Add 10% of the flour to the water and mix. 4.	⁠Now add the salt and mix until it's almost dissolved. 5.	⁠Add slowly the rest of the flour whilst mixing the dough. 6.	⁠Knead the dough for 2 minutes and add the oil. 7.	⁠Knead for another 2 minutes. 8.	⁠Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, stretch and fold the dough and then ball it. Repeat this step two more times every 20 minutes. (The dough temperature never rose above 22°C/71°F) 9.	⁠Brush the dough with oil and let it rest in the fridge (~8°C/46°F) for 24 to 72 hours. (I let it rest for 48 hours) 10.	⁠Let the dough come to room temperature (2-3 hours). 11.	⁠Preheat the oven (at least 1 hour) with the baking stone/steel to around 270°C/520°F. (I used a stone and pizza screen. Might get a baking steel one day.) 12.	⁠Bake pizza with top and lower heat element for 7 minutes then turn on broiler for 1 to 2 minutes.    Notes  I also brushed the dough with garlic and herbal infused oil before adding the sauce. Also, I sprinkled just a bit of fine sea salt over the cheese. It turned out great!  The pizza stone was on the lowest rack in my oven, 27 cm away from the broiler.  This time I used the broiler just for the last 1 minute.  Used a 15inch pizza screen this time (on stone)  I only changed the hydration from 62% to 63% and increased the salt from 2,8 to 3,0%.",5년 전,0,

@sandau44," @kaze6945  I know you're making a joke, but I hate Imperial units and this is a common conversation topic in college for me and my friends in engineering.   From what I remember, a lot the Imperial/British measurements were originally a combination of Germanic/Anglo-Saxon measurements and ancient Roman measurements. Because the original measurements were so old, a lot of them were based on physical quantities and dimensions. For example, the foot was based on the king's literal foot size (for some reason. Not sure if that's even true, but I wouldn't doubt it would be something so dumb). Most measurements seem to be pretty arbitrary and were likely based on whatever a local community used, which eventually became a common standard for the majority of the area. Common folk didn't really have measuring tools, so measurements had to be more easily accessible.   As a working engineer, I really dislike working with Imperial units. Switching to metric is a dream of mine, but I don't see it happening any time soon. Changing the road signs, measuring cups, and other everyday items is one thing, but changing all the hardware used in manufacturing/construction/etc would be a nightmare for a long time. Entire assembly lines would need to be remade. American designed cars would need to be overhauled. There are many other aspects of America that would have to be rebuilt from the ground up. It may be something that can be done over the course of the future, where Imperial systems are slowly phased out. CEO's are going to fight that tooth-and-nail though, as it means they would have to spend money even though it would likely be better in the long term.   A man can dream, though.",5년 전,7,

Singlehandedly, and in less than 10 minutes, you showed me how to make a terrific crust and a terrific pizza. My family had a get-together a couple of Sundays ago, and I made 6 pizzas for a big crowd. Universal enthusiasm was the result. As you said, it may not be ""strictly authentic,"" but in my experience there are a whole lot of New Yorkers who have made up their minds that there is no such thing as a good pizza if it was made outside the confines of the five boroughs, no matter how good the pie actually is. Kinda like Boston folks who b!tch and moan about ""bad"" Boston accents in movies. Screw 'em. Your pizza is awesome, and because of you, mine is, too. THANK YOU AGAIN!",6년 전,66,

If you do that you will not have to flour the paddle.  The steel paddle is used to remove the pizza.  Also I like to put the dough in the oven with nothing on it for about 5 minutes   until it gets a little firm and then take it out and put the toppings on it and put it back in the oven.  That prevents a soggy crust.,6년 전,0,

@nordyilprocione3668,I'm italian and you have to know that the new york pizza is the worst type of pizza that you can make and now you can ask why well as a d.o.c italian that is studying in one of the best kitchen accademy i'm gonna tell you why. 1rst reason: the quantity of olive oil used is too much making the dough of the pizza and the sauce realy gross and fat. 2nd reason: the mozzarella used for new york pizza is not natural and at the 80% of case the stuff is pulled inside is not coming from a cow brest so you should use a normal mozzarella like the fior di latte ( the original mozzarella for napolitan pizza). 3rd reason: never and sorry but never use tomatoes concentrate inside the sauce. Now i know that you should probably never see this comment but for all your subscriber it gonna be only a simple tip for making a good italian pizza and sorry not a gross and fat new yorkese pizza remember this is not for blame or something but only for information good bye and have a good day. :),6년 전(수정됨),4,

Electric stove - High heat 500- 510f  bottom rack don't walk away check the pan every 4 min.   Shuffle the pan to see if its not sticking, move it to the top rack to finish off nicely brown.

That temperature will help the yeast working better, so you'll get a softer pizza as a final result. Another suggestion I may give you is that olive oil is useless when you put the dough in the containers (especially if you follow my previous suggestion); try to use some flour on the container's borders!",6년 전,2,

@Zspun12,For what it’s worth- I love this video because I’ve been chasing ny pizza as well for the last 6 years - I’ve tried making my sauce many times but I can’t beat full red fully prepared pizza sauce by Stanislaus - I also bought a waring wpo 500 pizza oven - it gets to 850 degrees Fahrenheit it heats from the top and bottom- I have to use pizza screens to start with so it doesn’t stick to the floor of the oven - after a few min I can transfer without the screen straight to the oven to finish off the pizza - remember that oven floor is HOT so it only need between 10 to 15 seconds to finish - much more and you will burn it to a crisp.,6년 전,0,

No wasted food, i turned the failed attempt into a calzone 😁 I'll finish off the other 2 dough balls tonight and I'll make ur bread sticks this time. I used to work in a non chain new york style pizza restaurant. We made everything from scratch. I cut 2 blocks of cheese and a quarter block of skim cheese then shred it. Hand mixed sauce. Hand made dough. Freshly cut toppings. We honestly made the best pizza i ever had. We used real italian ingredients. I wish i could remember the exact cheese recipe to replicate it.

@tommaika9121,"Ok, here is my results with this.   It came out about 92% of your 100%.   I made the dough and waited a week in the fridge!  I did not have olive oil at first, and after 1 week, I added it later to the dough balls.   Sauce:   I found the same plum tomatoes and crushed them and added the sugar and olive oil and canned tomato paste (3/4 of a can) and oregano.  I retained the juice in the can for some tomato soup I like to make... with milk. Another story.   I did not have a pizza stone,, yet i have an 18"" round metal tray which I dusted with bread flour and corn meal ....albeit generously.   I took my dough, which was somewhat wet, and stretched it out just fine onto the floured round metal pan. I added the sauce, and the parmesan cheese layer, and the mozzarella on top. I found a block of whole milk low moisture mozzarella  just like you said to do. I am in central NJ BTW...so our local italian supplies are ample.    I added some pepperoni from Dollar Tree on top which I think was a mistake and they made the slice taste bitter.  Perpaps I will use a better brand another time.  I want to crumble ground beef topping too and would like a recipe for a good ground beef topping.   I placed the pizza on the metal tray in my 525-F oven for about 12 min.  Upon taking it out, the center of the pizza was very wet, but it tightened up later.  The outside was perfect and if I could post a pic here of the bottom of the pizza, I would say that it turned out like yours with the stone except for the fact that 4-6"" in the center of the pie was soft and still kind of thin and wet.   The overall taste of the pizza was very very good and yes, it does taste authentic.  I think my sauce was a bit acidic, but having pizza in NYC, the taste was nearly identical to great NYC pizza. It smelled great and nothing like I have ever attempted to make before!    I will try to pick up a stone and will try to make my dough a little more on the dry side. I believe that aging the dough in the fridge for 1 week, made it taste fabulous. I have 3 more pizza balls to make now!   THANK YOU for all this good pizza making instructions.  Now I know the errors of my ways in previous attempts!   Can't wait to make this for my family to enjoy!   I have young kids just like you.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

@TheTaXoro,"For those worried about energy consumption: Say you are making 4 pizza's with a bit of time between, this is a cooking time of about 1 ½ hour at 550 fahrenheit. From what I could find, at 550 fahrenheit a regular oven uses about 3000 watts for that high heat. 1 kWh is 1 kilo watts(1000 watts) for 1 hour, we are doing 3kilowats for 1½ hour, that means this uses about 4.5kWh. The average price of a kWh in the USA is 12 cents. So this whole cooking process costs less than a dollar in electricity.",6년 전,1,

@faust451,"Awesome video! One thing that has worked well for me regarding the pizza sticking to the peel when trying to slide onto the stone - a large piece of parchment paper. I tear off a large section of parchment with the intent of leaving a couple of inches of parchment from where I suspect the edge of the crust will be. I lightly dust the parchment with some flour, then stretch the dough and assemble sauce and toppings. Once ready to bake, I slide the peel under the parchment and slide the parchment/pizza onto the stone. After just 90 seconds or so, the crust will have set enough that you can use the peel or a spatula to hold the edge of the crust while you yank the parchment out from under the crust and let the pizza continue baking on the stone sans paper. This technique totally eliminated all the drama I encountered trying to slide a pizza off a peel onto a stone. It is important to leave at least 2"" of paper to grab from the edge of the crust, you don't want your fingers too close to the stone when you go to yank the paper out.

My first pizza, though fully baked, had a pale crust and was not too flavorful using my perforated pizza pan instead of the suggested stone. Had to take it out though or the cheese would burn. So, for my second pizza, I put the cheese in the freezer for 20 minutes and let the dough rest at room temp for an hour before assembling. My oven only goes to 500 so it was in there a bit longer. This pizza was much improved with a golden brown crust and tasted better. (For my second pizza I also added garlic, more oregano, and a bit more tomato paste to the sauce which fits my taste/preferences better.)

I don't own a pizza stone but I do have a bake stone (cast iron with a convenient handle) I use on the stove for Welsh cakes (if you don't know what they are, look it up, make them and thank me later), which is also suitable for the oven, and that worked a treat. Heats up in no time - no need to have the oven on at max temperature for an hour for five minutes of cooking! No need for a fancy pizza scoop thingy either. I used fresh mozzarella and Parmesan, as well as plenty of oregano and pepperoni. Came out a treat. I don't have a food mixer so made it by hand - I used a whole wheat flour. I proved the dough for 24 hours - made it on Thursday evening after work then it was ready for Friday night. Came out really well. Mine was a bit smaller as my bake stone isn't huge, but to be honest that's probably just as well.",6년 전,0,

I like to use a 14 inch cast iron skillet that I heat on medium for about 15 minutes, then turn the heat up to high for another 5-10 minutes. It just takes a bit of trial and error to get this temp perfect. You don't want to start the cast iron on high or else you will warp the pan and will eventually crack it. I pull the dough and use semolina in the hot pan and build the pizza while the pan is still on high. Then set the oven to broil on highest setting and put the pizza in for about 5-10 until it looks just like yours. I started it this way just because I don't have a fancy peel.

@Adolphsson,"As a novice, I'm a bit curious as to why you don't let the sauce simmer for a bit? Doesn't that make tomatoes a bit more sweet if you don't like that bitter taste or maybe you loose some of the raw taste?   I'm really impressed by how easy it was to stretch out the dough. I pretty much just had to hold it at the edges and let the gravity do most of the work. To bad I somehow overshot my smaller sized stone a bit when I put it in the oven (why are there no edges on these things?), but after a lot of running around with smoke alarms in each hand it was definitely one of the best pizzas I've ever made! Very crispy crust!   Thank you for the guide, Adam. I can't wait to try out the other doughs when they have aged a bit more, this was a 24h one.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

Your dough would so much improve if you'd stop doing this.  Let me tell you why:  > Warm/lukewarm water will indeed activate the yeast fast, but it will also make it die fast. The only reason you should do this is if you're in a hurry and don't have time for the dough to rise properly. So doing it and then go for the refrigerated slow rise is the worst thing you could do. > As you know, yeast are living organisms, you don't want to rush them. You want their actions to be slow, even, like a flat line. Dropping hot water on them is like using a defibrillator on a sleeping patient. > Doing so will ruin the fermentation, causing your dough to develop an acrid flavor. You probably don't feel it now, but try without hot water and I guaranteed you'll taste the difference. > Also,n as a general rule, you NEVER want your dough to be warm, unless you're doing a brioche.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@chefjohnpaul7855,"1: Upgrade your equipment  Use a pizza steel. I know it's a bit of a price jump, but when you take into consideration that stone can crack or split in half when exposed to a sudden  chill of air plus it gets a really black charred spot on it and it takes forever to heat up your much better off with a steel. It takes only 5 minutes to heat up it won't crack and it hides any charred spot because it's the same color as the char. When you also take in consideration the fact that old cars are still around, maybe not in the best condition but still ohysiclly there. Steel can be heated up and cooled down over and over and receive hardly any damage so for that reason I highly suggest you upgrade to steel.  2: grind your own grains. Before you you think that no pizza place in New York ever does everyone this, but Scarrs in New York doesn't advertise this but they do grind there own grain every morning in the basement. You can get a kitchen aid grain mill attachment and you can buy grains online extremely cheap. The other benefit is it's much healthier because the all the nutrients that are normally taken out of commercial made flour are still in there including the germ. If your concern d about the color of the dough they do sell wheat berries that are naturally white and whole grain. Plus you can get a 26 pounds of wheat berries for 36 dollars and they will last longer then you will be alive so there are many benefits to grinding your own flour. however, this is your recipie if   its inconvenient to grind your own flour then that fine.  3: measure using scales.  There are reason why most bakeries measure with scales because it's easier to measure, to clean and it's also easy to scale. If you used a scale in your recipies the only thing you would need to clean would be the kitchen aid bowl and the hook you could rise your dough in the kitchen aid bowl but it less mess to clean later on. If any mess got on the scale you could just wipe it with a damp cloth.",6년 전,0,

All this for a pizza you will eat in like 5 mins.

@dominiccrimmings6925,"Here's a few things. New York ""style""pizza isn't ""a thing"" - you just think it is when you go to NY.  Also, putting dough in the fridge for 24hrs is fucking stupid - everyone knows that the yeast requires a certain temp to help raise -  every other recipe on the planet adhere's to the chemistry of that. Putting it in the fridge to rise is bollox.  Also, don't you think, given your ""I throw away the juice cos it's bitter"" comment about the tomatoes just proves the fact that using canned tomatoes is (not only universally worse for the environment) compromising on taste compared to fresh one? I think it will be universally accepted that it does.  I could go on. But can't be arsed. This whole video is awful. If you want a worldwide audience, then to appreciate this then they'll have had to gone to NY and had pizza no? No. A good pizza is a good pizza. Even if I made this exactly to your recipe I would have no idea if it's a good NY pizza or not. By the way, I've been to Italy many times (where the pizza comes from, you know, where it was invented, not in NY) and suffice to say I've eaten pizza in a lot of countries and a lot of styles and I doubt NY pizza is any better (not saying any worse, but most probably definitely not any better).",6년 전,0,

@mikeans4693,"#car_guy_with_a_pizza Great video. Love the passion. I too have a passion for creating amazing pizza at home. My journey began when I moved to a small town in Georgia from Los Angeles. Having lived half my live on the East Coast ( NJ/ NY ) and half my life in Los Angeles, I was allowed access to great pizza. Moving here, not so much. Atlanta has amazing pizza options, but with traffic and a round trip of a few hours I opted to learn the craft. I have made at least 3000 pies at home and am still experimenting with the process. I am told I make amazing pizza. I will not stop until I am told it is perfect or at least close to perfect. I order my flour and cheese from a deli in PA and make my sauce from tomatoes I order from Northern California. I have however found great options locally. I currently have dough in the fridge that I made following your video. I made sauce following your video as well and used it in conjunction with a store bought dough and used whole milk mozzarella. I found that the sauce was freaking great. The pizza as a whole was not. I attribute that to the fact that the dough was not fresh made. It was store bough frozen dough. I can't wait to use your sauce recipe with your dough recipe I the next few days. I look forward to giving you feedback. Do you have an Instagram? I would love to follow you if so.

First few pizzas went in oblong and weren't as thin as they should've been because the transfer into the oven was messy. If your dough is sticky, I found manually rubbing flour on the underside helped to keep the pizza from sticking to the peel and becoming impossible to move.

I can't tell you how much I have missed the big slices of real honest to goodness pizza.  Your recipe and technique look great.  I will definitely be trying out your recipe.  Next on my list:  trying to find the good hard smoked peppery pepperoni that slice out smaller and thicker.  They basically curl up;  after they are oven fired on a pizza.  Someone once told me to add a little bit of Munster and or Monterey jack cheeses to the motzerella.  Thank you again for all the hard work and devotion you have put into your pizza making skills.

Garlic and pepper are the ones you add the least of and sugar being the most depending on how big of a batch of sauce you’re making you’ll have to find your own measurements but it should consist of more sugar than anything else. Then once it is all together mix it well so that there is no sugar at the bottom and refrigerate. It doesn’t matter how long you refrigerate it we just did it to preserve the sauce.

@bostaph-maverix5836,"I was friends with a Pizzaria owner in the early 1970's and he took me in the basement and showed me how me made the dough    and it was different than shown here. This was before New York Style Pizza became a thing.  The moderns changed how the dough and the sauce are made with different results.  I also saw how the sauce was made.   The big thing in the 1960's and 1970's was the dough  and also the sause was aged.  The dough for 72 hours  it was balled dusted with flour and flattened to look like a cheese wheel.  It was allowed to rise in the mixer bowel with a cloth over it and punched down, I think that was done a second time.  SO that the rise in the fridge was a slow uniform rise  with only fine Co2 bubbles in it.  It was almost as if the dough wheel had a rind on it.  It needed to warm some to roll out in those days. Cold the dough was stiff  So the dough of the pizza was tender and the crust was crisp and the bottom was firm but not crisp.   The dough had a slightly sweet flavor  If the dough is rippened too long in warm temps it gets a stale beer smell and the dough when cooked gets hard and leathery  I will say he is MISSING a Key ingredient in the sauce,   He put in way too much oil for the little he made and double the amount of oregano used back then  On the tomato componant they had no blenders  then  I can not say what is done now.  They did not use whole or chopped tomatoes, they did not use Tomato paste, they used a canned Italian Tomato Sauce in Nunber 10 cans. It was not imported.  As to this recipe in this video   They DID NOT not add sugar in the sauce as it was sweet.  They added salt.  And your missing ingredient is garlic powder.   The sauce was then aged  overnight as well to let the flavors work, Just like that is needed with the dough.   I also worked in a Pizza hut around 2000 . . .   Which was interesting as they made dough from self rising flour allowed to rise once in the mixer as well    weighted the dough balled it wheeled it and put it in the walk in for the days use.  No aging The sauce was a paste concoction that had to be rehydrated with a gallon or so of water.  It was sweet  but not too much and aged for however long until it was used.   Compared to the Early Pizza hut when they painted on the sauce and their pizza was cardboard this remake of their product was incredible  compared to what it once was.   The same with the remake of Subway,  The one in the early 1970's has laid out sheets of meat that was so thin you could hold it up to the light and the pepperoni would light up like a stain glass window.  The Product they have put out since 2000, I had a gap of many years before I darkened their door.  Was Incredible compared to what it was.   So much for so much",6년 전,4,

@guillea423,Nooooo... if I learned something in Argentina where there's a lot of European descendants and have a unique and delicious way of making pizza is that you're supposed to cook the dough just a bit before you put the tomato sauce and cheese. Otherwise the sauce doesn't let the bread cook as well and or stays like raw dough. Good suggestion is if anything put a real thin layer of sauce (just to give it some color) leave it in the oven for a few minutes then take it out and apply the sauce and cheese then put back in the oven. You'll see and taste the difference!,6년 전(수정됨),0,

@dianeconti7602,I make my sauce with a pinch or 2 of dry basil and after spreading the sauce on the dough I generously sprinkle the oregano on top AND garlic powder. I find putting oregano in the sauce overnight can make it bitter. The flavor is also brighter when sprinkled dry on top of the sauce. Then go on the cheeses and a drizzle of olive oil. Letting the dough rise over night or longer is how pizza parlors make their dough too. I don't have a pizza  stone so put my pizza in a lightly oiled iron frying pan to bake. It's easier getting my pie in and out of the oven. I use this iron frying pan only for pizza.,6년 전(수정됨),0,

@StrwbrrySmmr,"This is such a great recipe! I do have one suggestion, however. In almost every shop I've worked in, we toast the oregano and red pepper flakes in a pan, before making the sauce. I didn't see any red pepper flakes in the video, and I'm not sure if that was a personal choice, or if you didn't know about them. I was curious, so I made two small test batches at home to see if it made a difference. I personally simmer my sauce for six hours, but I made it the same way as yours except for toasting my herbs. One with only oregano, one with red pepper flakes as well. I, myself, can taste the difference, and my roommates picked out the sauce with the red pepper flakes as the one they think was the most ""classic"" tasting. (except one of them). I also put basil and garlic in my sauce, but I'm not sure about those two being considered authentic.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

After you apply the sauce, add a very very small sprinkling of hot sauce around the outside ring of tomato....this will give it a kick at the end of the slice when eating.  Lastly, brush on melted butter on the outside crust and sprinkle parmasan right before putting in the oven for a toasty finish.  As for the cheese, I use a little bit of provolone as well.",6년 전,0,

Now the last time I made it, I used a bread recipe, called Bloomer bread its on you tube, its a good hydrated bread, I don't use sugar with this recipe.

Does it lack a sort of finesse and add a slight more acidity? Maybe. On the other hand, it is a faster way, but crushing with hands, a fork, or a ricer is ideal.",6년 전,0,

I cooked it in my gas grill with a pizza stone on the grill.  It worked, but that direct fire or heat got too hot and burned the bottom of the pizza before the top got done.  Temp was prob around 700 degrees.  I have one more dough ball left over, so I will try it in the oven today or turn down the temp.  Again, I appreciate you sharing this recipe.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@hulaganz,Use a hacked oven to make use of the cleaning cycle. Heats the top and bottom of the stone to about 750 degrees. I preheat the stone with a propane torch.  Extra light / high temp olive oil is better.  Fresh Romano tomatoes deseeded and canned in mason jars with a little sugar.  Fresh grown oregano or basil for the top only.  Wetter dough.  Semolina and cornmeal plus flour mixed for the peel.,6년 전,0,

Cento plums are good .. but Costco sells a monster can of Nina's for under 5  bucks .. not much more than  a 28-oz can of Centos and I think Ninas brand are actually better tasting.

@thomasw178,"This is a brilliant video and contains everything one needs to get a ROCK SOLID NY pizza at home.  You can tweak to your taste, but there will be no disappointment following it to the letter. Whole milk, low moisture is key and is non-negotiable. I also prefer non-iodized salt.  The hard cheese sprinkle before the mozz is spot on as well, and I don' t think people realize how much this does for the pie.  @Adam I've discovered something after years and years of experimentation as well, and as much as I hate to admit it, I've converted to a pizza screen, lowest rack in the oven. I just can't, no matter what, get the bottom of the pizza how I want it on a stone - even after a solid hour and a half of preheating. I don't know if I have a bad stone that isn't dense enough or what, but here's my method I've adopted (Also, I don't have a convection oven. I think that does a lot for your cornice!):  Put a rack on the lowest and preheat oven to 15 degrees lower than it's highest. Before I load the pizza, I kick it to 550 to turn the element on, which essentially grills (reverse broils?) the bottom while the heat is active.  If I do this and combine it with the trick of using really cold/frozen cheese, the crust and cheese coast to doneness at the same time.  https://imgur.com/M0imumH for an example from last weekend.  Have you had any success with screens or since you get satisfaction from your stone are you not interested in trying that?  Ovens are so wildly different, I would definitely encourage people to try many methods to hit exactly their preferred pizza.  Thanks again for my favorite YouTube video!",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@montyzooma,Just a small note for viewers: make sure you have your pizza stone in the oven right from when you start to preheat. Sometimes if you suddenly put a cold stone into a super high heat oven it can crack. It needs to be in from the start when the oven is warming up so it can absorb the heat gradually.

This way the moisture in the dough gets into the stone quickly and is then baked out more evenly improving overall crust. The sauce will have less surface to sink into the dough and that makes it more fluffy. Maybe the amount of  oil you use does the job as well, I am not using any. I would also let the dough rise for an hour or so before adding any oil or salt, you should be  able to reduce the amount of yeast by a lot.

@JG-DivMan,"Great video -- thank you for sharing it.  5 to 2.25 is right around the ratio I use for my crust.  Humidity seems to factor into the equation, too, as some days it seems to take a bit more flour to get to the proper consistency.  As others have mentioned, I add some basil to my sauce, and a slightly smaller ""glug"" of olive oil.    A couple of process tips that I've learned along the way -- Season the pizza peel (i.e. bake it ) when it's new.  Obviously don't burn it, but removing moisture from the wood helps avoid the pizza sticking while it's on the peel.  Also, if you have a ""heavy"" pizza (lots of toppings), slightly lift a portion of the dough off the peel and gently blow some air under the crust. This will help it ""float"" over the peel for a few seconds while you are transferring it to the oven.   Disclaimer -- I haven't tried the following yet, so proceed carefully I read an article a few years ago written by a man that was on the same quest as you and I: perfect NY-style pizza at home. He created the additional heat by using the oven self-cleaning function to warm the stone to the higher temperatures this feature uses.  I've used the broiler to help heat up my stone, but never the cleaning function.  Not quite convinced that it's entirely safe, although he claimed to have been doing it for several years without issue.  I'm not advocating this -- just sharing.  Question -- have you tried any of the home pizza ovens that are available today?  (Blackstone, among others, makes one.)",6년 전,0,
@gtrent7744,"Love the pizza bread dance your son does.  very cute.     Your dough recipe is your basic pizza dough recipe identical to mine and most you find out there on the internet, but usually I just make 1/4 of it for 1 dough.  So nothing new there and I think its the best one.  You could experiment with different flour brands and high gluten content though.  I did and am very happy with King Author bread flour.  They also have a high gluten one as well but it is very pricey and I could not tell much difference between that and the bread flour.  All their flours are unbleached.     Yes, it is very difficult to find Whole Milk Low Moisture Mozzarella.  And I live in New York City.  My local grosser in Inwood (Upper Manhattan) does carry several whole milk Mozzarella but not low moisture.  It is usually dry enough though to use on my pizza though and has a good flavor.  You are right though, your pizza will get soggy otherwise.  I have to ride the subway a little to get the good stuff.    Your sauce recipe looks very interesting though.  I just might try it.     I also switched to cast Iron pizza pan.  it is flat with no rim.  Used to be on Amazon but it is no longer available.  All the other cast iron ones have a rim. so using a peel is very difficult.  You can get the cast iron hotter than the stone.     As for that New York Flavor or Chewy dough.  Never quite got it.  My dough comes out crisp on the bottom and bready on top but not that chewy consistency of New York dough.  I really think its gluten content though for the chewy.  I am thinking of using a bagel dough recipe since bagels are suppose to be chewy.   Still working on it.",6년 전,0,

@ericaspruill8461,"I worked at a business where we made Chicago style pizza (deep dish and round) and it's really interesting to me how you can variations in the steps for your dough and still get pizza! Of course I know the crusts come out tasting different but still. We let our yeast bloom in the beginning as well, though we had specific temperatures for the warm water for the two doughs. Also, we cheated with our rounds and had a lovely machines that flattened out the dough some before we tossed it the rest of the way. Never had a problem with crusts forming and never pinched the edges. Maybe it's just the difference in doughs.  One tip is we'd put more cheese around the edge and less in the middle so you wouldn't get the naked sauce by the crust. The cheese sort of slid towards the middle and it was even everywhere. NY style is thinner so I'm not sure how well this tip would work for you but it might be worth a go once.  Really interesting video, makes me miss making pizza. Tfs.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@ClaytonMacleod,"A different method if you don’t want it too thin. Try leaving the dough out, but still covered, at room temperature for 45 minutes. Press it out roughly to the end size, and cover again for another 45 minutes. Press it out LIGHTLY to finalize the size and it is ready for use. Each 45-minute waiting stage gives it time to proof/rise. The second press being very light allows you to get it into the right shape that you want without losing too much of the rise. It’ll cook up very nicely.",6년 전,0,

I showed this to a friend who does some professional baking.  He suggested, a little less sauce than in the video, but of course that's a personal preference.  The more sauce, the more cheese you need to cover it up.    Much of the sugar isn't necessary.   Also, when doing the cheese, shred some pecorino, then shred just a small amount of sharp cheddar (yellow or white) it doesn't affect the color but it helps give a little missing piece of the flavor.  Then continue on with the mozz.     As for the mozz., we know you can only get the cheese sticks, but he suggested trying to shred them the best you can (or even do lots of unstringing them) for a more even cheese coating.  Hope this helps.   I've been doing what he suggested with the cheddar and am happy with it.    I am going to try washing the tomatoes as you suggested in your update.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@jovevviktor,"My dad told me a recipe that i tried once and the pizza came out very good. I make the dough by putting some flour in a plastic container. Then I make a hole in the flour using my fingers. In the hole I put some salt, 1/3 olive oil (or sunflower oil) and then I put 1/3 yeast mixed with warm water. Then I put the yeast in the hole and then i start mixing the ingredients with my hands until it becomes solid and sticky. I put the dough on a warm stove for about 30 minutes or less. Then I stretch the dough and put it on a tray with some oil on it. I cut the access dough at the ends and then i put some ketchup, oregano, bits of sour cream and some cheese. And then I put the tray in the oven until the cheese melts and when i am able to separate the dough from the tray (My oven is preheated for about 1 hour).  And wallah  🍕",6년 전,0,
@bongwater2290,"So I know this isn’t considered to be NY style pizza (but Detroit rather) but I work at jets pizza and when we make our round dough, we add in all the water at once then let the yeast bloom for 5 minutes before adding flour. Also I can’t remember if you mentioned it but I believe we make sure our water is between 90-110 (I think it’s around that range it could be around 100-120). We typically tend to keep the water on the higher end so it doesn’t cool down while the yeast is still blooming. Also I’m fortunate enough to have a wood fire pizza oven at home and I must say, this looks pretty good by comparison as well",6년 전,0,

@schmatever,"Thanks for this Adam, I have been striving to make restaurant level pizza at my house for many many years literally every friday night for my wife and kids.  Some things that I have learnt along the way:  - pizza stones are more prone to breaking, I use a pizza steel.  Also they seem to retain more heat and get a really good crust, plus never break. - recently discovered that the frying pan / under the grill method is even more effective and can produce a pizza that has amazing char and crust. (plus far cheaper, faster, less hassle) everything made in the pan, so no peel sticking issues. - I find that the less I knead the dough, the better they come out. I do minimal kneading and then age in the fridge like you do for 24-48 hours. - I use the same ingredients for the sauce but also crushed garlic, chilli flakes and runny honey instead of sugar which adds something to the consistency.   - I mix in a food processor rather than a blender because it holds the colour of the tomato but still mixes in everything well enough (especially the tomato cores which kids tend to dislike when they come across them).  I hope the above helps you or others.",6년 전,0,

@sandiebeauty2067,"Hello , Adam here is my thoughts with evidence from a book and from my Italian back ground and simple love for good pizza. 1- To improve the crust use biga technique or poolish technique , you will find that completely different taste so much better( ref: Forkish_-Ken-The-Elements-of-Pizza_-Unlocking-the-Secrets-to-World-Class-Pies-at-Home). professional Italian masters do it. 2- Start with the flour as an important start, in US you have general mill and caputo , 5 stagione and polselli) they are great. Buy   00 flour with W power ( Italian measure for flour) from 300-400) it is written on the package. 3- Your oven is fantastic, Italian pros they do it this way at home. You did the right thing warming up the stone for long time. 4- To improve tomatoes saus, italian, peeled tomoatoes are the best don't use the saus use the tomatoes themselves and mix them to make the saus , the idea is to get substance not water which will help to make it crispy. The best thing for tomatoes saus because we cant buy professional is fresh tomatoes mixed and strained, boiled with 1/3 peeled tomatoes ( this against all the rules of the masters but it is the best so far. 5- according to pizza masters and the book use % water of flour to get soft crust or crispy crust. there are method for sticky dough to loose its stickiness but. called La biega which is folding with the tips of your fingers after maturation  and on it self there are 2 fold and 3 fold method but this for pizza Al Taglio. Round pizza must not be stick at all ( see the book). 7- Crispy romana pizza is 55% of water of flour wight it still has flexibility and it is thin crust for the ny style is not thin it is a bit thicker but the rule apply. The more water the softer the crust. 8- Use Mother yeast it complete anther world of taste , you will be surprised.  9- You need first fermentation and second fermentation all in the fridge 10- you need maturation  which you did ( 24-28 hours in fridge). 11- Yeast for 1 KG is 0.5 -3 grams only otherwise the fermentation fase will takeover the mauration stage which we don't want to do that at all because maturation makes the different between eating floury card board or nice tasty chewy  rick ny style pizza. I hope i was helpful as you are thank you very much for a great video. good luck  Sandie",6년 전,1,

@Egglolls,"Ok so I've lived in NYC my whole life, this is pretty spot on, your top looks almost exactly like Joe's Pizza in my opinion.. obviously the bottom of the pie is so difficult to replicate at home, but a gas stove helps. I know this is going to sound somewhat crazy but one of my favorite places that isn't around anymore used to have a layer of bricks in the oven that they put the stone on top of.    But you're missing one important thing:  What seems like ~15% of the time, they get lazy and don't clean the oven so there is a crap soot taste / disgusting black char (not a good kind, it's just soot) all over the bottom of the slice. Roughly one out of your four pies should have tasted like garbage to achieve this authentic NYC flavor profile.   Great job.  Take care.   I know this video is a couple of months old and I'm just an internet stranger but if you're still on this quest, I'd be happy to ship you NYC tap water at cost as I'm unfortunately not rich and I have a feeling water is heavy.

@DeannaWalsh,"It seems that I sort of just make a pizza and It is good. Sometimes I’ll use the same recipe and go and make a ordinary pizza and then I’ll make myself a deep dish pizza out of a ceramic quiche dish . Although, I have learned from some pros that the water you use has a lot to do with how well the pizza turned out. i’m trying to figure out what is the best water to use. I heard about a pizza place in California that ships their water all the way from New York. It’s just different water. I don’t have a pizza stone but I use old steel pizza pans with the holes in the bottom that were tossed out by Shakey‘s pizza place. They make a pretty good size pizza that fits in my oven. Sauce I’ve made actually was from fresh tomatoes that I blanched to remove the skin and then make it simple. But I love this recipe you’ve shared and even though I may not have a pizza stone yet and be able to get my oven hot enough, I think I’m going to try a few things that you’ve done here to certainly improve my pizza. New York pizza is pretty amazing when it’s done well. There’s an original pizza place here in Southern California in Escondido and Poway that is absolutely amazing and even though it’s not a New York style pizza it is absolute best pizza I’ve ever had (if you like a robust pizza). It’s called Filippi‘s Pizza Grotto. You never need to ask for extra cheese because they really pile it on. They have other good things there too. Everything they make is made there.

@booyakashaboy7250,Man growing up in NY/NJ I didn't know how good I had it Pizza-wise. I lived in Florida & Now North Dakota and the available pizza's have been absolute garbage. What I remember about good NYC pizza was they started with NY tap water but I'd imagine any good bottled water would be fine. The sauce had the oregano and basil and many good places used a big block of whole milk polly-o mozzarella cheese shredded into leaves. The sauce always had a thick consistency and a tangy taste to it. Not sure if lime or lemon based. My favorite is in Brooklyn. Its Grandmas Original Pizzeria on 3rd. Chucky tangy sauce with stretchy cheese and a really good crust.  😋,6년 전,0,

One question,  did you ever try an autolize step (letting the dough rest for about an hour covered with a moist towel) in between taking the pizza out of the mixer and balling and refrigerating?  I notice that Tony G uses this technique with great results.  Anyway, thanks for the great recipe!",6년 전,0,

I used just a metal baking sheet (no pizza stone) and the crust doesn’t have the dark color that his has but it’s definitely still delicious.

Never ever put sugar in your sauce, the 🍅 has enough, instead, add a teaspoon or so of baking soda and watch that shit foam up as it neutralizes the acid in the 🍅. My grandparents were Italian, grandpa grew the 🍅, basil and oregano, grandma made the sauce. Trust me, I still make my own sauce tho from canned 🍅 (grandma's rolling over in her grave I'm sure) and I have never added sugar. The tomato taste is good and bold but there's no tart or bitter acidic taste. Give it a try this way, you can always add sugar later. Try to use fresh herbs instead of dry, don't forget the basil, oregano is over rated and over used. The last 2 generations have been raised on cheap, sweet, bottled spaghetti sauce, makes me want to cry. Otherwise everything else looks great",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@Hags_Mixtape,"For someone thinking of trying this out:  I’m not a cook at ALL, in fact I really suck... but I did this recipe and it was the best thing I’ve ever made. The sauce is AMAZING and the two cheeses are so melty and delicious. I really recommend giving it a try.  Tips/mistakes I made:  - I made 3 pizzas and every time I forgot to flip the pizza the right way. Make sure you have the smooth side down.  - make more sauce! I ran out on my third pizza and I used one tin.  - if you make pizza bread, garlic power is really needed, other wise it doesn’t cook quite right.   - I ran out of cheese sticks (mine was a block) and stringed mozzarella in a bag worked fine.  - I didn’t have a bread mixer, so I just used my hands. The end result was the same as the video but it was really difficult to kneed and it took 2 hours (no breaks).   - don’t worry if it breaks when you try stretch it to see if light passes through, don’t pull it, just let it stretch. If it’s not perfect... trust me it’ll be fine.  - I added a TONNE more flower. You definitely need to if you’re doing it with your hands.  - I didn’t have one of those pizza board things, so I just used a wooden chopping board. It works fine, just make sure you have room for it to slide around....... the first time I did it, 1/3 of the pizza fell off the board when I shook it around.   - BE CONFIDENT when you transfer the pizza into the oven. I never had any problems with this but you have to keep shaking the board when you walk to the oven.   -have fun!!! (And clean as you go.... wow I made a mess).",6년 전(수정됨),1,

The ""New York-style"" pizza pie is huge, each pie is around 20"" - 24"" diameter, so each slice is around 10"" - 12"" long, 8"" - 10"" wide, cost about $2 per slice. The standard ""New York-style"" pizza is plain, meaning only a thin layer of parmesan and mozzarella cheese as topping, and usually the good one have tomato sauce taste sweet never sour (like Pizza Hut's). if you want other toppings that means you going to pay $2 - $3 extra per topping.

@elegraphy,"Because that's the standard NY style pizza, plain and simple, only a thin layer of parmesan and mozzarella cheese as topping, it will look pinkish orange, as the sweet tomato sauce lightly mixed with a thin layer of melted cheese, on a thin layer of hand-tossed pizza dough. I think the video putting way too much mozzarella cheese for NY Style. Most New Yorkers get used to order a slice without an extra topping, and if there's a topping choice, most people will only ask for 1 topping, like Italian sausage or pepperoni, 3 toppings will be a limit and can be very expansive. (plain usually cost $2 per slice, with each topping can cost extra $2 to $3 per slice). Also, don't forget NY style pizza came with a huge slice, each slice is around 10 - 12 inches long (304.8mm) and 8-10 inches wide (254mm) on the edge of the pie, the whole pie is usually between 20"" - 24"" diameter, so when you get your single slice just came out of the oven, it's pipping hot and the pizza dough maybe too thin and soft to hold on a lot of melting topping. The standard way to eat NY Style pizza is to fold it into half like a sandwich, so you have more control with the topping and not dripping the sauce and oil on your cloth.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

@sarchlalaith8836," @aragusea  that some yeast died and some lived doesn't preclude your dough rising.  That salt in high concentration kills yeast is demonstrably true and well documented.

The only debatable factor here is the volume of yeast killed by the salt contact and the degree to which it will affect your rise. Arguably it's inconsequential, and yet if you may gain some extra rise by the simple expedient of placing the salt on top of the flour and then mixing thusly  ensuring its concentration is to the yeasts tolerance then why would you not?",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Admittently, I don't see New York style pizza going down all that well this way, but, for other topping styles, this works well and doesn't require a pizza stone nor a really long pre-heat time.  The idea is that putting cheese on top, in a home oven, seals in moisture which would otherwise find some way to escape in the veritable cauldron which is a wood fired pizza oven.  So, the idea is to have a 455 degrees Fahrenheit oven with top and bottom heat (no convection) and put the pizza, with its various sauce an toppings (except for the cheese) in as close to the bottom as you can get it for about 8 minutes. Then, take it out, put on the cheese and put it in again for 4 to 6 minutes favouring the top of the oven.

That is a good guideline for a workplace, because you don't know how long the salt will sit in the water before the flour gets mixed in, and you might not now how much water will be in with the yeast in the first place. But that doesn't mean that salt instantaneously kills the second it touches it. It doesn't. In the case, I get the same exact rise whether I salt the water or the flour.

Have you compared compared cooking/reducing/simmering the sauce for a much longer time verse adding tomato paste?  Personally, I greatly enjoy a sauce that I have ""concentrated"" myself by letting it sit and simmer most of the day.  I have not compared that to using tomato paste.

After washing it, some may still linger unless sterilized every single time. How about putting garnishes, (which does not undergo extreme heat to kill bacteria), touching the plates and utensils. If you wear a ring while cooking, you gotta sterile it every time you touch things or it may contract cross contamination. Even if it has a slim chance, I wouldn't risk it especially when I will be cooking for my family or kids. Since you only care about cooking for yourself, I assume you don't cook for the whole family? Man, just remove accessories next time for the sake of the kids and for the viewers of the channel. Many idolizes you, sink that deep into your mind.

There is particularly minimal risk when it comes to smooth jewelry, which is one of the reasons why the U.S. Federal Food Code specifically allows for food service workers to wear plain wedding bands, see p. 52. https://www.fda.gov/media/110822/download Much of the health and safety practices observed or recommended in the food business are not actually about preventing illness; they're about keeping customers from getting grossed out.

Whatever we didn't bake, we would put on trays in the fridge... and when we cooked that dough the next day for lunch, it was the BEST!

Things to watch out for, do not use to much cheese, just a thin layer, to keep a good bread/sauce/cheese ratio. Optional - Put a little Oil or water on the exposed crust, before saucing, to keep it from browning too early.   Bake at 350 for a few minutes ~5min until the cheese is bubbling, keep an eye on the pizza this one cooks fast, then set to broil for only 30 seconds to give the cheese a nice golden color. Depending on your oven this may need slight tweaking. You want the crust to have a good crunch to it but still foldable.

@1nomnomnomnom1,You could make your own mozzarella . Then you'll have complete control and not be dependant on cheese string. Takes  about 20-30mins using full fat milk - rennet - citric acid and a microwave. First have a  pint or so of cold salt water to hand - this is what you'll put the mozzarella into for keeping and flavouring.  Super easy - from memory... 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid in 2 ltr milk. Microwave 6 mins - add rennet - stir - let stand for 5-10 mins. cut up now set milk into curds and whey and pour through a colander catching the whey in a pan below catching the curds in the colander. Roll the colander around so curds drain. then put it back into the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute to keep it hot. put back into the colander and Squeeze as much liquid out of the curds and once it starts resembling cheese start to kneed it like dough - reheating as required. After stretching and kneeding it will get a gloss on it - rip into small balls - smooth and drop into the water. Store in the brine in the fridge for at least a few hours to get best flavour. Remove from brine - slice or tear up for putting on pizza.,6년 전,0,

@BravingTheOutDoors,"OK.I have no idea what NY Pizza is because I'm not American (we all have our shortcomings) and so I've never been to NY. Therefore, it could just be that it's meant to be ""that"" simple... however, while I appreciate the effort you've put into the method (you did get a lot of things right, no doubt) this is nonetheless (and please don't take this wrong way) rather low level (in comparison to other more professional recipes). I can offer an improvement on the dough, for one, but, more importantly, I can offer a much much more professional recipe for the sauce. Though, mind you, it requires a significant amount of ingredients. However, like I said, I don't know what NY Pizza is meant to be. Perhaps a simple tomato sauce IS what you're ought to use. (I looked at it in Wikipedia and it does indeed say that traditionally it is made with a basic tomato sauce) So just to reiterate - I can share here my professional recipe(s) but a word of warning first, it is not for people who think quick, easy and simple can produce Michelin level results. It's for those who are willing to go the extra mile, make the extra effort and put more time into it.",6년 전,0,

@ncooty,"You asked for advice about better emulating a high-temp oven.  Replace your pizza stone with a 6mm (1/4"") thick plate of stainless steel--or thicker if you prefer.  It has a lower thermal capacity than the stone, but a much higher rate of heat transference.  After all, what you care about is how quickly you can dump that heat energy into the dough.  Second, after you've preheated the oven, turn on the broiler.  That will increase the temp on the slab even more.  However, be sure it's situated where you want it when you bake; you do not want to try to move that thing at that temp.  Finally, you could try baking under the broiler.  Combined with the SS slab on the bottom, you'll be dumping an immense amount of energy into the dough.",6년 전,0,
@sophiestrano,"Not sure if you’ve ever considered this but a big part of why New York and Long Island pizza and bagels are the way they are is because of the water we drink and use for dough making, the minerals and sediments in New York water are key in the dough. Also the way you make sauce is probably hurting you in terms of taste. Traditional New York Italian sauce starts with sautéed finely minced onion and garlic in olive oil and a variety of spices (salt, pepper, ground oregano, parsley, basil, rosemary, etc because some families alter it) until everything is aromatic and perfect, and then sauté the tomato paste with it for about a minute before adding the crushed tomatoes with just some of the liquid, and you’re meant to cook this for a long, long time to get rid of the acidity of the tomatoes and develop thickness and flavor. You already touched on the dryness of the dough by in my opinion the sauce really makes the pizza, and that would make a huge difference.",6년 전,0,

@superpoluha1,"I love everything you do with the dough. I just want to offer a small tidbit with the sauce:   I like a much more reduced end sauce, also I do not pursue the new york style as much. I chop some garlic coarsely and throw it on a saucepan with olive oil and toast so it just barely starts to turn color. (If i would want some spice, here i would add fresh chili flakes). You get an amazing garlic extract here. Once i am satisfied with the color of the garlic, i add the rinsed tomato like you mentioned in your update. I add some medium-bodied red wine. You can chose between tannic and sweet here to suit your preference, and given that you added sugar i recommend a sweeter red. I then add an herb mix (oregano base) and continue to reduce on very low heat for about an hour. The texture of these very soft chunks of garlic tomato really get me going. By reducing the sauce more, i find the dough bakes really well. Add salt to taste.   Your video formats are revolutionary on youtube. Keep it up!",6년 전,0,

@Fusterclucked00,"I've worked in pizza places for many years. I would suggest less oil on your dough post-mixing. Instead dust it using flour when you need to handle it.   Also, keep the dough on the table when you first start to stretch it, pressing down on the dough to create the crust. It'll help prevent you from getting a hole in the dough which will result in you losing the whole dough ball.  Third, in future experiments, try using a touch of molasses. It'll give the dough a slight brownish color after cooking, but the dough will have a bit of a sweet taste to it that melts in the mouth. I believe that's what Mellow Mushroom does.",6년 전,0,

@hulaganz,"Ok, here we go.  Defeat the lock on the oven and use the cleaning cycle. My electric oven will then reach 750 degrees.  Spray edges of pizza with some water.  Keep a bowl of water in the oven.  This gives a sub five minute pizza.  Seed Roma tomatoes and blend the meat of the tomatoes.  Add fresh oregano and a bit of paste . Sugar and salt to taste. Nothing else. Those can go on top if wanted.  Oil. Use light tasting / high heat , clear / light yellow olive oil. NOT evoo! That craps for salads, not sandwiches or pizza.  Wetter dough. High protein flour, add gluten.  For the peel. Semolina ran in a food processor for a second add a dash of cornmeal and some flour. Run again for a second.  That's all I do different.

@jackdeath,"Well, at least you don't waste time with '00' flour, but, if you did, then you could get away with only using 1/2 tsp of yeast. 1 tsp is perfect when using higher protein with coarser flours.   Most New York pizzerias use honey instead of sugar. I'm glad you learned to use a slight wetter dough than in the video.   The sauce is a matter of personal taste. While the choice of tomatoes is correct, adding fresh basil is most common for a plain cheese pizza. And most New York pizzerias add the olive oil directly on the dough before adding the sauce; they don't mix the oil into the sauce, as it will usually dull the flavors and make a blander pizza.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@Christopher-vj2ie,"I've found that if you want to skip the 24 hr wait, you can actually skip using yeast all together and add more olive oil to the outside of your dough. You'll only get 1 pizza out of this though! Also! If you're using a wetter dough, how you then bake it can make a huge difference. If you've preheated your oven tray, then you should put your pizza first at the bottom of the oven for about five minutes, close to the bottom heat source. That bakes the dough and makes it crispy. Then move the tray to the top of the oven for five more minutes, and the cheese will brown just perfectly along with the crust without burning. Of course temperature is also important. If the temperature is too high, everything burns, and if it's too low nothing cooks properly. I usually preheat my oven to 225 Celsius. That's roughly: 437 Fahrenheit.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@jogon206,"I don't think this pizza will taste all too good with so many ready to eat-ingredients. Some tips:  Make your own tomato sauce: slice fresh tomatoes into quarters. (1-2kg) Slice one red bell pepper (red=sweeter) Slice one small to medium-sized  onion into tiny cubes. roast chopped up garlic (1-2 pieces) in olive oil (can do that in a pot directly). You will need to stir a lot; don't use too much olive oil; the garlic shall not turn brown. Add the onion, roast it for a moment with the garlic. Add bell pepper and tomatoes and a sufficient amount of water. (1-2 litres) Add a reasonable amount of sugar, salt, and oregano. stir it a little every once in a while and let it cook (reduce) at low temperature until you get a sauce. You can then again add sugar, salt, tomato paste and oregano for taste. After seasoning the sauce, stir it a little and let it sit for a couple of minutes on the hot stove. You can also use your mixer to make the sauce smoother/thicker or let it cook/reduce longer.  It should taste way fresher and better. Also works for pasta; if you wanna make the sauce for that purpose, you also can add some ground beef and shortly roast it with the onions and garlic in the beginning before putting in tomatoes etc.. This recipe will make up for about 5-10 pizzas depending on size and how thick you apply the sauce, I guess. Just try it out and be patient as making sauce like this can take 2-5 hours depending on what you want as a result. But trust me, it is worth it.   Also, try to use fresh yeast if you can and let the dough rise in a warm place for about an hour before you put it in the refrigerator. Just take a bit of hand-warm water and sugar to give the yeast something to ""eat"". break the yeast into smaller parts, stir it in with a whisk or fork, let it sit a couple of minutes, then add it to the dough. You should get some smoother, better-tasting and maybe even a bit more dough out of it.  Sorry for the metric system, but I can't help the US being stuck in ancient times ;) Also sorry for any bad english, I can't think that well today. lol  All I wrote is basically how my italian great-grandmother as well a an italian friend who works in a pizza bakery use(d) to make this stuff.

@airxperimentboom,"Hi, you got the good idea with the stone. Usually a traditional wood fire oven is the most! The stone reach 350-400°C and the flour burn which give this smoke taste. Personally, to imitate this at his full extent with my 250°C max oven, I precook the dough with the tomatoes and when it's united, I take it out from the oven, put ingredients over (ham, mushrooms, mozarella...) And flour under! I put the pizza again in the oven in a way where the dough become soft brown like and the cheese melt.  To bake the tomatoes sauce, there is no miracle, you want use real tomatoes. Not the one who come from Argentina and are artificially colored and not mature. I mean you go during the summer asking some tomatoe farmer. The old tomatoes who are pressing. You can get kilo of them for nothing. Those tomato are perfectly suited to bake sauce. You can bake the annual quantity of sauce and stock it in the cellar into glass jar. You got the tip! Use olive oil ! And personally I put garlic onion and sage during the cooking and remove it.   Tell me what you think about it and how well you can perform those tipps?

@joda8349,"Was in North Carolina a decade or so ago and I ran into a pizza joint that was really close to the NYC pizza.  I mean really good.  I talked to the guy and he had a NY accent and since I was NJ we kind of got along even though there is an inherent competition between guys across the river.   We eventually talked about his pizza.  So he basically owned a shop in NYC and moved from there due to ahem... unscrupulous protection rackets and had been in NC for maybe 20 years.     He admitted to me that it was the water in NYC as the reason his pizza wasn't quite as good.  But let me tell you that if I lived there I would have eaten his pizza at least once per week and no other, since it was that good.  He shipped everything down by truck to his eatery and must have decided that since he didn't have NYC water that it must have been that.   Not sure I agreed with him.  Maybe it was in his head because I thought the pizza was astounding.",6년 전,0,

@contentsailor5764,"​ @jaredkeeler8522  Just got the ingredients took a picture, But just to let you know we use a pretty big jug to make the sauce so the measurements aren't going to be for normal use(its enough for a store making hundreds of pizzas, but to much for one).  *DISCLAIMER*  we use stromboli cups which are small plastic container cups we put sauce in to for the stromboli. I think they are equal to 1/4th cups I will have to check next time at work. Everytime I say cup its a stromboli cup  -2 cans of 7/11 -2 cans of Full Red -1 cup(stromboli cup) of salt -2 cups of sugar -1 cup of Basil leaf -1/2 cup of Oregano Leaf -1 cup of Grand Alaiev Garlic -1/2 cup of Black Pepper -Finally 1 full Pitcher of water, which I believe our pitcher goes up to 4 or 5 liters, but because it also has quarts it would make sense that it only has 4 quarts since 4 quarts is a gallon.  That is a lot of sauce and not good for practical use. Figure out how that would fit for your specific use, The sauce is really good has a sour and sweet taste that is a bit savory.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@56squadron,"You should stop using plastic cutting boards because germs can (and do) live in all the cut lines in it and they will transmit to everything that touches them. Use only wooden boards, which should also not be over washed, and when washed dried completely. One of the reasons wooden boards don't harbor germs is they become so dry because the top layer of wood is air permeable and that kills germs which need moisture. The little cuts in the plastic board can and do hold moisture which allows germs to live. On top of that wooden boards impart no smell or anything else.  Otherwise thanks for the vid. I personally was never a fan of billion degree ""flash"" pizza baking where the crust turns out black, the bottom is hard and the cheese has turned that sickly yellow color and has literally changed chemically.  (and some of it is even black too)  If the goal is to reduce it to carbon let's just go eat a charcoal briquet. I always preferred my pizza ""al dente"".... the crust just cooked and almost still white, (slightest hint of tan) the cheese melted but still white and the bottom solid but not discolored.

But it'd also be a pretty expensive one, ""just"" to get a pretty damn awesome pizza.",6년 전,1,
@alohaWEBLOG,"​ Anon Ymous  Yeah mate, things are a bit different in Europe. I haven't seen much of the US, apart from the Fort Lauderdale / Miami area, so I don't really know if the image that we get from movies - with the big highways and loooong, free roads across the country is really accurate. But if it is, you can't really expect that in Europe, for most parts. It is indeed relatively small, but it is dense, and not always straight forward. Our highways are mostly 2 lanes, if you're lucky 3. There's always a lot of road work, so for parts of your journey - especially around the major cities - you can expect a 62/50/37mph limit with lots of traffic during the day. Which feels more like driving through San Francisco than going on route 66 😁  It's not like you can get in your car, and just drive at cruising speed for hours and hours. Sometimes you have to go through the major cities to change autobahns, and you wouldn't wanna do that during the rush hours.  But it would definitely be an awesome road-trip, that's for sure! Don't wanna spoil your fun mate. I did several road-trips, from germany through belgium to france and further into spain. From germany through austria to croatia, and back to prague.. Since we got the EU, there's not really a lot of border stuff and money exchange going on, which makes it pretty awesome. You get to see a lot of nature, different places, different languages, different state-of-minds. All in a couple of hours. It's always nice to take a detour from the autobahn, and take a lot at the country. It's a beautiful experience, and I'd recommend it. But it defo takes longer than the same distance in the US.

@titianarasputin,"your overall method is ok, but your understanding of why things are better or worse, and how things actually work, is just misinformed.  First of all, san marzano are not more acidic. especially the brand you showed. Cento is a very low acid brand, and those tomatoes are very sweet. The sweetness is why they taste so good. [a basic google search will confirm this.]  Second, all canned tomatoes are cooked. You aren't preserving the freshness of the flavor by limiting the amount of tomato paste. You are simply preserving flavor. Tomato paste is typically made from lower quality and waste product tomatoes, and is cooked until it is bitter.  You can get a better, more flavorful sauce by putting a quality tomato packed in tomato sauce {Cento is a great one but very expensive} through a food mill. You must salt your sauce just enough so that it counteracts any acidity, but not so much that you taste salt. Lastly, fresh basil is the only other ingredient you need in your sauce. Oregano should be added on top of the pizza after it comes out of the oven, and some crushed pepper too for some heat. This is New York flavor and New York style.  Good job on the whole milk mozzarella. Sorrento is my favorite east coast brand, and Walmart actually packages a whole milk mozzarella in 16oz. Fresh mozzarella is acceptable too, but if you're going to use it, use a quality (expensive) brand.  Your stretching tecnique leaves much to be desired. Use flour liberally while stretching. use better table technique for an even thickness crust.  Dough that has sat for a week in the fridge will tear easily. There will be a lot of sourness to it, but not sourdough sour. It's more of an alcohol tang (from the yeast) rather than acetic acid (from cultured bacteria in true sourdough). There will be a sweetness to it as a result of the yeast activity breaking down the starches. It will not be at peak flavor though. And the texture will suffer, as higher acidity and sugar content lowers the chewiness and limits the action of the heat on the dough.  I could continue, but i need to finish the dishes and you need time to absorb this knowledge. Your delivery is good. I feel that when you are using such an authoritative, no-nonsense style, you should feel obligated to learn whether or not the things you are saying are actually true.  A good place to start for beginners is any book by Peter Reinhart. He focuses on bread, and has a couple pizza books out as well. The crust is the sina qua non of pizza, so understanding bread is critical to making great pizza and improving your technique.  Lastly, after you have perfected everything else, and you are still not getting the flavor you seek, i'll give you a spoiler alert now: you will not be able to achieve the flavor in your home oven. The temperature is not high enough, and won't ever be due to safety regulations.  New York Style pizza needs termps between 650 and750f. it makes all the difference. Disbelieve this at your own peril.",6년 전,13,

In some restaurants here we have pizza bread too but it is much different. Instead of it having garlic and olive oil on top, there is cheese and sauce, almost like pizza, only the ""crust"" is much thicker, between a loaf of bread and pizza crust, but more towards the size of a pizza crust. The shape is the same as your pizza bread and it is cut into little strips just as yours is. Just figured this was something for you to try if you wanted to, im sure your son would love it too!

@arshadshah8845,Use rolling pin or wine bottle instead of streching by hand because you room temprature is different than that of a pizzeria to replicate it correctly. And if you still want to stretch it by hand use high water content in the dough so its wet to a point where it is not stocky enough to stick to your hand but will stretch out due to gravity when you hold the dough ball from one side after flattening it a little. And also use coarse corn meal on the shovel instead so that the pizza does not black out.,6년 전,0,

@johnathandoughboy,"I just wanted to comment on my experience.  No mixer- couldn’t really “stretch till i could see light” but i could definitely get it kneaded no problem and the pizza dough was very workable.  Pizza stone? Nah. I used cold metal pan, extremely strange how similar it was to a fire baked pizza texture. didn’t need a pizza peel either. but if you got one hey why not.  The cheese was much better but i still wasn’t feeling that new york pizza taste, i think there’s a secret there we aren’t getting or my cheese sucked. (yes whole milk low moisture)  The sauce. Holy shit that is close. I’d say that’s the most “authentic” part of the recipe   So overall i’d say this is DAMN CLOSE but just not quite “street pizza” i was hoping for. Honestly i think yours is more “refined”. something you’d find at italian restaurant. it’s classier lol.   i think i was light on the olive oil maybe, it didn’t seem very “greasy” and i remember a few slices in NY being pretty damn greasy.   Despite my gripes i want to thank you for this recipe. i might tinker with it, amazing starting point. 5 out of 5. i think it’s better than any restaurant in my town in upper michigan.  i did a pepperoni pizza  i did a pepperoni green olive, mushroom, artichoke pizza (yum)  i tried to roll the rest of my motz sticks in dough and failed at making cheese sticks.  And maybe you will appreciate this one. i bought a pork tenderloin. wrapped that in bacon and slow cooked it and broiled it. I chopped that up and put that on my last dough but with bbq sauce rather than tom sauce. Topped it with cheddar cheese (and motz). it was so good, i had 1 slice and my dog stole the rest burning the shit out of her tongue.

@IllyaKaliyev,"Thank you for this video, I myself experiment a lot with home baked pizza and you gave me great new insight into parts I still didn't know.   Here is my Tip for you to try out.  If you want a more complex taste to your pizza sauce you should try adding bell pepper powder, dried garlic powder, and little Sambal Oelek (don't overdo or it will take over the flavor). We do it where I work and the pizza sauce pops more when you eat the pizza. Don't know how to explain it but I personally feel it balances the tomatoes acidity very well.   Ingredients: Canned tomatoes (crushed)  Tomato paste  Bell pepper powder Garlic powder  dried Basil Oregano black pepper  Salt Olive oil Sambal Oelek (don't overdo)",6년 전,0,

@tanwera,"I made two pizzas this w/e with your original recipe.  It was a great success.  The dough was perfect after 24 hours of cold fermentation.  I will let the remaining dough age a few more days in the fridge to compare the taste. It was very easy to work with and very easy to shape.  Perfect stretch, very uniform, zero tears.  So much better than the pizza dough my wife usually purchases at the grocery store for her pizzas.  This not an exaggeration. I kept it simple for these first two pizzas; one cheese and one pepperoni.  By far the best home pizzas we have made.  This, my wife, kids and I were all in agreement.  I read your update.  I dont think I will need to make any changes to the dough recipe unless the summer heat and humidity require it.  I'm very happy with your new york pizza sauce.  I will make changes to it only when I want it to more closely resemble the sauce in the pizzas from the pizzerias where I grew up, which are sweeter and have addition spices.

@kenchan529,"For the past few mo's i've been a home brew wanna be pizzaolio.  When i watched u'r video, i think i'd make a couple mod's.  From my research, experimentation and experience using ""00"" flour (brand didn't really matter) made a difference in the texture of the dough/crust. I had started out using bread flour, but wasnt really able to achieve the correct texture. If u cant find it in stores, worse case scenario get it online. I also use reverse osmosis water to add to the flour a hack i got from https://youtu.be/IyfktmYqbRo?t=2144.  The other mod would be switching from a stone to a baking steel griddle  (which i heated on the stove directly to expedite my heating process(heats to 500+ within 7 minutes, keep it on longer and it'll go higher), and reduced my risk of cracking a stone, i use  kevlar-ove glove like or welding mitts to move the steel off the fire of the stove top to the oven ***SAFETY FIRST don't do this if u're afraid of buring u'rself).  These 2 mod's from u'r process, i think  achieving a near or exact replica NY style is within reach. as far as out door grill, pizza kettle if u already own a weber kettle is a good setup and repurpose of the grill and i use the steel there once again, and get enough heat reflection back to the top of the pizza, i create a pseudo oven in my grill,  or this is advise from a seasoned  guy https://youtu.be/IyfktmYqbRo?t=2016 .

@mukkaar,"My dough:  500g flour (Works with 00 flour and all purpose flour, have not tried with other flours) 325g/ml of water  1/2 tsp of salt touch of yeast, if I had to give amount it would be maybe like 1/8 tsp.  Knead for 8 min and let it rise overnight in lightly oiled bowl. Plastic wrap the bowl, cover with something to block light. You don't need sugar or much yeast when dough rises for a long time.   And maybe the best pizza sauce:  One can of whole tomatoes 1 tsp of salt Some extra virgin olive oil Blend it up. After blending add one or two whole hand crushed garlic cloves and some fresh basil. Let this sit in fridge for overnight and remove garlic cloves before use. Just use best quality tomatoes you can find, where I'm from the can size is 400g.   Next day you can form dough to 4 balls, roll them in flour, cover and let rest for at least 1h on floured surface.  Nice tip: After forming pizza dough sprinkle some chili flakes and honey or agave syrup on base before the sauce. Or you could put some sugar on the sauce day before. You can ofc rise it longer than 24h like in this case, but I usually do only one day. Process is also faster in room temp. I also like my oregano on pizza, but I sprinkle it on when pizza is out of the oven. Chili flakes especially are maybe on of the nicests addations to pizza, just put enough that there is the slightest heat, just enough to add another dimension to the taste, not really for the heat.  My pizza is not made with New York style in mind but I can guarantee it's really tasty. I use both fresh mozzarella and dehydrated mozzarella depending on what I feel like having. And ofc some parmesan, I prefer grating it on after baking. Oven tactics are same as in this video. Try topping it up with both fresh basil or coriander/cilantro.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@Zipzeolocke,"Instead of going through all that effort with the sauce, I prefer going with Chef Boyardee 4 cheese pizza sauce. Maybe it's the kid in me, feeling nostalgic for that flavor I grew up with.  There is also another sauce called Full Red Fully Prepared Pizza Sauce #10 by Stanislaus. you can try ordering that on Amazon and see if you like it. They have another version that is just the sauce with basil, you add the seasoning yourself. But I typically choose the fully prepared version for convenience sake",6년 전,0,

@guitarr44,"In my experience, proofing the dough for more than a day or two gives it an undesirable sour flavor and messes up its texture. Proofing to me is about hitting a sweet spot where the dough has risen as much as it's going to without bubbles popping (which reduces the dough's volume), and ""overproofing"" is something to watch out for.  I also would highly recommend first proofing the dough for 24 hrs as one whole piece in a plastic container. Then after that, scraping the dough out of the container (yes it's messy), forming the balls, then letting those proof for another 24 hours (or at least 3 or 4). I believe in letting the yeast do it's thing untouched for 24 hours before messing around with it. You'd be surprised how fragile these ""gluten networks"". Developing a dough with good gluten structure will really elevate your pie. And on that note about gluten networks, I've always been taught that stretching out dough is something you should do very delicately - pressing down on it just hard enough on a floured surface, letting it fall over your hands as you lightly pull apart your knuckles, etc. I think that does a lot to help maintain the dough's integrity and structure. I think you end up with pizza that has a fluffy texture yet good chew, and a crisp bottom. I could go on and on but those were my main takeaways and the pizza you made looks pretty great. And I'm no expert. My only 'evidence' for these tips comes from experience working in bakeries and two pizzerias - one with a strict dough-making process for traditional neopolitan pie, and another where I more or less used that prior knowledge, plus reading from guys like Chris Bianco and Joe Beddia, to create my own process.

@guillaumekiefer7657,"Hi from France !  It's interesting. I'm more used to Napolitan way of making pizza but your recipe shows some similarities with Napolitan pizzas (although the dough looks too thick to me) and that's why I would like to advice you something very important. Dough quality represents at least 50% of the final result, but tomato quality is certainly at least 30% more (then mozzarella, the real thing of course, is one thing to take into consideration !) Regarding to the tomatoes, please try to avoid mixing them and just try to use your hands only. The thing is : when mixing your san marzano tomatoes, you also break their seeds, and it adds more acidic taste than wanted in a pizza sauce...San marzano interest is that it's a very sweet kind of tomato, but if you add too much acid, the result will end in a ""normal"" tomato... If you're looking for the best family oven than can cook the best pizzas you'll ever taste inside your house, get your hands on P134H Effeuno electric oven. It can cook pizza at 500°C which is the only way to get this professional result. If you want some inputs about napolitan (the real pizza to be honest) way of cooking pizza, Just contact me :) Cheers ! Guillaume",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@GoldChump,"The ratio of ingredients for a New York Pizza crust is - 3/4 units Live Active Yeast, 2 units Salt, 3 units Brown Sugar, and 4 units Olive Oil. Flour should be wait for it ------> HIGH Gluten Flour. For a 50lb bag which equals a 75 lb dough by end with water added it is 3/4 yeast, 2 cups salt, 3 cups brown sugar, and 4 cups Olive Oil. The dough should be rolled tight when fresh and placed to rise in a refrigerator( cover with damp rag so crust outside does not harden or use a container with cover ). Once this process is complete dough should be removed from fridge and allowed to rise again before stretching out. All of this for a Neapolitan pie. If you want a thick Sicilian pie follow same procedure except when finished rising second time use a square or rectangle  pan and grease with olive oil. Stretch out dough to fit ( always make sure to slap doe in process of stretching so to beat air bubbles out) and allow dough to rise again. Very carefully add sauce and be sure not to smash risen dough down. You can actually cook the dough several minutes to maintain integrity of the ""rise"" then remove and add sauce/cheese. Depending on the oven you might need to pre-cook the Sicilian dough anyway so to time a brown crisp bottom, completely cooked threw dough,  and a satisfactory melted cheese. Sicilian dough is about twice the amount as the same size Neo. The dough should be basically dry to touch you can add pinches of flour during mixing to achieve this result once a ratio of water flour is close enough. Don't want the dough to stick to skid add lots of flour to skid...Don't forget the Oregano....EDIT: Buy a pizza stone for an electric oven and it will be just like your favorite Pizzeria...",6년 전(수정됨),0,

That's an option for some, if your friendly neighborhood restaurant sells their pizza dough. I've never met anyone else who bought dough like that.   Is there another town you could take a drive to where they sell the right kind of mozzerrella that's not string style? Just curious. I feel bad for you having to use an ingredient that's not your first choice.    The oregano thing, it is crucial. I put it on any pizza I have, often in addition to whatever else is on it. If the pie was baked with oregano, I still put a bit of dried flakes on top before eating. The fragrance from the oregano jar is heavenly to me.  Good video ... concise and easy to follow.

@grasmereguy5116," @Paola-bu8wx   NYC pizza (THE STANDARD FOR PIZZA EVERYWHERE!) was of course first made by Italian immigrants to New York. They had to leave Italy and move to New York City, where the water and the air is so special, in order for pizza to evolve from its primitive beginnings on the wrong side of the Atlantic Ocean and develop into its pure and perfect true form.  Rest assured, I agree that most pizza in the USA is pure garbage. (Hello Chicago! Hello Detroit! Hello California! I'm talking about you!) So I'm sure that Italian pizza is better than ""pizza"" from St Louis, Missouri, or Chicago, but by definition it simply cannot be better than New York pizza. We have a few places here in New York that make pizza al taglio, Roman-style and other varieties of pizza from Italy that it is okay, but nothing is better than a real NYC slice.",6년 전,0,

I'm not saying NY pizza is bad as I never tried it (although from what i saw...i can guess) but what you also don't understand is that the ingredients we use are just better.

New York culture & food isn't the same as the rest of the USA, and pizza in the rest of the USA is mostly shit.  Anyway, who do you think brought pizza to NY? It wasn't the Chinese. It was people from Italy. But in NY we have special water and air and we improved on Italian pizza a million times, because it evolved here.

@jamiany,"Some criticism: 1) Since you're using Dry Yeast instead of Fresh Yeast, don't put the salt in until you've at least put the flour in. Even mixing a bit before adding the salt would be good. Incorporating it directly in the water will kill most of the yeast. 2) Sugar should not be used in the dough, since sugar can also kill yeast. You can test whether your Dry Yeast is alive by blooming a tiny bit of it with sugar in an unrelated water bowl. If you want sugar, you can add it to the sauce, but even better would be California tomatoes (I use Miur Glen crushed, nothing else added). 3) Do not use plastic or metal containers to store dough, since they leech tastes onto your food. Glass is best for this. 4) Tip: For softer crust you can do purified water, for crispy crust Evian Water because of the minerals. Crispy crust works better with stuffed cheese crust, to melt and separate it.",6년 전,0,

I am demonstrably not killing enough of my yeast to cause any problems whatsoever. Mixing the salt in with the flour before mixing into the wet ingredients would require getting a large bowl dirty, and it is just not worth it. Again, ample rise, every time. The sugar in the dough is not for sweetness; I don't taste it. It's there to help the crust brown at domestic oven temperatures. Again, it's not killing my yeast; ample rise.

One key note if you can't get the top hot enough - use firebrick on four corners of the pizza, and put another stone on top...this will trap a LOT of the heat and reflect it down (creates a firebrick oven).

@rkmugen,"Try the under the broiler-to-stove top skillet method.  Since I don't have a crepe pan, nor a large (enough) skillet, what I ended up doing was get a standard metal pizza pan (13"" Chefmate, non-perforated), and broke it in by baking a bunch of greasy things on it several times beforehand........ you know, to season it, as you would normally do to something like a cast iron skillet or frying pan.  Once that pizza pan has a nice layer of seasoning on it, I just take a paper towel and wipe on a new coat of just regular olive oil onto it.  While the oven is on the broil setting (not really a 'setting', because my oven is all-gas, from the 1970's.... so no push-buttons), I press the dough out on the counter to flatten it initially, then stretch it by hand, pick it up with both hands and glide it over and onto the lightly greased pizza pan.  Add the toppings and place it under the broiler..... as close to the broiler's FLAME as possible.  What I did was take the bacon drip pan that came with the oven (you can buy a separate one online or even from Target if your oven didn't come with one), invert it, and place it on the top rack of my oven.  Then I placed the pizza pan on top of it.  I used TWO pairs of blunted tongs (so the sharp edges won't scrape the pizza pan), one pair of tongs in each hand, and used them to rotate the entire pizza pan while the pizza was cooking under the broiler.  This is because the broiler's heating element is in the shape of a narrow, rectangular bar - if you don't rotate the pizza pan while it's under the broiler, half of the pizza will be cooked, the other will be.... under-cooked.  Once the pizza is done broiling, I move the entire pizza pan onto the stove top burners  Since the pan is rather wide, I turned BOTH the front and rear burner on medium to medium-high FLAME, and proceeded to cook the UNDERSIDE of the pizza.  This will cook the outer perimeter of the underside.  Once that's done, I turn off the rear burner and center the pizza pan on top of the front burner......... this will cook the center/middle of the pizza.   Why use this method?  You save CONSIDERABLE amount of money on your gas/electric bill by shortening the length of time to pre-heat the oven.  AND..... this method will allow you to approach the results comparable to that of a wood burning oven, commonly used for traditional Neapolitan pizzas.",6년 전,0,

@hoverbike,"I have a much better method to present, but first some criticisms for the video;  A 7 day rise? Shit man, you got some funky shit going on. I hope that shit isn't giving you stomach problems, I would never let a dough rise for that long. Get a feel for when the dough has doubled in volume. Usually for me, a cold water made dough put in the fridge needs a day, around 24 hours. Same method as you, but I prefer to use fresh yeast, for a slow cold rise, about a 'big' green pea size.  Pizza is easy to make. Experiment, and make it your own. This is the process to get you started, and it should require no investment, given you have a pan and an oven: This process is derived from Gordon Ramsay's video: ""How to Make Margherita Pizza at Home - Gordon Ramsay"" I strongly suggest to watch it as well as reading this.  The measurements for the dough aren't completely off. I prefer to use fresh yeast, around 20 grams. Check out Malteserkors to see what I'm talking about. Replace cold with warmth. Not hot. Warm. Maximum is 37 celsius, body temperature. Warm the water in the microwave in a cup, until it feels pleasantly warm to a well washed pinky finger. Put your yeast in a cup, cover it with warm water, let it relax before mixing. Do not add sugar to the yeast, add it to the dough mix. We are not making alcohol. Fresh yeast is easy to tell whether its good or not. It turns dry and powdery when it isn't. Also the smell changes slightly, but I wouldn't use it as a point of reference to anybody reading this. Once everything is combined, the dough is kneaded, and put in a bowl to rise, cover it only with a cloth, and leave it somewhere warm, a good example would be the pleasant warm the floor tiles in your bathroom has, or kitchen. If you have neither, experiment with a radiator and distance. Make sure it is PLEASANT TO YOURSELF. You don't want to kill your dough.   This warm kneaded dough will need 45 min to 1 hour 15 to rise to double volume. Don't put a timer on, its not the time that matters. Its the size. Let it rise for too long, and those threads that you spent sweat and tears kneading, powering through with your little noodle arms are PRECIOUS. Don't let them go to waste.  Once it has achieved the desired volume (twice, I hope this is clear now), cut the dough into desired sizes. I can only tell you to experiment, because the size of your lumps of dough depends on the size of your largest pan. To start with, make lumps the size of a woman's balled fist. Slightly smaller than your own fist. This should produce a thin dough that fits your pan. If it does not, adjust next time.  Leave these lumps to rise for 15-20 minutes, to let the dough recover from the slashing you just gave it.  By the way, I don't know how to properly explain this, but you can sort of tuck the edges you created in, by using the chop side of your hand, to sort of ball it together. Do like a cup with your hands, but open the bottom up, and move one hand away from yourself while you pull the other one towards you. Good luck.  Once the dough has made its recovery, cheat, and use a rolling pin. Cover your entire kitchen in flour. Don't hold back. Roll it into a thin circle by alternating the path you roll it. Always start on the dough, never on the kitchen surface, or you will have lots of trouble.  Once the dough is shaped, put it in a pan that you have let preheat for a good amount of time. This is more or less important depending how thick and heavy your pan is. Heavier is better, holds heat for longer, which is very important. Your pan is like your pizza stone, and the dough is big and cold. I usually let it sit on the stove until I start seeing the slightest bubbling.  Depending on your oven, and the thickness of your dough, you may need to put the pan in the oven, to quickly seal the top of the dough, as to prevent tomato from soaking it, and to get the dough cooking a little bit, as thick ones may need longer than your toppings desire.  Preferably, this won't be the case, and you can simply top them, and throw them under an oven set to Chernobyl's fourth reactor hot. Grill, everything it has. Killmode. Throw the pan inside, watch it happen. It will take around 5-6 minutes, but perhaps more if your oven is tired and old.   As for the sauce, rather than letting it sit for three days to spoil, I prefer to reduce it. And I don't mean 'a little'. I start off doing the sauce before doing the quick rise dough, or simultaneously. I reduce it to the thickness of a runny jam. Once the sauce hits room temperature, it will be very thick. Don't put in any salt or spices other than stuff you want to soak flavor out of (garlic, for example), you will do this at the end, as you will over-salt it, if you salt it to a good flavor at the beginning of reduction, and then reduce it to half volume. It will be 2-3 hours of simmering *wasted*. And since you are basically making runny tomato paste, you should add very little. A teaspoon for 2 tins of skinned tomatoes.   I generally avoid putting in any oregano and such. I don't feel like it does anything. However, I dress the pizza after its done with it, so that the scent is there when it is presented. I feel like oregano is more of a 'scent' spice than a flavor spice.   Good luck making your own pizza. Experiment, and make it your own. This is the process to get you started, and it should require no investment, given you have a pan and an oven:",6년 전(수정됨),0,

If you can get papa Johns to throw the crust thinner (not pre made thin) and bake it well done, it's way better.  And as soon as you pick it up, and you take the garlic butter out of the hot pizza box, it stays very creamy !!!  Where i live currently, in Los Angeles though, there are Mexican owned pizza places with $5 to $6 Carryout 14"" Large Specials all the time. Yet people are hooked by tv ads and order $9 Pizza hut delivery, but after minimum order and $5 Delivery Charge, you pay $20. These Good Privately owned places make Dominos taste like Chef boy R.D.  i think where you live, you are better off making it at home.

Bread flour is 100% necessary, preferrably King arthur. The second crucial step is making your dough. Make the dough super stiff and keep working it untill it has a very smooth texture and don't add water! Lastly, cover your rounded dough in olive oil and wait for it to rise.  I recommend buying the walmart 16in pizza pan, its super cheap. Bake your pizza as high as your oven goes. Most conventional ovens do 500°F, thatll do. Cook it for 12-16min untill you see a brown crust. Tips: don't use cheap ingredients, invest in good sauce, mozzarella, and olive oil. I wish I could show you but I can't.

Instead of adding tomato paste, use more whole tomatoes and cook them down before seasoning, this avoids the tinny taste that paste adds. One can also blend a quarter onion in which adds sweetness when baked. 1 or 2 tbsp of mild white wine vinegar gives a really nice glaze to exposed sauce when baked as well. Lastly, sometimes (especially on a meat pizza) using soy sauce instead of salt will give the tomato sauce heartier character. Awesome vid btw! Wish I'd seen it when I started.",6년 전,0,

Oil in the bowl is important to keep the dough from sticking when you pull it out after it has risen. You could prob use less in the bowl, but you need some.

@tofugremlin2299,"Hey man! I was taught how to make pizza by a brooklynite pizza chef and actually trained under him for a year and some change. There's a few things I think you should consider. The first is definitely gluten percentages! If your having trouble getting a dough to rise and create that nice big air bubbly presence in your dough and getting more of a crumble texture, I would look towards getting a gluten percentage in the mid teens, 12-14%. When you do this, remember that the more gluten, the more time the yeast needs to break down that gluten. Secondly, I think you should consider autolysis. Autolysis is to bind the water flour mixture before breaking down the gluten with yeast and seasoning. My procedure for creating dough is always this: autolyse, yeast, season. Always giving the dough time between each step. To Autolyse, simply mix all of your flour with all of your water minus 20 percent for yeast and salt. With your hands, gently mix  the water and flour until the gluten fibers just barely begin to form, then let rest while you prepare yeast and a salt water solution for seasoning. After that I then ad yeast, and gently mix, making sure to not create a fully bonded dough. After a mandatory 2 minutes, I season with salt and olive oil, and knead to completion. Thirdly, I think you should consider a more particular testing period. The dough should rest covered after made, then shaped, then oiled, then rested without covering, then covered and slowly fermented for at least 48 hours at around 5 degrees Celsius. It's odd and quite persnickety, but I believe it to be essential. Also, if you want tips on how to toss/stretch dough like the pros, shoot me a message! Of course if you'd like any other tips, ask away!",6년 전,0,

@deepfried13,"A few tips i've picked up working in NYC pizzerias:  1) Work the dough over your knuckles. Instead of pulling and yanking it you can gently roll the dough over your knuckles until it's the size you want. This avoids overhandling that will break down your dough structure and make it lose its elasticity.  2) Plenty of places do it, but you should try to avoid using sugar in the dough. Yeast will break down the simple sugar instead of the flour sugar and rob your dough of some complex gluten flavor 3) Don't top the pizza on your peel! Top it on your work surface and only put it on the peel when you're ready to launch into the oven, that way you won't have to worry about it binding to the peel!!   That's about it, everything else looks great! Fold that bad boy and enjoy",6년 전,0,

You don't want a dry crust, you want a cooked crust that's airy, light, and still somewhat moist. Obviously when you don't have a pizza oven it makes it harder to get that temperature right. I've found what works best is using the broil setting with the stone near the top (very well preheated), while leaving the front door of the oven open to prevent the thermometers from kicking off. I can get an even 700 degrees in my home oven if I don't close the door.

@aragusea,"1) The oil keeps the dough from sticking to the bowl as it rises, and also protects the skin of the dough from drying out. It allows you to extract the ball from the bowl without deflating it. I do a long, slow rise in the fridge because is slows fermentation resulting in a finer bubble structure and, I think, better flavor. You could maybe use less oil in the bowl than I have here, but I think having a good coating of oil around the edge helps it brown at domestic oven temperatures, since oil transfers heat more efficiently than air or water. 2) In the middle of summer when I have beautiful fresh tomatoes from my garden, I do use them in my sauce. But the rest of the year, high-quality canned tomatoes will always be far superior to hot-house-grown ""fresh"" tomatoes available at the grocery store. Also, the aim of this particular recipe is not to make the best-quality pizza possible; it's to recreate the NYC street pizzeria pizza I grew up with and love, and that is definitionally a low-cost product that uses cheap ingredients. None of those places use fresh tomatoes because they're too expensive and labor-intensive to prepare. Lots of wonderful foods are born from poverty. I would think a Frenchman would know that. 3) As I said in the video, the correct cheese for replicating the NYC-style is whole-milk, low-moisture mozzarella. The only way you can use fresh mozz on a pizza (as in Neapolitan style) is to use far less cheese, otherwise you'll get a huge puddle of whey in the middle of your pizza. Also, mozzarella marketed in the U.S. as ""low-moisture"" has been dried using a high-heat drying method that causes additional fermentation, and results in a stronger flavor. Again, I would think a Frenchman would know that ""fresh"" is not always best in food — you have many delicious cheeses that are old and funky. As to why I don't use a grater, as I said in the video, I live in a small city in the deep south, and no grocery store near me sells whole-milk, low-moisture mozz in block form. I can, however, get these Galbani cheese sticks, and they're really very good. It's the same cheese they sell in block form.

@johntrent018," @aragusea   1) Being french don't automatically give me the greatest gastronomic knowledge, and I think you've a lot more knowledge than me about food, so I'm happy for learning the ""Fridge and oil"" trick, thanks. I think the biggest food difference between France and US are in the economy : cooking at home sounds to be cheaper in France (eating outside can be really expensive in France. For a pizza, depending on which pizza and the pizzeria, it generally goes from 9$ to 25$ in little cities). So I generally cook at home, but I don't have some god culinary knowledge so far.  2) Don't worry, for this point I know it, we can make extra cooking with poor food. The pizza itself was originally a meal born from poverty, back in time. And I agree about the fact we can find some great quality food in supermarkets, sometimes, it happens.  3) Well, for the cheese, I don't know a lot about American cheeses in supermarkets and all so I couldn't judge how you're using it. If you tell me this cheese sticks are good for this, I'm okay with it, after all, we all have some great alternatives to high quality food in different countries.  Again a time, I hope I didn't offense you, I'm not a french cooker and I've never tasted this NY pizza, so I guess I can only judge related to french pizza, but I also guess these are two things we can't compare, and both can be great pizza.",6년 전,0,
@johntrent018," @aragusea  Also, when you're speaking about costs of tomatoes exploitation, it reminds me of a french gardener, Pascal Poot, who grows some vegetables fields in his own philosophy : he doesn't use anything to make his vegetables grow (not even any water during dry season in summer). No chemical products. He's doing this way so when his vegetables are ""sicks"" they ""learn how to survive"" by themselves and transmit it to future vegetables, through seeds.

@aragusea,"I think it's mostly an urban myth. Yes, NYC has unusually soft water, and yes, soft water does affect dough, but you can buy soft water in bottles, and when I've tried baking pizza with it, I noticed no difference in the finished product.",6년 전,0,
@aragusea,"The long cold rise slows fermentation, resulting in a finer bubble structure and, I think, better flavor. It's also easier. You just make it the dough, toss it in and forget about it. After a day or two, you can just take it out and make pizza any day for the next week. If your dough isn't rising in the fridge, there are a couple possibilities. You might have your fridge set to be unusually cold. But I think more likely, you're doing something wrong as you're making your dough. Did your yeast bloom thoroughly? Meaning, when you mixed it with a little bit of warm sugar water, did it get super frothy and bubbly? If not, it was dead to begin with, or maybe you killed it by using water that was too hot. Maybe you added your salt to the water and then waited too long to add your flour. The flour dilutes the salinity of the water. If you leave the salt in the water for too long before putting in the flour, the salt can kill the yeast. Another possibility is that your yeast is alive, but you made your dough too dry (i.e. too much flour) and thus it's too stiff to allow the gas created by the yeast to stretch it out. As I wrote in the pinned comment above, I think the dough I demonstrated in this video was a bit too dry. Should be a bit stickier. Good luck!",6년 전,1,

@aragusea,"A tablespoon of sugar spread across four pizzas is not a lot of sugar. The finished product does not taste sweet at all. The sugar is there to help the dough brown at home-oven temperatures, which are lower than what you can get in a professional oven. I don't always add a pinch of sugar to the tomatoes. It depends on the tomatoes. They vary a lot. I taste them, and then I see what they need. Some need more sweetness, some need more acidity, some are just right. Americans are fat for a lot of reasons, but the sugar in this recipe results in a negligible difference in calories.",6년 전,0,
@ulrichlehnhardt4293," @aragusea  For my European tongue most recipes from the US are too sweet. I would use less sugar. I only use a tiny tiny little bit to make the yeast work. I agree on your calorie argument. But it is a question of taste. Sweetened dough for pizza just gives me goose bumbs. Most industrial doughs are sweetened, so I don't see any reason to make my own dough (which I have done for 50 years now) and spoil it with sugar. In  this case, I could buy one in the store. Less sugar means more natural taste! Even if it may taste unusual for our industrially spoiled tongues but I recommend to give it a try. I would for sure taste the sugar in your recipe, even if you think that it does not taste sweet, I could tell it is sweetened.",6년 전,0,

@bodeghost,"This is fantastic & thank you, for I am always looking to enhance anything recipe wise in the ole kitchen.   Now a few moons ago when I was still running my tile company, while at my  clients house... every. single. day. my taste buds were awakened & excited by the aromas alone.   I simply could not take it anymore & had to inquire as to what she was making. That's when I was blown away. This classy lady said she had lots of experience from taking charge in the kitchen from the old country. I replied in an almost guessing type posture and said, like Sicily, Italy old country? Now, you would have thought  the pope came to visit or something given her reaction and very proud smile behind those eyes... 😉   She did reply with a most enthusiastic yes and if any barriers were up, which there were not, but if any barriers 'were' up.. they were gone now! She asked me honestly to give her an age. I gazed at her with an almost puzzled look and said you want me to guess your age?   Now, I never like to do this type of thing but I am used her and said I am going to be honest and put you in your late 60s to mid-70s. She asked me if I'm being very honest and I said I'm not kidding I am being extremely honest. She told me that she has taken extremely good care of herself, drinks a half a bottle of Chianti everyday since she was 13 and that it has to be chilled.   Slowly but surely we began to get along more and more because I told her without any hesitation that I too love, chilled Chianti. She then [FINALLY] revealed her age & shockingly she told me that is 93 ! You heard me... 😉 93 !   NOW! She enthusiastically begins to tell me that when it comes to any type of red Italian sauces, especially pasta and/or pizza sause, do the following with your tomato paste and ONLY the, TOMATO PASTE !  BURN IT!!!!!  Get a separate pan, in goes your tomato paste & BURN IT! She prefers using an properly seasoned old school cast-iron skillet. Luckily, I have several! You should have seen hers. An 8"" skillet over 100 years in use! That got me thinking for my skillets. I found out they too were over 100+ years from my Grandfather's side. 100%   I do sincerely apologize for this incredibly long dissertation here but I do want to thank you for your incredible recipe as this looks exactly like something I am going to enjoy cooking up this weekend.   If you don't mind I would like to pop back over and let you know how it turned out. I hope anybody reading this will actually give that burning of the tomato paste a try and/or maybe you have already heard of this...   but I have shared this numerous times with family and friends and everybody says whatever that lady told you and however she came to learn of it as well... There's just something about it! So, if you've got that perfect sauce you been making for years and all you are required to do differently is the BURNING of the tomato paste, I promise... it's going to be the talk of the town & nobody has to be none the wiser!

@kedrak90,I had great success with a cold risen dough. Your sauce is very traditional. I like to a sweetness to it. I've tried adding half a banana and it worked out really well but I'm usually using a spoon of honey. The banana is not really detectable in the end product but it does change the taste a bit (but not better or worse than usual). Basil (about a third of the oregano) would also be nice.  Self-made dough that was frozen works somehow better than just after 24h in the fridge for me.  I just made a batch of dough as close to your way as I could. I think that I messed up with the conversion to metric and that my Thermomix scale is way off so I ended up with flour soup. But after adjusting by feel I got a good feeling about this. I also used regular white wheat flour. I have no idea what the local equivalent of what American flour is.,6년 전,0,

@aragusea,"Does it look like the dough snapped back? It didn't. Working with cold dough makes it less likely to stick to the peel, because it's stiffer. Letting it warm up first makes it easier to stretch, and arguably results in a more even bake, but my priority here was to keep the pizza from sticking while I took the extra time to fiddle with my camera. Also, I think working with cold dough is safer for beginners, which is who I'm trying to help with this video.",6년 전,0,

@MasterMichelleFL,"❤Sweet! I've been playing,  but haven't found my favorite crust yet...hope this one is it! Tips: I found a ""PizzaQue"" oven. It's a coated metal oven that has a good sized propane ring under a double stacked stone. The top stays on and there's an opening to slide your pizza in(up to 12 inch pie, I cut mine in 1/4 too).  This little wonder heats up to 850/900° in like six minutes. It's easy to move, and you can set it up outside. I slide a steel box with wood chips (oak, hickory, apple, cherry, pecan, mesquite,  etc) into the bottom and it's like a wood fired (adds the smokey flavor), only it's faster to get going. My crusts usually have a few of those big crunchy bubbles. ❤💚❤",6년 전,0,

The stone heats up about 120°C and the Top the full 350°C. That takes about 25 - 30 minutes. When the top heater is at full temperatur i bake the Pizza about 6 minutes.

@maxque2841,"Can you give some kind of a guideline as far as how long it should be kneading in the mixer? Even a +/- of a few minutes would be fine, just trying to get an idea. I tried this recipe yesterday and my dough came out super droopy and I'm worried it was because I didn't knead it long enough initially. Baked up okay but was a little thick due to me using too much dough to fit our pizza stone, and as such I couldn't make it ""new york"" thin... This was more of what I imagine a Jersey thin would be (pretty thick). Was also quite sticky and hard to work with considering the oil in the bowl, and I think that made it hard to slide off of my makeshift metal peel, even when using a plethora of corn meal -- like every square inch of the bottom was covered with meal. Either way, thanks for the recipe I will definitely be tweaking my methods until I get it down.

When you get more advanced and more confident, you can start working with wetter doughs, which I think taste better. But dry doughs are safer. As far as kneading time is concerned, it just depends on your mixer, if you're doing it by hand, etc. In my mixer it just takes a few minutes, but time isn't important.

Yes, our water is in fact from the Catskills (and also Delware). Yes, we have rats. No, they don't show up in our restaurants (they just chill in the subway stations). Yes, a lot of things are over-priced, but only for tourists (stop listening to tour guides, they only want your money). Yes, pollution and crime are pretty bad here, but the same goes for any big city in America. And lastly, yes, it is the water the makes the pizza taste right (same for the bagels).

@varva001,"You asked for comments, so here I am. I will not comment on the doses of what you use because I don't know how much a cup, a spoon or w/e is in grams. When you cook or bake you should always use weight and not volume to measure. Why? One remains almost constant given the gravity, the other one doesn't, so 1 liter of oil isn't 1 kg of water.   1st Mistake is adding the salt to the yeast. This should never be done, because part, or if unlucky all of the yeast dies. 2nd The flour you use. You say to use bread flour w/e that is, and then add high protein flour. What is important is the strength of the flour which is related to the amount of protein it has, but you don't need a strong flour. A too strong flour would make the pizza too chewy. What is ideal is a flour with about strength(W) of 160 in order to be able to absorb 60% of its weight of water. A strong flour in my country generally is used to absorb between 75 to 90% of its weight of water.  3rd Not really an error, but it will save some of the mess you make. The oil you put in the container, i guess you use it in order to allow the dough to increase in volume without sticking to the container. Well, what we do is ""wet"" the container with some flour. This term also apply to when you sprinkle the flour on the peel. 4th The fridge. This one hurts. Yeast doesn't grow well with 4C (which is the temperature your home fridge should be set at). This is why it takes you a whole day to make the dough rise. Put it in a container in a warm part of your house and the pizza will rise in few hours more than it does in the fridge for a day. I guess the oil you use on the pizza helps not having to deal with a thin sheet of dried dough that forms after a whole day in the fridge. There is a name for that too in my language but i don't know how to translate it to english. It happens in restaurants where we keep the dough in the fridge after it has grown to stop the yeast and allow us to maintain the pizza during the day, but if cooked right off the fridge it forms burnt pieces. 5th San Marzano is the species of the plant, you can grow them in NY if you want to. They are the traditional tomatoes for sauces. Inexpensive, easy to grow and the pant produces  many fruits. So if you are paying a lot for that, it's a rip off, but if you like them, go for it! The error here stayes in ageing the tomato paste. It's not really safe to age a raw sauce for days, and it's rare but it can lead to food poisoning, other than that i've noticed you add tomato paste to make it thicker. Why not boiling off some of its water? just heat it for a few minutes until you like the consistence, or add a pinch of starch to thicken the thing up. 6th Stone isn't a great heat conductor and that is why it takes forever to heat up. Why not using alluminum instead? It gets hot in seconds and it transfer the heat much more quickly This are the major things I've noticed in the video, let me know if this helped or if after trying some of my tips it came out better, easier or you prefer to stick to your stile.

@Reggie2000,"Long time pizza man here. I don't know about NY pizza, but some other tips would be this. One, feel free to also try some good aged white cheddar (NOT new orange chedder!) or provolone cheese as well. Two, the Parmesan should really have been put on top of the other cheese for best flavor. Trust me. Three, never use a bunch of raw veggies and raw meat together as it will release to much liquid, you have to par cook or fully cook some of them. Most usually cook the meat, and use raw veggies for a balance. Four, if you love onions, but don't like them crunchy, then dice them and put them on first so that the sauce cooks them soft. Five, I when using pepperoni, I like doing two layers, one on the bottom, and a layer on top. Six, also look into the old world pepperoni that comes cured as a stick you have to cut. Definitely put that on top as it will curl and collect flavorful pools of grease in each curled pepperoni cup. Yum!   Seven, no on in the game to my knowledge ""ages"" dough for a week. In fact most tout the freshness of their daily made dough. Sure it needs to rise, heat does that, and yes you can rise it slowly in the fridge, but anything beyond three, maybe four days, is old ass dough, or ""poor dough management"" as it is professionally called. If he or you likes it, then of course do as you please, but know that it is highly unorthodox, and I doubt any reputable pizzeria in NYC is using week old dough. The fact that he feels it tastes sour makes sense though, and that is a bad thing imo. You will know it is getting old the same way humans do. It will start to get brown age spots.   Eight. Dough freezes, so feel to freeze the rest right away. Like before you let it rise, and then let it rise in a warm place when you thaw it to reactivate the yeast. Nine, once again, this is not the NYC way, but the quick biscuits that come in the refrigerated tubes, flattened out, make great mini pizzas. So do English muffins. Ten, I'm sure his sauce is great, but the jars of sauce are pretty good too in a pinch. Don't feel you have to make your own sauce to make homemade pizza. Same with the dough. Just do what it takes to get into the homemade pizza game to start, and then ramp it up from there. Experiment with different toppings and have fun.   Finally, always add some Italian Season to the top before you cook it for added flavor!  So important.  Hope some of these tips are helpful. Good luck.",6년 전,39,

@thomashughes4859,"Adam, thank you. I have been working pizzas and dough for 25 years, and your recipe is EXCELLENT!  I have a suggestion on the sauce: buy tomatoes a week or so in advance, and since they're climacteric fruits, they will ripen off the vine. Place them near bananas or avocados for faster ripening. I kid you not, let them sit on the counter till they become (in Spanish ""aguados"" or I guess in English ""soft and liquidy-ish"") ... even if they have a few black spots - as long as they don't get to that ""icky tomato"" smell, you're still GREAT TO GO! Here's the kicker, IF you want to go for the sauce of sauces, pressure cook them at HIGH pressure for twenty minutes (canned tomatoes MUST be cooked, so not a deal-breaker here).  When they come out (fast or natural depressurisation OK), you may remove the skins or leave them (more vitamins and again, for me a native NY-er, not a deal breaker (Buffalo, btw)). Either way, you'll not have a need for the paste, and as a bonus, if you wish to add a little red wine - all the better, seriously. I have an OTB Italian where I live who puts wine in the sauce.  Advice worth the price, my friend. Great video, and now you make me want to get a set of pizzas going! God bless!",6년 전,0,

@aragusea,"Galbani makes a good mozz. The cheese they sell molded into sticks is the exact same cheese they sell as a block, it is no more or less ""processed."" It's good cheese and, more importantly, it's the right cheese for this style pizza. Utility pizza places in NY use low-moisture mozz that has been dried with a high-heat method the causes additional fermentation. The cheese is stronger in flavor as a result, and also has a ""snap"" when the pizza is well-rested that I think is characteristic of this style. I have learned from many people who make pizza professionally. What works in a commercial context is not necessarily what works best for the home cook. I'm not going to make a poolish. I have other priorities for my time. This method is fast and easy and makes a good pie.",6년 전,0,

A long cold ferment is definitely the best way to develop flavor although I haven't noticed much improvement > 48 hours.  Secondly, a steel vs a stone will improve the cook time and and make for an even crisper crust as steel has more thermal mass.  You can also get a pretty large steel which is great as you can make bigger pies.  Lastly, if you're having trouble launching the pies into the oven (as I do) use parchment paper and pull it out half way though the cook.  Parchment paper will allow you to work the pie for as long as you want without worry of it sticking.  Bonus tip - make garlic oil (minced garlic in olive oil) and brush it on the crust post cook... godlike.",6년 전,0,

@elizabethdorchester5307,Nice pizza mr American physco . Pls tell me youv seen that film because you sound just like tge main character . Also ever tried adding some basil to the tomato sause . Its the real missing ingrediant . Always use fresh not the dried stuff . And i like the way you handled this very nice indeed . For the cheese you did a good job . If you drizzle the cheese in a bit of extra virgin oil your gonna get crazy crisp . I want a slice . The parmesan was a great pick . I find freezing the parmesan makes it taste stronger . I appreciate the logic behind it may be flawed but for me it works . Top tip is to put tiny slices on the inside of the pizza not the base with a fork because the sause just tips into them . Now after the nice addition of parmasan you can put half the cheese then bake . Once it begins to get that color you managed to get which may i add is a skill and after its risen how you like it then open the over . Turn the grill on max add rest of cheese and grill on highest heat 5.2 inches from the direct heat but thats in my oven and i do it for 4mins and 25 seconds or intill its how you want it . When you take it out i have to day i was impressed with your skill and techniques.  Rest it on a little flour seasoned with that yummy salt and serve.  I cut mine with a very Sharp string also into 4 slices and serve . I try to cook a selection of pizzas every outher day and iv tried so many things.  I found mixing the dough with water thats had pickles resting in the for 40 hours gives it a subtle but tasty tingle . I must ask do you ever make seafood pizzas . I make a lobster and orange chocolate one and its unbelievable . Pls share some outher videos with your own recipes.  Thanks,6년 전,0,

@KaWouter_,"Since you love to hear some feedback: - I see no reason at all to separate your dough before rising, only more dishes to wash off. From all Italian recipes I've seen, not a single one has separated his/her dough. You can get the shape right after rising. - Overkill on sugar, for 400 g of flour I would only add a tablespoon. The goal of the sugar is to make the browning of the dough better and should not be a huge flavour enhancer. Sugar to the sauce you can do to balance the tomatoes. - Heat up your marinara: it's faster than letting it set for 48 h, you can add the whole can with juices and boil them off slowly, your sauce will be much thicker and a much more developed flavour with the herbs added at the end. Minced garlic and/or a shalot can also enhance the flavour. - Finish off your pizza with oregano (dried or fresh) for that extra bit of flavour.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@thedave5687,"One of the first things you learn if you do an apprenticeship as a baker in switzerland is a how to check if the dough has finished kneading: Its similar to how you do it, but you should be able to pull the dough apart without tearing until it is so thin that you can read newspaper through it. By those standards, your dough would be considered underkneaded, but its kind of hard to reach that level of stretchability at home. With the food processor I have at home, I have to knead the dough for about 30 minutes. It results in a dough thats much more elastic and airy. You also have to use really cold water as the dough warms up quite a lot when kneading this long. (ideal temperature after finishing kneading is 23-28°C, colder than that and the yeast wont develop properly, warmer than that and the dough will start to lose its firmness).

@ViviSectia,"Since others didn't do it, let me explain what the water actually does. The reason why people think it was due to water in the first place was due to people moving from New York and finding that their recipes suddenly stopped being good with only the water being different. It actually was due to the water but it wasn't something magical about the water or the cleanness but instead because of the hardness and PH of the water. The hardness affects the gluten in the dough. Hard water makes the dough tougher due to having more calcium and magnesium. Softer water like New York has causes the dough to be soft and sticky.    New York's water is naturally at the perfect softness for bread making. The decades old recipes that pizza makers have been using is centered around the water being at that specific hardness so when New Yorkers moved and found their recipes not being as good, they either used their baking experience to adapt to the hardness or softness of their new water by compensating by changing the ratios of ingredients or they blamed the water and said it was impossible without New York water.",6년 전,1,

I've been making home pizza for 20 some years. Every time I went into a pizza shop I would strike up a conversation with the owner or manager and inevitably I would walk away with my pizza and a small bit of advice to add to my recipe. Thanks for offering some great suggestions; rise time, tomato paste, I'll even have to check the type of Motz i am using. My pizza is 16"" (not bragging) with pepperoni, onion, fresh garlic and feta. Soooo good, (now I am) but any hoo. A few years ago I priced out my pizza with all ingredients to just under $3 per pie. $3.....while I still like a shop pie its kinda hard to spend $17 anymore.  for those that don't have a stone, I highly recommend double bake like a sicilian (deep) pie. For the first bake on the bottom rack, wet the dough with just a bit of water down sauce (no spice) in the center leaving a defined edge crust dry. Maybe 10 min or so turning every 2-3min until the crust is lightly browned. Add more sauce and toppings and on the top rack for finish baking.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

I told people to start with a basic volume ratio that would likely be too wet, and to add flour until they get the desired hydration. It's perfectly fine to do this by feel. You don't need a thermometer to cook a perfect steak, either. You can judge dough hydration by touch. I don't want to weigh ingredients at home. It's a pain.",6년 전,0,
@jonasaras,"Variations of 2% in the level hydration will make a delectable difference in the final outcome.  You might make something that works out once, but then you'll never duplicate it again.  People then try to put the blame on humidity, etc.  Weighing is as easy as turning on a scale.  Your dough formula translates into bakers percentages as follows: Flour - 100%, Water - 85.6%, Salt - 2.32%, Yeast -0.48%,  Sugar - 2.57%, Oil - 9.65%.  This is NOT a NY dough.  There isn't a NY pizzeria that uses that much oil.  If it's in there at all it's at 1-2% and it's added after the dough ball has come together.  The typical hydration for a NY dough is 56-63%.  Sugar, if it's present at all is 2% or less.  The amount of yeast should be cut in half for cold fermentation and you should be using water that is at 65-70F (assuming your flour is about 70F to begin with).  The finished dough temperature should be 75-80F.  Here are the weights for a single 312g dough ball (same size as yours) of a legit NY pizza dough.

@marghebimoullabiere9629,Dude 10 years?? to make NY pizza you should have given up. just so you know the technique to make pizza or bread is to calculate amount of water to flour (hydration)  exemple  classic NY pizza :  1kg Flour 650ml  Cold water 8 degrees 6g dry yeast or 15g fresh yeast  (ask bakery in your local supermarket $2) Salt 25g Olive oil 20g Method : In mixing bowl add (flour + yeast) mix 2min Add water slowly while mixing for about 8min non stop slow speed Add salt mix for 5min Add oil mix for 5min 2min on high speed Rest the dough for an hour at 22c covered with slightly wet towel on your kitchen surface  ball dough to 300g Let rest for 5 hours at 22c covered with plastic  Place in fridge for 24 to 36 hours  Stretching use semolina only ( cook same way) BTW your stone is black because you are using too much flour under your pizza  Enjoy buddy,6년 전(수정됨),0,

@siliconpenguin,"Hey @Adam Rausea That's got to be the most honest ""New York"" style pizza I've ever seen online. Disclaimer: I'm from Chicago. Now I've eaten NY style pizza in NYC, Florida, San Diego, Dallas, and Las Vegas. And they were all pretty much the same. Thin crust pizza, sauce, cheese, maybe pepperoni - done. Not bad, but I have some complaints. Firstly you call the crust crisp. Okay, I would say a potato chip is crisp - if you try to bend it, it breaks. If it bends, its soggy. These are just terms, but they're important. Don't get me wrong, I have respect for NY style pizza, I can enjoy it. But a slice of pizza that can be bent in half is not crispy...  My second complaint is that the cheese is always supper greasy.  It seems it isn't NY style pizza if the cheese isn't the lowest grade, greasy cheese. You use olive oil, as I do, because you're using a low fat cheese., is that authentic? I don't know.  Enough complaints!  Okay, there is no reason to refrigerate your dough unless you're making it ahead of time. You could just put your dough on top of the fridge for an hour or two. The fridge only retards the growth of the yeast - the cold temps slows down the growth. You only want to do that if you want to cook the dough at a later date.",6년 전,0,

@davidthomas6094,"You made a great looking pie.  A couple comments: the extra hydration is generally helpful, but the crispy factor comes from the effect of evaporation during cooking (just as an air-conditioner works by removing moisture from household air); and you mention using a grill for high temperature, but crucial for 800+ degree cooking is to have the top heat and bottom heat in balance.  A basic truth about pizza is heat balance, top to bottom.  You'd need a heat-safe insulated dome in a Weber kettle to get heat radiating down as well as up.  Also, except for the Neapolitan-style places in NYC, which is not NYC slice style, I bet their heat is more like 550-600.  Neapolitan pizzas bake in 90 seconds or so.  They also use different flour (Caputo 00, typically, which doesn't brown properly at less than 800+ degrees, alas).  But I think you've nailed the NYC style.  Another hack: while I haven't gone so far for heat as some people, who disable the self-cleaning mechanism, where the oven typically locks itself and goes to 800 degrees or so to clean away crud to dust--they cook the pizzas in cleaning mode!--I did find a way to get into the ""service menu"" and tell the stove it was running 35 degrees too cool, so my 550 oven compensation and becomes now a 585 oven.

@MapleAudio,"Hey Adam, I will post a video in a few days on my method. At the beginning I should tell you I do my dough quick. The rising time is like between 2 and 6 hours. Of course not in the fridge. I tried it in the fridge and honestly it was not better, for me at least. But anyway the trick is how i bake it.  1. You will need a crepe pan. Just buy the one with flatest to almost no edge  2. You'll need to turn on your oven on the highest settings. Indeed you only need the upper heating coils to be turned on. Let it preheat about 20 minutes and put in a rack as high as you can in the oven so the pizza you will put in later will be as close to the coils as ist can be  3. Now you make your crepe pan, as hot as you can.  4. You put the bare dough without sauce on the pan. You wait until the dough gets a little stiff and crispy between 10 and 20 seconds  5. Now you gotta be fast and put sauce and toppigs on it  6. Then you wait between 30 - 60 seconds. It depends on how quick you have put your toppings on the pizza.  7. You slide the pizza from your crepe pan directly on the rack in the oven which is very near to the red hot coils.  8. You gotta wait between 1 and 2 minutes and your pizza will be fluffy and ready.  Hope you find this technique helpful. I plan to make a video in the upcoming weeks about it.  Greetings from Germany  Dennis",6년 전(수정됨),1,

@ajtimmenbru7905,"never put oregano in the tomato sauce. always put oregano on top of the cheese, before putting pizza in the oven. also, put some garlic powder, black pepper and salt in the tomato sauce. dont put olive oil in the sauce. you can pour a little oil on top of the pizza before you put it in the oven (: also it's best to use the sharp flour for stretching the pizza cause it will slide more easily off. and don't put so much flour on the wooden racket. use minimum flouer. aaand sharp flour is better cause it will slide off of dough easily too and that way you won't bake as much flour in the oven. there are many many little tricks to pizza :) and throwing dough is the best way to do it not because it's the fastest too, but becase it will stretch evenly :)",6년 전,0,

@aragusea,"Some updates since I made this video: 1) I have been going with a wetter dough lately. Wet doughs, counterintuitively, seem to get crispier. I figure that's because they're more pliable, which allows more steam to escape during cooking. If you want a precise recipe with weights, look elsewhere. I don't like getting out my scale unless I have to. I can judge hydration pretty well by feel, and I reckon you can too with a little practice. I still think 2 and 1/4 cups water + 5 cups flour is a good starting place. Add more flour until it reaches a stickiness that you can handle. The only downside to extra hydration is that the dough becomes sticker and harder to work with. Part of the reason I went with a pretty dry dough when making this video is that I was worried about the pizza sticking to the peel while I got all the shots I needed. 2) I have started not only taking my tomatoes out of their packing liquid, but also washing them off under running water in a sieve. It's crazy, but that really makes a difference in a raw tomato sauce like this. The packing liquid is just so bitter. And I've been experimenting with different tomato brands. With really good tomatoes, I don't need the tomato paste. I would rather not use paste. 3) Many commenters have mentioned some affordable home pizza ovens that intrigue me. I think I'm going to give the Uuni a try and report back. Ultimately, my pizza still lacks the very distinctive flavor you get from baking at a thousand degrees. 4) If you have thoughtful, constructive, evidence-based advice for how I could improve my recipe, please give it to me. But if you're going to tell me I'm doing it wrong simply because you've always done it another way without interrogating why, please keep it to yourself.",6년 전,2.3만,

There is one after-market product for grilling pizza on a Weber that has a stainless steel plate suspended over the cooking surface, and that seems to get the top hot enough.",6년 전,360,
@wfqsfg, @aragusea  good to know. I'll probably skip it then but I'm glad I learned about whole milk string cheese!!,6년 전,111,
@sechay9328," @aragusea  As you know fermentation and hydration have a big impact on color and text, etc., so I won't get into any of that. Besides I use my sour dough rather than commercial yeast a lot. So just in terms of techniques and tricks I have found success with for browning in a home oven, here are two: 1) I always use a steel, but as you have likely observed, it frequently outpaces the oven's ambient temp. One trick is to put your steel close but not too close to your broiler (if you have a top broiler). Then you can start in convection and finish with the broiler, or if your oven is hot enough and your dough cooks evenly you can do the whole pizza under the broiler. That has worked well when I am working in a 48 hour, high hydration naturally leavened dough. 2) A much less fussy and way to do it and more reliable with my ny style dough that uses commercial yeast is to use both the steel and the stone at once. Put the steel on the bottom rack, and one rack higher put your stone. Start your pizza on the steel, and then around halfway check on its bottom crust. It'll probably be taking on good color and dark spots but not be done yet, but the top will need more time than needed to finish the bottom. Then pull the pizza and transfer to your stone on the top to finish up. Bottom will have that little extra from the steel but the top will manage to finish cooking. I find it pretty hard to burn the bottom of a pizza on a stone so this has yet to fail me. Feel free to reply if you want to keep talking pizza, I find that there as many great pizzas out there as there are ways to make them. I have never tried doing pizza in a weber with a steel though but I suspect that it will always conduct its heat far to quickly for the rest to cook. This is probably why hardcore pizza ovens stick with tiles and stone. There is these:  https://www.kettlepizza.com/kettle-ovens/charcoal-grill-inserts/ but I haven't heard much about them since they came out so I can't attest to the quality.",6년 전,54,

I've found a single proof often results in a dough that is less ""sturdy"" and ultimately one that deflates and can't hold the air bubbles as well so tastes more dense. I also keep my pizza stone on the bottom rack all the time as we have an electric oven and it helps to evenly disperse the temperature during our other baking and cooking.

@PaulTMaack0,"Good job. I worked pizza for 14 years, several of which were at the New York style places (which are from NY), and I gotta say... That's about it. Doesn't get much better than that.   The places I worked at had us age the dough for minimum of 16 hours, but 24 is a good sweet spot. I also found that the wetter the dough, the crispier the crust. I personally don't like having browned cheese, so I tend to use more moist cheese, or you can add a bit of olive oil on the top to prevent the browning.   Only thing I'll say is that you should probably work on getting the dough sealed up nicely on the bottom, otherwise that seam on the bottom can turn into quite the air pocket and cause some real uneven spots later on. If I had a camera, and some dough on me, I'd show you what I mean, but I'm sure you get it. It's just a little effort to save a big headache.  When we were training new guys, we'd show them how to stretch the dough over the edge of the table, and that's something people who aren't confident with holding it in their hands can do too. Basically you'd just lay it down on the edge of the table, and grab the top, with both hands and rotate it around so gravity does the work of stretching it over the edge. You can do that while pinching out the crust for efficiency if you like. Again... If I had a camera and some dough... :) Your pizza looks super tasty!",6년 전,41,
@TheLobstersoup,"Oil and salt are natural enemies to yeast, so it's good you add the salt later, but I would add it to the flour (not to the water). To leave the dough on top a base of oil and coated in it is also not helping the process. Ideally you'd let it rise in a warm place for the first hour and place a wet towel on top of it. Then you can knead it down once and let rise the same way again and then cover it and put it in the fridge. I also like to coat the dough (which I form like you do) with a coat of olive oil before putting the sauce on. It prevents the sauce from soaking into the dough; you do put a lot of olive oil into the sauce though so that might work similarly. As for oven - I think your steel is too hot. You want a hot air temperature and hot steel of course, but if it isn't a time-lapse your pizza gets very dark fast. You have to let the flavours develop, too. Some fresh chopped basil on top of it would be my choice to give it a finish. The three colors of the Italian flag translate to cooking: white, red, green - mozarella, tomato, basil ;)",6년 전,17,

I imagine that the oil coating the dough, only in the outside, may be positive because it prevents the contact of the dough with the air, allowing fermentation to happen.   About the metal, you cannot say that it is bad nor good for yeast growing. But remember that acids react with metals, and fermentation usually lowers the pH, making it acidic. Yeasts produce acids. Therefore, if you want to be sure, better not use metals.",6년 전,14,

For the home pizza (home ovens with stone) i tend to make a higher moisture ration my dough because it takes longer to bake from a wooden or professional oven ( home oven 6-9 minutes / professional 2-3)  so you need more moisture so it will not be completely dry. As for handling the dough with higher moisture, just be quick with putting the ingredients (from the moment it touches the wood it takes like 10 to 15 seconds until it will stick on the wood )   As for the things you can try are:  1) in older times for the classical american  dough they were using sesame oil (it was removing some taste of the flower) you can give it a try and see. 2) for the tomato sauce, from the moment you wash the tomatoes try to avoid using sugar and add 1 tea spoon of white vinegar ( it reacts with tomato sauce and makes it  sweeter )  i personal put a clove of garlic , thyme and red cracked pepper . 3)For the cheese ( i live right now in slovakia so  it is very difficult to find mozzarella cheese with less moisture if you are not in the industry of restaurants)  for home i buy some normal mozzarella and i am cutting it and leave it to dry in the fridge for at least 24 hours, i make it for 2 days, ( i put in a plastic open container  with some grills on the bottom so the water will not touch the mozzarella and add some fat sea salt ) take care only not to have in the fridge anything with strong smell.

@Dannemon,"This is a great video and I agree with using wetter dough. I've tried many different methods of making pizza over the years, including refrigerating the dough over 5 days,  and finally settled on No Knead Pizza. More like neapolitan style pizza as well wich is amazingly chewy and flavourful. Skip the olive oil, I find it only greases the gluten I think to not be as chewy. I use the ratio 2 parts water against 3 parts breadflour. I think thats how you say that. So throw dried yeast, sugar and salt in the water and add the flour. It will be really sticky so add some more flour so its easier to handle but should still be really sticky. Don't need to knead much at all, just tumble it a bit and let it rest in a plastic covered bowl in room temp for at least 12 hours. I usually do this the day before. Letting it rise in room temp like this without olive oil creates great flavour and chewiness and the smell is intense when you take it out. It will be sticky as all hell, so when you remove it you'll need alot of flour on the table. Tumble it abit in the flour so the sticky surface goes away and let it rest an hour. Then do the usual with the pizza peel and pizza stone, but add alot more flour on the peel because it will stick easily,. I even bought pizza steel wich is way better at transfering heat to the pizza so it gets crispier underneath and you don't need to heat it as long or have the dough in the oven as long.

In an acidic environment your stainless steel becomes stainless ions, if you know what I mean.   It does not require much knowledge to know that. If you let water for some hours in a stainless steel bottle, eventually it will alter its taste. But if you do a quick research you will know that, even though stainless steel does not ""stain"", it still oxidizes. And this makes sense because it is an alloy made mostly of iron.

@oukid2633," @aragusea  Baking  at 1000 degrees does not give you any distinct flavor. It makes the dough chewier and softer because you are cooking it much faster, allowing the dough to retain much more moisture.    Also get a scale, no baker uses cups! You have to start using bakers percentages, it will save you time and it be much easier to record results.    Also most of the distinct flavor comes from the cheese after lots of experimenting I've found some whole milk to cheeses to taste better than others. And letting the cheese age in your fridge for a week or two gives it a distinct flavor thats slightly acidic, that distinct flavor tastes just like the pizzas from my local pizza shops so I assume that they also age their cheese too.   You mentioned to not use moist mozzarella, you're missing out dude. You have to use the broiler, so that the pizza is able to cook faster on the top. It's like simulating a real oven where they cook from the top and the bottom.   Also one last thing, like what the other guy said the longer you have your dough sitting the more flavors it developes. But you have to make sure that you use very little yeast and less 2% salt, flavors in the dough are the result of flour enzymes which are impeded when you have too much salt.   here's a pizza i made it's a been a bit over proofed https://imgur.com/UPosjSh  and another one https://imgur.com/oMnqPsg",6년 전(수정됨),8,

You can consult many authoritative scientific sources on the matter, or you can just use your mouth. A pizza baked at 400 does not merely have a textural difference from pizza baked at 800. There is a significant flavor difference. And I have a scale. I use it when I have to. I don't have to use it to make pizza. As I said, I use volume measures as a starting point, and then I add flour until I get the hydration I want, which is easily judged by feel. I am not ""missing out"" by not using my broiler. I have used my broiler before, many times. With this particular oven, I have found that the convection roast setting directs more heat to the top of the pizza. It's nice if you like fresh mozzarella, but even if you can evaporate the excess whey during cooking, I still prefer low-moisture mozz for pizza. It is dried using a high-heat process that causes additional fermentation, giving it a stronger flavor. Why can't you just tell me what you do instead of telling me what you think I'm doing wrong?

@frankw3217, @sth9669  I think the may be losing too much heat on the top. I posted earlier for using a oven on the rack above the pizza stone place fire brick and heat up the pizza stone and bricks. Thoughts are to retain heat above the pizza as like a pizza oven does. Not sure how that can be accomplished on a gas grill. I did something like this year's ago on a pool heater (gas) the the insulation got wet and I had to service the leak. Looking at it I saw I could got fire brick in instead of the insulation.  The water heated very well and saved on gas. This is just a thought I am posting here.,6년 전,1,
@neilmcginn,I saw a video a while back of a guy cutting the cleaning lock on his oven. When an oven is in clean mode the door locks. This is because it runs at a very high heat (800 degrees ?) during clean mode. Sounds a bit extreme but you might want to check it out.,6년 전,1,

@oukid2633,MGS V bread flour is high protein flour same as the ones the pros use. The only difference is that they mill it much finer so that results in worse water asorbtion. Which means crisper crust. Ive used both and the normal bread flour is much chewier,6년 전,4,
@oukid2633,"Adam Ragusea   I have read no evidence on cheese that states high heat resulting in flavor, the flavor is produced by the microbes. The more you wait the more flavor is developed by the microbes.   Also the only flavor that is developed in the oven is through browning aka maillard reaction. Its actually a contradiction assuming that you get more flavor in a higher temp oven, when in reality you get more flavor in the lower temp oven because you get more browning.  Using a scale is vital when it comes to fermentation the difference between 4% and 1.5% will result in an extra day of fermenting and overly salty pizza crust. It will also result in lower water content in your dough because of the likely hood of mis measuring flour.   You asked for a better way in the video, you seemed to be asking for critiques yet your too stuck up and arrogent to listen.  Heres my criqitue of your video: *Too much olive oil. *You should never ferment dough that long, if it tastes like sour dough that means the bacteria have started to grow and eat the alcohol from the yeast. *Your dough is too stiff and it needs to relax more so it can be easily stretched. *You over cooked the pizza.  *Its way too thick, its got the thickness of dominoes. No pizzeria makes pizza that thick, unless if cheap takeout.  *And no one spins pizza in the air, thats just for show. You slap the dough and stretch it with your knuckles(look at pizzerias and naan makers).  I congrat you on making a decent pizza most people fail because they dont have a kneading machine.

@randomuser2461,moister dough should let it rise more because it has more time being soft. Not sure why water makes it crispier. I've noticed that. Maybe the lack of fats relatively. I know fats make it crumbly and seperate. maybe water thins this out and makes the opposite. Water normally makes something get crispier as a coating on normal breads while milk fats make it softer and oils make it much crisper but not in the same way. But moister bread makes it stay soft longer for greater rising. I have no idea what is going on with that as logically it seems like it must be something more complicated.,6년 전,2,

@iroveashe,"Have you looked into diastatic malt powder in place of sugar?  And since you asked for feedback, I want to encourage you to use a scale. For one, you clearly care about pizza, so I don't think laziness can be excused. The pros maybe don't need a scale but they make hundreds of pizzas everyday, that's experience that can't be achieved at home even if you bake several times a week.  But if you want to improve, then consistency is key. How can you improve on the dough if you don't really know what you're modifying, and by what amount?  I bought a jewelers scale just to measure yeast and DMP, and I use it for the salt, oil, etc, anything under 100g. A cheap one is good enough  Furthermore, baker's percentages are essential for scaling up or down the recipe and for sharing with other people. If you've looked into baking at all you probably know that cups are a really bad way to measure flour. It's okay although uncomfortable for water, but for flour it's a horrible idea in baking (again, if the focus is learning). You say that you're good at judging hydration by feel, but you're probably used to your flour's absorption. Someone with different flours will have a different experience, and if they're meant to go by feel (a feel which they might not even have in the first place) that might fuck up the whole recipe.  ""The only downside to extra hydration is that the dough becomes sticker and harder to work with.""  Lastly I don't think this is accurate. More hydration means longer cooking time. Ideally with the highest heat you can get, and with the browning agents in the dough (sugar/malt) the goal is to cook the pizza as fast as possible in your home oven. This means the extra hydration will be working against you. Higher hydration works well for sicilian.",6년 전(수정됨),2,
@aragusea,"@iroveashe You're entitled to your own cooking philosophy, but this is mine. I don't like measuring, and I don't like having my head in a recipe. I like getting a sense of generally what the food should look, smell and feel like, and then using my senses. It takes fewer dishes, it's more pleasurable, it's more resistant to interruption (i.e. kids), and more conducive to creativity. Part of the reason I don't bother with scientific precision is that I think, within a certain threshold, all of the possible outcomes are good. I like this dough when it's a day old, I like it when it's 9 days old. It's different every step of the way, but always good. And no, I haven't thought about diastatic malt powder in place of sugar. I'm not interested in filling my kitchen with speciality ingredients unless they're going to make a big, big difference. In case of this style pizza, having low-moisture full-fat mozz makes a big difference. Regarding hydration, in my experience, the wetter the dough, the more water escapes during cooking. Yes, obviously, there will come a point where the dough is so wet that it won't crisp up in time, but I think such a dough would be so sticky and loose that you wouldn't be able to stretch it in the first place. If people want baker's percentages and such, they have J Kenji Lopez and a hundred other people. This is how I do things, and if people like it, great. When I asked for advice, I was asking to hear about what YOU do, not what you think I'm doing wrong. The former is friendly and helpful, the latter is pedantic and rude.",6년 전,13,

I absolutely did show the kneading process, and if you wan to make a video about a no-knead process, then go ahead. That's not what this was. I made a stiff dough because I knew I was going to be filming a video while making this pizza, and I didn't want the dough to stick to the peel while I futzed with my camera. I don't care about creases. If I wanted an industrially standardized product, I wouldn't make it myself.The reason I put a small amount of sugar in my dough is that I have found, through much experimentation, that it helps the crust get more brown that the relatively low temperatures possible in domestic ovens. The goal is not to do what the pros do — it's to roughly reproduce the same result using grocery-store ingredients and home equipment.

The achieved char and flavor of the crust is something that definitely brought a smile to my face after years of baking in my home oven (like you). However, if a NY style pizza is what youre looking for, with a slightly floppy yet stable crust, then wood fired ovens at 800+ degrees isnt for you.  I think the real trick with the flavor at those staple NY style pizza joints is that their stones and deck ovens have usually been seasoned for decades.  It is possible, however to regulate the temp of the uuni more precisely with the new gas attachment, that way you can keep temps in the 550-750 range, and avoid the ""smokey"" flavor that is meant for neapolitan, as well as cook the pies thoughoroully to get a crisp, yet soft crust.

Second, consider a steel plate instead of a stone. I broke my stone and started looking for more durable stones, and then found this to me holy grail of baking steel plates. I forget the numbers, but they retain massively more heat than stone and they never ever break. I've tried making pizzas in less than two minutes with oven grill on and thin Margheritas, Heston style. It's fun, but insanely wasteful in terms of energy. Anyway, steel beats stone, try it.

I must say I’m impressed with the fact that you mentioned fermenting/aging the dough for a week. I found 9 days to be similar to Pizzeria Regina. I mainly make a Boston style which is very similar to NY.  Couple of things I’ve found:   1.  I use less cheese for a more NY blending of cheese and sauce and like to cook for a while to get that perfect orange color.  This is tougher at higher temps so 500-600ish°F works best for this.   2.  I found an effective hydration (total hydration of water and oil/other wet ingredients) of 70% to be really good but NY is usually 50-55% hydration, I believe.   3.  Your cornicone and bottom crust looks awesome. I use the Ooni/Uuni Pro and it will give similar results, but more in line with 700-900°F which is closer to Neapolitan or Lucali in Brooklyn. You can mod the Ooni Pro with a flame guard to prevent flames from touching the side of the pizza, with temps sitting around 640°F from slump charcoal. But what you made now is pretty typical NY around 500-550°F and probably the nicest crust I’ve seen from a home oven.   3.  I’ll have to try your sauce. Here in Boston we have Greek style with Greek oregano, and Italian with basically Italian oregano and a thin watered down sauce of only ground tomatoes and sometimes basil/Romano cheese.  4.  I love that fact that you mentioned cutting it bigger. I found cutting two giant slices is also fun. You can make 18” equivalent slices from a 16” pizza.

@pmberkeley,"While I appreciate there is a lot of superstition in the culinary world and push back against it myself, as a scientist, a lot of your attitudes and beliefs make my head hurt. I won't go over them all, just the two or three remaining disputes in the comments.   1. It matters what order salt is added in. Mixing and chemical reactions, and availability (or requisite scarcity) of a chemical to an organism depends on the order of the process/reaction. This is like high school chemistry and cooking 101. Like, it matters whether you add water to chocolate or chocolate to water, and in what ratios, because the behavior of the chocolate molecules in relation to the water molecules is different depending on local availability of the molecules. When you add the salt to the water, you make ALL the water in your dough a saline solution. If you let the water molecules mingle with the flour and yeast first, the water is not all attached to NaCl. It's scientifically a different process, dude. You may not mind the difference in results, but you can't argue that it's chemically the same process, or that it ""doesn't matter"", because it's not and it does.  2. Same goes for stainless steel. You may not mind the difference, but it doesn't mean the difference isn't there. Glass is the easiest way to avoid the question.  3. Density has nothing (directly) to do with the heating of the stone, and it will NOT take an hour to heat it thoroughly, give me a break. Specific heat capacity is what matters to how long something takes to heat and how much heat it has available to conduct to the food. The thermal mass of the material you cook on (which depends both on the mass/density and the heat capacity of the material) affects the rate of heating and the stability of the temperature, but not much else. It doesn't make it hotter.  4. I'm not too sure about this (these reactions are not my specialty) but the hotter temperature reactions you seek may not actually exist or affect much of the flavor. The main one humans care about/notice is the Maillard reaction, which occurs at 330 F. So it all comes down to the rate at which you achieve this reaction relative to the rate of heat transfer to the other parts of the food. E.g. a scorchingly high temp oven will create surface Maillard reactions while leaving the inside of a thin pizza relatively unaffected. This is the more likely source of flavor complexity than additional reactions at higher temperatures.  5. Use a scale, if you want people to take your pleas for ""scientific evidence"" seriously. The inconsistency and fuzziness of your measurements IS totally acceptable in the kitchen, but this is the same ""space"" kitchen myths live in, which you hate so much. You have to pick one. Either accept people saying salt and stainless steel affect the dough within the uncertainty bounds of your fuzzy measurements, or use precise measurements.",6년 전,16,

For example, you can stick your hand in a 212* oven and it'll feel warm, but if you put your hand in 212* boiling water, you'll immediately burn your hand. This is because the water in a pot is much more dense than air in an oven, so despite being the same temperature, one cooks much faster than the other.

@aragusea," @pistolpete8231  Of course you can make it in two hours. But my way has two advantages. 1) I make the dough at night after my kids have gone to bed (and they're not in my hair), and then I just throw it in the fridge and forget about it. I don't have to wait around for it to rise at room temperature, and I don't have to time it for two hours before I want to have dinner. I just make it, toss it in, and forget about it. Then any day over the next week, I can come home straight form work, turn on the oven and make dinner, really quick. For my lifestyle, this is far more convenient, and I doubt I'm alone. 2) I really do think the dough tastes better after a long slow rise instead of a quick rise. Also, you complained about my checking the dough to see if it had reached the windowpane stage. Of course you don't need to do that.

@pmberkeley," @TheRety20   I have my PhD in this and I'm currently teaching this subject. You sound like an idiot.   You're talking about several different things here. The 212 F oven air verses water temperature not only is different because air and water have drastically different SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITIES (per/mass absorptivity and emissivity of heat, to attempt to put this into lay terms), but water at 212 is ALSO undergoing phase change, so if it's close to the steam side of things, it has all the energy associated with the phase change included in it at the same temperature. Air does indeed have a lower density than water, but it ALSO has a much lower heat capacity. (Water has a heat capacity of 4.18 kJ/kg K, while air's is less than 1, so even if air were as dense as water, it still wouldn't absorb or give off as much heat).   Volume for volume, steel's heat capacity is only double that of clay, so twice as much clay would put steel and clay on the same heat capacity footing. It's completely unlikely the reason steel is better for the job is because of heat capacity alone ,though - steel has a much higher thermal conductivity than clay/baking stones, which means that all the heat contained therein is much more accessible to the food.

I can totally see why you wouldn't want to do this, and there really is no wrong way to stretch if it gets the job done (for the most part). There's a million different ways and some work better than others at certain stages of the stretching. Except tossing it in the air of course, like you already mentioned!     If you don't mind making a bit more of a mess - before you start forming the cornice, place the dough on whatever surface you are working on and start flattening the dough in the very center and work outwards using the tips of your fingers up to the first knuckle. The theory is that you are pushing the air bubbles out towards the crust. How much impact this actually has on the outcome probably isn't very significant, but depending on how delicate and how much you are able to stretch the dough before forming the cornice, gravity can also help do some stretching. It can also give you a bit more control over how big/small you want the crust to be. I know this is a very insignificant detail but just thought you might be interested.     I hope you keep finding success on youtube! I'm sure you will. I absolutely love your videos!   tl;dr:  Start from the center and work out when you stretch. Air bubbles and shit.",6년 전,0,

As far as voiding your homeowners insurance, I can only think of one solution. Buy a second hand oven off craigslist or what have you, cut the lock and set it up outside. you can then modify it for pizza only. The only catch with that is that you'll need a free 30 amp breaker(or install one) and you'll need to run a 220 line out to where your pizza oven will be. It wont be free, but even if you build your own brick oven, it will still be similar if not cheaper in price. Definitely cheaper than buying one, or having one built. Oh, one last thing.

@xDubstepify,"just a tip! i work at a pizza shop and have been making pizzas for almost 2 years.  I would say to chop the cheese as finely as possible as it gets everything cooked evenly as opposed to the inside of the small blocks you were using being less cooked. also your cheese doesn't reach the crust on your pizza, this will make the cheese way more likely to fall off when you are trying to enjoy it.  what I do is sprinkle cheese all over the sauce to the best of my ability, being able to see the sauce in between little holes.  if you cant see the sauce it is too much cheese. inevitably you will get a decent amount of cheese on the crust and that is ok.  Next you are going to ""fluff"" the crust.  go around the edge from underneath the dough before it is cooked, and flick the cheese back onto the sauce so that no cheese is on top of the crust, but rather next to it.  This will make the cheese stick to the inner layer of crust, and not fall off when you enjoy it.",6년 전,2,

@oxbowmonster8614,Ok so i finally tried making pizza at home and these are my conclusions: 1. Needing the dough by hand is a nightmare. It's stressful and it take a shit ton of time. I really need to buy one of those mixers 2. You don't really need a pizza peel. I really didn't want to buy one so i used a wooden cutting board and it works just fine 3. I didn't have a pizza stone and if you don't want to buy one i just took a pan and flipped it upside down. No you don't get tge same browning but its still better than nothing. 4. One big mistake i make was putting too much flour on the pan. You really don't need to much and is going ti taste horrible if u add to much. 5. The pizza came out pretty good but i definitely need to work a bit more on my methods. I'm going to update this comm as time goes and i learn new tricks.,6년 전,0,

@louism.4495,"Hi Adam , good video. My own recipe is alot wetter but I use living yeast adapted from my mums recipe from matese region. Buy 100g FRESH yeast , put in the freezer. then get a jar 500g jar with lid, fill 1/4 with filtered water , 1/4 with ap flour (cheap one) and about 1tsp of the yeast . Leave for 12 hours on table top (might overflow). When you make your dough take 1 big rounded tablespoon and mix into the water or milk a little bit. Now put a little more water and flour into the jar and put in refidgerator. Every 3 or 4 days remove 1 tbs and replace replenish with water and flour, this keeps a living proper yeast mix for about 3 months, although even when it looked dead I found it it still worked as well!

@PizzaSteveNY," @JohannesWiberg  For NY pizza yes it is! You don't even live here and are trying to tell me who owns a pizzeria in NY and has worked atleast a dozen NY pizzeria's since I was 16. You are arguing when you don't even live here. I can tell you all the sauces that are used. Normally most pizzerias use Stanislaus 7/11 (ground tomatoes) or Alta Cucina which is a plum tomato and you have to grind them down, mixed with either Saporito, Full Red or Super Dolce (tomato paste) or the other big company is Escalon which the is normally used 6 in 1 ( ground tomatoes) mixed with Bonta ( tomato paste) they also make fully prepared pizza sauce which is Bella Rosa. Stanislaus and Escalon are both from California and are literally across the street from each other. You normally do not want to cook pizza sauce twice. It gets cooked on the pizza. Also we make 40 gallons of pizza sauce every other day so imagine places that do even more volume trying to cook 40 to 50 gallons of sauce a day. It becomes less efficient and less profitable.

@PizzaSteveNY,I'm not saying it's a fact but most pizza places don't cook their pizza sauce. Your listening to articles written by people why not ask people that are in the industry. How about this I am very good friends with a few of biggest distributors in NY. Ferraro Foods and GDS. I can ask them what majority of their pizzeria are using. I would say almost 80 to 90 percent use Stanislaus. The rest are either Escalon Sam Marzano or Don Pepinos. Their are a couple smaller companies out their but most are using the canned tomatoes. NOW if you are talking about fresh tomatoes where you are peeling them yes you have to cook them but most places need to be efficient to keep up and that is just not. The famous NY pizza recipe has always been 7/11 and Saporito. Now Margherita pizzas that is different alot use crushed tomatoes and San Marzano sauce. Go on PMQ forum where other owners actually talk about this and you will ae most don't because it's not necessary NOT SAYING ALL DON'T but majority will say they don't. Just like putting eggs in the dough has become a thing of the past. I get upset because you say you read some books and that makes you know everything about NY pizza. Yes I only worked at a dozen but I am friends with alot of pizzeria owners. You asked a question NY pizzerias don't cook their sauce and all I was answered as a owner of a NY pizzeria. My Pizza guy worked at Ray's Pizza one of the most famous Pizzerias in the City and they did not cook their sauce either. The volume at that place is insane. There are certain coal fire wood fire places and they probably should cook their sauce because they cook a pizza in under 2 minutes. Most of those places do not sell slices and do not delivery it's eat in only. Of course I get upset when you brush of my experience and knowledge because you read some stuff.,6년 전,0,

@WITANStudios123,"​ @oukid2633  I've been reading this thread for half an hour or so and I don't really have much experience in cooking but I tend to watch a lot of videos. I'm certain that Adam's recipe for pizza isn't stolen, he has made many points throughout the recipe that tend to be thought through personal experimentation (for example: the packing liquid in the tomatoes). While his recipe may be similar to Kenji's, it doesn't necessarily mean that he stole it. Recipes are formed through shared knowledge, it wouldn't be surprising that there would similarities. Making baseless accusations just because it is similar is a little stupid.   Your earliest comment about the effects of different temperatures on pizza was really well thought out, so I'm not going to argue anything about it because I don't have any knowledge behind that.   I believe that the browning depends on environmental factors (what appliances are used, how well circulated the heat travels in the oven, stone/steel, whether the oven has a convection setting). From your comment, you state that the dough browns well enough without it, this means that sugar DOES help it to brown. If the person following this recipe doesn't have the same conditions in your cooking environment, they might need that sugar to help with browning. I don't see any harm in putting sugar if that is the case.   Referring to the other comments you have made, you seem to complain about him using a 'dough machine'. That's a stand mixer, it's a very common tool used in an everyday home kitchen so there really isn't anything to complain about him using it in this recipe. Adam mentioned this in one of his responses to your comments. A stand mixer is not just for bread, it's for many other things as well. We appreciate your thoughtfulness for caring about the people who don't have stand mixers but there is no need for you to bash Adam about it. If the person doesn't have a stand mixer, that doesn't stop them from using this recipe. Don't underestimate people who don't have stand mixers, I'm certain there are a couple of people that are capable of adapting the recipe to their own conditions. You complained about how having a stand mixer gets rid of all the hard work. Is that a bad thing? I certainly don't think so. That's all up to the person and their values. Don't lump your values with other people.   You're saying that Adam thinks he's 'too good' to use a scale. He's not saying that you shouldn't, he just doesn't use it because he believes in his own skills and that it is also a hassle. You see, he's not pushing his values and opinions onto other people like a selfish person cough *cough*.    ""No right minded cook actually uses cups for flour"", what do you hope in achieving by saying something so ridiculous? Using cups as a measurement is a standardized method for making bread and pizza dough. What's the difference in using grams and cups? They're both forms of measurements of WEIGHT, this means that they can be converted. Sure it's a hassle, but it's not the end of the world (especially with Google, everything can be done so easily).    I like how you advise people to use the no-knead method while showing pictures of the results but there is something wrong about it. The pictures that you show aren't New York style pizzas. They look more like a Neopolitan pizza, that's not what people came to this video for. Give the people what they want. I'm not dissing you about your pizza, it looks great! I would eat that in a heartbeat.   I'm not experienced with cooking so I can't compete against you in terms of cooking knowledge. However, from a general point of view, your comments haven't really been following through the rules of this thread. You have been saying what he does is wrong without any explanation. To justify your point, you need HARD facts. Facts with scientific proof. That's the only way to convince Adam, a perfectly logical person. He's not being a bastard, you're just being ignorant.    Feel free to reply to me with more hate but if you don't address any of the points that I have mentioned, that just shows that you don't receive feedback and criticism well.",6년 전,1,

@oukid2633," @WITANStudios123  The measurements of his and kenjis are exactly the same. It's not a coincidence, also it can be considered neopiltan if its cooked at a tempreature above 900F otherwise the texture won't be soft and chewy enough to be considered Neapolitan.",6년 전,0,
@WITANStudios123,"​ @oukid2633  That is inherently false. According to Kenji's recipe (https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/10/new-york-style-pizza.html) the measurements are not the same as what Adam has suggested.    Adam's Measurements for Dough: 1 teaspoon of yeast 1 1/4 tablespoon of sugar 2 1/4 cup of warm water 1/4 olive oil (AT MOST) 5 cups bread flour   Kenji's Measurements for Dough:  22 1/2 ounces (about 4 1/2 cups) bread flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar .35 ounces kosher salt (about 3 teaspoons) 2 teaspoons instant yeast 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (0.187 cups) 15 ounces lukewarm water (1.875 cups)   This information is directly extracted from Adam's video and Kenji's recipe with the same link that you have used to attempt to falsify Adam's originality, thus you can't argue that I faked this information. You can obviously tell that the measurements are similar, but not exactly the same. Try to check your evidence before you give out bold statements.   New York pizza can't be considered Neopolitan pizza because they're not the same thing, that's why they have different names. I don't care if New York pizza turns into Neopolitan at 900F. You can tell from Adam's video that his oven doesn't go anywhere near as close to 900F. Your point is irrelevant because it is about Neopolitan pizza. Also to add the fact that New York pizza is WAY thinner than Neopolitan pizza. New York pizza crust is iconic for it's crispy, thin and not chewy texture.   It's not just the dough stretching that is different, the cheese placements are different as well. Neopolitan pizza tends to come with globs of mozzarella however New York pizza has cheese that covers the whole slice except for the edges.   I didn't even need to address your point about how New York pizza can be considered as Neopolitan pizza but I still schooled you. That's like saying Cacio e Pepe is the same as Carbonara. They're pastas and they're similar in some aspects but the execution is different. You could seriously offend pasta-purists by saying something like what I just used as an example.   You still haven't given me any proof on why using cups as a measurement is bad. This just shows that you are stating claims that you can't justify yourself because you don't have any articles, quotes or any other form of evidence in which can help to support your opinion. Just from the fact that you didn't address that point, it shows that you are ignorant and are simple-minded.

Not sure if you have Aldi's down there, but I buy block whole milk low moisture mozz there...My step Dad owned an excellent pizza joint in NY for decades.  He retired to FL and opened a shop there.  He said he could never make decent pizza there because the water is different.  You might wanna try using distilled or bottled water in the dough if you're using tap.  I always heard the reason the south does not have good pizza is because of the water.  Even Pizza Hut sucks compared to their northern pizza huts. It may be a myth.

@robshell5367,"Great looking pizza. The seeds from your tomatoes should be removed also, they can cause bitterness also. Too many people think you make pizza in a day. They don't let the yeast do what it is supposed to do, create flavor. I bought American Pie by Peter Reinhart about 15 years ago and never looked back. I have other great books too, but that was my first go to book. It is a lot more than recipes. It is a great pizza book. If you don't have it I highly recommend it. I like to use 2 stones, one near the bottom element, and one closer to the top. I start the pizza on the bottom stone, it tends to be hotter. Then I finish it on the top stone with the broil set to high, to duplicate the dome effect they do in a real pizza oven. I have accomplished pizza that looks like it came out of a professional pizza oven in around 3 minutes. My oven goes to 550. Like you said in the video, you really have to get to know your oven, that is where most people fail. They think you just have to get it to temp for a while and bake it like a casserole. The longer it takes to bake, the more flavor the crust loses. I finally broke down and bought a 1/2 steel slab, I think I can get to 2 1/2 minutes with the correct set up.

Your pizza sauce is what you like OK I don't put that much sugar in mine. Do it to your taste. Spread the flower out with your hand once or twice around. That's enough. Use about what you did it should be enough. Don't be afraid to blow a little air under your pizza if you need help to get it off the peal. You can use flower on your peal. Its what we use in NY. When baking your pie half way through give it a half turn you will get better browning on the bottom. Invest in an aluminum pie pan. It's great to cut your pie on and it shouldn't get soggy. I have never seen anyone take a pizza out the way you do. I use a metal peal to get mine out.

@Thommadura,1: Do not use Already Shredded Mozzarella - it is dusted with Cellulose to keep the pieces apart - and does not melt the same way 2 - The VERY best tomatoes come from New Jersey - however you can only get them fresh - they even FLY them to Paris in the season for the top chefs. 3 - Oregano is a spice that is soluble in oil - so I mix it into the Oil I put into the Sauce - and then mix that in - give more uniform flavor.,6년 전,37,
@tonkaGuy888,"Looks great. I've also been on this quest. I finally settled on a similar no-knead recipe - hand mix, rest, stretch/fold a few times and overnight rise. One pizza, one bowl, so saves a little cleanup. You're right about the stone: preheating is the key to a browned crust. I turn on the broiler for 10 minutes before I dress the pizza to give an extra blast of heat. IMO, hand tossing helps get a uniformly thin and flat crust. One good toss usually does it. I practice with a damp washcloth. Cheers.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

But because I was shooting the video myself and that was adding a lot of time to the process, I stretched cold to help it keep from sticking while I dressed it and got all the shots i needed. I have lately been going with a much wetter dough, and letting it ferment in the fridge for a week or longer. When I do that, it comes out very soft, and I have to stretch it cold, otherwise it simply wouldn't hold together or slide off the peel. tastes damn good, though.",6년 전,0,

@aragusea,"When someone who clearly doesn't know they're talking about accuses me of not knowing what I'm talking about, my feelings are generally unhurt. I will not use less oil in my containers. If you want me to stop doing something, you at least have to tell me why. I, in contrast, will tell you why I use lots of oil. I like to age my dough a very long time, and it gets very soft after 5 or 6 days, and lots of oil helps me get it out without deflating it. Also, the thick coating of oil I get on the outside helps the crust brown at domestic oven temperatures. That's also why I don't flour the ball before shaping; I don't want the flour to absorb the oil. Doing an initial rise before portioning is a totally unnecessary, messy step to add to the process. Unless you've tried it this way and have documented actual differences in the results, hush your mouth. I did not let the dough ball come to room temperature because I was shooting a video by myself, which added lots of time to my process, and keeping the dough cold helped keep it from sticking to the peel. Blow air under the pizza? That's absolutely absurd. The dressed pizza is far too heavy for that to have any affect. No, I do not need to rotate it halfway through cooking. This is a convection oven with a preheated stone. It's not a wood oven with a fire at one end. It is evenly hot all over. Opening the oven to turn it would let heat escape and interfere with the browning of the cheese. I don't care if you've never seen anyone take a pizza out the way I do. I have rested it on aluminum before, and that results in a soggier product, because there is no way for steam to escape out of the bottom. I live in Macon, Georgia, and no, there is no full-fat low-moisture mozz available here except for the Galbani sticks, which taste great, they're just a pain to unwrap. It IS absolutely essential for the cheese to be low moisture if the goal is to reproduce NYC street pizza. The texture and flavor are radically different, due to the extra fermentation that occurs during the drying process.

@oweneastwood3445,Nah San Marzano tomatoes are the best for pizza. It's why they're the only tomato you can use for the neapolitan pizza,6년 전,1,
@Thommadura," @oweneastwood3445  Nonsense - Thankfully - Actually - San Marzano Tomatoes failed to live up to their hype in recent tests done by AMerica's Test Kitchen/Cooks Illustrated - who ranked several American Canned Tomatoes above them.  San Marzano Tomatoes are actually a form of ""plum"" Tomatoes - which are higher in pulp than other varieties - lower in juice and thereby sweetness. Plum tomatoes never come out ahead in Taste Tests. ANd in fact - WHen I was a kid (I'm 78) - Pizza was called Tomato Pie - and they actually used Sliced Tomatoes on the pies instead of sauce. THe problem with all Plum style Tomatoes is that the increased Pulp makes them more bitter - less sweet. THink of an orange section - squeeze out the juice - eat just the pulp  - it is bitter -muchmore like the pith below the skin. The advantage is that they produce MORE sauce per Pound of Fruit. However - it is of poorer quality. Thankfully - YOu can make especially tasty Neapolitan Pizza with American tomatoes - and especially New Jersey Tomatoes - that is if YOU want your Neapolitan Pizza to actually taste like Tomatoes too! They are why Neapolitan Pizza tastes so good in the NJ/NY area - and cannot be duplicated elsewhere.",6년 전,0,

@Thommadura, @towellstowel7182  And if YOU actually thought that one out - THEN you would know that the climate in New Jersey and the Soil  in New Jersey ARE not the same as those in the Largely Volcanic Soil of San Marzanno.  New Jersey also has higher precipitation rates than that area of Italy. Which is why our Tomatoes still win as the best in the world consistently over the years.  - THe International Contest that New Jersey Tomatoes WON was in Europe too - Maybe YOU should do some Homework before you post. I spoke the truth - they are the best in the world - and I am not wrong. However - indeed - the best tomato in the world is indeed one I grew Myself on MY Tomato Farm in New Jersey - as YOU pointed out.,6년 전,3,
@Thommadura,@terrance martins Again - Wrong - child - I can name Twenty farms in MY are that still send vine ripened NJ tomatoes to European Restaurants BY AIR.   And our Tomatoes still win International Contests - and the San Marzanno Plum Tomatoes - those bitter and relatively Dry tomatoes - in fact ALL Plum Tomatoes - rarely crack the top 25.,6년 전(수정됨),2,
@Thommadura,"@terrance martins THat is because Tomatoes are a perishable crop that does not survive normal sea transportation -  And of course - real Tomatoes are VINE ripened with a short shelf life.- those ""things"" that pass for tomatoes in most markets are actually picked when green - and they use gases to ripen them - ie - no flavor. As far as the San Marzano being the official tomato of the Neapotlitan Pizza - you have NO evidence of that. (Total San Marzano production could not possibly supply all the Pizza Makers in New York and Italy - much less the rest of the world) THe fact is - most ""Italian"" brand tomatoes sold in the USA use US tomatoes and are canned here - with few of then actually using Italian tomatoes - which as I said are bitter. That is why - many cooks add sugar or something with sugar (Like carrots) in their sauces to canned foreign Tomatoes. It is not only to cut the higher acidity - but also because the tomatoes themselves (Plum tomatoes) - are grown not for flavor - but for canning ability.    Yes - with the BIG commercial Farms - they look to tomatoes that can be mechanically grown - and the NY Rutgers Hybrid is less desirable - but most farms in New Jersey are not huge operations - often 40 - 50 ares - and the fruit is picked ripe from the vine the old fashioned way, by hand.  This is not unusual by the way - with most vegetables - the prize winners are rarely the ones grown for commercial production. The evolved hybrids have a tougher skin (Which you remove when you cook them) - but they still do not have the same flavor of the tomatoes that are grown locally here for quick Local consumption - that is why they have to be flown to europe - their shelf life is in days. Since we still grow the real thing - the Rutgers Hybrid all over New Jersey - at least here you can still get a good tomato.    In England - THe big National Vegetable contest is actually run with the Flower SHow In North Yorkshire. THere are literally dozens of Vegetable contests in the USA - often run along with State Fairs. Sometimes they include those grotesque HUGE varieties grown pretty much only for competitions. The reason why - again - shelf life - competition winning varieties are generally not the ones grown for commercial consumption - and simply do not last long enough. Apparently though - interest in Vegetable competitions  - even on the internet - is limited - compared to things like Murders and wars - who would have thought that!   In the last major Competition I attended in France(Which I admit was about 15 years ago - now my grandkids go)  - the Rutgers Hybrid took all of the top ten spots - although ONE was won by a French Farmer who grew the Rutgers Hybrid over there.   BUT that remains the problem - the ""Plum"" Tomato - the one variety that includes the San Marzanos - is one of those varieties that was grown specifically for commercial production - having more pulp (sometimes they call it meat) - less juice - less sugar - and as a result are more bitter. But they DO can very well. Recent contests in the USA found that Plum Tomatoes from of all places - Indiana -  came out ahead of the others. But in taste tests - next to the Rutgers Hybrid or any number of Normal Shaped tomatoes - the Plum tomato cannot compete  - not even close - even at their best.",6년 전(수정됨),2,
@Thommadura,"@terrance martins  In addition - there are other factors against using Canned Tomatoes. Tomatoes are acidic - and they react with the cans they are in. In the USA - many producers use cans that have been coated inside to prevent this - but not all. The european brands tend to be behind on that. Also - Tomatoes in cans that have NO skin - are generally de-skinned by spraying the tomatoes with a LYE solution. THere are only a very small number of producers who use steam.  If you buy fresh tomatoes in season - and ""can"" them yourself in Mason Jars - the product will be substantially improved over any and all commercially canned tomatoes.  As I have said - these tomatoes are picked GREEN (WHen they are less delicate and easier to pick by machines) and then they are ""ripened"" with gas - so they cannot have the flavor of vine ripened tomatoes.    THe Fact is - is you are Buying Vine Ripened San Marzano Tomatoes in Italy - they are likely to be good. If you are only  buying CANNED tomatoes - then you do not even know what a really good tomato tastes like.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

@Thommadura,Englander - Actually the information I gave is readily verifiable over the internet - starting with the international win for NJ Tomatoes - in 1934 - and several wins since. The Rutgers Hybrid is well Documented on the Internet as well.  It is a matter or record ON THEIR website that Cooks Illustrated/Americas Test Kitchen  tested canned tomatoes and found that San Marzano tomatoes were overhyped as well.  The makeup of Plum tomatoes is available on agricultural sites all over the internet - and even the fact that NJ growers ait freight Tomatoes in Season is available on Google.  For those who are unable to GOOGLE  like you above - maybe you should take some computer lessons. ANd the Two largest NJ Coops that send overseas Overnight shipments - while their sites say they are unavailable right now (BEcause they are not in season) - actually can be verified to exist by entering New Jersey Tomatoes Shipped - which lists the Amazon site third on the list. OF course - lots of other claims have been made by the San Marzano advocates for which THEY have offered NO support .

Epicurious recently had a test (In addition to the Cooks Illustrated test) where Redpack Tomatoes came in above the ""real"" San Marzano tomatoes. The problem is - jsut as in Sicilan Olive oil - it is simply not possible for the local farms in the areas to produce ALL of the claimed San Marzano tomatoes - But then again - With the EVIDENCE so obvious - the people who claimed that they could find NO mention of what I posted are simply the trolls who never actually checked - apparently YOU never did as well",6년 전,1,

@aragusea,"Yes, I usually do a wetter dough. I needed to play it safe with this one, since filming the video added time to my processes and I was worried about it sticking. Why do you think it's too much oil?",6년 전,0,
@dvaoa," @aragusea  1/4 oil for that amount of flour is just way too much...you shouldn't need more than a TBS or two to give the dough some structure and also allow for better browning in a home oven.  1/4 cup oil makes the dough too short in my experience.  But you did the right thing with the extended rise in the fridge.  My recommendation for what it's worth...if you're going to commit to the time to do that, cut back on the amount of yeast to about 1/4 tsp and just use room temp water, let the dough rise on the counter overnight.  Then you can shape and use the next day, or shape and store in the fridge for up to 4 days or so before it over-ferments.  You'll end up with a better texture, and dough that's more digestable.  It'll be less ""yeasty"".",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@aragusea,"Yeah, I put the oil in to help with browning. Dough seems about as elastic as dough can possibly get, to me, but I'll try cutting it back a bit and seeing what happens. I'm open to the idea of using less yeast. I'm not sure about doing an initial rise on the counter. I really like the fine bubble structure you get with a cold rise. FWIW, I really seem to enjoy what other people regard as over-fermentation. Sometimes I leave it in the fridge for 8-9 days. I just love that funky acidy it gets.",6년 전,0,
@dvaoa," @aragusea  Try it (the lesser yeast).  It's really very simple, 1/4 tsp per 4-5 cups flour, with roughly half that amount in water.  Dough will indeed be sticky at first, but after leaving it to rise in a bowl on the counter overnight will help develop the gluten on it's own (think of the gas bubbling as internal ""kneading"").  After you divide and shape into dough balls, you'll see the dough be a lot less tacky.  The first overnight rise at room temp + low yeast followed by storing in the fridge will really give you that pro crumb structure you see in better pizzerias.  Whatever you do, don't roll it out with a rolling pin...you'll get a shingle.",6년 전,0,

Also, since I have my own home, I lay out quarry tiles on my barbeque grate which gives me a stone that is 36x24 so I can make a very large pie. My tile gets up to 700%.

@aragusea,"I've found that if I don't oil the dough balls thoroughly, they stick and I end up deflating them on the way out of the bowl, especially lately as I've tried to up the moisture content of my dough to be wetter and softer than what you see in this video. Do you have tips for how to get clean extraction without oil? I've experimented with flour and it hasn't gone well; too gooey after a long rise. Regarding the sauce, how do you do yours? Mine is pretty standard; a raw canned tomato product, some oil and herbs. The only thing I would imagine could be controversial would be the use of tomato paste.",6년 전,0,

@blueberrybubblegum10," @aragusea  my best advice is to cook the tomato sauce in a saucepan with diced onions and minced garlic for at least 3+ hours to get that super good complex taste. for my sauce, I cook it for 6+ hours with the can of san marzano tomatoes, garlic, yellow onion, tomato paste, olive oil, and fresh basil ! :^)",6년 전,0,
@aragusea,"@franchesca a. If you like that flavor, that's great, but it's certainly not NY style. A standard feature of NY-style pizza sauce is uncooked canned tomato product, which gets you a far brighter flavor. Using heavily-cooked tomato sauce on pizza always yields a flavor that's more like lasagna to me than pizza. Not a fan.",6년 전(수정됨),7,
@aragusea,"Do you mean the cornice? I don't think anyone would argue that NY-style crust should be something other than flat and thin. It's a defining feature of the style. The cornice is often big and fluffy. I suppose mine could be bigger and fluffier, but it's pretty big, and I'm not a big fan of the cornice, so I don't think I'd want it bigger.",6년 전,0,
@aragusea,"In the end, you can only get so close at domestic oven temperatures. If I didn't have little kids, I'd cut the lock off my oven and bake on the self-cleaning cycle.",6년 전,0,
