@dontsettle4243,"“Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB.  Goodbye So That You can Chose if you want to say Hello again.   0:35 ""I See The Love In Disguise"" -- Lil Wayne - Mirror ft. Bruno Mars (Official Music Video).   When people get rid of your goodbyes they are then trying to deny your choices of hellos. And or if you do even want to see then again. When you have time to think about your life without them and then chose do you really want them back into your life? Watch out for the ones who don’t say goodbye. Who you don’t have time away from. And I dont just mean some Mona Lisa Smile Away From. I mean some time away time away from. Get your life on track. ANd then see if you wanna add them back into your life. Were they a blessing and or just a lesson. And as such are they still a present day impact. And or just another blast from the past. Cause when you spend some time apart and allow yourself to grow. Then you get to see if they are willing andor able to grow. If they chose to grow. And or just copy and or appropriate your growth. Who are they without you? ANd or are they just another leech in your life. Time will tell. Cause not everybody in your life will grow the same way. Even if you have the same interest. When the time// paths cross even after the space and distance. Is it a surge of an upgrade and or do you just feel stunted, by the lack of growth from one and or some of the individual(s) and so as such are you more readily able to just cut them off. Some people are time capsules though which can be great to see your truth, growth and perspective. And help you both grow. At the roots and the branches. Without sacrificing the tree trunks. Hence when you meet in the middle and combine // collaborate on a joint slay. Its harder to do when your slays are identical. You get it. Hence why Mirrors real mirrors not just the two way mirrors but how real mirrors reflect I Can with naC I. But you get what Im saying. BEDMAS to SAMDEB. I hope that helps. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.   Matthew 7:5 ""Do Not Embrace Ignorance"" -- tHB. 0:35 ""I See The Love In Disguise"" -- Lil Wayne - Mirror ft. Bruno Mars (Official Music Video).  Everyone is killing each other to show the house of the mourning. But really if they just say Bye to just just by but wishing a good farewell. A Goodbye. Then there that would be the house of the mourning. That day, knight, conversation, communication. That there is the house of the mourning and not many people need to get so physically, emotionally, sexually, spiritually, soulfully, mentally, psychologically, etc, hurt. ""If you want to know about life then go to the house of the mourning"" -- tHB. What and or whom has been saying ending there conversations. Has been saying there goodnights. Goodbyes. Prayers. Closures, etc. Who has been doing there nightly report end of day reports. Nightly routine. Reflect a bit on the day. That there in itself is also the house of the mourning. I hope that helps. Death of a conversation all pandemic people have been saying after a few hey whats up and or long pauses that they are ending the conversations. Dead Air on the radio, tv music. House of the mourning too. Flip to commercial so that you can ""Lay down in green pastures"" -- tHB too. ""We shall be reborn"" -- Koffee ft Idris Elba ""Pam Pam talk with the women who's afraid of no man PAM Pam see she duh"" To be reborn without fixing the system, environment, organization is to sometimes ""expect a different outcome without making any real actual changes to the system"" -- Einsteins definition of Insanity. But to fix the system organization while you are still in the system and or organization. You have to first get out. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 and then get as many people out also and or afterwards too. ""How can I help the people if I am one of them. I wanted to rap like Common Sense"" -- Jigga keeps ish popping. And then after goodbye when // if you are to see each other again. When you return it is Hello. ""Hello, Good Morning"" -- P Didy ft Rick Ross and I think Another. To always start the restaurant without someone cleaning it the night before. It was like who worked, managed the closing last night. It fxxks up your morning routine. Are the night time managers and workers properly equipped with the right ""Knowledge for understanding"" -- tHB tools and training yet? Are you? Am I? Is anyone; yet? ""A goal without a deadline is just a wish"" -- Pinterst. Don't just wish upon a star. Set goals in order to achieve your dreams and make it fully and hopefully safely to the moon.

@dontsettle4243,"People like us.   Matthew 7:5 People like Us. ""Keep Your Head Up Nothing Last Forever"". Its better to die honest then to live a lie. Sometimes you agree to disagree. They both got to get their honest feelings out at the time. He honestly felt bad and she honestly didnt wanna hear it. Its like What Samantha Jones Says in Sex in The City. ""I had a fever of 103 you can't take anything I said then seriously"". Not that people cannot change and nor mean it. But don't rely and nor debase yourself to rely on burnt out love for affection.   He wanted to clear his conscience. And she is allowed the years to process it. You cannot rush someone to feel things on your hour. People should not have to feel pressured into forgiveness. It can make it not as much real then. And then neglecting your real and or true feelings for a connection is not the aim neither.  Self abandonment for a connection is not okay neither. And should not be what you aim for others to do neither. Its not healthy. Its toxic. Im sorry that he died. But when shes ready and she grows through it. The dealing with the abandonment and the growing through the forgiveness will be well worth it. A true forgiveness can inspire others and soften your heart. A rushed forgiveness and or a fake forgiveness and or a pressured forgiveness can harden your heart.   It can hurt you in the long run. Its not good for you. Im glad that she chose herself. Im glad that she chose to protect her heart. She was dealing with the abandonment already. Shes made song about it throughout her career. And so you rushing back into someones life doesnt stop it. It can mend some fences, provide some answers, heal some wounds, ease some pain. But it doesnt magically make it all go away. It can be a catayst for her growth, health and forgiveness journey that she is already on.   But you cannot ask her to skip to the end of the song because youre ready. What if she is not. Especially since she was not. She can continue to work on the abandonment and make the necessary changes. Cause it can leak into and affect other aspects of your life. Even without you realizing all of it. And she can actively continue to grow. She talks about her current divorce being hard because ""There are young (alot of) hearts involved"" her referring to her kids. Obviously she doesnt wanna replay and trickle down her generational trauma of abandonment after the divorce from her dad the same way with her kids. She is still dealing with it and being real about it.   You cannot force someone to chose you and abandon all the other areas of their life that they are already and are currently in the works of being healed. You cannot give up your health journey for someone else's well being. It was a longer health conversation that was needed and he just didnt have anymore time and he waited until he was almost out of time. Like with before she would have to answer the possible questions and or reasons of why without him. And she jsut chose to do that before during and after him while walking in light of her truth. Cause even if she got all the answers she would still needed some time and space to deal with the aftermath. It was abandonment, she didnt know if he was coming back.   And you take time for// with what your heart can carry. ""Above all things guard your heart"" -- Proverbs, tHB. I hope that she goes easy on herself as she continues to heal and now grief from the loss of her dad. And if she let him back in and knowing that he was dying and was gonna be abandoning her all over again this time for something out of his control. She could just be signing herself up to be abandoned all over again.   And could possibly be signing herself up to deal with all those feeling again. And dealing with grief this time. Thats a lot to put on a person. Especially when they are not yet healed from the first time. Youve got to give people time to grow. She did the best she could with what she (emotionally) had. You cannot fault her for that. And if you fault her for that. And then you could understand how she could fault her dad. Sometimes ventilation can hold up a mirror to some of your very own feelings as well.   I wish her nothing but the best. Happy healing journey. Don't let nobody bully you into health. That ish can make you depressed. And dont let nobody shame you for being depressed. Its just imploded anger from a boundary being crossed. Dont let nobody make you feel bad about being sad for a reasonable reaction// response for a boundary // limit that of yours that they crossed. Emotionally and or otherwise. You are allowed to feel your emotions. Just chose them in a healthy way. Best, X.

@dontsettle4243,"Matthew 7:5 James 2:20.  The maple leafs hat. In front of the picture with all the mountains.   You know the one.   He’s Two Faced!    Youve Got To Save Yourself!   The Truth is, its the joke.   He’s in “Love” choke hold.   Envy. When a parent mirrors a different kind of love in order to get it.   Maybe she’s tried growing roots in his romantic lane too.   When you know it, but you play along and smile through it.   What else is he to do.   Tangled. When the seasonal parent is the year round parent!   He looks like a kid on the side of a milk carton!   If you only look from the right side!  Michael Angelo Drew Cloud on the ceiling for when his love couldnt yet go outside.   You bring the outside inside for when you can’t yet go outside.   The outskirts come to you then.  Hospital or prison then?   When you are missing from your own home.  Youre there. But youre not yet exactly present; yet.   If you got through it on a mountain top to a valley.   Parent function. Then you will go back to find your lost sheep.  to find your truth. On the valley to the the mountain top on the   other parent function. Cosine X. and Sinx Parent Functions!   0-11 Scorpio goes to fall back on Libra. Libra can send Scorpio   forward or back to Taurus. Forward. Always forward. Fail in the valley.  Get a new one. And or fail in the valley go back and get the old one.   Learn from your life experiences! With other veterans. Not just sharing war   stories but learning from past mistakes. To prepare for the next war. Thats how   you lose if you dont grow. Some talk the rugby sport play that got the game winning goal.  Stand on your truth. I talk the high tackle that has me checking my toes now before I get up.   The high tackle that now I can hear some of my bones rubbing against each other. I talk Rugby   high tackle from blitzing forward and crossing the centre // half way line along. Started From   The Bottom now we’re here. Cross with a pack. But I need an inter independent pack. The Bag Guys, Leverage, Oceans 8, Oceans 11, Any heist movie. Any good heist movies knows that the crew. The main crew. The roots. They are inter independent. Have their own past. Can rely on their own instinct. Which makes them better when working together as a team. It strengthens them. Not hinders them. Makes there team work so much all that much stronger. They are not co dependent. And so Rugby you can learn to stand alone and then you make good teams for which you can stand together with. And or at least I thought. I counted myself in. But what if Capricorn does not yet. And then that could lead to be going on and on adn on. How do you stop. Have a goal with a limit. A goal with a deadline. Anybody else get injured from rugby? Sport injuries. Connective Tissue. Connecting with others based on truth. What about a high tackle. Specifics. ADN or a tackle and or move that shouldnt really be in the sport to begin with? Should be removed. Nobody really wanted to high tackle to begin with. ANd so others can share their experiences too. Someone can google research what the original point of high tackles was even about. Roots. Corrupt Roots. And then make moves to eradicate them. Translate them for other tackles. Also learn healthier and safer ways to tackle. “Fix the car, but keep the dimple” — Just Wright Movie Inspo. Keep the sport. Upgrade the healthy and safety. But without diluting the passion. For the game. And nor for the love of the sport. And then that is how you “Go back to go forward”. “Learn your history so that you are not doomed to repeat it”. “The future is to those who prepare for it” — Malcom X. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.  Matthew 7:5 0-11 = 12 Zodiac Signs. And so Scorpio falls back on libra. FRom Libra to Taurus Leo, Capricorn. And then the cycle can repeat. Scorpio is not in the cycle with a home base. Because Scorpio is on the move. Can rest at certain places along the way. But You will always find your way back home. And so that is what stops the circles from always going. On & On. Scorpio will want to go home. And so the game will stop. It’ll stop at Libra which can bring // help Spring Scorpio forward to scorpio on the other side of the butterfly effect. Not always back to the same place. So that way when the circles stop some times you can go back to your original stop. Level out. Let the waters settle. Let the waves calm down. And or to a whole new Scorpio stop on the other side of the butterfly effect. And or Taurus takes note. And then when Taurus is ready springs forward to a whole new 0-11 on the whole new other side of the butterfly effect. AND or on a whole new butterfly. Im not exactly sure yet.

@dontsettle4243,"Things That You Deal With, Before You Go To War.   “Give it To Your Sister Your Sister’s Older” — Enchanto.   Matthew 7:5 Wait! Did you tell peaches because you knew that purpose had jumped out of a moving car on the high way at like the age of 2. And that peaches pulled purpose back in. And maybe you thought that peaches you could help you with the Shawn Mendes Weight that was to heavy for your shoulders to carry adn that could just make even the biggest adn or hardest of hearts to break? Where you desperado then too? Was it a hail mary in hopes of helping in the end of the day you needed assistance? Who helps you when you can't get there yet? When the daycare attendants aren't yet doing there job? When the system isnt working during the days where sometimes the sun dont yet shine. When the organization fails you. And the parents play you? Who suffers?!??!?!..... the kids. When you refuse to be swept underneath the rug. 1984. ""Pressure that will drip drip drip never stop"" Enchanto. George Orwell. If you do not yet know who you are in times of peace before the war. Then you are at higher risk of skipping peace during the war. To prevent the end of the war. In hopes of not going back. ""Who are you if you are not of service"" You need to know that before you go to war. How many people keep feuds because what else are they gonna do// talk about if they are not fighting. And so they continue feuds that now having nothing to really do with nothing. Systems get clogged, organization structures get used but are not yet // no longer working. People start being of extremely high risk of going nowhere fast. All so that people dont have to go back to the not so good part. Aren't yet ready to heal from the not so good parts. So that they can go back to only the good parts. Not wanting to move on forward without the good parts. Abandoning themselves and or there possible real growth in which they miss actually meeting crossing paths on the next metronome. So that you can hold on to the past in fear of potentially not crossing paths again. And so in such possibly fxxking up all the other natural parts where the paths organically cross? You deal with your loneliness before you go to war? You deal with your identity and sense of self worth when not of service before you go to war. You deal with your needing healthy and safe space for quite and inner peace before you go to war. You deal with finding other people to talk to before you go to war. You deal with living your life out loud. And finding healthy and safe ways to ventilate your frustrations and navigate your past mistakes to learn life lessons from a life experienced. You dont give up a life experienced for past experiences. You grow through it. And hopefully make better experiences. But you deal with the truths before you go to war. Some people dont like drowning in the stagnation of a corrupt system. Others dont like having to ruffle through a bunch of lies looking for one truth. You deal with these things before you go to war.

Is it progressive lasting? And or are we riding with this change until the next wave comes up? Are we just trend setting when it comes to democracy and ish.

Let start start ""For the lowly there is wisdom"". ""For the last shall be first and the first shall be last"" -- tHB. But I mean where is the line. How many poeple will return oscars.

But I mean you dont wanna start with the rapist and the pedophiles first. Lets not pass the bucket. What wass the real issue. Where is the line? How can we stop it? How can we address it? How can we grow through it? Create a whole new system? Learn from it? Not just keep it in house all the time. People are doing their jobs but their with in regards to people, not just numbers on a spreadsheet, means to an end, like these are peoples lives. Chris said a joke and it really didnt land with the one on the chopping block Jada. Say what you will but she is the one with the hair that fell out. That we really havent seen outside of the house in forever. It was Will's big night and the whole family showed up and the joke really really didnt land on ""punching bag"". Thats what she was in that joke. She looked amazing but even tho you can look cool. Sometimes it still hurts. Its not like she shaved off her head and nobody knew. Everybody knew. Its just balled heads are kind of in right now. But hers is not by choice. She came outside of her house for Will. She most likely didnt wanna be reminded of her hair, her illness, her stress. Just be able to be a person apart from her appearance due to sickness and or stress. But a person who looks good and is here to celebrate achievements like everyone else. But could somebody else over there be like nah nah nah dot say that joke. Maybe not tonight. Someone else can have a balled head and you can pull it off with them. Did he asked Jada too. Its not like they have good history. The joke didnt land. aND the fulfilment got lost in translation. You get mad at people for defending sick relatives and its like where which direction is society heading? You get mad at the John Q's but not the corrupt system? Not the rapist? Not the pedophiles? The bad but not bad is where you draw the line? No this is to talk about when someone does something but bad for the right reasons. When a burglar breaks in and find kiddy porn and calls the cops. But leaves to not get caught. This is to talk about ""When you are a bad guy. But not a bad bad guy"" -- Wreck it Ralph. Because when you have a two parent income and insurance and you still cannot yet afford the treatment then it is not you. It is the system. And as such it is then also the system that we need to address, talk about, ventilate and find some truth towards solutions and trailblazing a new system forward thinking afterwards.

Was it really an oscar award winning performance peace of work based on quality and or popularity. You cannot redact adn not delete history. People getting stripped of work earned doesnt take the rapes, molestation, power plays, violations, etc away. The honorary ones because of there reputations sure. But not the ones that they earned. That doesnt make sense. Rather then stripped people of there non honorary awards. Why not just focus more on a better health and safety system. Where people can report sexual misconduct and abuse. How do you deal with it? How does justice get served? Grow through history so that it doesnt happen again; not sneakier, not lowkeier, not unreported longer. Talk about the movies, tv shows, other various art work that they worked on and also that won awards. And talk with the cast and crew.

That was different then at the Oscars. Don't compare someone reacting to the bait and switch that lead to sexual misconduct by a report to the person.

Talk about the ones who abused men women and kids from a position of power. And got many oscars, nominations and other awards accolades along the way. To the men women and children who spoke up about not wanting to be sexually violated and nor treating in a way of sexual misconduct at the hands of a power play and or abuse of power. There is self defence and then there is just assault. Start then with the survivors who have names there abusers in and outside of positions of power. Start then with the the people who abused there positions of power to abuse assault coerse people into doing things to keep there job, be employed not be blacklisted. We're not growing through those aspects yet. Slapping the jester (that would be Chris Rock here) is like shooting the messenger. Hurting the truth tellers. Thats the directions that Im taking right here. BEDMAS Divide before you multiply. I havent heard the joke yet but Ive seen some of the slap. Who protects the survivors and the truth tellers who speak up who fear retribution. Who fear violence for speaking up, using there platforms to promote a message depiction of the truth, to make a difference, etc. Today it is self defence but with the direction that we are headed tomorrow it could be an abuser attacking a survivor for speaking up. And also there are some truths that are just too heavy to talk about. And Jesters are truth tellers. Artist. Who comfort the disturb and disturb the comfortable. Who get the truth to the royals and allow them to think. Make light of what is sometimes seen as too heavy so that the actions can still be discussed and dealt with. Who protects, King Richards, The Kings Jester. When the jester has to do his and or her job and make light of a truth that is still wayyyy to heavy for the king himself to hear. Who stops the King from attacking his own peoples, works, employees. Cause people ask why didnt you speak up? How did some boss' get stuck at the top? Who calls out the boss? And then there are potentially a whole bunch of truths that the royals dont get to here because they dont wanna this to happen get slapped publicly or worst. Its about respect and he (Mr Will Smith) especially right after playing and being honoured as King Richard, he crossed the line. Conflict of interest. How do we deal with this? Where then does this truth get send without being underneath a bushel. And nor too undercover to be mistaken as a cou. Do they were the Kings Court. The Kings Jester. Badges.

And then all the extra ventilation. In the after math. Youre growing through the experience. Fireworks. Combustion. Youre gonna give some things off in the combustion process. Thats how the really big fireworks take off. And so who deals with the imformation that you may have left behind in the combustion process somebody has go to go through it; no? But on the other side of the soil. Libra leaves the environment and starts fresh. And or they just send all the information away and then pieces just works on it in another location. But sometimes you need a change of scenery. Sometimes its not you its your environment. So it depends on the libra. There are two. One that can go the distance. Like what I said. NAd the other that can carry the weight. Points still valid. And so Mendes can't be a Megaphone for Bieber anymore. Scorpios need a real and honest Leo.

@dontsettle4243,"Does society make room for solitude and inner work within society  Open circuit and or closed circuit.  ""Do Not Embrace Ignorance"" -- tHB. 0:07 Shawn Mendes There's Nothing Holding Me Back Music Video. So are they Bruno Mars locked out of hEAVEN. Came out 9 years ago. Saggitarius bro.  And or are they muffins in the oven that have to go on without some of there philosophy. When baking Yeast needs that pure water to feed off of. How do people include make room for themselves within society. You count yourself out someone else suffers too. Youre needed within society, for you , by you for true. Not as someone else may want you to be. ""Don't let nobody change you"" -- So A Child May Follow song Inspo by Damian Marley. So shine A Light. Open circuit and or closed circuit.  Spirit and or Soul Circuit. I said what I said. There are two middle grounds. 5,6,7,8, two times. One carries the weight the other can go the distance. Orcas fins go limp when kept in underwater cages. Do you give make room for some people to just sit down and watch the current? And or do you make it all get in or get gone? Is it all get in and get it done? Make it happen? But what about time to wonder? What about time to get lost? Call for help? And or find yourself? Does society make room for solitude and inner work within society? If not who suffers? The people suffer? Youve got to count yourself in! As a human as a person. Or else possibly risk feeling alienated. I said what I said. For who you wanna be not just for who other people may want you to be. And neither for who you may think other people may want you to be. Youve got to count yourself in for who you are. How you can best healthy adn safely do what makes you happy. Don't let a closed circuit try and condition you into how to survive make it as an closed circuit in an open circuits world. If you have to be closed circuit then look for the closed circuit spaces. Look for the other people who are also healthy and safe who are living there lives in the closed circuit moments. Look for transitioning circuit spaces. Or if you are closed circuit then look for a closed circuit world. A polar bear cannot just live in the ocean. Global Warming. As an Orca cannot just live free range in Texas Just minding its business. Aquariums are temporary but eventually people gotta be free. They cannot yet survive if put back out into the wild because life in captivity has robbed them of there real life experience adn teaching from nature. Better late then never. So we can track where Orcas go but we cannot teach them the migration patterns. You ever notice how all those animals dont need that much help giving birth in the wild. That being said some animals in the wild can vary.Some can mind there business. Others can be harassed by peopel for not seeming interesting. Others can become on the defensive and attack humans as they enter there locations life on the defensive am I right. Others can walk // swim go up to humans and ask for help. Others can get lost within the village. So do we think about the animals and there natural habitats, migration patterns when we set up shop. Do we do any engineering planning before we may chose to build. Other animals in the wild can just walk up to people just to play. Others may even chose to save humans from other natural and or unforeseen possible dangers. Animals can vary like people within society. And so why do we all try to get everyone to just fit this like one mould. Its inhumane. Its not natural. Make room for variety. Various types of people. Personalities. And allow people to go there seperate ways when there personalities clash. Just because youre related doesnt mean that you'll like everyone in general and or right away. Do you like everyone in your class, school, work, etc? ADN what if youre boss forced you to hang out specifically with the person that you didnt like because you worked together? And or did the same hobbies, sports, etc. Not everyone like each other on day one and thats okay. You appreciate the ones who you do like ways better. You respect the realness way better. Make room for people to enjoy there solitude adn proper alone time to. When everyone counts themselves in people will naturally gravitate to what it is that they do like. And then it is so much ways cooler when you can chose a soceity lived in. Some to socialize. Time to recharge your social battery. Not lithium pills for lithium batteries. But time to spend relaxing doing things that relax you. Listening to music, going to the spa, having calming conversation, hanging out in natural. Make room for talking about health and safety when it comes to nature within society. Not just for when you get out there. ""Prevent is better then cure"" -- My Gma. And various types of people counting themsleves in as people within society means also various types of engaging activities things to do. A place for arts adn cultures. TO learn about various history, to make pottery, create your own tea cups, to dance ball room, hip hoop, salsa, etc. A place to debate the rules, a seperate place to argue the rules, a place to talk philosophy, to take history, etc. To learn machanics, plumbing, etc. Best, X.

Healthy and safe spaces/ and or places to fumble without feeling completely exposed and or shredding if you may have another view!??!?! Real question!?!?!? Let's talk about !!!!

@dontsettle4243,"""Do Not Embrace Ignorance"" -- tHB. They Need Abusive Relief Shelter! For Men and Women! Not Just in the islands. But also in the hills after you are famous too!! Some for physical abuse. Some for environmental abuse. Others for when truth tellers need to lay low. After getting much heat from telling and //or sharing a much needed story!! People need a space to lay low. They are people and then they are celebrities. And when we fail to treat Artist as such. the people suffer. The world suffer. the Artist suffer!! More importantly the poeple behind the artist suffer. Hollywood needs a work life balance. But most importantly a safe space to be a person. And seek shelter in the event of physical violence. Drew Barrymore. And have Social Service Workers. Who can see past the razzle Dazzle. And call it for what it is truth amongst the chaos. That the ""kids are not always alright"" -- Dua Lipa song inspo. Especially when it comes to being parented and or raised in Hollywood sometimes. Who can provide solid ground for those floating up within the air? Who can help people be grounded without destroying there confidence! Keeping them safe without just letting them be free figure it out for themselves. Treating kids as adults because they are in the spotlight and make big bucks as a shiney coated way to candy coat there neglecting these kids when they need guidance role models leadership the most. For wanting all the perks of wanting the kids and even sometimes making money off of them but wanting none of the responsibility with having to actually take the time to care and redirect them when if they should fall of track. Justin Bieber falling out of cars getting drunk plastered where was his guidance!! Who steps in when the kids are not alright!! SSW equality and then equity. Every kids needs a healthy and safe space to hang out. On various socio economic backgrounds platforms!! Who helps them to do outreach and connect with the people. You cannot get mad at people for getting being tone def when we alienate them on the top of the world. Segregate them from the real world. In famed isolation. And then get mad when they dont' yet understand real world problems. Who talks them off the ledge! The people suffer when the artist cannot yet have a life outside of the world. Hollywood needs to close. Hollywood cannot always be open!!! People need to clean house! It has been on for far too long!!! Who cares for the people in Hollywood. AND who cares for the workers as artists? You cannot put the people in a box! And then get mad when they lash out! Why must you try to people in a box to begin with? Make room for introverted, extroverted and Ambiverted people within hOLLYWOOD! Thats all for now. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, aMEN.",3년 전,0,

I used to work sound and lights for concerts, in the course of which I met and worked with a lot of famous musicians and singers, most of whom were not nice people. There were exceptions, of course. Muddy Waters was one of the friendliest, funniest and kindest people I ever met. The singer from the Psychedelic Furs (Richard Butler, I think) was also a very good egg.

@Alpha-Andromeda,Jimmy Dishkawnt why u generalize?  Most hot girls have a lot of talking and dancing going on. That cuts down on the amount of alcohol per hour. Less attractive girls can sit and drink (sometimes a lot).  Hot girls are also more self-conscious. They get hammered less as a result of thinking about the consequences more.   Very hot girls are never very fun. Always go for the cute fun girl and leave the hot girl to her posse.,5년 전,3,

The last few years, I’ve started to get his humor and I just love him. I went to a taping and one of his jokes was so funny that I couldn’t stop laughing. Got home that night and watched the show. All I heard was my giggling. I have a dry sense of humor and it takes a lot to get me to laugh like that. LNSM has done that to me SEVERAL times. You can’t find this clip anymore but Seth told a joke in his opening monologue and the joke BOMBED. You could hear cotton drop. His reaction was so priceless which made everyone laugh. One day, I’m gonna ask him about that joke. Thank you, Seth.",6년 전,0,

Some people bash her for various reasons and all of them stem from jealousy; c'mon, just look at her! Try to find a flaw because I can't, and if you think you can you're wrong.",6년 전,0,

@chaimaa_mae,"@Vince Garcia you wrote me a whole ass newspaper? Are you okay? Are things okay at home? Selena was born poor af she ate from the 99 cent store and lived in a garage she didn't even have a bathroom, girlie started working since she was seven to feed her mom and her dad was completely out of the picture, she made one wrongly worded tweet and she apologized for it so many times once in a live concert and once in Instagram post, she is an activist and she does soooo much charity work she even worked for free a full year to stop human taficcking and she was the reason hundreds of people donated their kidneys to patients who suffer from kidney failure and this isn't even 0.099% of the good she did, WHAT DID YOU DO? Besides being a negative bit#h to a completely random woman, does it bother you she worked hard af to be where she is? Then work hard too... You are simply pressed because you are a complete failure and she as a woman did better than you will ever do, that's what's up... Rihanna tweeted MULTIPLE times about her love for selena and the sadness but funniest part here is that they both don't know or care about you but they care about each other so I suggest you be kind and work on loving yourself ❤ and don't act like you don't make mistakes, she is on a big zoomed screen but you are on a small screen the difference is that people care enough to talk about her mistakes but they dont care about you enough to judge your mistakes and that's the tea.... So I could care less about you and I'm pretty sure selena don't even know you exist nor does she care so you need to calm down kindness is free ✌",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@Patrik1st,"After sobering up and realizing the time he'd just spent with Rhianna had come and gone.... Seth locked himself away, refusing to be seen by anyone.  Days later emergency services broke down his door at the behest of his loved ones. Finding Seth, in the corner, severely dehydrated.  An officer at the scene recalls, ""Just before we kicked in the door, it was eerily quiet. All that was heard was a steady, rhythmic ""thumping"" sound coming from behind the door.""  It was then, Seth was rescued.....from himself.  Some say a faint thumping sound can still be heard from that room.",6년 전,0,

She is no longer super skinny (Which she was gorgeous then as well) but still has a beautiful toned body. It's ok to give another person a compliment.  You dont have to be jealous hunn..

Mr. Scott Buchholz MP hosted the meeting, which was attended by members from the Senate and House of Representatives. According to Dr. Zhao, president of the Australian Falun Dafa Association, legal experts and medical professionals gave presentations on how to expose and end this brutality.

Also an unasked for piece of advice/ suggestion on what to do if you no longer want to do music.  Continue go try different avenues that spark your interests. Whatever you find that puts a smile on your face thinking of or doing it. Take time to be conscious.  Second idea... open up mentorships and workshops to help others excel in areas you can teach. This can give you some joy and help figure out what else to do.  Good Luck Love♡♡!,6년 전(수정됨),0,

@transformationstation5414, Sudan Nutella  Rihanna's Arab boyfriend was married to an Arab woman. She is just as rich (if not more) than he is. They got divorced.

@tdsims1963," @lovettdeleted  Not true. I once met a former alcoholic-turned-lecturer who told me something I've never forgotten: ""You are already who you are before the alcohol. The drink didn't do anything special or magical to you; if you're an asshole sober, you will also be an asshole drunk. Alcohol doesn't change you, it did nothing until you picked up the glass and drank."" And I agree with this. And so, I hope that they are also friends offset as well as on. Why not? Sure, they're celebrities but they are also human beings and chemistry is chemistry.",6년 전,3,

Arab men, or any man, doesn't validate, make, or break Rihanna (or any self-actualized woman with agency)! I honestly don't get why you're so invested, and hypercritical of this woman's personal/love life, whom you've never met, and feel the need to be some kind of weirdo  ""watcher"" over the events of it?

The deadline and intangible date for the start of the Tribulations is the evening of November 12, 2023 --> HORROR ON EARTH.  It is your faith in the shed BLOOD of Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the Cross, which will save you from these Tribulations  Those left behind, on earth, will experience unimaginable horrors after the Rapture of the Church within 9 days, prepare to suffer for Christ, shedding your own blood for Him, for this will be your only possibility after the Rapture of the Church.  Because having refused HIS BLOOD TO THE CROSS until this Rapture of the Church, you will then have to suffer and die for JESUS CHRIST in order to obtain eternal life, at your death, because yes.... after your death earthly for CHRIST, you will go to Heaven, because you will have carried your cross.
