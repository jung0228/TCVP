@watdew1502,"Shout out to the cute dog photo. Behold all the chubs and wrinkles what a chubster. I begged my parents for a shar pei when I was a kid, and we got two. I named them Mr. Pugglesworth and Pennelo-pei. They were neurotic af :( Very nice to us but terrible with other dogs. Turns out the breed has quite a few issues, mostly due to the fact that the breeding pool in the states was from a mere 200 dogs. If I ever get a wrinkle dog again I will get a bulldog, or possibly a pug. I love pugs but like shar pei, they seem to suffer from many health problems. I have a 13 year old hound/golden retriever mutt I got from the pound when she was 10 months old. She's fantastic, never had health issues, still loves running, and bc of the hound in her she does have some good wrinkles and chubs around her neck.

@Djs23455," @Youtubemademeaddahandle  I still disagree; my argument is that what your body tells you to do is not always what will bring you the most benefit. For example, after a hard set in the gym, your body will tell you to pant and gasp for air. But the most effective approach there is downregulation breathing, because it allows you to recover quicker.  And just fundamentally, not everything our body has evolved to do is beneficial in the modern age. Take diet, for example. Our bodies are designed so that we prioritize sugary, fatty, salty foods because they're energy-dense. A diet high in those foods worked in prehistoric times because it was an everyday fight for survival, but things obviously aren't like that anymore. If you just ""listened to your body"" with regards to what you eat, you'd become obese and hypertensive and you'd probably be dead before you hit 50. Does that analogy help?",9개월 전,0,

@ItsOnlyGenjutsu,"TL;DR: Needed this topic in particular, and it popped into my feed right when I needed it. Lezgo! Thank you.  Bro, I need this. I was kinda at a loss (I look [looks aren't what matter to me, but was jarring apon recognition] better now stomach wise, just cause I can finally handle some foods again) because I literally look like came out of a concentration camp. And, I'm not being hyperbolic. I look like my limbs will snap under what weight I do have. Especially since I'm bigger (6'4-6'5). I have zero clue on how to build back muscle. Or, if it's even possible after atrophying this severely. And, with my father gone. And, the countless bullshitters and hucksters and nonsense ads that make you skeptical about everything. I didn't really even wanna search ""how to build muscle"". Not like I haven't tried before, but still. And, somehow, I didn't think to check Huberman. This way I can have a little faith through scientific processes being explained. Since I'm literate enough in this terminology to understand what is being said (or rather, pick up on bullshit if such pops up) and can properly fact check what I don't know. Not just what someone says. I'm hyped that I'll have at least a point to jump from. I feel stupid I'm so late, but it's amazing the Huberman/Lex clip SPECIFICALLY on muscle building just haphazardly appeared in my feed. When I'm at a point health wise that I can actually do stuff now. So, instantly came to the full pod from that video (sorry Lex lol).",1년 전,0,

@NeuroReview,"Rating: 8.6/10 In Short: Common Sense Strength Science  Notes: These two bounce from mechanism to real life principles elegantly.  Once the ideas and tools are discussed, with a dance of mechanism here and there, it becomes so clear and feels like most of the things discussed are pretty common sense.  From building strength or endurance, to breathing and intent, after the tools and protocols  are given it seems like I already knew it, just hadn't heard it discussed before.  Of course as someone who has worked out and pushed myself I know how these things worth, but what I realized is that most of the things I 'know' about strength and endurance (as a d1 athlete) just come from stuff that friends have said before.  For anyone else who has done, is doing, or plans to do thoughtful exercise and training, this is a fantastic and must listen podcast. Sometimes it gets in the weeds of strength training, but its so behavioral focused and mechanistic that it makes so much sense how the two of you go on to do a 6 EPISODE guest series.",1년 전,0,

@risecopeman5409,"Dr Huberman, There is a sadly significantly growing group of young people trying to recover from abnormal loss of  muscle, stamina, and endurance. The syndrome is very similar to overnight aging by 60 years. Or waking up from a 2 year coma.They were strong, very active people who went through significant, sudden, sustained tissue hypoxia and repeated reprofusion injury. When treated and ""healed"", they are left with the overwheming loss of micro vasculature, muscle, nerves, and brain/body connection as if they were very old. Yet it happened so quickly and at an age where they do not cognitively naturally understand why they feel the way they do. So weak, so prone to pain, so scared.... So they avoid everything rather than do very small, very careful incremental increases in stresses. This condtion is growing in the population. 10 to 30 percent have it now. Each year there will be more. It particularly effects young, active people who are more damaged specifically because they were so young and so active and unwittingly did the most damage because they pushed through, repeatedly, when the microvasulature was inflamed and full of micro clots, causing hypoxia and toxin buildup, followed by tissue destruction, overwhelming fatigue, and retraction/shrinking/loss of muscles, nerves, capillaries and arteriols. Suddenly becoming like a very old person. Yet they are not! They can rebuild it all. But they, that whole growing population, needs help. You are that person because of your deep interest in the body, the mind, and healing - the bodys amazing potential, especially at such a young age. Please, please help.

@vvolis,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  16:31 💪 Exercise choice alone does not determine the adaptation; it's the application of the exercise (sets, reps, rest ranges) that primarily influences the outcome. 20:54 📊 You don't necessarily need to assess your one-repetition maximum; conversion charts can estimate it based on your repetitions and weight lifted. 22:22 🏋️ For strength and hypertrophy, modifiable variables include choice of exercise, intensity, volume (reps and sets), rest intervals, and progression. 25:51 📆 Training frequency is essential; how often you perform an exercise affects your progress. 35:08 💪 To develop strength, you need to impose a high-intensity demand, typically above 85% of your one-rep max, with low repetitions (5 or less) per set. 38:29 💪 For strength training, rest periods of 2 to 4 minutes between sets are recommended to maximize outcomes. 39:29 ⏳ Limiting strength and hypertrophy training sessions to around 60 minutes can help manage recovery and prevent overtraining. 40:29 🔄 Super setting push-pull exercises can be an effective way to maintain intensity and cardiovascular effort during a workout. 41:28 🩸 Different types of exercise adaptations lead to various physiological responses, and you can strategically choose your training approach based on your goals. 42:27 🏋️‍♂️ Hypertrophy training and anaerobic conditioning can offer the most comprehensive physiological adaptations across multiple categories. 44:24 🧠 Early adaptations to exercise are primarily neural, but sustained hypertrophy takes weeks and involves changes at the muscle fiber level. 45:21 💡 Training frequency is crucial, and waiting too long between workouts may miss the window for inducing further hypertrophy. 46:21 🔄 The gene cascade and protein synthesis process play a role in hypertrophy, with a recovery window of 24 to 48 hours between workouts. 47:48 💪 Strength development involves changes in the nervous system, muscle contraction, and connective tissue, making daily training feasible. 49:45 🤔 Strength and hypertrophy have a relationship, but more muscle doesn't guarantee proportionate strength gains. 58:10 💪 Repetition ranges for strength training are typically five or less, with the frequency being as often as every day. Rest intervals can range from two to four minutes, or longer for one-repetition maximum attempts. 59:12 💪 For hypertrophy training, effective repetition ranges can vary from five to 30 reps per set. A minimum of two times per week per muscle group is recommended for hypertrophy. 01:00:10 💪 Training for strength can follow the ""three to five concept,"" which involves selecting three to five exercises, doing three to five reps, three to five sets, resting for three to five minutes, and training three to five times a week. 01:13:32 💡 The ""mind-muscle connection"" or being intentional about contracting specific muscles during exercises may contribute to greater muscle growth. 01:18:01 🧠 Proper muscle activation during exercises is key for muscle development, and compensatory movements can hinder progress. 01:19:23 💡 Visualization, tactile feedback, and touch can help improve muscle group activation during exercises. 01:23:20 🔑 Separating breath from brace is essential for effective core stabilization during exercises. 01:35:07 💪 Adrenaline ramp-up during workouts can lead to energy crashes later. Down-regulations after workouts can help avoid this issue, even with just a few minutes. 01:36:08 🕒 Taking short breaks, as short as one minute, between intense activities can help conserve neural energy and enhance performance. 01:38:05 🏃‍♂️ When focusing on endurance training, choose exercises with minimal eccentric landing to reduce muscle damage and soreness. 01:39:59 🚴‍♂️ Activities like cycling, swimming, and rowing are good options for endurance training with minimal eccentric loading. 01:41:57 🔄 Mixing strength training and endurance training in the same workout or within the same week is generally not detrimental to overall progress. 01:47:18 💪 Interference between endurance and muscle growth is less significant than previously believed, especially if energy intake is controlled. 01:52:15 🚶 Incorporating more movement into your daily routine, like walking during phone calls or pacing, is essential for overall physical health. 01:53:46 🏃‍♂️ Dr. Andy Galpin recommends doing something once a week to reach a maximum heart rate (close to max intensity), lasting at least 30 seconds, for optimal cardiovascular health. 01:54:46 💓 Maximum heart rate (approximated as 220 minus age) is a rough measure and may vary significantly among individuals; focus on reaching a challenging heart rate during exercise. 01:56:12 🏋️‍♂️ Incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts that challenge maximum heart rate once a week can complement hypertrophy training and provide various cardiovascular benefits. 02:00:41 🩺 Identifying your point of physiological failure (e.g., legs vs. cardiovascular system) helps tailor your training to address specific weaknesses. 02:02:11 🏃‍♂️ To build well-rounded endurance, include three components: once-a-week high-intensity training, extended moderate-intensity cardiovascular work, and 2-6 minutes of high-intensity work followed by equal rest periods, repeated as needed. 02:15:04 🏋️‍♂️ Training just below the threshold of pain can help improve tissue tolerance and desensitize pain signals, especially for conditions like low back pain. 02:16:04 💧 Proper hydration is essential for health and performance. Aim for half your body weight in ounces of water per day and replenish fluids lost during exercise. 02:17:30 💧 Hydration needs vary based on individual factors like sweat rate. Sweat testing can help determine sodium loss and guide electrolyte supplementation. 02:31:01 💧 Pre and post-exercise hydration recommendation is around 500 milligrams of salt each time. 02:34:22 💧 If you're losing more than 1% of your body weight during exercise, it's essential to focus on hydration. 02:34:53 🍽️ Whether to train fasted or not depends on personal preference and the type of training, but it's generally okay for the average person. 02:36:54 🥶 Avoid immediate cold exposure like ice baths after strength or hypertrophy training, as it can interfere with muscle growth. 02:37:25 ❄️ It's best to wait at least a few hours before cold exposure after a workout to minimize interference with hypertrophy. 02:38:31 🥶 Cold showers are not as effective as ice baths for recovery and adaptation, and it's preferable to separate them from strength training. 02:40:59 🏋️‍♂️ Cold exposure may not be as detrimental to strength development as it is to hypertrophy, so it's less concerning in strength-focused training. 02:49:29 🏋️‍♂️ Sauna use after strength and hypertrophy training could have potential benefits, although there isn't official data yet. It might be beneficial after endurance training as well, assuming proper hydration. 02:49:57 🌡️ An ideal regimen might involve training, then sauna or heat exposure, followed by cold exposure on off days or several hours away from training, optimizing recovery and adaptation. 02:50:59 ❄️ Cold exposure in the morning can lead to improved overall relaxation and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) scores throughout the day, reducing the need for excessive caffeine. 02:51:28 🌊 Sitting still in cold water immersion creates a thermal layer around you, so it's more effective to move around a bit to break up this layer for better cold exposure results. 02:51:57 💪 Regular cold exposure can lead to enhanced adaptability and reduced fatigue, as seen consistently in athletes' HRV scores. 03:02:42 🔵 Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) can improve training performance by helping to regulate pH levels in muscles, reducing fatigue, and enhancing endurance. 03:07:40 🫐 Inhaled oxygen is used by the body to create energy by breaking down carbohydrates or fats, with carbohydrates stored as glycogen in muscles. 03:08:08 🔬 Anaerobic glycolysis, which breaks down carbohydrates for fuel in low-oxygen conditions, produces acid as a byproduct, leading to fatigue buildup. 03:14:06 💡 Sodium bicarbonate can temporarily increase alkalinity in the body, delaying the onset of fatigue during intense exercise. 03:15:34 🥤 To use sodium bicarbonate, start with a small amount (e.g., half a teaspoon) dissolved in water, consumed around 45 minutes before exercise. 03:16:04 🤢 Gastric distress is a potential side effect of sodium bicarbonate, so use caution and experiment to find the right dosage. 03:24:57 🌙 Understanding and addressing environmental factors can significantly improve sleep quality, even when other aspects have been optimized. 03:25:26 🌬️ Monitoring environmental factors during sleep, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality, can impact sleep quality. 03:25:57 😴 Re-breathing CO2 around your face during sleep can lead to sleep problems; addressing this can improve sleep quality. 03:26:56 🛏️ Absolute Rest is a commercial sleep optimization device that can diagnose sleep-related issues and improve sleep quality. 03:28:19 🤝 Dr. Galpin's ability to distill complex information into practical protocols is highly valuable to many people. 03:29:17 📲 Connect with Dr. Andy Galpin on Instagram and Twitter for further information on exercise science and related topics.

@Simonsayssomething,"I am 42 and have been lifting since I was in 7th grade.  I use to only do lower rep ranges. I liked it because it is was harder to do higher rep ranges.   A year back I switched to higher rep ranges, up to 35 reps per set. It was tough at first, but I prefer it now. It just seems safer and I have yet to get even close to injuring myself.   I just love lifting and love lifting for longer amounts of time early in the morning. I do a push, pull, legs schedule 5 to 6 days a week and love it. The high reps definitely allow you to lift more often. My body is much more lean looking as well, which is what I prefer over a big being a big fat muscle looking guy. The lack of injuries is the biggest factor. At 42, I just want to be able to lift with less risk of injuries.  One trick I have found to get over the fact I am doing lots of reps is to count to 15 to or 20, then I start over and count to something like 5 or 10, then start over and count to 5 or sometimes 2 or 3 and even 2 and 1 at the end. It’s weird, but mentally breaking up the last reps seems to make it easier and then I add them all up.  Also I like to go up to 35 reps before I add more weight and then I add weight and if now my rep range is 20, I keep going until I get it to 35. I will change that to 30 now after listening to this. I just thought I heard 35 somewhere.  Sometimes I will do up to 40 reps on certain exercises and sometimes more if I have it in me. Another thing I will do if I am really high on reps and I don’t want to add weight is I will slow my speed down and/or do isometric exercises.  I do these changes to mix things up and make it more fun.  Basically I do all kinds of different methods, except I don’t do low reps high weight any more.  I have found high weights, low reps is a recipe for injury. Everything is fine, until it isn’t. It is too easy to injury myself quickly.  Then you can’t lift, possibly for weeks when you are older.   So, as a result I am an advocate now for lower weight, higher reps; isometric exercises, and slower rep ranges with lower weight. They are just safer and seem to be very effective for the average person.  It’s not flashy, but is highly effective and safe.",1년 전,1,

@Szpulenso,"Do you think that you can combine, during one session, muscular endurance workout + cardiovascular? So for example, doing muscular endurance training first such as sets of bodyweight pushups/pullups/squats/plank (1 isometric exercise), high reps such as 25/8/40/2min plank circuit, (numbers are arbitrary, basically every exercise to the point of near-failure) and:  -doing about three such circuits, they will most likely not trigger HR max, they will simply just burn the heck out of your muscles, mostly triceps, biceps and quadriceps I assume given the exercises I listed, - then, shortly after (perhaps max 3 min break? 5 mins? just to recover some strength in quadriceps) going for something more cardiovascular-endurance oriented such as 4 bouts of sprints, 90% to MAX HR,   Would such protocol even work? I am worried you cannot exactly mix two of these.  And one more question: would mixing cardiovascular aerobic + anaerobic exercise patterns during THE SAME training session work? If I ran 40 mins steady pace at 50% HR, conversational pace + top it off with few sprints at the end - would these sprints undermine my aerobic changes within the body or vice versa? Is it better to keep them seperately? It was talked in this podcast that HR Max endurance training is complementary to hyperthrophy training, not sure about Aerobic tranining.",2년 전,0,

@antoniosdongas157,"great podcast! I love the common sense realistic advice instead of the 'magic bullet"" advice most utube videos try to promote and sell. I wish they would have delved a bit more into what strength progression looks like. For example, lets say I follow the workout principles in the video and I want to increase my bench press or, alternatively , I make a goal to shoot for a 300ib. bench? First off, is that a realistic goal for the average male around 5'10'', 200lbs. who is not genetically gifted, nor a pro-athlete and, assuming all other factors such as eating ""clean"" , sleeping and resting for recovery are in order? If so, When and how often  do I add weight (get stronger) to the bar in my progression of strengh? or, how long will it take to get to the 300lbs.benchl?  For example, say I'm working out at 75-80% of my one rep max, how do I know when to increase the poundages and what percentage do I increase the weight on the barbell in my pursuit of a 300lb. bench?  5 lbs at a time? 10 lbs at a time? 50 lbs at a time?  And how often do I add  weight ? every week? every month? once a year???(I'm using the bench press as an example, so this question is really for all/any weight lifting movement. And obviously progression is going to be different for everybody but is there an average percentage rate that one can expect to get stronger at aka lift more weight? or is there an indicator when its time to lift more weight aka ""progress the resistance"" or ""reach"" further or over reach as you say in the video? I'm sure that if I'm starting my bench pressing  at 150 lbs one rep max for example, I don't just then throw 300 lbs on the barbell after working out for a certain period.. So How do I get to the 300lb bench goal, again, if that is even a realistic goal for the average person? If not,  what would be a typical expectation or average expectation of a one rep bench pressing max for the average person? Is there any avergae percentage for 75% of the population?",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@benoitjacquet4961,"Great podcast!  Thank-you both for sharing all this valuable information.   I must say, though, that I have a very hard time believing in the baking soda ""trick.""  Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, and when you swallow it, it goes straight into your stomach, which is a very acidic environment that contains hydrochloric acid.  Basic chemistry tells you that when you combine an acid and a base, you form a salt, a gas, and water.  In this case, to be specific, baking soda on HCl produces table salt, CO2, and water.  Don't believe me?  Drink a little bit of baking soda solution, and you will inevitably burp within a few seconds.  That's your newly produced CO2, right there.  So, by the time the baking soda solution reaches your small intestine (major site of absorption in the digestive tract), it is effectively mostly water and table salt.  Moreover, even if some actual basic baking soda made it into your bloodstream, your body has many ways of buffering your blood to bring it back to a baseline pH (through ventilation (i.e. breathing rate), specialized cells in the kidneys etc...)  So, in my opinion, if baking soda works, it has to have mos of its effect(s) through the placebo effect.  I strongly doubt that it has any pH-changing effect for the duration of a workout! Also, on another note...I'm sure this was just a slip of the tongue (keeping your thoughts straight for 3 hours+ is tricky), but Dr. Galpin stated in the podcast that fast glycolytic muscle fibers (""fast twitch"") are resistant to fatigue.  They are actually the most fatiguable fiber type...way more than the slow twitch fiber!  That's why you can run for hours, but can't keep generating tons of force for very long.",2년 전,1,

She rebuked me and said MHR equals 220 less age and there was nothing more to argue. I'm so thankful and grateful that you make such important and critical knowledge available to the public!,2년 전,0,

Reason being, around the 40 min mark we are in the depletion zone of glutathione stores. You want your glutathione stores in the muscle to be at a Maximum when beginning a resistance workout and not depleted at all. With that said, other than a very short warm-up, endurance or cardio should always be done after and never before strength, power or hypertrophic workouts.Glutathione’s multi-functional role cannot be left out of a health and performance discussion.

@viktormeier,"Hi Andrew, congrats for the excellent research and podcasts you and your team deliver every week! I have transitioned from athlete to Founder/CEO of a global sports company. I am a bit astonished about the 1. the high volume of sets per week/session recommended and 2. the high caution around going to failure and 3. the little recovery time recommended.  Although I love strength training, I want to limit my time investment to a minimum to have more free time for business and family etc. My protocol is doing 4 workout sessions per week each with a core movement (Push, pull, squad, Abs/core), each with 6 sets and each set a different exercise variation of that core movement. Every set I go to failure and like that I can finish a session in under 20min, cold shower and attack the day and still being fresh.   My recovery time per movement/muscle group is 1 week and every session I feel super fresh and ready to push myself to the limits what I doubt if the recovery time would be less.

@bbk2802,Military type training. Maximum repetitions then repeat for a second set. Take two days to recover and repeat. Add sets not reps to progress. At 6 sets begin to add reps to progress. Then increase frequency until you can do 6 sets of 100 reps of pull ups 4-6 days a week and you’ll be golden. Btw the world record for pull-ups is in the several thousands so if this seems impossible then crawl under your bed covers wank off and watch Netflix and enjoy being soft,2년 전,0,

For instance, I work quads and calves Monday, back and biceps Tuesday, hamstrings and glutes Wednesday, and chest, shoulders and triceps Thursday. Since I would be trying to train those muscles groups more frequently then the current split should I combine the split and do upper and lower body exercises on the same day so I can repeat it more often?.

Take days off as needed but don’t take days off if you can continue to repeat the performance. 1 set is plenty to activate your growth. If you are an intermediate then do 3-8 sets until failure using 40-60% everyday and take days off as needed.

@alexislauzon8907,My hypothesis would be  Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) once ingested and metabolize would dissociate in Na and HCO3.     HCO3 in the blood act as a tampon molecule.

@rudysal1429, @alexislauzon8907  I don't think that's how that works. Your blood contains H2CO3 from dissolving CO2 and converting into H2CO3 but acts as a buffer. Usually the more CO2 you have the more acidic your blood will be until it releases it by breathing out.,2년 전,0,
@TheMalteseMisfit,"It is possible to change the pH of your body, albeit not through food which is what I think is alluded to in the podcast you mentioned. In the oncology/haematology setting we have a protocol which requires sodium bicarbonate to be given intravenously to stop methotrexate (an antimetabolite) from crystallising which would hinder it's excretion and cause more damage than necessary. Once the MTX has cleared we stopped giving the sodium bicarbonate.  If it were only to change the pH in the stomach and not the rest of the body, much like other antacids, it would not be effective in preventing acid buildup in muscles.",2년 전,0,

As the system is particularly designed to address those same areas (Signal and Connective tissue in particular relation to joint movements- which Dr Galphin hinted towards as well),2년 전,0,

@keatingmohrman5551,"Hey there Dr. Huberman and team!  Any science out there on eyes open versus eyes closed on lifts and it’s effects on mind/muscle connection geared towards hypertrophy results?   I have heard about the eyesight focus and by looking at the muscles and/or muscles being contracted during exercise, it stimulates better mind muscle connection.   Thought came to mind while benching and I can’t really look and focus on my pecs and other movers used in the exercise. I tried closing my eyes and noticed two things.   1- I had to focus on balance and form as I felt the bars travel path start to drift. Guessing because I didn’t have any visual anchors to orient myself and the weights. I wonder if this created better mind/muscle connection? My anecdotal experience would have me believe, yes but kind of flies against what you and Dr. Galpin discussed.     2- my contraction seemed stronger. Maybe this is also because I moved a bit slower during the movement to help stabilize.   Any ideas?",2년 전,0,

The more important metrics are how much your muscles burn during the workout, how much of a pump you get post-workout, and how sore you are the day after. On a scale of 1 to 10, if you can get at least 3 (5 preferably) for each of these, you’re probably maximizing your potential for hypertrophy.  The only caveats are you have to take it to muscle failure and you need enough rest for the adaptation and protein synthesis to occur.",2년 전,0,

@evrisevr,"Loved this, but Galpin made a comment with respect to squats and deadlifts that has always troubled me. In your early  discussion of push vs pull exercises (and accepting your caveat around technically all exercises being pull) Galpin refers to deadlifts as a pull exercise and squats as a push. If you compare a push up (“push”) and a row (“pull”) I can understand the distinction - the two exercises are mainly working two antagonistic sets of muscles (pectorals + triceps; lats + biceps, respectively). However surely a deadlift and and squat are for all intents and purposes using almost identical muscle groups (glutes, quads and lower back) and are in no sense using antagonistic muscles. Furthermore, while a push up and a row apply a force over a distance (and therefore “do work” in a technical sense) that force is applied in opposite directions. Whereas for squats and deadlifts the force that moves the load over a distance is applied in the same direction (upwards, opposing gravity while the body goes from a bent to a standing position ). Indeed a deadlift applies an upward force through the arms for which there is nothing analogous in the squat, but since the arms remain extended the arm muscles do no work during a deadlift (save for gripping). The major difference I can see between the two exercises is that since the weight is slightly further in front of your center of gravity for a deadlift you need to stick you butt out more in order to balance. That’s it. So how is one a push if the other is a pull. Apologies for the stream of consciousness - I’ve been awake for 30 hours waiting for delayed flights!",3년 전(수정됨),0,
@stephengriffin1541,"Stupid question from an experienced trainer. Is bracing the spine achieved by pushing out core musculature, or pulling it in? I believe (probably incorrectly) that everyone uses the phrase “brace your spine” but description of what this actually involves and how this is achieved is vague. It’s either because it’s so obvious that it is assumed we all know it as experienced trainers or that we all as experienced trainers are a little bit unsure of how it is achieved. 🤔🙂.

@pavlodsgn,"Summary?  Hypertrophy 5 to 30 reps per set (range for variation in training). Need 3 things for muscle growth: pump, burn and soreness afterwards – a bit, not too much (on the scale 1-10 aprox 3 each should be enough, 5 probably better, but don't overdo it). Take it to muscle failure (not to extreme failure), assuming good form. 2-3 times per week per muscle (at least a day rest for a muscle)  Strength 3-5 exercises 3-5 reps 3-5 sets 3-5 mins rest 3-5 times per week. 85+% one-rep max weight (for power 40 to 70%)  Endurance Different ways to train, do throughout the week: - Max heart rate (aprox 220 minus your age), once a week – hardest exercise you can, sprints, intervals, burpees. Aprox 90 secs, 4 to 8 times (plus some warm-up). Challenges whole cardio system – stroke volume, cardiac output, resting heart rate, capillary, pulmonary exchange, etc. Could be done on the same day as your main training (could even improve hypertrophy) - Middle ground, about 80% heart rate. ""Mile repeats"" – run 1 mile (1 km, 800m) for X minutes, rest for X minutes (2 to 6 mins). Increases VO2 Max - Lots of moving, zone 2 cardio – walking, running at talking pace (nose breathing), etc. as much as you can incorporate per week   Breathing  Down-regulation after training and between sets. Box breathing (exhaling to a count of four, holding your lungs empty for a four-count, inhaling at the same pace, and holding air in your lungs for a count of four before exhaling and beginning the pattern anew) or simply breath in and breath out twice as long (e.g. 4 secs and 8 secs respectively)  Muscle-mind connection is a thing: exercise with intention, see your muscles working. Mental awareness – touch your muscle-to-work for better muscle activation, visualise. Learning to activate a muscle group by focusing on eccentric movement (moving a weight away from the body – good for strength and hypertrophy, on avg lead to more soreness)   Don't do cold therapy after hypertrophy training (might kill your gains bruh). Before is good (adrenaline burst and warms your muscles) or just wait about 4 hours / do on other days. After endurance is fine, strength training is not clear. Mostly considers cold water emersion and cryotherapy, not as much as cold shower (not as effective, so not as big of concern for ""gains"") Heat exposure after any kind of training is beneficial considering good hydration and good in general",3년 전(수정됨),1,

@angrypirate1094,"On a cold Friday afternoon, I had come home from school. I had been thinking of the gym all day. I was hungry, didn't have any lunch. In fact, I didn't eat because I spent the money. For the past month I was saving up for something. Something special which I bought at GNC. I was surprised they didn't ask for ID; I was pretty sure the cashier noticed how nervous I was. Anyways, my mom asked my how my day was when I got home, but I ignored her. I have more important things to do. I run to the bathroom and unpack my bag. In my school bag is a white plastic bag from GNC. I open the bag, first removing the receipt and flushing it down the toilet to get rid of the evidence. My heart was racing now. I unpack the creatine monster from the bag.  I wonder what people will be asking me when they see that I will be 50lbs heavier. Should I say I was just eating a lot? I remove the label from the tub and tear it into a thousand small pieces. I flush that down the toilet, too. It is time now. I run up to my room when my mom ask me what I am holding. I panic, sweat drips down my forehead and my teeth chatter. ""Mom, it's just for a school project"". ""What project?"" ""I don't know mom I just started it!"". A tear runs down my cheek. I run upstairs and open the creatine, scooping upservings into a clear water bottle. What have I gotten myself into? I fill it with water and drink it. There is no turning back now. The creatine monster is inside me now, it will control me. What should I do if I die? I cant let my family know about this.  I open the creatine tub and throw it all out the window; a white cloud of mysterious dust sparkles into the wind so graciously. I feel the substance taking control of me; I am now the monster. I walk downstairs, its time to work out; time to get big. Now I worry, I don't want to get too big; people will think I use steroids. I do use steroids. No I don't. Creatine. All I see is the weights now, I am almost downstairs when I hear ""Do you want a cookie I just baked"". I know I do not have time for this ** now.

@theMSKphysio,"@@hubermanlab - re your lower back pain, you should try some of the lower back and abdominal endurance tests and peak force tests. You might find some variables to work on here. A nice encompassing reference for normative values is here: DOI - 10.3390/app11209518  Two potential mechanisms for your relief from doing distal work at the neck and shin muscles. 1)  likely increasing load tolerance through synergistic sagittal biased muscles. 2) your injury history may indicate the need to address something in these regions i.e. loss of normal joint range or coordination with nearby regions e.g. an ankle sprain that cannot pronate with knee flexion and hip internal rotation leading to increased eccentric load through the back during single leg landing.  Desensitization work is definitely relevant and absolutely a variable during a training program. Specific impairments need to be found though! It is then the combination of desensitising those impairments as you rehab them. General exercise will increase your pain threshold but the recurrence of your low back pain indicates there is likely still an impairment somewhere in the chain.   Some thoughts :)",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@christopherbehrens6315,Your discussion on sodium bicarb is very interesting. It made me think about the Bohr Effect on oxygen dissociation though.

I think it would be interesting to see RCTs on workouts with bicarb or alkaline water on performance.,3년 전,0,

@guppiefang,"I have questions about the 5-30 reps, to failure, for hypertrophy. First, the experience of failing at 5-10 vs failing at 30 is way different. So I doubt it's doing the same thing to the muscle, but I didn't hear them talk about the difference, biologically. I suppose I'll just try to just mix it up. Is the difference described anywhere? Second: it is very hard fail at 30, right? I mean with the lighter weight, I can usually keep going but it burns like hell. And a tiny pause between reps can give the muscle enough recovery to keep going. So ""failure"" becomes more of a mental choice - ""I can't take it any more"". So I guess to fail at 30 requires more mental discipline and exactness in how you do the reps, so this is why you usually see the 8-12 recommendation?",3년 전,0,

I would say that Galpin is overall correct to about 90% maybe. There are a few things here and there that I know he is either missing  or just simply wrong i would say..

Meaning you HAVE to split your workouts into 2 or even 3 sessions per week if you want to hit the 10-15 set per  muscle/week. Edit: maybe he meant muscleGROUP?

@1Wendy_Woo,"As someone who went through full menopause, naturally, at age 45 I am still searching for answers. The process left me with unexplained weight gain that kept coming, hypothyroidism, and severe adrenal fatigue. Exercise, let alone stairs, or showering, exhausts me. I eat whole foods, take cold showers, fast, etc. But the heat here in FL., and my once-beloved sun, does me in. I cannot be outside for very long. And sweating is a primary issue. I would love to have my outdoor activities back (ie: biking, kayaking, swimming, walking,) but this kind of heat does not feel safe at all. I am 56 now and my once disciplined physique (through professional dance, and practicing/teaching yoga [Asana, pranayama, dhyana] for 24+ years) has transformed into a blob of fat that just will not budge. I drink water. Take my supplements. TRY to sleep. *sleep has been a struggle since 2009 ~ prior, I never had trouble sleeping and my body usually got 9-10 hours  I truly despise what my own body has become. It feels like the biggest betrayal.   I keep reading and listening in hopes of something working. Thanks for all you do.   *gaining strength after forcing yourself to be more sedentary because your adrenals are tanked would be something I want to learn, because safety is a huge concern",3년 전,0,

@brettalexander5585,"I wonder if doing higher reps is better in a cardio sense for losing weight. I'm just now starting to lift again for the first time in like 3yrs after being a couch Potatoe. I just started doing cardio as in just walking and dropped 81lbs through that and Diet. Saddly the highest I ever got up to was 381. Currently I've been stuck at 295-300 range for quite some time even while increasing cardio intensity and adding in lifting again. My problem the gym I'm working with right now is my apartment gym. Although it's not the worst gym When it comes to more compound or heavy lifting muscle exercises and groups I'm going to quickly outgrow my little gym here soon. I'm 1 month in and I've already regained some of my strength when I used to workout 3 years ago. I had lost weight in the past and gone from 315ish to 200lb in 5.5 months and then another 3months to 175-180ish where I kept it off for an number of years until gaining even more back to where I'm at now. At my little gym there is no bench press and dumbells are capped at 50lbs. I've had to use a short/(ez type) bar that's not Olympic length. More like 4-5.5 feet. It works as far as benching pressing. The heaviest those goes is about 110lbs so It's quickly becoming unchallenging again now that I'm putting more muscle back on or just regaining some prior stength. Right now I'm just focusing on doing cardio along with lifting sessions so like 30 min before hand and then lifting sessions of like 30-45min, mostly because I'm just trying to keep my heart rate up so right now the light weight I suppose is good for that cardio aspect. However now I end up just 'running the rack' and doing a drop set heavy to light or vice versa for 6 working sets. Usually 20, 18, 15, 12, 8 going light to heavy or the other way around. I'm wondering if I should just increase my reps the stronger I get. I will prob have to rejoin my older gym here soon but am trying to maximize being right near this little gym where no one ever is for as long as I can. I wonder if I should maybe start increasing reps. Same sorta goes for body squats although 110lb bar right now feels fine since I still am 300lb but and my own body weight at 5'8 is contributing to the workout. What would you guys do?",3년 전,0,

@rogerdane3253,"Mike Mentzer! Wow... wasn't he the first to get a 100% rating at the Olympia? Anyway, Dr Galpin, just a great presentation here with Dr Huberman. In my lifting time, never professional and really mostly for strength, I have trained next to or with people like Bill Pearl, Chris Dickerson,  Beyerly, Dennis Tinerino, Dave Johns, many lifters and B/Bs of the '70s. Learned a lot of good and probably some bad... YOUR presentation is so rock solid and so much so due to your excellent research and the type. ONE area that is not much covered (anywhere) is the aged athlete/lifter with ""injury"". Probably a smaller percentage but not those who suffer 'just' from osteoarthritis but joint replacement, joint immobility, severe damage from time past that has also created the arthritis. For instance, my lower body is damaged due an accident and I have very limited mobility in one ankle, squats are really hard but to make it worse, I have a left leg injury in the knee (neither replaced). So we have to figure out how to train these muscles, endure the discomfort and hopefully aid the bodily function and not do damage. Your suggestions are obviously usable in these scenarios but I wonder if there are any specialty suggestions (besides, 'don't fall over'!)  Great information, thank you so much.",3년 전,0,

@wellnesspathforme6236,"Dr. Galpin, thank you for sharing your time and insights!  However, your mispronunciation of eccentric validates your claim you were a gym rat early on. it is ehk-sen-trik.  The first ""c"" is hardened by the ""c"" that follows, and the second ""c"" is softened by the ""e"" that follows.  I highly recommend The Logic of English book as a family heirloom. Also, look into the importance of bio-copper to cellular energy production.  The ""chrome"" in cytochrome c oxidase refers to the color the copper brings to the enzyme.  All anti-oxidant enzymes, the real anti-oxidant work horses, are powered by copper delivered via its transport protein ceruloplasmin. It also happens to be the most sophisticated protein/enzyme in the human body with 1046 amino acids and up to 8 coppers.  It also expresses as ferro-oxidase to flip ferrous iron in cells to ferric iron, which enable ferritin to remove the iron from the cells and prevent tissue buildup of potentially reactive iron stores. Cu is absolutely critical to the produ tion of Mg-ATP, the true energy currency of the cell, and NPK fertilizer has neither.",3년 전,0,

@rmp705,"Hey Dr Huberman or some random person reading this. I really enjoy the podcast. One thing ive kinda thought about is your research talks a lot about “normal” people and I say that because I am a seasonal worker. I am a raft guide, I work outside I live pretty minimally and enjoy what I do. But there is those days that things are off and then all of a sudden the summer is over and its winter and seasonal depression can hit. I have ton of friends half way through each season crying they want the other season to happen and sometimes not really appreciating the season we are in.Is there a group or place or person that studies this? Will someone study this? Would you study this or talk about this or um I don’t know exactly but is there anything to be learned? There is no problem I do not “need help” but I think it would be really cool to have some solid research or studies to point people to when things happen. I want someone to study us as funny as that sounds. If this sounds like its not written well, um it is but isn’t I have been thinking of writing this for a while but its so hard to put into words things I do not know how to ask or say. But I think there is something here and would be more than willing to talk to someone over the phone answer questions. I would like to help all of us realize what the negatives actually are and help people and my self eventually.Thank you for your time and hope hear back from someone",3년 전,0,

So for instance doing a focused 5-day squat program to increase strength and then training for hypertrophy for another body part, making sure to get 48-72 hours of rest for those muscle groups and staying in a caloric surplus.   Would it be possible to do the above-mentioned and get good results in both strength and hypertrophy for the respective body parts?  An example of a program could be a push pull upper body split + 5 day strength squat program:  Day 1: upper body pull + squat strength Day 2: upper body push + squat strength Day 3: sqaut strength Day 4: upper body pull Day 5: upper body push + squat strength Day 6: squat strengh  Day 7: rest",3년 전,0,

A question, progressive overload , or even formal exercise is not a cultural norm in Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece, and Loma Linda, California or Okinawa collectively known as the Blue Zones.   These populations have the best rates of health in terms of quantity and quality of health ever measured. No 300lbs bench presses  or marathon runners  in sight. Norms of movement are walking , gardening etc none of which get harder progressively   Is progressively making exercise harder or at least novel needed for a long healthy life?   I am agnostic on this topic. For context I am a ACE certified trainer and a psychotherapist trained in clinical psychology. I am alos a PhD student in Health Sciences   My take  (not advice) is progressive overload does have benefits, with that said if one gets in 150 minutes a week of brisk, bit difficult to talk level walking , dancing, biking  (Zone 2 exercise). This along with maintaining  good strength, muscle mass and bone density  via minimal amount of compound movements. This can be done in less than 20 minutes a week. Progressive efforts are optional but may offer benefits and come with risks.   All best, Matthew Velissaris, MA, LPC, CPT",3년 전,0,

@austinheyman,"9 points of improvement: Skill Speed Power (Speed x Strength) Strength Hypertrophy Muscular Endurance Anaerobic Endurance VO2 Max (3 - 12 min, Zone 5) Long Duration Endurance (30 min+)  Modifiable Variables: Choice of Exercise (Muscle Groups, Compound vs Isolated) Intensity (% of 1RM or a specific Cardio Zone) Volume (Reps x Sets) Rest Intervals Frequency (Days per week)  Type of Progression and Overload (All of the above variables) is the first question after finding default: - Default: All joints through Full ROM  Balance push and pull, vertical and horizontal.  Beginners should balance all Modifiable Variables   Always build up to your working set over the first 3 - 4 sets (especially for high intensity)  Hypertrophy and anaerobic conditioning affect the most physiological systems  Determining Rest and Frequency: Hypertrophy: Lower frequency, high volume and sufficient rest are the drivers - Sarcoplasmic or Contractile, rest is required for protein synthesis - 48 - 72 hours rest to allow protein synthesis  - Faster recovery can lead to higher frequency - 10 working sets per muscle group per week MINIMUM (15 - 20 or more is ideal) - High reps (5 -  30) - Drivers include a combination of metabolic stress, mechanical tension, muscular damage  Skill, Speed, Power, or Strength: Unlimited frequency, intensity is the driver - these progressions are happening independently of muscle size/hypertrophy through nervous system changes, muscle efficiency, and connective tissue efficiency, so can be trained more often (even daily) - 2 days a week is sufficient, 3 is better - Low reps (3 - 5), 75% -  85% of 1RM  Gauging Workout Difficulty: 1. Can I feel the muscle working 2. Do I feel a pump during and after 3. How sore am I These parameters should be close to a 5/10 perceived effect or greater  3 x 5 Rule for Power, Strength, Speed: - 3 - 5 exercises - 3 - 5 reps - 3 - 5 minutes rest in between  - 3 - 5 sets - 3 - 5 days per week (Frequency) - Choose 3 on weaker days, 5 on stronger days - Choose higher intensity for more strength (75% - 85% 1RM) - less intensity for speed or power (40% - 70%)  Intention during a workout: - Focus your efforts appropriately - For speed/power: The intent to move is more important than the volume moved - Be intentional and present   Eccentric overload can help target hard to reach muscles - Maintain control during concentric, eccentric, and isometric contracting to practice individual muscle control  Maintaining intradominal pressure during breathing is the ultimate goal - 1 rep exercises may not require any breathing - Maintain breathing during eccentric or lowering portion of a lift, exhale during concentric portion  Breathing to calm the body post-workout will help with recovery - Different patterns recover low O2 or high CO2  - Fast inhale followed by slow exhale (exhale double the time) (4 x 8 sec) - Box breathing works too (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 sec)  Endurance: When pushing to fatigue, focus on concentric work (stationary bike, swimming, rowing, sled push, running and walking uphill) - Progress volume slowly if doing eccentrics (running on flat or downhill, box jumps)  When concurrently training: Endurance training may effect strength gains, but strength/power training will not effect endurance gains - Strength training will almost always benefit endurance training  Aerobic endurance: At least 1 day a week, Zone 5 for as long as you can (30+ sec) for 1 - 8 sets - Start with 1 - 2 sets, 1 day a week - Build to 4 - 8 sets, 2 - 4 days/2 weeks - Always warm up before reaching 100% effort - Always down regulate breathing after  Zone 4 for 4 - 12 min     - Can be broken up into two intervals (Two 2 - 6 minute bouts) with equal parts work/rest  Muscular Endurance: - Type I Muscle and Type II  Optimal Hydration: - Bodyweight in lbs/2 gives oz per day of water - Consume 125% - 150% of the amount you lost in water after workout - Example: 2lbs = 32oz x 125% = 40oz  Optimal Salt Intake: - 500mg - 750mg before and after - 2mg/kg Bodyweight every 15 - 20 min (Bodyweight lbs divided by 30 gives you oz of sodium) - If you loose 1% or more of your bodyweight, start supplementing  Cold exposure: - Avoid after workout for hypertrophy - Wait at least 4 hours after working out (after gene expression calms down)  Hot exposure: - Everyone should do it  Recovery: We want to increase stress as much as possible AND to recover from that, to maximize adaptation/change Choose modifiable variables that maximize stress on proper systems and minimize stress on all other systems Find your limiting factor (“performance anchors”) - this will increase recovery capacity and adaptation where you want it Track your recovery factors - Grip strength - HRB - Force plate  - Tap test (CNS) Track your progress",2년 전,42,

They only want to work with the top 1%, and you will only be wasting their time if you’re not in that demographic. So, in other words, if you’re a low middle class peasant that would like to try out their systems, wake up. They don’t want you. Also, in their questionnaire, they asks if you’re financially capable of paying for 6-12 months of coaching, but their website doesn’t tell you how much it costs. My bet is that it’s no less than $5k per month.",3년 전,0,

@matrinezkevin11492,1:26:20 That style of focus on eccentric abduction of the scapula was what really helped me build a better mind-muscle connection with my lats myself. I did it mostly with one armed high cable rows and used my off hand to reach across my chest and feel the lat and really try and visualize the rhomboids between my shoulder blades and the lats outside of them moving away from my body and trying to just control a more moderate weight with just contraction of my scapula.

@NotaNazgul,"@Andrew Huberman Thank you so much! I love your podcast and learn a f*ck-ton from every single one. Hence I like recommending them to curious friends. To give you also some nitty-gritty points for improvement from my personal view: - I have a feeling that some podcasts could be an hour shorter with the same value. Some deep-dives or repetitions don't feel helpful for me. On the other hand, some deep-dives and summaries are pure gold, so I would not be able to tell you what to remove up-front. Sorry ;) - You sometimes rephrase sentences to be more accurate. That disturbs me more than it helps me. But maybe that is just your immutable inner scientist - and i value him a lot.  Also, I would love some podcasts from more controversial or interpretative perspectives. People/topics that form studies into broader ideas, even if that is not profound yet. Especially regarding health. I am getting a feeling that health science is feeling a-ok with just delivering some studies, because well, they get funded for it and nobody can attack you if you stick to the known ways. ""Dear patient, just wait and suffer another 20 years. Nono, that illness and treatment is just a theory. Why change your diet now - if BigPharma will have a new daily pill for that issue soon?!"" Thousands of studies each year, burning health crisies in our countries, and nobody officially dares to tell the people ""Before you do nothing, do Pranayama and fast. It seems to help!"" When you recently interviewed that breath scientist, I acutally became really desparate listening, since I was looking forward to some deeper Pranayama insights for years. ""are you looking into thousands of years of yoga pranayama medicine and getting to the scientific roots of that?"" ""No. Actually, we are just funding a huge machine that goes ""bing"" and we will do 5 years of 7th-level-details-research while the USA population is drowning in stress symptoms and problematic psychopharmaca."" That was very revelatory to me. We seem to need that extremely patient scientific love to detail for later breakthroughs.

While it is true that the body will fire slow twitch fibers first, the problem is when those slow twitch fibers become fatigued. I haven't found a good answer to this but it seems counter intuitive to think that the body wouldn't recruit fast twitch muscle fibers after the slow twitch fibers were fatigued. What I'm getting at is that you could build strength in a higher rep range (albeit not maximally) and thus a range where it's less likely to injure yourself or if you are already injured and can't lift heavy, you can take advantage of the strength gains. It really just doesn't make sense that the body would adapt in a way that it would be so inefficient to just not use fast twitch fibers when the slow twitch fibers were exhausted.",3년 전,0,

@ruslanfattakhov1582,"To ECFMG From doctors and medical students of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.  On the 31st of March 2022, on International Doctor’s Day, ECFMG has banned for an unknown period of time  all Russian doctors, based on their citizenship, and nationality from taking USMLE exams and obtaining an ECFMG certificate which is needed for applying to US residency. Interestingly,  we found out about this decision by accident. One of our fellow colleagues had a call to solve routine questions regarding their application and found out that his documents are no longer processed because of his Russian citizenship. ECFMG representatives later confirmed their decision and added that they will not publicly announce it on their website or social media.  We are not able to pay, or register for the exams USMLE Step 1 or USMLE CK. Those who have already passed these steps will not be able to go through any ECFMG certification pathways. That means that the absolute majority of Russian citizens won’t be able to take USMLE exams at all, without exemptions. This ban applies even for Russians with dual citizenship, even if it is Ukrainian or US, Russians who have political asylum in the US or any other country and even for foreign citizens, who currently reside in Russia. Ban is based solely on our citizenship and national origin, not on our personal choice, beliefs or actions taken during these tough political times.  Years of hard work we put into studying medicine, self improving and preparing for medical residency in the US are ruined by this quiet decision of ECFMG officials. Our work has simply been portrayed as unimportant, all due to political issues that we, in fact, have no control over.  Throughout the last month we have signed numerous petitions against this war, putting ourselves at risk. Please, take pity on us, we are simple doctors, looking to practice medicine and save lives in peace.  It’s a discrimination of Russian citizens based on country of origin.

@coachchara,"@ruben I am 55 and I am still getting faster. Same protocol like you.   Strength training (Calisthenics) and sprinting.   To not slow down your functionality or to slow down the process of slowing down, movement patterns are important! High functionality. Stress free ligament usage.   90% of everything that is taught classical is wrong. It starts with the way your feet hit the ground. How you generate force and propel yourself forward. If you use your front chain or back muscle chain.  The other huge parameter is nutrition. You have to get rid of all that BS that is lowcarb, keto and all the other nonsense that just adds stress on your body.   If you lose your carb tolerance and your caloric tolerance, your metabolism is already in a downward spiral.   Regenration can’t work as it should. Ageing is basically a slowing down of metabolism. The worst thing you can do is to slow it down additionally with excessive endurance tracking and moronic diet fads (keto, lowcarb) and pseudo anti aging theories like people like Sinclair spread to sell sell their useless supps.   You are basically a bunch of cells . Quite a few. Trillions of them. All of them produce energy. Imagine it like a science experiment where you are slightly off with the parameters or ingredients needed. It won’t work as it could.   Mineral balance, avoidance of some extremely detrimental fatty acids and most important running on glucose will keep your metabolism high and regenration at max.   I combine a very high carb, natural sugar diet with intermittent fasting. So I get the best of  both worlds without programming starvation (like keto and lowcarb do).  At 55 I felt never stronger, younger and faster. I average 4.000 calories every day in a four hour window and keep low bodyfat levels constantly all year long. I don’t train high volume. Inhabe quite a high frequency. But I don’t train a high volume.  Keto, lowcarb and all the other snake oil  will slow you down, will slow down your metabolism and decrease your functionality and regeneration.   If you want to dig deeper, have a look at the work of Ray Peat. The smartest physiologist among all of them. He understands cell metabolism.   Don’t let yourself be fooled by studies that prove that putting worms in a lethargic shock, by starving them, makes them „live“ longer.  They literally slow down their function. Massively. Life extension on chronic caloric deficit is a hoax.   If you are a grown man, who is physically active  and eat less than 3.000 calories your metabolism is basically already trash. Of course you will lose strength and get slower in the following years.   So many people have wrecked their metabolism (and call it „effective“). I have coached very large male individuals who could not lose weight and sustained body weight on basically starvation diets.   The spectrum is really wide. Metabolism is highly adaptive. You want to keep it high to have max regeneration, to improve even at a higher age.   I started running two years ago. Because i was most of my life obese i started late.   After wasting time with endurance running and trashing my feet and ligaments with wrong movement patterns I paused for a while and restarted with new movement patterns.   Today i don’t even stretch anymore. I only sprint and run fast miles. Running is fun. Without all that usual mobility drills and chronic pain that most runners suffer.  I increased in a few months my top sprint speed to 27 km/h. My goal is to reach 30 km/h before I turn 60 years and keep it for as long as possible. My anaerobic power is quite high. I love distances like 200 meters. Or the high power needed in uphill sprints. With these low volume training methods I have achieved a 7 minute mile while completely nose breathing at a heart rate of 155.   The important thing is to never be injured. I never pulled a hamstring or adductor since I changed my movement patterns. Running back chain dominant and sprinting barefoot.   This has changed everything for me. This and also getting rid of the lowcarb snake oil (which gives you a weak sleep, low testosterone, weaker thyorid function and a lot more dysfunctionality. Been there, done that. For quite a few years.",3년 전(수정됨),2,

@ChrisProuse,"Great conversation, but the stuff about building endurance he metioned… “if you’re at the pace where you can have a conversation - to me I don’t count that as exercise” is really outdated, particularly when you consider what the world’s leading Olympic endurance athletes are actually doing. Yes, you can build some endurance by pushing your upper thresholds and VO2 max at higher heart rates, but the benefit to your VO2 max plateaus quite quickly after a couple of weeks. More recent understanding and what the world’s leading Olympic endurance athletes are actually using is what’s called “high-volume, low-heart rate” training, where the overwhelming majority of their workouts are well below their lactate threshold turning points, and they can hold a conversation - you just have to do a lot of it in order to train that base aerobic capacity, and avoid releasing the stress hormones that arrive when lactic acid levels get too high. There are almost linear benefits to that type of training all the way up to 35 hours per week. Dr. Maffetone and the “MAF” method are similar to “high-volume, low-heart rate” or “polarized” training where the overwhelming majority is in zone 1, a little bit in zone 3, but almost none in zone 2… because if you’re always pushing your upper thresholds, then you’re applying the wrong stimulus to what your base aerobic system needs to build it more overtime, in order to increases much more cardiac stroke volume and VO2 max over time. Lookup Dr Stephen Seiler’s research, or look into what the Norwegian triathlon team is doing to win gold and set Ironman records. Sports scientists are finding athletes can also recover more easily from high-volume low-heart rate training, and doing the bulk of it in that low intensity zone greatly reduces injury too. The old “no-pain, no-gain” / go push your thresholds at tempo pace every time you do cardio stuff is outdated dogma, which has limited benefit if you care about building actual endurance.",3년 전,9,

Obviously no one can do it all, but where is the best bang for my buck and why? What if the goal is not ""optimising"", it's just getting by? How do I know what my goal should be? It would be great to see a synoptic episode where you make sense of how some of the protocols from your episodes trade off against each other depending on your goal and what factors should shape what you should prioritise if you are time/resource constrained.

@ChrisProuse," @jacklauren9359  - I can’t think of any good reasons why an MMA fighter wouldn’t want a higher VO2 max. After training with the correct stimulus to their underlying aerobic system as mentioned above, the Norwegian triathlete’s can also maintain near sprint level paces for several minutes that would leave others gasping for air and feeling the lactic acid burn. Their lactic acid levels remain relatively low and they experience less cardiac drift over repeated bouts. If you’re any athlete who feels the “burn”, increasing your VO2 will stave that off for longer and contribute to less fatigue / buildup of lactic acid in the muscle.",3년 전,2,
@eliteboxfitness,"Thanks for sharing. With the benefits on mitochondria and aerobic base that zone 2 provides as well as fat oxidation, you mentioned very little work is done in zone 2, the research suggest the wolrd class cyclisst amonst endurance athektes are utilising zone 2 80 percent of the time.

@MasoNowa," @dietzyfly  I don't want to get into it too much, but all of the research i have ever been able to find shows that hormones do not strongly influence the basics of training.

Many people will try to over complicate fitness to sell you a product but humans are humans no matter the gender. I believe if anyone followed the information laid out in this podcast they'd see success.

@alshaifhir,"Fantastic discussion. I'd really love to know more about body recomposition. This episode was great for learning about hypertrophy and general conditioning, but what about maximal fat loss? I've been experimenting with extended fasts every couple of months and would love to know how to maximize fat oxidation and upregulate metabolism. It would seem intuitive that those with more body fat would initially burn the most fat during an extended fast, but as you become leaner the body would downregulate and potentially sacrifice other tissue (muscle, etc). Is there any data around when this happens and how to tell? Are there any protocols for high or low intensity workouts and resistance training to maximize muscle growth/sparing while burning the most fat? Any protocols for how long to fast based on your current body fat %? Could there be a canonical protocol to follow which starts you at an arbitrarily high body fat % and takes you through to a goal? Is there a theoretical optimum amount of body fat to target when considering health, aesthetics, and hormone levels? Thanks!",3년 전,1,

@robertofilipe8605,"I didn't get it. He said  ""do 20 sets of between 5 to 30 reps per week for hypertrophy""  Per exercise people usually do 3 or 4 sets per exercise, like dumbbell chest press. 3 sets of 12 and 10 and 8 reps.  So Doing like 7 exercises per week per muscle? If you do 3 sets per exercise for hypertrophy? That seems like very little volume",3년 전,0,
@isaiahbucur," @robertofilipe8605  Yeah I do significantly more sets and volume with very little rest and I've been getting amazing gains.  But it's also the true that I stay sore  for like almost a week.  But honestly my best advice is to just mix it up.  Lifting heavier requires you to do more sets to get s pump/ even feel like you're doing anything   So do as many as you can until failure.. As long as you reach failure for for 1 or 2 of your working sets you should see progress. Usually I go far beyond failure which is why I take forever to recover, but if you can afford to go almost every day then you can split that intensity each day to where you can get more volume overall.   I think there are some studies that suggest that volume isn't the best driver however, it's almost better to get quality working quality workouts then filler workouts  You can check out the Muscle PhD, they've got a lot of quality content based on studies and their own tests",3년 전,0,

Eat LOTS of starchy carbs a.s.a.p. after muscle-building exercise! Don't overdo your muscle building exercise! Just enough to feel the burn and the muscle pumped nicely.

@AgendaInMind,"Most of the more severe illnesses happen to people by surprise, unexpectantly, impacting first in the brain, then in the corresponding organ which that part of the brain controls. The end of WWI had absolutely everything to do with the Flu and lung TB outbreak that occurred killing millions. In nature, the biological conflict linked with a territorial fear (just what it means—a fear in your territory, your home, your community, etc.) is a widening of the bronchia (tissue loss). Your body attempts to widen your bronchia in order to allow more air into your lungs to give you more strength and energy to fight to keep your territory safe. Stay with me.......The biological conflict linked with a death fright impacts the lungs. The lungs attempt to grow larger in order to allow more air in because breath equals life, as we all know. No breath equals death.    While you are in the fear or death fright conflict, you notice no symptoms of “disease”, except you have cold hands, cold feet, you can’t sleep, you awaken at 3 AM every night, you have little appetite. During the war, millions of people were in fear of the bombing of their homes and cities where the war was most active. Fearing for their lives, their loved ones in the war, their ability to survive. The food in the stores was sparse due to shortages. This lasted for 4 long years! The longer the conflict, the worse the healing phase. Within 2 weeks of the German Chancellor announcing the end of WWI, these millions of people ALL went into the healing phase all at the same time. It is during the healing phase that you experience symptoms of illness! What is the healing phase of the bronchia widening? Severe bronchitis, pneumonia. The body attempts to refill this lost tissue and you experience inflammation, fever, coughing, body aches, fatigue, etc. What is the healing phase of the extra lung tissue that grew? Decomposing of the tissue by TB bacteria and fungi. The symptoms of this healing phase are: severe coughing up of blood and tissue, fever, inflammation, severe mucous, body aches, fatigue. During this decomposing of the extra tissue (tumor), the body expels a lot of protein, and without replenishment, severe protein loss can result in death. Antibiotics did not exist yet. If TB bacteria does not exist in a person or they have been vaccinated against TB (big mistake), then the tumor will simply encapsulate and become dormant and not harm you. Who died during the Spanish Flu? Mainly the poor who could not afford to buy meat and proper nourishment, and the people who were directly impacted by the bombings and destruction of their homes.    Millions of people suffered fear and death frights during the fighting of WWI, and millions of people all went into healing at the end of it. Not everyone was affected because not everyone suffered the same way.    It’s not a “flu”, it’s not something you “catch”. It’s biological, meaningful, and unavoidable. One hundred years later, a Fear Campaign begins, using the media to spread it......",3년 전,0,

So I’m just going to put ALL of my energy into everything motion and health science. Deeply appreciate this podcast. My love for running is why I want to do this.

Sir plzz make a dedicated podcast for 18 to 25 year old youngsters relating to how to be more productive. 🙏🙏🙏 Thanks a lot for all becoz i have had a really tough time in the past with phone addiction.

@the____echoes,Creatine monohydrate is the Micheal Jordan of all supplements. Stimulants like headphones is detrimental in overall productivity in gym. The primary drive of strength is intensity not the volume.  Power= Strength* Speed  Training frequency is crucial 💯. The primary driver of hypertrophy is not the same as the primary driver of strength....that's intensity driven.  Choose strength training 🦾 should be 5 rep per set or less range. Much more grateful to Sir Andy for beautiful insights and Andrew sir. Much love from India 💚🇮🇳. These thoughts will be helpful in my fitness journey ❤,3년 전,2,

Bc  I just have been of course my own m.d and can take care of the lows life hands you and know why and how to addresse it, know when to just take time out and have developed also the financial health to afford the luxury of time out(no trust fund here) to step back analyze, develope a strategy, then implement,  always take notes, then a year out compare those notes, they can be mental notes and on to the next chapter I took pandemic time out myself to take inventory reset and reboot, so you are absolutely on the right track, this is a habit that has served me very well for 2 decades.

@alexacacio8325," @Siveth-ff3jy  If you're replying to me, I'm doing wonderful now and I'm just picking up the slack from the past 12 months.   I figured out I want to get a finance degree at my university instead of Environmental Engineering cause I love investing so much (obsessed). But if anyone out there is dealing w/ depression trust me when I say IT GETS BETTER. Don't physically hurt yourself and obtain self-destructive behavior.   Currently, I do have an agenda on my Ipad that I use just to put my thoughts onto something so I don't forget it.
