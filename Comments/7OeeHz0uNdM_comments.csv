Trump's mental instability isn't just a spectacle—it's a ticking time bomb. His erratic behavior and impulsive decisions have made the U.S. a global laughingstock, and worse, a target for exploitation. Ruthless leaders like Putin are not just observing this chaos—they are actively capitalizing on it. Putin's smirk is a calculated one, born from the knowledge that he is manipulating a mentally unfit leader to destabilize the U.S. and advance his own sinister agenda.  The truly evil figures surrounding Trump are well aware of his mental fragility, and they are weaponizing it to further their own power and influence. These enablers are not just complicit—they are architects of a strategy that uses Trump's instability to dismantle democratic norms, erode international alliances, and sow discord both at home and abroad. They are exploiting his weaknesses, feeding him delusions, and steering him toward decisions that benefit authoritarian regimes and undermine global stability. This is not just a failing of leadership; it is a deliberate, calculated betrayal of American values and global security, with Trump as the unwitting puppet, dancing to the strings of those who see his presidency as a tool for their own dark purposes.",1년 전,1,

I ask because so often his supporters say they love him because he’s a business man. In truth he only made money pretending to be a billionaire on a reality tv show. Then he made more as the president! This should be brought up every time they say he’s a business man and that’s why they support him. His business acumen is one of the easiest things to debunk.,1년 전,0,

His base has eroded a little bit but apparently these folks don't care if what he's done is illegal. some of them think he handed the power over this country to the 'military'. that biden was president but is dead. that biden never was president. that there is an actor as biden. they will say all of these things in one breath, contradicting themselves.  PS.  a handful of us military veterans went to protest 'general' john flynn in Norwood a few months ago. In august the GOP forced a special election trying to change the Ohio consitution. They set up at a park in Norwood, lying to the local residents that they were putting on a concert. I haven't seen footage of our tiny but powerful protest; could be because the 10 of us shouted at Mike Flynn the whole time he was on stage; that NONE of the audio was useful.",1년 전,0,

The Red states were among the most and lowest educational levels in the nation. His words from his February 2016 speech in Vegas, “I love the poorly educated” is biting his backside. His supporters have researched him and find him wanting…they are leaving him by thousands! They are researching his lies and threats.

You can't start a independent trade union, you can only join the CCPs private union. Private companies exist in China and the rest are state owned. (State ownership and Communism are not the same thing) They have currency and national borders. They don't have elections which means you can't have political parties defined by class instead of ideology. Dissent is illegal so that means that the working class has no voice. Those are all the opposite of Communism. Can anyone explain how they are Communist? Because I've heard People who claim to be Communists praise China. I just don't get it",2년 전,2,

@lylatessofficial,"I love this guy.  You crawl intro the cluster of love for Trump and hate for anyone else including but not limited to Hilary Clinton  24:00 this is the truth. Trump IS the swamp and he detests these loyal people who I will no longer judge or measure their patriotism. Forget all that. Until these fans know exactly how little what THEY need and want means to their almighty Trump, until then these folks are locked in.  Can we draw a comparison with the religious fervor that had people drinking poison for their leader? I’m not sure it’s that lethal and self destructive. These folks aren’t the ones who attacked Capitol police or used the offices of Congress as restroom’s right? These aren’t the proud boys or the oath keepers (wow what an oxymoron… oath keepers? Who defy the oath of office like their fearful panicked leader does ..? Do they ever listen to facts and insert these into their adamant denial of any wrongdoing? Do they look impartially at any of the facts that come from Trump’s own mouth. That cannot be attributed to the left wing media that Trump attacks because they’ve refused to suppress what they uncover or sometimes are handed by Trump himself. Is this the only alternative to the Democratic party that they obviously hate. But an ex Democrat who went to Hilary Clinton’s daughter’s wedding, who hasn’t met a principle he hasn’t dumped the moment its creed interfered with his self interest? This is your hero huh? Your man who evaded military service on a lie of white privileged bone spurs? Not saying other candidates weren’t guilty of the same desertion but they don’t parade themselves around like macho patriot. Yeah a patriot when it’s lucrative to be.  He cares more about Putin’s opinion of him than he does about every single American. He’s a phony. Even his hate is calculated to make him money.  That’s Trump   A sick man who in the private sector sued anyone who looked at him and then whines like a baby about useless dishonest lawsuits.  He’s a walking vulgarity on America a stain that brands us as purposely ill informed purposely oblivious to the facts that indeed highlight their their man as the absolute worst president we’ve ever had worst on paper and worst on the civil rights we fought decades that he tried to destroy in one dreadfully dismal term. Absolutely dismal to see my fellow Americans so ill informed about the seedy man he really is. And universal healthcare by the way lady IS socialism your stupidity is what Trump banks on.  That’s how he feels about the Americans like you who he leads around like sheep.  Brainwashed by the media? Oh dear take a look at how brainwashed it is to believe a loser won an election. Listen to yourselves at 56:01 just hear the warped logic you embrace.  Please wake up or move to Russia because that’s whose propaganda you guys are absorbed and regurgitating on videos like this I don’t think I can watch it anymore I think it’s made me sick and these people are very sad and very pathetic.

@VagueMemory,Obviously this is edited and only shows the dumbest people. Ther are countless videos that show the exact same thing being done with liberal / sjw / democrats and only showing the highlights. It is easy to interview a large number of people with the large majority being intelligent and sensible but make it look as if they are all idiots by showing only the ignorant people. Unfortunately the average person lacks critical thinking and is easily swayed by videos like this. I know plenty of dumb Trump supporters but I know far more intelligent Trump supporters and those people are well aware of his faults but know he is still a better choice than the alternatives. It's almost a lesser of two evils.,3년 전,0,

Let me help:  ""Sheep,"" when used as a pejorative for people, are generally regarded as people who do things just because that is what other people are doing.  Stating that you would do precisely this ""out of respect,"" followed immediately by the assertion that you ""aren't sheep,"" is what we like to call a ""self-own"" and, in this case, a somewhat ironic one.  It illustrates the short-sighted idiocy of the individual.  It's clear they haven't thought through their own position, or perhaps have little understanding of the words they use.  In juxtaposition to the caustic vitriol said individual uses to chastise the choices and decisions of others, this again can only be characterized as either hypocrisy or ironic stupidity.

@jonathanbecker8935,"These people have been lied to by a complete idiot who has never worked a day in his life and was given every dollar he's ever spent.  But the real evil is Fox News and the Murdochs, who profit from airing a fake news channel posing as fact checked, ethical journalism.  Fox News reinforces all the lies Trump tells with professional hosts who, as articulate and intelligent speakers, present conspiracy theories and unproven information as absolute facts.  They twist data in polls or from academic research to suit whatever their messaging needs are to support their corporatist, far right agendas.  Their ultimate goal is to convince working class viewers to vote against their own best economic interests in favor of laws and policies that help BILLIONAIRES and corporations rig the tax code and economy for the sole purpose of increasing their profits.  Trump and Fox spread lies about COVID-19 and the vaccines which resulted in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands of Trump voters.  These people will take unproven drugs like hydroxychloroquine and a de-worming medication sold at feed stores instead of a vaccine that's had twenty years of research behind it.  Fox bears direct responsibility for the preventable deaths of these folks.  Without Fox reverse engineering explanations for mistakes Trump made while in office, he would never have had the continuing support of a large portion of his base.  Fox News has even been directly responsible for some of Trump's policies and rhetoric.  They had a direct line to the White House during the Trump'administration.  At the end of the day, this hijacking of our democracy by BILLIONAIRES and corporations who legally bribe our elected legislators is by definition fascism.  We are becoming more and more like a Putinist cleptocracy because of how Trump stacked the judiciary with corporatist mercenaries who side with big business over individual human rights, and twist Constitutional law into pretzels to justify it.  The SCOTUS justices Trump appointed are extremely loyal to the corporatist agenda.  All of these things hurt working class voters.  Trump and Fox go as far as even killing their base of voters. It makes zero sense.  All of what Trump did was to enrich BILLIONAIRES, corporations, and himself.   He did nothing to make healthcare more affordable.  He did nothing to improve to rights, conditions, and wages of workers. He was all talk, but did everything to hurt, not help them.  Get rid of the Fox News messaging, and Trump is finished in politics.  But try to explain to Trump voters how bad he was for them?  Nope.",4년 전,0,

Back in the day, what America stood for, in all its imperfections under hindsight, was dedinitely a foundation of the freedom of speech which we are now enjoying, the first republic / democracy in a world ruled by kings and opressing tyrants, which was definitely one of the biggest feats towards freedom and human rights in modern history.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

I'm all for different views so long as they aren't radical and harmful to others(pretty much what trump  and his supporters are), but I respect their views even if I can't change their mind. They've been brainwashed too. Children have NO PLACE WHATSOEVER in politics, religion, diet or so on. You are an adult. You have your own views on life. Educate your children on the different ways that exist. I am Íslendingur, an Icelander. I moved to America about 3 years ago now for my wife and I kind of regret it. We have a daughter and she has been super into politics here. I understand her beliefs and respect them, but my daughter is her own person. She deserves to make her own life choices. I do not have a religion, yet I teach my daughter all different ideas along with real science. If she wants to choose a religion over real science then so be it. Thats HER choice. I won't force anything on her. My wife is a radical Democrat in America. And judging by my values(that most of us in Iceland have) I would be a ""left leaning centrist"" we agree more with American democrats than we do Republicans. Especially today's Republicans. I fully support my daughter learning my wifes values and ideas, just as I support her learning other. I teach her everything out there so she can make her OWN life. I have seen so many children on the news at political events. Their parents brain wash them into their own personal ideas. If they dont follow their parents, they likely won't be loved the same anymore. I dont care HOW my daughter or future children live their lives. I will always love and support them. Teach your children everything the world has to offer. Let them learn their own way and live their own life no matter the path they decide. I hope that I can convince my wife to move back to Ísland after the Covid is under control in the US, which the Republicans and anti vaccine people are unfortunately stopping, but she has come around to agree with me that the US is no place to raise our children. It is so toxic, radical and aweful. She lived with me in Ísland for 5 years before we moved, so she knows what its like there. Please, keep your kids out of your way of life. Let them. Pick their own path. Let them live their own life.",4년 전,1,

@cydoman8014,"Can't understand why Trump supporters won't engage their questions and threats  directly  to him. He was in charge. The Republican Party has been in charge for decades.   The ease with which the insurrectionists  subject themselves to Trump's manipulation is such a sign of weakness and timidity.  It seems they care nothing about holding themselves accountable. They are in love with the power they think they have to create fear in their fellow Americans. So much of their threat-filled  rhetoric is actually aimed at fellow citizens, not at their own Representatives and Senators. Why is that? If they had any respect for democracy they would practice it more often. The opportunities for threatening is what they like. The fighting is what they want. The rule by force over the self-rule by citizens is what they practice. It is the self-rule that scares them, because it means they must accept direct responsibility for the outcomes of the government put into place by the people, including them. All those so-called patriots aren't interested in responsible self-rule. What they want is to impose their version of government by force, government by threats, government by fear of brutal beatings.   This type of government requires a special kind of fascist   leader. Who is their leader? Trump. Always and only Trump and his family and close friends.  Look into Congressional behavior and find the sympathizers there also. And don't forget to look deeply into the stored records of Trump's dealings with Putin and other foreign countries. If the UAE passed 700 million dollars into Trump's inaugural foundation, where did it go? His inaugural was listless, unappealing and frought with extra charges for attending. It could never have cost 104 million dollars. What other funds from unnamed foreign countries made their  way into the finances of the Trump-Kushner families?  Open up all those sealed records. Check all the travel records.  The insurrection demands a complete exposure of all relevant sealed documentation. January 6 was no made up Clinton personal email witch hunt.

@douggerard9792," @jasonrick594  How many proven lies does it take for you to realize mainstream media has been lying to you? The media and the DNC hate Trump because he exposed them for the liars they are. The whole Russian Collusion hoax was dreamed up by Hillary Clinton and Obama and Biden knew about it. The OBAMA / BIDEN administration weaponized the FBI, CIA, and DOJ. But even with the Durham report nobody will be held accountable. It's a double standard. And this energy crisis doesn't have to be. Remember America was energy independent under Trump. But Biden's energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, laughed as she blamed OPEC for high gas prices. Like Biden shutting down American pipelines and canceling drilling leases has nothing to do with it. Their plan is to make our energy so expensive that Americans will get behind their ""Spending Bill"". Please take the credit card away from the JoKe Biden administration. Climate change is going to happen regardless of anything humans do to stop it. No gasoline cars around when the Grand Canyon and the Bonneville Salt Flats were formed. There's a reason seashells can be found miles inland from the ocean. ADAPT.  And look at the lies Biden tells. ""We will leave nobody behind in Afghanistan"". ""Paying illegal migrants separated from their children $450k is not going to happen"". ""I'm not going to mandate masks""... Just to name a few Biden lies... And how about that boarder crisis? Allowing 2 million illegal migrants to cross the southern border during a pandemic and then they transport them to RED states and blame republican governors for rising COVID rates.

People that literally know the law extensively were committing some of the severe crimes as for the policeman that was killed, he was killed in the line of duty  People at the Capitol entered into a building where they were holding a recount due to their beliefs there were some injustices being handled.

Have you heard about the border crisis where Biden is allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal unvetted, and infected migrants to pour into America? Have you seen the price of lumber, food, or gasoline since Biden TOOK office? Do you realize Joe Biden abandoned American citizens in Afghanistan along with 80+ billion dollars of cash and military equipment? Do you know that Joe Biden is asking OPEC to produce more oil because Biden shutdown our energy production. We were energy independent while Trump was president. But not now. Under Trump there was peace in the middle east and two months after Biden TOOK office missiles began raining down on Israel again. The Trump administration got a COVID vaccine to us in record time with ""Operation Warp Speed"" while Joe Biden mandates masks and withholds therapeutic drugs from states that need them simply because he doesn't like certain governors who reject his restrictions. I guarantee that anything you don't like about Trump has been CHANTED to you by the LYING mainstream media. They hate Trump because he exposes them for what they are.

@douggerard9792," @cjvaye99  Voter Suppression? Laws that hinder Voter FRAUD is not Voter suppression. And let me explain ""simply"" the Electoral College since you have no idea WHY we have that system.   Our forefathers were so much wiser than generations to follow. For people who want to do away with the Electoral College I’ll explain it this way; Imagine a street of 10 houses and the residents have to vote on the color of their house. Everyone gets a vote and they use the “Popular Voting System” rather than the “Electoral College System”.  •	Family 1 has 2 adults and 10 children. They each get a vote so that is 12 votes. •	Family 2 has 2 adults and 15 children. They each get a vote so that is 17 votes •	The remaining 8 homes each have two adults and 1 child so they have 3 votes per home.    Families 1 & 2 have a combined total of 29 votes while the other 8 properties have a combined total of only 24 votes.   That being said, if families 1 & 2 vote to paint all the houses on the street pink with purple dots, it doesn’t matter that the other 8 families voted to allow freedom of choice for their house color.    This is the same reason we have an “Electoral College”.  If decisions were based on “Popular Vote” the states with large populations of pink and purple dot house painters would dictate crazy policies for the entire country.

I also don't understand what Biden had done in terms of policy that has lost anything to China.  You sound like you're repeating a thing, an image  that Trump had attempted to project.

On the 7th he blocked me and has never spoken to me again...  Maybe he is ashamed of all the times he threatened me with GITMO just for disagreeing with him... Maybe he just went into hiding feeling robbed and cheated by the world... Who knows... I really don't care too much... but I do wonder what made him block me. Shame or selfrightiousness....",4년 전,0,

So if you abide by the Christian bible you do all of thos things for all people, you can't just cherry pick what you want but that is exactly what they do.",4년 전,3,
@juniorolumide," @mjc42701  you got it completely right. Despite being a Christian, thats the way i see it. You cant be ""prolife"" and be against universal healthcare and free education. American evangelicals vote against their own best interests.   Humans are different by nature and depending on one's perspective, abortion can be immoral, but that doesn't mean a complete disregard of it. There are plenty of reasons that can lead a woman to choosing abortion and this is something plenty evangelicals ignore.",4년 전,3,

The indigenous people were slaughtered and terrorized for land and profit. Not for years, or decades, but for centuries, this nation exploited and victimized every single person who was not a white man — denying them all the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness — denying them all the right to vote, the right to safety, the right to dignity. People where brought from Africa  and enslaved and worked to death and used for sexual pleasure so how can anyone say that america has always been great.

@doodleproductions7552,"@Kiera B. Well, to answer something, you have mentioned 2 situations where you understand that you think abortion should be legal (e.g., medical emergencies and sexual assault) however let's get into statistics, the percentage of teens getting an abortion is only 24% of those pregnancies, so you're talking about a very small minority in the situations you think that abortion should not be allowed. But here's the thing.. do you really want the kid to have a choice between the undernourished, underfunded, ab*sive (don't wanna get flagged) foster care system wherein possible fosters still don't have enough background checks? Or do you want the child to live with an irresponsible teen who, after all, they did get pregnant by not using protection, likely smokes (even while pregnant), and/or drinks (probably.. still while being pregnant). If anything.. abortion would probably be less painful for them yes? If the teen cannot possibly take care of themselves properly enough to use protection what gives you the understanding that they won't give the baby a lot of harm whilst being pregnant, most likely harm in the form of deformities, is that really any better than something done before a heartbeat even occurs? Furthermore, abortion is not very clearly defined in illegal prospects and many people mistake miscarriages for abortions with not a lot of medical influences determining the difference. So.. my prospect to you is that we should probably fund planned parenthood more (they provide sexual education, condoms, birth control, etc.), and that way we should instead reduce the teen pregnancy rate altogether so that abortion is only for the 2 reasons you have listed.",4년 전(수정됨),2,

@kurokasteele4830,"54:55  Oh boy, time to flex a little of my college-essay overly-pedantic research  Technically, that is actually an American flag. The flag code (Which is codified, but has no enforcement procedures, and stands as an optional, suggested guideline for flag use and care) states that anything that has any readily-recognizable aspect of the flag is effectively considered the flag (at least within the Flag Code)  So step one, that is an American Flag.  Step two, you don't deface or mark an American Flag or display it with any kind of marking.  Step three you don't sell any form of merchandise (and basically any other form of 'thing) using an American flag or use it in advertising. Bet you he bought that flag from somewhere.  Step four, the flag shouldn't touch the ground (Or any other thing below it) under any circumstance while being carried or displayed. I don't think Klepper is high-stepping to step on the flag there.  Step five, it should not be displayed in any manner it will be easily torn, soiled, or damaged. Like carrying an oversized flag in a rally with people talking and walking and low enough to be stepped on.  And... virtually every other section and subsection in the flag code, that man violated. And yet, he is a patriot, and most likely (though I cannot confirm) believes kneeling is a disservice to the flag.  (Which, kneeling is against the unenforceable flag code, which would mean he follows that standard for other people but not himself.)   And as a closing point, I will admit that the flag code, while being unenforceable, is absolutely crazy save for like two sections, but it stands that the average trump supporter is hypocritical in following it. (Edit, as well as so many other people, but primarily trump supporters it seems.)  And for the record, I believe the supposed restrictions about using the flag as advertisement and merchandise is very good. Companies should not be able to print American Flag Print ____ and sell it, capitalizing on people's patriotic feelings.  The other portion I believe is good, is some limited provisions about caring for the flag, and about it's positioning and locations of display, since it helps ensure that the flag is given what respect it deserves, but isn't overly.... flag worship.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

In most crimes you don’t even have time to get to a properly stored gun. Plus I’m not arguing for guns to be banned. I’m arguing that we shouldn’t have thing larger than pistols and rifles which can be used for protection. Because understand that my mother makes me text her when I get home to make sure I didn’t die in school. Understand that my teachers keep baseball bats in their cupboards and staplers in areas to chuck because shootings have become too common. They don’t even make headlines anymore unless they kill more than five kids. Understand that I grew up learning to hide from a shooter. Understand that my teachers listen for gunshots when the fire alarm goes off. Understand that I grew up in the wake of sandy hook, where six year olds were killed and teachers died barricading the doors to keep their students alive. Understand I grew up planning walk outs in the wake of parkland and writing the names of pulse victims up my arms. I know where every unlocked door in my school is in case I have to hide. The seniors tell the younger kids how to climb into the ceiling in case they are in the bathroom during gun shots. Children are walking over bodies, picking body matter off of themselves, and preparing to die. Australia, Sweden, Norway, the UK, and South Korea are all examples of first world countries with extremely low crime rates and weapons are banned or heavily restricted there. Excuse me for wanting my classrooms to be places of learning instead of battlefields. Excuse me for being mad at the death tolls saying more people died of gun violence in America then American soldiers at war. Excuse me for wanting my siblings safe. I’ve heard gunshots. I have seen blood in my hallways. I’m tired of it. The people have a right to protect themselves sure. But I have a right to live. I’ll savor America sure. I am happy for my education, for the roof over my head and the freedoms I get. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t keep improving.

@BlindCoyoteGod," @atomicnut1486  I’m actually a self proclaimed “radical” combining political ideas of the French Revolution, extreme left ideas communism/Marxism and ideas of Buddhism and Christianity with the center of my belief system being Anarchism.

With the ultimate goal and in my opinion the cause of most crime being greed, so we need to destroy the idea of greed. But that’s just a summary of my personal beliefs.",4년 전,1,
@atomicnut1486," @BlindCoyoteGod  Honestly I can agree with you on the rich, hell just look at the gamestop hedge fund recently. The rich cry when they get outplayed. However, I disagree with Marxism. It took away millions of people's freedoms and continues to do so. China and North Korea are two huge examples. Only good thing I can say about it is that it helped feed a starving China after the Japanese came through. While trying a new system or parts of a system is truly democratic, communism IMHO has just left a really bad taste in people's mouths. Not saying capitalism is perfect, because it is not by a longshot. It also has some shitty stuff that occurred because of it. But when you compare the two, capitalism looks like a apple pie compared to a moldy raspberry pie.",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@BlindCoyoteGod," @atomicnut1486  see, my main issues with the left stem from- I agree with what their doing. People need help. I want a stimulus check, I want a higher minimum wage, I want the average man to have a better quality of life, but their solution to everything is MORE government control, and that’s where I fundamentally break from them, I hate bureaucracy and paperwork, it slows down processes to a T, which is 1 of two reasons why communist countries don’t work, the second reason is that they have dictators which arguably goes against the very point of communism, (put things into the hands of workers) and that dictator has no incentive to give up his power, so he keeps a lot of the resources that are supposed to be redistributed to the populace (another example of the rich problem) so I speak more about communism in small communities and the theory, than historically, in that I like the ideas of coming together to fulfill our needs, rather than say North Korea.",4년 전,0,
@atomicnut1486," @BlindCoyoteGod  ok, I can see your point more clearly. The idea was good, and if put in to plan correctly, it very well could be alright. However, because of how it was put into process, with the restrictions of human rights and the millions of deaths, people just don't wanna try it. And honestly, I cannot blame them. I am in the middle on this issue between socialism and capitalism, however I think that if we were to mold what we have now into a better system without switching, that would be the best long term solution. (Better healthcare and more taxes on the rich would be a good fix)",4년 전,0,
@BlindCoyoteGod," @atomicnut1486  my personal idea for a solution is called The Township state. It would in a way a no government state, and to an extent become a total democracy rather than representative. Each city would become essentially its own state, further centralizing the local powers, and making things easier to balance and care for. It would allow freedom of travel as borders are dissolved, and just in general I feel localizing everything would solve a lot of issues. It would reduce the devastation of war considerably as army sizes and capability falls. So that’s just my idea of the perfect world. Highly unique cities with their own ideas of governance shining through, without a proper federal government left existing anywhere in the world.",4년 전,0,

I especially dont like the fact that he is guilty of collusion with China and committed treason along with Obama, Hilary and the FBI and then destroyed the lives a highly decorated  general who has served this country for years. They took every penny that man had, his home and threw him in Jail knowing all along they were lying.  No, I was at the capital that day...I was workjng my 2nd job I do to help the elderly & low income people who are at high risk of being hospitalized if contracting covid & can't get out to get what they need. Then I studied for my exam for my senior level renewable energy class so I can graduate with my Bachelors of Science in And & Energy & my Bachelors for Construction Management in 3 months  then after that I worked my job as and Independent contractor/p Project Manager over for a international company that builds Commercial  Solar& Wind farm projects to provide renewable energy to our utility grid. Im over every project in every state South of Ohio and east of the Mississippi River. So, no Im not the one out of touch and voted for an incompetent, weak willed, china placating treasonous criminal who doesn't give a rats behind about America or our rights that our military have fought and died to protect. So Your damn right im a the supporter of the rightfully elected man who took the left's crap for 5 years. Biden is a puppet who doesn't know where he is. Yes Im a Trump supporter and damn proud of it. President Trump wil always be my President and the President of the people  !!  ❤🤍💙 TRUMP ❤🤍💙 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸",4년 전(수정됨),3,

All I see out in the real world are.......price increases in meds.FOR instance .... BYSTOLIC meds increased to $85.00 for a 30 days supply.(all I see IS emergency room co payments increased to $200 00).I DONT FIND prescriptions cut in half IN ANY DEMOGRAPHIC in any government or private insurance plan.(SOME ONE SHOW and prove it to me).THIS IS ALL hyper........intent at DEMONIC EVIL against themselves AND against others.....BY THE ULTRA insane conservative AND ultra insane FAKE conservatives Alex and TRUMP.(trump was SUPPOSED to have a major implementation OF A MAJOR socialist-conservative health care policy.WHICH trump and his boys NEVER DID because it was NOTHING but the usual scamming by trump).SO AGAIN......nothing but REAL LIFE DISASTERS by trump.(alex and TRUMP claims TRUMP is the only president who kept us out of war).WRONG.......trump simply.....RE MANEUVERED trumps in one portion of the globe to.......other areas.HE DIDNT STOP OR BRING HOME any more total amounts then.....all the other presidents did.(in fact......trumps reluctance) to start new wars.CAN be looked at as a DEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL (need)......OF MENTAL TRANSFERING his need and his reality of Trumps OWN total evil cowardness AS AN ILLEGAL DRAFT DODGER.(that of which HE DOES as mental transference on our troops by BRINGING a percentage home).YET still proceeding with the HORRIFIC UGLYNESS of he himself trump-keeping other troops deployed.THUS FULL FILLING-HIS......SELF PROCLAIMING his love for daily chaos.AS he still re deployed other percentages of troops NOT TO HOME.......but to other death zones around the world.(again nothing but disasters from trump).AND trumps international peace treaty.(is a complex and simple exercise-in trumpisms-forcing one side over the  other-to take the treaty .OR ELSE !).with no STABLE BALANCED COMPROMISES NEGOTIATIONS that Trump says he's a GENIOUS on.(which ultimately in the short and long run will lead to or maybe has already led to.VIOLENT indiscretions by the forced side.REMEMBER ITS TRUMP .where nothing good naturally ever happens).TRUMPS main foreign policy.WITH China and Korea.SAW no great negotiation skills that Trump claims he ALWAYS orchestrated.(but rather ONLY tax increases to those countries.AGAIN WACKED out liberal and conservative moves).again nothing but disasters via trump.(I could go on and on and on here about the NEGATIVES about ALL of trumps so called real accomplishments.(but the list would be SO LONG that evil itself would charge me with written to the reader-harrassement).i will say however........that because of the HORRIFIC responses to the female murder in RACIALLY CHARGED charottsville.AND because trump literally said.......that those Nazi racist DOERS are part of good people syndrome.THE MERE FACT that trump is NOT CALLING NAZI-RACISTS bad people all the time.SHOWED how much of an overall disaster and in PARTICULAR disaster ALL 4 years of trump was.(on top of all this.TRUMP still has a good chance of being in jail for all the private $ scams he managed to pull off.DURING and BEFORE HIS PRESIDENCY.i mean.Trump had so MANY MORE tax increases on the American public versus his very few tax breaks.THAT trumps trak record makes him the.....king of tax liberal conservative INCREASES.(TRUMP......could have been the greatest president and greatest citizen ever.IF he had on a daily basis JUST USED his unusual/usual power to bring people in.AS A DAILY PEOPLES TOOL to put forth BALANCED economic and social programs that were conservative and liberal.BUT IN CONCLUSION.....predictably TRUMP ends up being the worse ever-president and worst ever citizen......AND yet 73 million DIP-SHIT intentionally evil moron low life's still vote for him TWICE)......SHOWS the rest of us........how intentionally evil....most of America has become.(and shows......how intent AT demonic evil Alex Jones is to himself and to others).ALEX needs to.....seriously consider committing suicide and immediatly.(to get his INTENTIONALLY EVIL ASS of this planet).your replies are welcomed.,4년 전,0,

Sorry to break it to you he is doing it because he has no choice with taxes going higher and the price of a gallon of milk costing $8 he has to raie the minimum wage...but its only going to run the already struggling business owners out of business because they can't afford to pay thay wage. We are im for a recession from hell and our civil liberties granted to us by out Constition because of his Dictator way on governing. Not to mention he put us back in the Paris Accord that's going to cost more American jobs and he's putting us back in the China run WHO  along with getting us back into the ridiculous Iran deal.

Illegal immigrants are literally what this country  known as the US has been since the beginning… but now u hate illegal immigrants.  Fun fact! Illegal immigrants make up less overall crime than ANY OTHER POPULATION OF PEOPLE IN THE US.

Additionally, it would increase the disposable income of those families which stimulates the economy.

Not only that but a lot of jobs that involve tips won't actually raise the wage that employees are making, as long as their tips get them above the minimum wage.

I think we had the best public schools in the nation. By third grade at PS 33 I was a ferocious reader. Bio’s, history, and fiction. My parents encouraged me to read and question what I read. My teachers encouraged us to always question anything we didn’t understand or why we were fore or against something. We had great teachers. My grammar teachers were the best. Jr. High we had very good teachers. By High School I had great English and history teachers, subjects I loved. Math was my down fall, algebra. But when I went to SUNY Albany I mastered it. It was fun. I understood.  I am still a ferocious reader, my hero’s in school in the Bronx was Clara Barton, Queen Elizabeth the 1st, Florence Nightingale, strong women all who did what they had to do to make this world a better place. So many women in history that changed this world. So many men that changed the world. I’ve worked in business in Manhattan, traffic, consolidation and operations, an LPN in Albany, also a job coach and legal Advocate for victims of domestic violence. I have a BA in Psychology with minors in Criminology and Sociology. I received an injury while working as a visiting nurse and so had to retire from that calling. My learning never stopped. I still question what goes on in this world. If you refuse to continue to learn, you don’t read and your opinions are formed by what other people say and think then you might as well hang it up, become a hermit, because free thinking has passed you by and I for one feel sorry for you.

@orionxavier6957,"Elon Musk said at the end of the World Government Summit in 2017: ""Always take the position that you're some degree wrong. And your goal is to become less wrong over time. One of the biggest mistakes people generally make, and I'm guilty of it too, is wishful thinking. You want something to be true, even if it isn't true. So you ignore the things that, uh, you ignore the real truth because of what you want to be true. This is a very difficult trap to avoid.""  When I look in the comments, the majority of them are not practicing this. Instead they are trying to demonstrate how much ""smarter"" they are than ""those people.""  Jordan speaking to a few dozen people at most, is hardly representative of a large portion of this very large country. Not to mention, the conversations are edited to make them appear ""stupid"" or ""crazy."" Yet anyone with a modicum of intelligence would realize that surely there are Republican voters who have intelligent and compelling arguments in favor of voting for Trump. Which we never see, of course.   This is divisive, dangerous propaganda. It is not ""political humor."" I don't find it funny at all (and I'm not a Trump or Biden supporter, to be clear).  I would also ask people to consider Abraham Lincoln's Temperance address: ""When the dram-seller and drinker, were incessantly told, not in accents of entreaty and persuasion, diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring brother; but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation, with which the lordly Judge often groups together all the crimes of the felon's life, and thrusts them in his face just ere he passes sentence of death upon him, that they were the authors of all the vice and misery and crime in the land; that they were the manufacturers and material of all the thieves and robbers and murderers that infested the earth; that their houses were the workshops of the devil; and that their persons should be shunned by all the good and virtuous, as moral pestilences -- I say, when they were told all this, and in this way, it is not wonderful that they were slow, very slow, to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations, and to join the ranks of their denouncers in a hue and cry against themselves.  To have expected them to do otherwise than they did -- to have expected them not to meet denunciation with denunciation, crimination with crimination, and anathema with anathema, was to expect a reversal of human nature, which is God's decree, and never can be reversed. When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted. It is an old and a true maxim, that a ""drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall."" So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which, say what he will, is the great highroad to his reason, and which, when once gained, you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if indeed that cause really be a just one. On the contrary, assume to dictate to his judgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned and despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues to his head and his heart; and though your cause be naked truth itself, transformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than steel can be made, and though you throw it with more than Herculean force and precision, you shall be no more be able to pierce him, than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw.""",4년 전,0,

@starmessenger,"I have news for you: American citizens have virtually no power at all! We don't make the laws — the lobbyists pay our lawmakers to create laws that benefit the interests of corporations and groups that are detrimental to the welfare of humanity. We haven't had an Administration in several decades that even tried to improve our way of life and world. And since voting went electronic, we probably haven't had an honest election in the past several elections. Almost all of our elected officials are wealthy elitists (including Trump, whom his idiot followers viewed as ""one of them""); they are in it for themselves and the elimination of competition (which I would have to say is long gone); they do nothing for the working class or poor, except throw a scrap now and then like a $20 reduction in taxes, or a single ""stimulus"" of $600 which won't even pay a person's rent for one month. We have already seen the demise or chipping away of our Bill of Rights since 911. Over the past 50 years our standard of living has plummeted like a vertical roller coaster while the Elite's worth has shot straight up like a rocket that sucked our marrow for the fuel. There once was a time when Americans could have put their foot down or made changes in the system, but catch phrase ""socialism"" clouded their brains and made them push hard for unbridled Capitalism. That was our downfall. Today, we have no power whatsoever. We're trying to keep our heads above water in a huge recession during a massive plague. And I will add one more thing: If you think any other country or culture in the world would handle power any differently — think again! Greed is a HUMAN condition — not a uniquely American one. There will be many countries on this planet that garner the number one power position.. and each one will eventually fail because the element of compassion is missing. When the majority of individuals on the planet want for all others what they want for themselves, then we will begin to see a civilized human species. That could be a hundred thousand years away.",4년 전,0,

I've been LAUGHING at Trump et al ever since he won in 2016, when I, a died-in-the-wool-small-d Democrat (or Green, or Indy), calmly (enough) accepted the idea that the President for the next Administration was already a Clown, and was destined to become a laughing stock. Of course even I couldn't know what his final moves would be like, but I'm gratified. And Mary was right all along, a good credential for psychiatry: he NEVER gave up trying to stay; he's now going down and will likely shoehorn some last desperate move into the minutes before he's escorted down the steps.   He went down in flames. Which it what makes it all SO gratifying, with video up the Orange Wazoo, to show our kids. It's so funny, because THAT is when people learn: when their faces end up in the dirt, and people are rightly laughing at them. That is an inflection point. He can either be a Dalek, hating everyone forever, or use it to learn. I don't expect him to learn, but I do expect him to now... go away, if any other country will let him in. Him and his entire family (the evil side of it, that is; Mary and Katherine can stay.)   It's very much too bad, that so many people had to die, but that's mob-icity for ya... And it did all work out humorously enough -- in the same vein as cavemen laughing at a saber-tooth's struggles in the tar pit. I would likely have made up the list of the Covid Dead a bit differently,  and included not a few RICH bodies on it...   I wonder what Sheldon Adelson died of, and why Charles Koch is still alive -- whose blood is in HIS veins?  BTW, is it true that only truly EVIL people can survive by becoming walking Covid super-spreaders?  And in that line, does anyone have Satan's number?

@mikej8973,"￼  Hello liberals.  I tolerated Obama for 8 years and kept mostly quiet, and did want him to be a good President for our entire Country (I've never wanted a President to be bad for your country!). I remember when he would go overseas and publicly bash the very country that overwhelming put him where he was - twice. I damn well remember when Obama referred to Americans as ""enemy"" in a racist tirade on a public television station.  Here is my issue with the whole, “let us all be a United States again” that we hear from Joe Biden and his affiliates (all while they spew hatred against almost half the country). For the last 4+ years, the Democrats have gone and scorched earth. You have salted the fields and now you want to grow crops. The problem is 75+ million of us have memories longer than a hamster.  -We remember the women’s march (vagina costumes and all) the day after inauguration. -We remember the 4 years of attacks and impeachments. -We remember “not our president” and the “Resistance…” -We remember Maxine Waters telling followers to get in their faces, tell us we’re not welcome here and harass us in restaurants.  -We remember the President’s spokesperson being kicked out of a restaurant. -We remember hundreds of Trump supporters physically attacked. -We remember Trump supporters getting Doxed, and fired from jobs. -We remember Trump supporters kicked off commercial airline flights. -We remember anti-Trump riots, looting and destruction. -We remember “a comedian” holding up the President’s severed head. -We remember a play in Central park paid with public funding, showing the killing of President Trump. -We remember Robert de Niro yelling “F"" Trump” at the Tony’s and getting a standing ovation.  We remember liberals calling for the execution of all police officers chanting in the streets ""pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon!!!!!""  -We remember Nancy Pelosi tearing up the State of the Union Address. (clearly NOT a 'union' move!) -We remember the non-stop and live fact checking on our President and his supporters. -We remember non-stop in your face lies and open cover-ups from the media. -We remember the President and his staff being spied on and lied about. -We remember five people shot on a ball field. -We remember every so-called comedy show turn into nothing but Trump hate fest. -We remember 95% negative coverage in the news.  -We remember the state governors asking and getting federal help while blaming Trump for their problems, yet rightfully demanding their 10th Amendment State's Rights and saying the federal government shouldn't intervene in their State.  -We remember a Trump top aid verbally assaulted in two DC restaurants. -We remember people banging on the Supreme Court doors. -We remember that we were called every name in the book for supporting President Trump (certainly not very 'loving and tolerant'!) -We remember that Hollywood said they would leave after Trump was elected but they stayed. -We remember billions of dollars of destruction, the ruin of thousands of businesses and 20 people killed in their “mostly peaceful protests”.  We will remember that trump worked tirelessly to to give all you liberals and indeed all Americans the historic $2,000 stimulus payments and that the Democrats shamelessly nonetheless took underserved credit for it.

So what threat was George Floyd when he was on the ground, with his hands cuffed behind his back and 4 cops sitting on him? Again, I'm not American, and here in the Netherlands our police are held to a way higher standard. Which is why people here aren't afraid of and yes, actually trust the police. The educational requirement is higher and it shows in their ability to de-escalate situations.  It's similar with press. We have some very politically neutral news sources that ask the tough questions no matter who's in charge. Which helps keep the government in check and the people trusting the media (in general) to do their job. Which is reporting on the acts of government and their consequences, rather than sensationalism.  And again with government. We use proportional representation voting, which means every Dutch citizen has equal political power. Which is why many people believe in and participate in politics. Our national election turnouts are almost always 70-80%. Meanwhile in the US there was just a record turnout for the Presidential elections, at 66,7%. The highest it has been in 120 years. It tends towards 50-60%.  In short, it's not weird that Americans don't trust their political system, news or police.

I don't want conflict so I'm going to ask you nicely, but as a bisexual woman I would appreciate it if you didn't use your religion as an excuse to discriminate and continue to disenfranchise us (the lgbtqia+ community). Sexuality and gender identity are both things that we cannot change, and considering that you probably don't follow the entire bible completely literally, it would be hypocritical to cherry pick this single verse to justify your personal biases. Jesus said love thy neighbor as you would love yourself. Period. No exclusions, thus, discriminatory behavior against certain groups is un-christian. I am currently atheist, so feel free to rip into me if my scripture isn't correct (I haven't been Christan in a long time) but I would prefer to not have conflict.

@NLTops," @jefferyepstein4252  You're right. It's better to just bow your head to the loud minority that decides to get violent. That never goes wrong.  In the Netherlands, every vote weighs the same at every level of government. Whether it's municipal, provincial or national, every person has 1 vote and each vote weighs the same. So if the majority of the country want something to change, they can do it through elections. And our system is built on compromise. We havn't had a one-party majority since 1848 when we became a parliamentary democracy. 173 years of compromising with eachother where neither side is the absolute winner and neither has to be the absolute loser.  This is very different from the US, where the electoral college ensures that it doesn't take a popular majority to elect a president. cough 2016 cough ... The bipartisan nature of the system also ensures that centrists (""swing voters"") never have their own representatives and must always ask themselves which is the lesser of two evils when they vote.

@NLTops," @jefferyepstein4252  Nothing else to say to that other than ""That is a very generalizing and simplistic world view."". One of the most fundamental questions you can ask about any two things is ""What is the difference?"". I suggest you ask yourself that question more often. You'll find that two things that appear the same can be very different, and two things that appear different can have more in common than it seems.  For example, the French revolution ultimately started because the peasants got hungry and sick of being taxed to hell. But there are countless protests and instances of civil unrest that never led to revolution. Why? Because the threshold for protesting and breaking shit is a lot lower than the threshold for bloody, violent revolution.",4년 전,1,

@NLTops," @jefferyepstein4252  ""very much used wrong""? ""then me""? A sentence with 5 commas.  The point is that the conclusion ""things get worse when you try and supress them"" is simplistic. That's not a foregone conclusion. Societies all around the world surpress a variety of behaviour: murder, theft, and vandalism to name a few. If you do those things, someone shows up to try and stop you. Imposing rules does not automatically backfire. It all depends on the proportion of the population supporting - and opposing - said rules. If a few thousand people kick up a storm because they don't like the curfew, that's all well and good. But meanwhile there are 17 million people who don't care because they don't go out after 9 pm anyway and think ""Let's just get through it so life can get back to normal."".  So I don't know where you're from, but if a couple thousand mostly-juvenile miscreants can break shit at will without repercussion, then I weep at the incompetence of your law enforcement.

@dramabeansk," @housedivided4225  like I stated before systemic racism is too nuanced and complex.  If you actually want to learn you will have to do some research.   But just some points to address are the inequal rate that people of color go to jail and the severity of their sentences compared to similar offenses by white counterparts.   The number of times children of color are penalized for their hair or clothes.  The gerrymandering of political districts so that poor areas with large poc populations are severely underserved in elections, education and social services.  Did you know people with ""black"" names are much less likely to be considered for a job? Studies have shown that white people and people of color use weed at a similar rate yet the percentage of those arrested for marijuana possession weighs heavily on poc. Systematic racism is not one law or rule but rather a system of inequalities designed to make lives difficult for a specific population of people.   There are people who succeed despite the oppression but maybe people are tired of working twice as hard to get half as much.  Again if you are genuinely interested in learning more about how systemic racism intrudes in our lives I would recommend the following book list https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/a-reading-list-on-issues-of-race/   Also again ava duvernay's documentary 13th paints a picture of how the prison system has affected and benefited from the culture of incarceration of poc.  As an Asian woman I have not experienced as much racism as many others in the poc population but I have done the research and the homework to better understand the pain and inequities that they face and I am a better person for it. Hopefully we can all grow in empathy,  compassion and our pursuit of equality and justice for every person .",4년 전,2,

I also have personal experience with that very same department and precinct. Only 4 years prior, my rapist nearly murdered me a few blocks from where Walter Wallace was murdered. My rapist attacked that same department and precinct (several officers!) with knives, swords, pots, pans, fists, furniture. Put a female officer on light duty for a few months. They didn't shoot him. Not even after attacking them with weapons, not even a taser -- just fists. The ONLY difference is that my rapist is blonde-haired/blue-eyed and Walter Wallace was Black. About the same age and body structure. And Walter Wallace is dead while my rapist is alive and locked up. I have friends who heard the police murdering that young man. Their immediate reaction was to remember that my rapist is alive after actually attacking that same precinct with actual weapons. He got convicted of attempted homicide and several counts of 1st degree felonies on protected classes. He got more time for attacking a single cop than he did for literally almost murdering me. Walter Wallace is dead because he was Black and lived with mental illness.  So fuq outta here when you say police don't kill civilians unless they intend to harm others.

It was mostly just republicans alleging fraud and that was about when Joe biden started to poll ahead and look like he was going to win. The reason 74 million Americans were under the delusion that there was widespread systemic fraud (not saying there's no fraud, there's fraud in every election) was because all the republicans in office wanted to play pretend and lie to the people disregarding the dire consequences weve seen. Actually the voter fraud we do know of came from trump supporters trying to prove fraud instigated by our president, who told them to break the law. Georgia had a hand recount. I think it was wisconsin recounted too? Trump filed 62 lawsuits? I think the audit was a thinly veiled excuse to stay in power for 10 more days at best, and at worst an attempt for republicans to put in trump loyalists to detect fraud. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean there's fraud. I didn't like trump in 2016, and I didn't jump to fraud then.",4년 전(수정됨),28,

I could rent a small mansion in mid Michigan for what I pay in rent living in a 3 bedroom duplex in eastpointe. And Michigan is gorgeous!  Have you ever been to Holland Michigan?  I lived there as a kid until my mom passed away. WONDERFUL place to live.  I would move back if I could.  Wonderfully diverse.  Great schools.  Great job opportunities for people with no college education so there ate a lot of immigrants. Very religious town, but surprisingly tolerant.  Probably bc of the diversity. I was like you.  As a kid I didn't realize how bad racism was bc racism was simply not tolerated where I went to school. Moving to a small town that was predominantly white after my mom died was a complete culture shock. My first week there I heard a white kid say ni**er. Loud af. I was looking around,  thinking shit was about to pop off bc  he would have gotten his ass handed to him by EVERYONE at my old school.  And instantly sent to the principal's office. Didn't even phase this teacher at my new school!  At Holland high school,  he'd have to run home bc he'd very likely get thumped a few times.  It was 120 miles away.  2 hour drive.

There are people in every country whose intelligence has been so brutally diluted, but the USA breaks all records when it comes to the appearance of such cults and the enormous number of their followers. Almost all of these cults originated in the United States and spilled over to other countries in one way or another.",3년 전,0,

And in criminal court the proof must be ""beyond all reasonable doubt"" and obviously the jury had some doubts...... IF OJ had decided to allow the judge to decide his case instead of a jury who knows what might have happened.... In the civil trial that OJ did lose it is a completely different case.... In civil court cases, the burden of proof has a much lower standard and has to only meet a ""preponderance of evidence"" to prove guilt....  So, you are the one that has no clue on how the U.S. justice system works....   and FYI, a lot of those cases that trump lost in court were by judges that he, trump himself had appointed.... so IF even those judges agree that the evidence is fake you still wouldn't believe them....  then there is the U.S. Supreme Court (who btw trump appointed 3 of the judges) refused to hear the case because they all knew that there was no evidence of the 2020 election being stolen from trump as did 99.9% of trump's own cabinet who btw, all told him there was no evidence of fraud...",3년 전,0,

Russian collusion was Hillary Clinton's HOAX and half of America fell for it. The media lied about him being racist too. Trump made America energy independent, cut taxes, lowered the cost of insulin for those on Medicare, secured the southern border, created opportunity zones for under privileged people, signed prison reform, brought peace to the Middle East, and so many other things you mainstream media believers never heard about. Meanwhile in only a few months, Joe Biden/Kamala and the DNC have put America on a path to RUIN by attacking the fossil fuel industry, raising taxes, inflation, vilifying the police and border control agents. Biden canceled construction of the nearly completed border wall and opened the southern border to 2 MILLION migrants this year. Coming to cities of their choice where they can infect American citizens with COVID, take American jobs, or go on public assistance. American taxpayers will be supporting these migrants FOREVER paying for their education, healthcare, etc.  Yeah, the MEDIA DOES HAVE THE POWER. Look at what THEY have done.

@NLTops," @tabethapacion7137  America was nuts long before Trump and it will be, long after. I think it's mostly due to two factors. It's a relatively young country and the cold war really messed with their shared perceptions. A large portion of the population rejects any form of socialism at face value because ""communism bad"", not understanding that left-wing vs right-wing is a delicate balance and swinging too far either way breaks a country.   No matter what economic system we operate under, absolute wealth equality is infeasible. So there will always be people who are richer  than others and people who are poorer than others. Their interests clash due to the variations in their circumstances. That is what left-wing vs right-wing is really about. If you say ""fuck the rich"" and go full left-wing they'll take their wealth and invest it somewhere else. If you say ""fuck the poor"" and go full right-wing, you get lots of crime and lots of civil unrest.   A stable country is one where there is willing compromise between the two. A democracy is a country that values each citizen equally. That's why they all get a vote, and why (not in the US with their electoral college) all votes are worth the same. So in a democracy, the left/right balance is decided by wealth disparity and average wealth. People vote on which policies will benefit them. So poor people tend to vote socialist, rich people tend to vote capitalist and middle class flip flops depending on ""which side is going too far"".   But in the US, they had a huge crackdown on communism in the country throughout the cold war. So people who believed that the prosperity of a country is measured by how they treat those worst off were basically considered traitors. That became part of the cultural identity of the country and that's why they don't embrace socialist ideas like ""state-run healthcare"", ""labour unions"" and even the extreme basics like food banks and homeless shelters (social services that have existed for millenia) are contested water.",4년 전,72,
@finmin2k," @NLTops  it wasn't just communism bad. It was all forms of leftism = bad, with no real reasoning. They just said ""communism is bad, communists hate america"" without providing any reason for people to think such, which leads to people like those seen in the video. They think that what they were told is true, but they don't know why and don't want to change their opinions to reflect the truth. This goes for quite a lot of stuff in life, really. Religion is a good example. With all respect, there is no factual evidence behind their being a god, people are just told there is a god as a child and those who do not bother fact checking it grow up believing this. I really think all forms of systematically taught propaganda should be eliminated. I specifically remember being taught nationalism and patriotism at a very young age for no apparent reason. I was taught to think that the USA is a great country made by defying expectations and exploring what others didn't dare, when in reality it's quite the opposite and always has been.",4년 전,24,

@monsieurpapillon810," @NLTops  I really like your analysis. It may be fruitless (you maybe won't see my message), but I have a question regarding your reasoning.  I agree that in the end, you strive for a balanced country, going a little right or a little left when need be. But I feel like something is missing in your explanation of a ""stable country"" ; what about education ? Do you assume that poor people are defacto uneducated and inversely (not trying to make a statement here, just asking for clarification) ? Or that maybe ""intelligence"" is somehow balanced as well across all voters regardless of their social status ?  According to you, ""middle class flip flops depending on which side is going too far"", which I also agree on. But wouldn't you say rather that ""educated people"" are able to understand which side (progressivism or conservatism) is going too far ? In that case, what would happen if we somehow ensure that all social classes have access to decent education ?  Of course, maybe I'm too ideologist, maybe society does indeed work in a way that educated people are naturally those who are able to access higher social status and I still refuse to accept that there is no other way around.  Or maybe do individual benefits (choosing conservatism because it benefits you, and the other way around) outweight overall education benefits when we consider the ""well-being"" of a country, thus delegating the overall ""education"" of people to irrelevance ? I would be highly sceptical if that would the case, ""society well-being"" is, I think, something people naturally want to achieve.",4년 전,0,

@meister0388," @t.l.1610  absolutely agree with your observation.  However, i want to add that the relationship of the so called elite and government manipulation is another dynamic that cannot and should not be understated.  For instance, Jane Mayer explains in her book  “Dark Money” the efforts by the Koch Brothers, DeVoses and such to assault the so called socialist agenda or liberal point of views by infiltrating Universities’ political science departments via donations, endowments and selecting professors who will preach the conservative ideals of what capitalism is.  I do concede that both parties’ candidates and representatives tend to shift their policies based on who gives the larger donations, which is the sole purpose of PACs - a loophole that allows the ultra rich to fund politicians.  But, in its essence, capitalism is just another system up for sale and often purchased by those of deep pockets because ultimately it is just another asset to them. And yes, while the irony is lost on those people showcased by this video, the sad reality is that there is some truth to their “elitist runs everything” mindset, the tragedy just lies on them as they do not reason who truly is, and fail to see the defacto oligarchy that truly runs the American political system.",4년 전,0,

I believe there needs to be a balance between capitalism (interests of the wealthy) and socialism (interests of the workforce). If you mistreat the wealthy, they will simply find another place to make money. And if you mistreat the workforce, it always leads to the same conclusion.  But hey, go ahead and worry about your lables. They mean nothing to me. Social hierarchies are all about interests. I'd rather discuss the implication of chosen solutions, or the effects of economic/political/social policies and models than argue with a Republican about what ""true capitalism"" is supposed to be.

@nativeofnc," @NLTops  When we use these terms (Socialism/Capitalism), we rarely agree on the meaning. That’s why we can’t come to any kind of agreement.   I don’t consider people to be “the workforce”. So The “needs of the workforce“ is an odd concept and then to label that as Socialism is even more odd.  If I have needs or dreams greater than a job at McDonald’s can provide for then I need to do something about it.  In a free market society, a person who is part of the “workforce“ as you call it, can, with ambition, planning and innovation, become the innovator or owner, thus not a permanent fixture in a predetermined echelon.   You act as if someone who is working for someone else is  fated and has no options but to join a union or get the government to regulate in order to advance.   In a free society, you have options and choices.  It’s not like you were born to a certain caste and can never escape   Take the minimum wage issue for instance. Not to presume but it seems like socialist leaning people would want to support increasing minimum wage in order to provide for the needs of people working in places like McDonald’s. To allow them to make a “living wage”.  Yet from my perspective, flipping burgers was never a valid career goal, but a starter job for high school students or perhaps low skilled laborers who simply did not develop themselves in order to be able to offer more and therefore get paid more.    When you drop out of high school, develop a drug addiction, have no ambition, you tend to end up in low-skilled skilled positions which obviously aren’t going to pay as much, nor should they, as someone who paid attention in school, didn’t drop out and then spent an extra 8 to 12 years going to college to become a neurosurgeon.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Without that labour society would grind to a halt. Where I'm from, the political system is different. I live in a multiparty proportional representation democracy. People vote on the party that most aproximates their political views.  Actually watched a video comparing US' economic model with the Dutch model. Especially upwards mobility was an interesting part of the analysis. In the US more people ""make it big"". But this goes at the cost of downward mobility. The middle class has been shrinking since the 70s, from 61% of households to 51% today, with growing upper and lower classes. whilst in the Netherlands, it's the lower class that has been shrinking, with middle class now being 78% of households.  So which is better? a massive middle class where almost everyone is pretty well off, or a couple more super-rich people at the cost of many more poor people? The difference between them is socialism. Not USSR communism, but taking care of those lesser fortunate, which you yourself mention examples of.  Someone ""flipping burgers"" isn't as valuable as a neurosurgeon. That's completely reasonable. But why shouldn't someone flipping burgers full-time, generating profit for someone else, deserve a decent wage that they can survive on? Living wages as labour cost is entirely reasonable. But if you say something like that in the US, people instantly start shouting ""communism"".",4년 전,1,

Left-wing propaganda has reached new highs with control over the media, big tech and the public education system. And now stacking the deck with bogus ballots and open border policies to add to their base population of government funded voters. Have you read the HR1 spending bill? Nobody has because it's a liberal wish list that keeps growing. Trillions of tax payer dollars to fund nonsense and line the pockets of corrupt politicians. Meanwhile, we have a border Crisis, INFLATION, a return to energy dependence on OPEC, Crime because of the defund the police movement, higher taxes, a pandemic that kills more because the Biden administration denies THERAPEUTIC DRUGS to fight the virus once it is contracted, and the list of Democrat party failures goes on. All this in 10 short months of BIDEN and a DNC reign.   The media lied about Trump for 5 years turning half a nation against him even though his efforts created the greatest economy in 60 years. Lowest unemployment of all races and genders. Opportunity zones for disadvantaged people. Peace in the Middle East, and energy independence. Nations were beginning to pay their fair share and America was respected again. Joe Biden erased all those gains and has put America into a tail spin by reversing all Trump polices and Executive Orders. Biden began his ""America Last"" agenda on his first day in office.  Do you realize under Obama and Biden insulin prices had the highest price spike over the entire history of insulin? Trump took the price of insulin from $300 to $30 for Medicare patients and that price reduction was to take effect for everyone after January through Trumps ""Favorite Nations"" plan. JOKE BIDEN KILLED THAT PLAN and now we are back to high insulin prices for Medicare patients and the rest of us won't see the lowered prescription drug prices of Trumps plan. Instead, Biden's plan is to have Medicare negotiate drug prices.  THAT will make it worse because then the government will be telling us what we can and can't have and someone is certain to negotiate their own kickbacks. WAKE UP!",4년 전,0,

@TimothyHuffGuitar," @NLTops  unfortunately many people don't understand the differences between Communism, Socialism, Authoritarianism, Fascism, Democracy, Republic, or Democratic Socialism. I've heard Republicans refer to Democrats as at least 3 of those terms, though they are all different.  I agree, you can go too far to the left and achieve Socialism, but I don't think that any political figure has said they wanted that, they are wanting more along the lines of Democratic Socialism. There are some Socialist groups in America though. There is actually a Socialist/marxist party though they don't get much recognition.  The same can be said about going too far to the right. With this you end up with a Communist State and a huge wealth gap and no middle class.  So how do we balance this? We can't just vote straight tickets anymore because Democrats come in at least 3 flavors and so do Republicans. We learned the hard way that a businessman with no government experience is a very bad idea, though a great many people allow their passion to rule their ability to reason and have bought into the great deception of Trumpism. Donald Trump almost single handedly turned our country into an Authoritarian State and people are too blinded to see that. When we lose faith in the Constitution and the processes we have in place for free and fair elections UNLESS the outcome is what we wish it to be...we are in real trouble. What helps us move on is the knowledge that even if our ""team"" loses, in only just 4 years we have another opportunity to win the game. For our delicate, but American system of government to continue, we have to be willing to concede defeat when it happens. It has been steadily growing more tense as time has passed but I think the election of our first ever Black President was too much for people to accept that hold racist beliefs (no matter how small that racist belief is). Then it boiled over again amongst those that are against women in government positions with Hillary Clinton running for President, then again with Kamela Harris as Vice President. The right wing didn't like that Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 but didn't complain because he took the Electoral College. BUT in 2020 they lost their heads because Trump not only lost the Popular vote AGAIN, but he also lost the Electoral College in key battleground States. Trump totally lost his head and his cabinet tried to keep him calm and appease him by giving him hope they might be able to overturn the election someway. It should scare everyone that despite his loss in a free and fair election, Trump, his lawyers, and many Republican lawmakers tried to find ways to delegitimize votes cast by legal citizens. They tried to convince the public that foul play had been involved. ..like dead people voting, illegal aliens voting, votes changed by computer systems, and other claims that were not backed by any evidence whatsoever! Again, a classic propaganda technique...if you repeat a lie enough times to the right audience, they will believe it even despite evidence to the contrary.",4년 전,0,

@floppylinks7847,"These are funny, but lets not ignore the fact that this method of reporting can be somewhat disingenuous and can take advantage of people's psychology to some extent. One of the aspects of social psychology is agreeability, so when you present to someone a loaded question in a joking way, they are likely to make an easy agreeable response, even if that response is intolerant. Make no mistake: I believe that people are to be held accountable for everything they say, and I acknowledge that what we see here is not the reporter's fault. Racism and intolerance are real. So is stupidity. We can see it clearly. BUT this is a prime example of judging people by the surface. take the latest BORAT movie for example. He'll say something totally disgusting and intolerant and then blame people for agreeing with him, or singing along with his ridiculous songs. He depicts the people who don't call him out as part of the problem, and then makes a movie of all the worst clips to make a political party look like it is ALL idiots. This is divisive. Let's be clear that much of what we see in these people is not correct, but I can assure you that this stupidity exists on both sides of the political spectrum. People have different priorities and need to find a way to meet in the middle. Conservative vs progressive is always a war. Both sides need to hear eachother out completely. Watch eachothers news networks to see the REAL FUEL OF THE FIRE. Look at eachother's facts. Consider eachother's fears and help them understand why they don't have to be afraid. What I think you will find, though, is that we all have valid fears and your own feelings won't alleviate them without an education of what both sides believe, straight from the source. Be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to anger. Tolerate eachother's questions. There is only one truth.. Both sides have their fair share of lies, but you would never believe me unless you identify with truth instead of your favorite color. The psychology tricks and emotional manipulation of the media have stained our minds and hearts, and you know its true when both sides have some valid points to make, but never get anywhere with eachother because they don't truly listen to eachother. At the end of the day, we are all missing the big picture. Step back from the politics and learn about economics, philosophy, sociology, history of the entire world, cultures, theology, political sciences, corruption, the law, and other people's perspectives.

Proverbs 6:12-19  A worthless person, a wicked man, Walks with a perverse mouth;  He winks with his eyes, He shuffles his feet, He points with his fingers; Perversity is in his heart, He devises evil continually, He sows discord. Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; Suddenly he shall be broken without remedy. These six things the Lord hates, Yes, seven are an abomination to Him: A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, A false witness who speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren. Psalms 52:1-9 Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The goodness of God endures continually. Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. You love evil more than good, Lying rather than speaking righteousness. You love all devouring words, You deceitful tongue. God shall likewise destroy you forever; He shall take you away, and pluck you out of your dwelling place, And uproot you from the land of the living. The righteous also shall see and fear, And shall laugh at him, saying, “Here is the man who did not make God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness.” Ezekiel 22:4  You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and have defiled yourself with the idols which you have made.

Any of trump's accomplishments were things that whoever was in office would have happened. When speaking of obama's birth certificate should bring.up ppl like john mccain and some other politians that were not born on US soil. but are americans because parents are. OBama's mom is american so he could have been born anywhere and become an america.,4년 전(수정됨),0,

@smaakjeks,"@gcox03 There's a difference between condescension and mansplaining. Maybe you should look it up. When someone acts like a douche, I allow myself the liberty of being a bit brusk when offering advice to avoid coming across like a douche in the future. Advice they are free to ignore, of course. If someone wants polite advice after douching up the place, they can buy me dinner first.",4년 전(수정됨),5,
@smaakjeks,"@gcox03 ""You asked how you were mansplaining"" Yep, I asked, just in case I was in the wrong and you could convincingly explain how. Especially since you mentioned mansplaining; something which I hate. When someone accuses me of something, I want to self-scrutinise, even though shrugging it off as BS is the easiest thing to do. Especially because that's the easiest thing to do.  ""so let me dumb it down for you."" Giving me a window into your perception of my words is dumbing things down? If you say so.  ""When you explain things starting by using ""pro-tip (...)"""" Yes, that was the extent of my bruskness.  ""(...) and then go on to explain something that sounds like you think you're smarter or better than the person you are explaining something to, (...)"" I took care to write ""act/come across like a douche"" rather than accusing them of being one. Everybody (myself included) can act like a douche sometimes. How would you have written advice about pointing out spelling/grammar mistakes, after that someone made fun of a person for getting a word wrong?  ""(...) you are mansplaining."" No, that's not what mansplaining is. Mansplaining is when a man assumes that a woman is clueless about traditionally male dominated professions or areas of expertise, and then condescendingly explains it to her. A good example would be a customer taking it upon himself to explain to a female mechanic how an internal combustion engine works, because she is a woman.  Simply giving advice, albeit brusk, is not mansplaining. The advice was not unprompted assumption (big part of mansplaining), as the person had already made fun of someone's spelling who turned out not to be an English native speaker.  ""By the way, you owe me a dinner then because you sound like the biggest douche I've ever encountered."" No. You did not offer advice politely, and you haven't shown that my bruskness was unreasonable in response to acts of douchebaggery. No dinner owed.  ""You should hop off your high horse and take a look in the mirror before you comment."" I was never on a high horse. I asked you to explain what you meant by calling what I did mansplaining, in good faith, to self-scrutinise (i.e. look in the mirror). You have attempted to do so, but I see no good case for mansplaining going on for my part.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@smaakjeks,"@gcox03 ""How have you done this? you continued to mansplain."" You continue to claim that without demonstrating it.  ""If you refuse to listen to what I say because your ego is to high to do so, yes, I will dumb things down. "" I have listened. I continue to listen. You're just not making good arguments that convince me.  ""Here's the definition of mansplaining (since you couldn't look it up)"" I guess you don't bother re-writing your comment as you gradually respond, since later on you agree with my definition and example.  ""the explanation of something by a man, typically to a woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing."" Condescension is the only relevant attribute here (unless you're implying half the population of Earth is disallowed from explaining stuff by virtue of being men), and you told me there's a difference between mansplaining and mere condescension. So, you have not demonstrated that I mansplain. And, your evidence that I'm being condescending is based on claims about knowing what I'm thinking: that I think I'm better than a person I'm giving advice to. My mere words don't get you there. Brusk advice is not condescension in my book.  ""When you rudely insert yourself in order to correct someone or to insert your unwanted opinion by explaining it in a manner that puts you above another person, boom, mansplain."" Your definition of mansplaining is widening awfully quickly. By the way, would you say that you rudely inserted your unwanted opinion in a manner that puts you above me?  ""sure, the person who corrected the non-English speaker wasn't necessarily in the right, but your response didn't set you apart from theirs."" Yes, it did. They responded douchily to someone who was not being rude. I responded bruskly to someone who was acting like a douche. Then you seemingly acted in a similar spirit, but you missed the mark. I've already recognised that I could have been more polite about it. My opting not to be super polite is not a moral failing in this instance, IMO. Especially not a misogynistic one.  ""What's your obsession with the word brusk? did you just learn it?"" No.  ""Biased maybe ?😫"" Yep. That's why I bothered to ask you to show me the error of my ways. Thanks for nothing.",4년 전(수정됨),1,
@smaakjeks,"@gcox03 ""What do you want me to do?"" Come correct when bringing accusations, or retract them. If you want to be a compassionate and fully rounded human being that is. I assume you do want that.  ""I've explained everything it's just not good enough for you."" Not when I demonstrably refute your explanations, no. That's not my fault.  ""You mansplained, get over it and stop continuing to do it."" I will not stop giving advice if I see someone who clearly needs it. I will not always be polite towards those who are impolite towards others. Those two things are what happened here, not mansplaining. Mansplaining is a form of misogyny. I somehow doubt Jonathan labours under the misapprehension that I was presuming something based on his gender.  ""Oh also, hop off the high horse."" I lead it to the river, and tried to get the horse to drink, and now I've flogged a dead one for a while. I've had enough horse for one day. Bye.

As soon as you embrace intellectual honesty, and let go of ego, it all becomes a much more valuable pursuit of time.   Either, 1) you're wrong, and admit to it as the opponent demonstrates your errors. This is almost universally loved and graciously accepted by whomever you disagreed with. And, now you've learned something which can inform your worldview going forward. Win.  Or, 2) you're right, and get to practice bridging a gap of understanding between intellectually honest opponents, or having fun painting intellectually dishonest ones into a corner. Win.  I mean, there are other outcomes, too. For example, you could be wrong after all despite discussing with an opponent who can't find the correct points that would demonstrate your errors.

@taylormiller7913," @t.l.1610  I will never know the truth if it was or not. I have not seen anything that definitively makes me believe it was. Personally, something just doesn’t sit right with me about it. It’s all intuition based. I won’t say that it was for sure because I don’t have proof. All I can say is that it doesn’t seem right. My gut feeling just says otherwise. It’s not that I think the media lies about racism, I think they amplify it for our reaction. When Floyd first died and I saw the clip I was disgusted and believed it was an act of racism. Then after the full body cam and audio came out I watched it without any commentary, just the footage. It had nothing to do with racism and everything to do with chauvin making the wrong decision and not taking his partners advice to come off his back/neck. But everything in the media made it “white cop kills black man” Floyd would still be alive if he didn’t commit crimes and take lethal amounts of drugs. He’s not dead because of racism. I watch everything. Mainstream media (CNN, FOX etc.) political commentators left, right and center on YouTube. I don’t echo myself to one narrative. I just know that the lefts narrative is garbage and a lot of it is dishonesty disguised as moral superiority. I don’t like either political party but trump was still the better option moving forward. We get mad that our government fails us and expect that our newly elected president, someone who’s been in government for decades, part of the reason why things suck now, is all of a sudden going to make a difference? Kamala “I believe joes accusers” Harris is a fake woman and really a pathetic first female VP. She gets championed for being the first female VP but jumped ship on the women she “believed” to go work with the guy who raped them. Yeah, such a progressive display. Kamala Harris is the embodiment of what the Democratic Party has became. A fake show of pseudo moral superiority",4년 전,0,

@t.l.1610," @taylormiller7913   Sorry but that “it was the drugs that killed Floyd” narrative was just as bad as the postmortem deification some media outlets did after his death. You can read the autopsy report — he died as a direct result of having his neck kneeled on. Had that not happened, he’d still be alive. It doesn’t matter what drugs he had in his system, nor his background. Chauvin used a banned restraint technique & had a history of complaints.   The reason people were upset about Floyd’s death isn’t him specifically, it’s the broader pic of policing which was absolutely due for this level of scrutiny & some major changes. That’s not a media narrative. (Speaking as someone who’s personally seen both heroic & awful actions of police).   As to the latter part of your comment, I heartily disagree Trump was the right choice or better choice. I don’t like Biden, but Trump is a scumbag who neither cares about any of us nor has any respect for our country, institutions, or democracy. He’ll do anything to benefit himself no matter who it trods on.   People love to say “Biden has been in gov for decades & look where we are”. No one senator or rep can change the country.

@taylormiller7913," @t.l.1610  if George Floyd did not take drugs and commit crime he would not have been in that situation. That’s what I’m saying. I don’t disagree that chauvin fucked up. People need to take responsibility for themselves and what they do. Government is not the people’s parents. Racism and white supremacy is like very low at the major problems our society faces but is expanded by the media to make it seem they are the biggest problems. Not once have I heard any BLM affiliate speak on the fatherlessness rate in the black community. Instead, BLM seeks to dismantle the family unit. Again, malicious activity cloaked as humanitarianism and the sheep eat it up. We say nothing about a government system like the family court that destroys low income fathers and pushes them away from their child’s life thus resulting in a tougher life for those children without a father that increases the likelihood they commit crimes and do drugs etc., But when a white police officer does something in the line of duty to a black person it’s automatically racism and white supremacy. It’s a hypocritical system that fuels itself. No one gets it. Instead I’m just told I’m uncultured and uneducated. Instead of looking at what the media points at, I seek for myself. There’s nothing I’m going to say that will change any one of your minds. You’re hive minded to the prescribed narrative.

So they spent the last 20/30 years doing it, and along the way that propaganda ended up also luring other otherwise regular people in conservative states that are simply moronic sheeps that need to feel like they belong to the culture.

@t.l.1610," @taylormiller7913   Do you know what Floyd was stopped for? It wasn’t drugs, they had no way of knowing what was in his system ... he had no warrants, so it wasn’t “crimes” either. They had an unfounded suspicion about a bill. The only thing they could do at that point was talk to him, & only if he agreed. They had little to no legal right to detain him. Floyd wasn’t perfect. Not by a long shot. But neither is policing and it’s beyond a few bad apples. This is why we have the stereotypes of “cops with God complexes” etc.   Your view of BLM is a very common one among right leaning (predominantly) white people. But it doesn’t erase the fact that policing needs reform. For THEIR sakes as well as the community. I know lots of cops. Do you know how burned out most are by responding to overdoses, domestic violence, & suicides? Police reform doesn’t mean “cops are evil and it’s all their fault!!” They need a community support system, as does the population.   Those problems you cited with families & the family unit — how much better would those get if we had strong community support structures in place?   And is your position there’s no problems in policing, period? It’s all the faults of the people they encounter? (Yes, that’s true some of the time. Not all though).",4년 전,0,

@zwickzack,"The stereotypes about Americans are all too accurate: fat, stupid, lazy, self-centered, uncultured, etc. We're laughing at it, but it's not going to be very funny in another ten or twenty years. We need to quickly start investing in proper educations for our children so that they don't grow up to become such embarrassing adults. This education issue is not just an issue for ""the American right-wing"" or Trump supporters; it's very much a problem that can be found in all regions of the country, regardless of whatever quasi-researched political ideology that you've decided to adhere to at this particular political landscape. Also, too many of us like to think of the President as having much more ""power"" than he or she really has, something akin to a dictator or a monarch, but that's not at all the case. The President is just the highest ranking position within the Executive Branch, and although the increased use of Executive Orders has helped to make the Presidency more powerful in recent decades, the position continues to be extremely different than that of any Dictator or Monarch. For example, the Directors of the FBI and CIA alone are more ""powerful"" than the President. On a more macro scale though, billionaire banking families with empires that stretch across the world, royal families that have lasted for generations, and other such prestigious family dynasties with business strongholds in dozens of industries, hold far more influence. These ""old money"" families that have their own Coat of arms with their family shields, family crests, family mottos, generational supporters and allies of the family...are the people behind the scenes making the real, important decisions. Not a reality show host with a few properties, a couple billion dollars, a loud mouth, and some salesmanship. No. These families with hundreds of billions of dollars, that aren't on any ""Richest People in the World"" lists, have real wealth and real ""power."" Anyway, a drastic change in educating Americans on a nationwide scale is our only hope, if there's any hope left at all for the future of our Republic.",4년 전,0,

If you agree, please pass it on. It's an idea whose time has come to deal with this self-serving situation:  OUR PRESENT SITUATION !Children of Congress members do not have to pay back their college student loans.Staffers of Congress family members are also exempt from having to pay back student loans.Members of Congress can retire at full pay after only one term.Members of Congress have exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed, under which ordinary citizens must live. For example, they are exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment.And as the latest example, they have exempted themselves from Healthcare Reform, in all of its aspects.We must not tolerate an elite class of such people, elected as public servants and then putting themselves above the law.I truly don't care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent, or whatever. The self-serving must stop.Governors of 35 states have filed suit against the Federal Government for imposing unlawful burdens upon their states.It only takes 38 (of the 50) States to convene a Constitutional Convention.IF???Each person that receives this will forward it on to 20 people, in three days most people in The United States of America will have the message.Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution:""Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and/or Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply equally to the Citizens of the United States ..."" You are one of my 20.President Trump is asking everyone to forward this email to a minimum of 20 people, and to ask each of those to do likewise. In three days, most people in the United States will have the message. This is an idea that should be passed around, regardless of political party. The TRUMP Rules: Congressional Reform Act of 2017 1. No Tenure / No Pension. A Congressman/woman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they're out of office. And, no more perks go with them. 2. Congress (past, present, & future) participates in Social Security. All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people. It may not be used for any other purpose. 3. Congress must purchase their own retirement plan, just as ALL Americans do. 4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%. 5. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people. 6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people (i.e. NO MORE INSIDER TRADING!!!).7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen/women are void. The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen/women. Congress made all these contracts by and for themselves. Serving in Congress is an honor and privilege NOT a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators should serve their term(s), then go home and go back to work … not get all kinds of freebies.

@iam3gion204,"​ @PBurns-ng3gw Depends on what he was talking about. the 16th and 17th amendments were both ratified in 1913.  16th: created the nationwide income tax and was definitely helpful in giving power to the federal government.  17th: this changed Article 1 Section 3 of the constitution to allow senators of each state to be elected by the people instead of the state legislature  In a vacuum both of those would be good arguments for a ""great"" moment for America but of course outside of a vacuum there's all the, ya know, segregation and lack of womens' rights and all that.  More than likely he was referring to the 17th amendment because if theyre claiming that the presidency and senate races have been taken from the people and decided by the gov then that's the amendment they would claim has been broken. Of course that would require them to be right.  Regardless though in the context of the question he's being asked I don't think he's playing 4D chess its just cognitive dissonance",4년 전,1,

@FuddMe, @user-mk2tu  Bro masks aren’t effective against viruses. They’re invented to keep the sheep inline.  Studies have shown that surgical masks to sweet fa as well. But go ahead you keep wearing your mask forever like a good doggie.,4년 전,0,
@EmperorZelos, @FuddMe  you are however entirely factually wrong. Masks are known to work and have been so for a century. That is why surgeons always use it,4년 전,2,
@a0flj0," @FuddMe  In fact, studies have explicitly been done for COVID-19, and masks were shown to work in many different independent studies. That's so well known by now in the medical profession that nobody even thinks of talking about it anymore.  Only, masks do not work the way you expect them to work. They provide some protection to the wearer, but, depending on mask type, not very much. What they do, however, is make it significantly more difficult for the virus to go from one person to another. This means fewer people getting sick, which means hospitals can afford to take all the sick ones in and treat them properly, which means fewer people dying. The problem, when not wearing masks, is that the virus spreads a lot more easily, the number of people getting sick skyrockets, and with too many sick people hospitals don't have beds, medics, medicine, oxygen appliances and whatnot to treat all of them. And then more people die. Unnecessarily. And the ones causing their deaths are the many people not wearing masks.",4년 전,1,
@FuddMe," @a0flj0  Your claim is disputed there are studies to the contrary out there too. Let's say you're right, then healthy people don't need to wear masks as asymptomatic spread has been debunked. Therefore your claim that deaths caused by people not wearing masks is false. Those that are symptomatic should stay home as we have always done since the dawn of time. The data does not backup your assertions either as countries/states with and without mask mandates have no significant statistical differences. But hey wear a mask if you want, just don't force your scaremongering on to me.",4년 전,0,
@ines1084," @FuddMe  ok boomer, hope you personally experience covid like your president who also refused to wear mask",4년 전,0,
@a0flj0," @FuddMe  Asymptotic spread has not been debunked. It was proven to happen over a much shorter period of time, and it was proven that it is much less likely that you get the disease from asymptotic spreaders. However, because asymptotic spreaders are difficult to detect and isolate (nothing short of testing everybody daily can do this reliably), they are responsible for a large proportion of infections - ranging from as low as maybe 10% in places where people are scared and wear masks and stay away from each other to maybe 60% where people do not wear masks and do not isolate.  Countries where mask wearing and isolation was practiced thoroughly, by everybody, early on, practically got rid of the disease within a few months. Look at New Zealand. Obviously, after not having any new case for a months, they no longer enforce mask wearing. However, in that month and before it, restrictions were tougher in New Zealand than they were anywhere in the Western world - and people obeyed them. And when they got just one new case in Auckland, the whole city went into complete lockdown instantly. Which led to the new source of infection being eradicated quickly, which allowed them to eliminate restrictions again. But nobody went around the city without a mask during that new lockdown. Then look at Sweden. Sweden didn't enforce any kind of lockdown until recently. After almost a year, during which the population got angry with the government for not putting restrictions in place, officials finally admitted publicly that their strategy was a fiasco. Despite having a good health system and a population with generally good health (few obese people, few people with heart disease, few diabetics, few smokers, many people do sports on a regular basis, the only health problem they have is that a larger than average number of people are heavy drinkers), they are worse off than many poorer countries, with less healthy people and less well working health systems.  Get your data straight. Every country publishes its data. Multiple organizations centralize that data. You can find most of it on wikipedia and worldometer. John Hopkins University even has an interactive map that presents the data - by state, in the US, by country for most of the world. You can also compare the data from different sources, to see if there's any mismatch. Without relying on data, your opinions can't be anything else but baseless.",4년 전,0,

They loved being locked up with their civil liberties being taken away. Probably because the state racked up huge debt to pay them to sit on their bums.  The data shows no difference in spread with or without masks. Cases rise and fall anyway depending on the season. There has been zero excess mortality so those dying with covid would have died anyway.  Lockdowns don't work, masks don't work. Let Covid run its course naturally.

Wether its against Mexicans, people from islamic countries, Chinese Americans and African Americans Wether the virus came from China or not- its called Coronavirus. And The only one to blame in America is Donald Trump, for letting nearly a million die from the virus. Lost jobs, closed businesses, and people getting infected every day.   Trump supporters have excuses for everything and stand by nothing factual- but racist, pessimistic opinions.   Joe Biden hasn’t said anything racist to African Americans.",4년 전(수정됨),1,
@alexhussman4125," Gabriel Pollard  Everything you stated is opinionated 😂 lol its unreal how ignorant Trump supporters are about the virus. Donald Trump didnt stop any incoming flights from China till after January- he admitted knowing about Covid in November of 2019 and did absolutely nothing cause he didn’t want to create a “panic” . Do your research kid.    Covid cases in the United States is higher than any other country. With nearly 400,000 people confirmed dead and rising by the thousands daily.   You’re comparing the death tolls for swine flu in America? Do. Your. Research. “More than 212,000 Americans have currently died of COVID-19, Johns Hopkins reports.” - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/swine-flu-vs-covid-19%3famp=true   “the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been much more devastating,"" Dr. DallaPiazza says.   Clearly states thousands more deaths for covid19 as opposed to an influenza like swine flu. Comparing it to a global pandemic is baffling.   Donald Trump is to blame- for continuously ridiculing the idea of wearing masks. He has no respect for intelligent scientists, and never wears masks where he goes and it reflects to his dumbass supporters who don’t wear masks in public and around there families ultimately leading for businesses to close down!   Stupid... and the act against the capitol then? What are Trump protestors excuse for raiding the capitol like the terrorists they were. Meanwhile they still get mad at Kaepernick for kneeling 🤷🏽‍♂️",4년 전,0,

But, 100 is a population statistic. Its not like an average in school where, if everyone studies, the whole class can get an 'A'. LITERALLY HALF of the nation scores above 100 and the other half scores below. So, 50% of the population DOES NOT HAVE the capacity for higher intelligence, more cerebral discourse, or the comprehension and reasoning skills you may expect after being around more intelligent people.

Better than many who had higher IQ test scores...i also work in technical field where abstract and  logical  thinking is a must and I'm doing better than may in the same field that I personally know...perhaps you would say that I'm some kind of exception and I would agree if my son wasn't the same way....strange...",4년 전,0,

@DrxEx," @spol1622  You can certainly make that argument, and you wouldn't be alone. All tests measure the ability to take that specific test and answer those specific questions. Take a driving test, for example. Let's say I took it in California in a Prius. I get 100/100. This certainly does not display my full driving characteristics or even likelihood of getting into an accident. It just means I knew how to do well on the test. It is, however ""a measure"" of your driving ability, assuming that you're motivated to do your best. So, while we certainly cannot say IQ tests are the measure of absolute intelligence with 100% accuracy, we CAN say they are ""a measure"" of IQ for the majority of people. So, you can have a very high IQ and do poorly at school or a relatively low IQ and do well in school. Most of the things we learn in school are not hard concepts. It's memorization. Even upper division science classes in college are not incredibly demanding of high intelligence. That's more volume. Intelligence itself is fairly abstract. All that being said, I'm not getting into a car with someone that doesn't have a license bc they failed the test.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@mirzaaljic,"Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force.  Against stupidity we are defenseless; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed, and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one.  It seems obvious that stupidity is less a psychological than a sociological problem. It is a particular form of the impact of historical circumstances on human beings, a psychological concomitant of certain external conditions.  The fact that the stupid person is often stubborn must not blind us to the fact that he speaks on behalf of an empowered group. In conversation with him, one feels that one is dealing not at all with him as a person, but with slogans and catchwords that have taken possession of him.  The stupid man is under a spell… having become a mindless tool, the stupid person will also be capable of any evil and at the same time incapable of seeing that it is evil.  - Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor & theologian, imprisoned and later killed by the Nazis in WW2.",4년 전,0,

Despite having the enemies of the United States as owners of the mass media.   Thank you for keeping GOD in the country I love.   Thank you for not backing down when the weight of the world wanted to link you to an alleged Russian conspiracy, while all the mass media produced false news against you.   Thank you for having managed, against all expectations, to bring the economy to levels never seen since 1970 ... before the ""Pandemic"".

Thanks for being crude and sometimes even too much.   Thank you for defending the unborn.   Thank you for caring about school education.   Thank you for working harder than any president in my life.   Thank you for your service to this country.   Even though during his government my businesses were seriously affected by import tariffs, I know his policies were in favor of the people ... and even in my crisis, I saw hope ...!   Thank you.

@willievanstraaten1960," @desireeorozco9686  Deezaya: About Trump. Long story, try to keep short. I am South African. Follower the 2016 election and runup very closely. We only have CNN to watch USA news. 1. CNN and their constantly playing pole stats in favour of Hillary with anti-Trump reporting pissed me off. 2. I did not like Hillary. 3. In our home and with family I was the only Trump supporter and had many reasons. 4. I predicted that he would win to the dismay of all the other. I liked many of his ideas, America first, the wall, stop paying and sponsoring the whole world. He did some things that embarrassed me and was difficult to defend.  Deezaya, some of the things that changed my views. When I realised that he has some white-supremacy tendencies I did not like that but ignored it. I started getting irritated by his egocentricity. He started annoying me with silly general knowledge things (in his speeches) but in his mind, he shared information that only he knew. I was an educator for 43 years and started seeing childish patterns in his talk and behaviour.  Deezaya, I am a non-believer or non-theist. I did not like his connections to the bible belt and the evangelicals but I could live with that. However, when he posed with the Bible it was the true turning point. The recent events are just oil on my fire. There are still many South Africans that support him and find some correlations with his views. Sorry for the long story, but both views were the result of several aspects. Thanks for asking.  Where do you stand and why?",4년 전,2,
@desireeorozco9686," @willievanstraaten1960  wow. Great explain, and ty:) and welcome with us.  Well, I never liked him, I am German born and raised. A lot of his rhetoric reminded me of ww2 Germany.  Making the press the enemy, demonizing people of color..  So, my husband is Mexican, and the day Trump announced he was running, what did he say??? Horrible things about Mexicans. Lol I didn't like the white supremacists he surrounded himself with. I.E Bannon and Miller. Like what the heck, why???  The Paris accord. He left it.  U know, it's not because he is loud etc, my gosh, he could have even been a fun president of sorts. But he went way way way to far right.  I despise him, and moreso his ignorant voters, who now look like cult followers. Like Jim Jones style. It's sick.  And last week, well, I'm with you 100% but it goes deeper. Remember how black people were treated last, year whilst marching? Why didn't this happen last week?  I hate him.  I don't care if he falls over. And I'm not usually one to say that. He caused so much heartbreak for sooooo many people of all walks of life with his right wing agenda, and today he got impeached for the second time. Good riddance. 😠😠",4년 전,2,

He incited a mob that attacked the Capitol — and killed a police officer — while Congress was meeting to certify the result. Afterward, Trump praised the rioters.  This behavior was consistent with Trump’s entire presidency. He has previously rejected the legitimacy of election results and encouraged his supporters to commit violence. He has tried to undermine Americans’ confidence in the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the military, Justice Department prosecutors, federal judges, the Congressional Budget Office, government scientists, government health officials and more.

And that is not identity politics and playing the victim. Something I tend to see more on the ""left"" than on the ""right"".

The cowboy hat guy literally stands there and say that slogans he expects to hear from Trump as if hoping that the favorite track of the band is going to be played live... Only problem is that politics is not like going to a rock concert. Politics deals with running the state, governing and it impacts lives, it's not there to get the frontline listeners knickers wet. Sad thing is, it's not only in USA, but all around the world.

@omennemo2364," @keithmuset6510 I do that a lot. I saw December 2020, I do not often watch these things. When all the murders of innocent people, the COVID19, and the fires. I began watching the various channels because it seems like all of this was just thrusted upon us at one time. In my state we have never had 48 fires all at once. As I began perusing through the various articles, I was very surprised at what was going on. I only started watching the news since Jan 2020. I stopped watching because I was getting depressed and didn't know who to believe as I found out that these news channels are bought by various politicians. Depending on what one chooses to believe, it can cause a lot of confusion and misinformation being spread throughout the communities. So I like  channels where I can see people saying or doing things. I just saw Klepper's interviews a couple of weeks ago I thought he was a funny guy. I like comedy it helps me get through the day. As for dates and times. At the age of 72, time means very little to me. I often forget what day it is and I don't pay attention to the time. Just yesterday, I woke up at 5 am the next day and I thought it was still Monday and realized later on it was the following morning.

The way they sidestep their own self-reflections and support of their opinions by simply pointing a finger towards some imaginary opposition or yet another uneducated non-fact? The ridiculous conspiracy theories??? Quanon? PIZZA GATE?  Yet they don't bat an eye that Trump was friends for decades with Epstein and wished his girlfriend well in prison as she is charged with child molestation, child trafficking, c******* yada yada yada???? I often ask my trump supporter friends if they actually pay attention to Trump and Followers during live broadcast, Congressional or house hearings, live speeches on a regular basis? Because I was glued to all live presentations either on TV or the radio I would compare later with the news stations were reporting or not reporting.  My friends are really good people and I was shocked to find their inner beliefs about our world that would cause them to support the beast called Trump. I will say the few that I have confronted in a loving way about what they actually know about Trump and what they actually know about what's literally going on and has gone on- none of them pay attention to anything but the conspiracy theories unfortunately. So I think it's up to all Republicans from start to finish that either supported and repeated his lies, supported and repeated or created alternative facts, those who created distractions or made accusations on the other side, manufactured stories and chaos all of these years really need to be held accountable both legally and they have lost their privilege to serve this great country. They have continually thrown tinder  on the ball of flame that is Trump, they have a lie to their own supporters and put it them against their own best interests and will surely never lift a finger to do anything that would benefit them and will only suck them dry to benefit himself. I can't believe that the Democrats and the other high officials are not absolutely demanding that he be held accountable for all of his actions that are amoral and illegalthere recorded for the world to actually see. I fear that if they don't bring the hammer down hard on each and every one that contributed to this absolute dictator with  brain damage , suffered great indignations and emotional abuse from an evil father, and himself has a giant ego to distract from the fact that he is absolutely terrified of being anything less than Grand. Let's add the fact that he has complete and absolute, bona fide textbook,  narcissistic personality disorder, and thereby has no conscience or concern for anyone but himself as he displays freely and always. Not only should he be stripped of the ability to hold power now but ever, and he needs to go to prison for a very very long time like for the rest of his life, be prosecuted for all his former illegal activity and tax evasion so that he goes broke. God forbid this man continue his rotten, evil, self serving, destructive, bigoted, backwards thinking, ignorant, dangerous message of hate, confusion, and chaos. We must not allow him to feed his dilusions of demigoddery and grandiosity. He is dangerous. He is responsible for more that just the murders at the Capitol. He is responsible for the violence and attacks on peaceful protestors against police murdering the black people. Trump degradedthe good people standing up for themselves and their community. He willfully requested tear gas on rubber bullets for his little picture in front of a church. He offered me a supportive words for that fight only threw hate, lies, and condemnation at the peaceful protestors. We need to take him out and does at the top in the White House and in the capital are the ones that need to do it. I have never hated anyone more nor have I hated so many people this much. and that is not the person I used to be for years ago. FU Trump, his sons, his political synchophants, unqualified appointees, and those who offered themselves up as shields for the beast to hide behind. I am not a religious person however I believe in a higher power. over the past five years I've gotten more acquainted as I've questioned so much of what all of you have said and done and caused and denied and is actually sat in a horror as you said bigoted abusive amoral actions throughout our country and our neighbors. Kids in cages is enough to steal your Fates. But there is so much more. There will be no atonement for the level evil you have displayed and participated in and supported. None of you are any better than Hitler himself. I just think creator you did not gain enough momentum or power because I have no doubt you would have done much worse. May Creator/ your God  have mercy on your souls. I hope you remember you call yourselves Christians, Catholics, people loyal to a God. I hope you are haunted for all time for  all the illegal and evil deeds, and all the decent people you defamed and degraded, all the indecent, inhumane, and bigoted, self-serving  actions you  committed or assisted in will NOT get you into the promised  land. All you can do is repent by admission, accept reaponsibility, and  consequences , set the record strait by admitting the lies, deception, etc. resign and promise never to be a civil servant or hold any power, and when you get out of prison,if you survive, live a quiet life. And start praying for a less painful area in hell. you do not get to go to heaven when you hold so much power and wield it to deceive so many innocents, cause the level and degree of harm you all have caused humanity in general, you don't get to go to the promised land / heaven / Nirvana / Nowhere Sincerely, Not Raven, just his mom",4년 전,1,

@equestriangirly2296,"Their slogan is:""Make America Great Again.""  So this stupid lady in 5:42 saying ""It's always been great."" seems to have missed this whole make and again part. When asked when exactly America was great so that we have to go back to that stage she replies:""We're not going back, we're going forward."" These idiots can't even follow their own baby logic.  Ironically she is inadvertently right - America is going forward, and Trump being voted out of power is the first step in the right direction.   As for the 1950's being ""great times"". Read the handbooks for urban housewives on how to be ""good wives"" and you'll think it's straight off a black comedy. No wonder HLA immunity tests for organ transplants in the 1990's revealed that 1 in every 6 Americans born in the 50's actually have a different biological father than the one their mothers were married to. Yes, that was probably the mailman, the plumber or the local casanova. And if you happened to be born black and lived in some of the Southern states - well, let's just say that you'd be wise not to walk alone at night unless you wanted to be lynched by the local KKK group. Then there was McCarthyism which basically was as close as the Spanish Inquisition America ever got to with a witch-hunt on people and a travesty of justice.   As for rock'n roll music. Kids had to hide their singles by black musicians such as Little Richard and Chuck Berry from their parents. Heaven forbid what could happen to their ""pure souls"" if they listened to degenerate, black, music or even ""the devil's music"".",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@Aric-Haldan," @NickAlpha_  ​ ah, classical whataboutism. Not only do you seek to somehow legitimize unacceptable behaviour by pointing out other problems, you also immediately switch over to another comparison as soon as you realize your first comparison doesn't work. I could sit here and refute your every word, point out every error in your false comparisons and you would just keep coming up with new other events that you think are somehow comparable. As though that would somehow make the actions of those who assaulted the US capitol less criminal. Are you really surprised you can't convince someone with that kind of weak and flawed argumentation ?  Btw there were indeed violent elements in the BLM movement, including a desire for revolution. It didn't quite go as far as attacking the symbol of American democracy itself and trying quite literally to overthrow the government, but there was a desire to force through change. But all that people are really asking is that these trump supporters are treated the exact same way that violent BLM protests were being treated, namely as criminals. Also note that no big politician on the left had been inciting violence or making inflamatory speeches. If they were, people would have demanded them to be brought to justice in very much the same way that they now desire Trump to be put on trial. And all of that even disregards the fact that the BLM movement is about personal safety of black citizens, while the capitol attack was about trying to dictate policy and overthrow the democratic process entirely. It even disregards the fact that Civil rights movements have been complaining about those very specific problems for decades before and have protested peacefully in the past without result, while the Trump campaign only started protesting election rules after they had already lost the election. If the Trump administration had tried to act beforehand, putting in systems to detect or prevent fraud before the election no one would have complained. But it is pretty clear that if they had won, then they would have had no problem with it being a fraudulent election.  PS: I'm not American either.",4년 전(수정됨),37,

@Aric-Haldan," @NickAlpha_  Trump supporters tried to overrun the senate. Trump arguably tried to take control of a seperate power. If you want to argue semantics, perhaps you can say it wasn't overthrowing the government when you define the government as solely being the executive branch, but then it just turns into a coup d'état, which really isn't much better. Either way it's a power grab trying to hijack the democratic process.  PS: Your argument, that Trump is the leader of the executive and therefore embodies the government, also only works if you consider the overunning and hijacking of congress as the will of Trump, which would de facto make Trump a criminal wanna be dictator trying to destroy US democracy.

The real difference here is the scale and the historical motivation of action.  Of the people who showed up at Capital Hill, a significant portion if not the majority were ready to commit crimes and violence.  There really was no message of peaceful protest, only that they felt entitled to undermine democracy.

@katharsis7957," @ThePhlubber  im not saying that violence is ever okay, I’m just giving the actual number that 93% of BLM demos were peaceful. Yes, there were a few non peaceful participants, but 1) they expressively don’t represent the entirety of BLM and 2) many of those incidents were provoked by police as well. Amnesty international felt compelled to put out a report analysing over 120 serious human rights violations by law enforcement towards medics, journalists, legal observers, and peaceful protestors. I mean, we all remember police destroying water bottles that BLM gave to the cops, right? People being pulled into unmarked vans? Pushing old people to the floor? Straight up driving into a group of completely peaceful people? And at some point, I imagine it gets harder and harder to just turn the other cheek. I wasn’t there, but I imagine that there’s a certain tension in the air if you get attacked by the people who are supposed to protect you attack you for exercising a constitutional right.   Still, all I’m saying is 93% of the demos were peaceful in spite of that . 100% of capitol stormings were not peaceful. And yes, obviously the political motive is extra troubling. But I can’t stand to hear one more trump supporter bringing up BLM protests as an example of „the other side“ being violent too, because that’s not comparable. Not by motivation, not by the response they were met with by law enforcement, and not by the violent demeanour that was exhibited by the very first second.",4년 전,10,

@iam3gion204," @NickAlpha_   First dont make an argument and when proven wrong suddenly decide it doesnt matter anymore. Second you are correct it was not a coup but only because it failed. It was an attempted coup.  Coup: a sudden, violent, and illegal seizure of power from a government.  What happened at the capital?  A bunch of people pulled up one morning (Sudden) and forced their way through the doors beating police officers, wrecking and pillaging the building, and stealing classified documents (illegal and violent) all while armed with guns, molotov cocktails, bombs, nooses, ropes and death threats (also violent and illegal) Why did they do it?  In an attempt to stop the electoral college from certifying the results of the election and to stop the duly elected president from taking office (seizing control of the government)  Now I dont know if where you live coup means something completely different but here we use this definition and what happened at the capital was a textbook coup.   As far as your comments being about peace? No most of them are whataboutisms. As far as the ones actually suggesting peace what a novel idea. In fact why dont you take a time machine back to the American civil war and make your argument for them. ""Hey guys just get along?"" I mean if we know anything its that ignoring large societal problems is a great way to make sure they dont get any worse right? Your argument is the equivalent of ""No no dont try that man for murder. Dont be mad at him. He already did it just move on""  And heres the thing I dont disagree with you in saying that ultimately the goal should be close the divide. I even agree that the political parties in America are polarizing. But to sit here and say that people should just move on 1 week after our capital was invaded. To say we should just ignore it when there are 70 million trump supporters actively attempting to over throw a duly elected president. And to say that everyone should just get along when people are going to be staying home and avoiding the capitals of every state on Jan. 20th out of fear of being caught up in a violent mob of Trump supporters out to fight against the inaguration. To say all that is ignorant and useless.   Also you absolutely can fight fire with fire. In fact its one of the best ways to fight a fire. Furthermore if by ""fight fire"" you mean an attempted coup and the desire to undermine our democratic process and by ""with fire"" you mean taking the appropriate legal action as laid out in the constituion for these exact situations then yes we absolultely should fight fire with fire.  You wanna know how you avoid Erdogans Turkey? Because its not by ignoring mounting problems leading us in that direction. Its by not letting a subset of your country instill an authoritarian dictatorship and overthrow the entire democratic process by violently putting a non duly elected president in power against the will of the people",4년 전(수정됨),2,

If you google the word coup you will see pictures of heavily armed men in uniforms and tanks not an angry mob with sticks. I live in Greece and we had a coup almost 50 years ago and a civil war 70 years ago, so i know very well what i am talking about.   Yes i say exactly that, to get along because if you dont it will be worse. We had here in Greece a civil war 70 years ago between the right wing and the communist party,  as i told you and now you will see our politicians even if they hate eachother, they dont even think about pushing the button. Thats the problem in America, the politicians dont know where to stop and ppl are watching and following and that is sad you know.  Whats the appropriate legal action against 70 million Trump supporters? Put them in Prison, Fire them from their jobs, shut their voices, make them scape goats? Thats exactly what Erdogan is doing right now in his country, and he actually had a real coup attempt from inside the army and now ppl are coming to my country almost daily asking for political asylum and over there the mess continues. He was elected too, he got 40% or more, but also he also suppressed the opposition badly in ways you dont want to know. Lets not talk about Morsy in Egypt, he was elected too, and what happened next, he began chasing the opposition, the army took over to save the situation and Morsy died in jail.

We also had a civil war which none of us were alive for so how does that mean you know more than us? Just because people didn’t storm into the capitol with hundreds of guns doesn’t mean it wasn’t an attempt to destroy democracy, there were enough people to overrun the limited police that were present. I don’t support the violence over the summer or the violence on the 6th but justifying one with the other is a big issue. We are divided because we have a president and congress who continue to favor their side instead of the country as a whole.

@stevenfisher7486, @NickAlpha_  that was not my point. My point is you don’t know any better than any of us. No sane person wants a civil war or a war in general because we see the effects of them.

@shiry3487,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲(𝘀) 𝗼𝗳 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆  America is in a state of deep scrutiny. So is humanity. Today’s America presents the future state of humanity: If the world advances the way America is advancing, we will end up being divided between two blocs that hate each other in every sense—ideologically, approach to life, culture, education, and every other way. It will be impossible to connect the adversaries, just as it is impossible to connect the Democrats with the Republicans in today’s divided United States.  As things are, there will be no calm. It seems as though things have gone out of control, but they haven’t. It is simply what happens when the ego wants to govern and will not hear of anything less than that. It does not want connection; it wants domination.  It may be horrifying to watch, but we are merely witnessing the natural process. When everything revolves around who has more and who has less, and when the ego keeps intensifying, we come to a state where the ego wants everything, and to leave absolutely nothing to the other side. This is what you get when you don’t educate people.  It doesn’t matter how much you invest in aid packages and relief programs, when the ego comes to a state of all or nothing, nothing helps. Therefore, we should thank America for the example it is giving us, at its own expense. We should thank the American people for setting an example that demonstrates what our future will be like unless we achieve unity among us. In other words, if we don’t achieve a united state in humanity, humanity will become like today’s United States: an assortment of nations, colors, races, and faiths that hate each other to death, and do everything they can to cater to their hatred.",4년 전,0,

You don't want to become a Muslim, even after you've watched all the videos no problem, you don't want to watch the videos no problem everyone can live as they want in islam there is no compulsion. but remember i  bring you the truth to save you. on judgment day you will not be able to say no one cleared me up, no one told me the truth i was influenced oh please forgive me, but then it is unfortunately already too late because this life is a Test and it ends with your death. oh Allah forgive us guid us ....  Important if you have a problem with that things, that i say. blame me not Islam. Islam is perfect i´m not. If you strugle with the qestion, why i waste my time for this videos or similar, dont lie to your self. you waste already your time. The first thing that the Devil try is to bring you away from the truth to his way. Example you watch films, series, something on TV, play games and other things that pass the time. that bring you fun, but not everything that is fun is good for you. in the end you lose time. so you could think of these videos  from the links as a kind of series, wich is very exciting btw. and watch a video every day as an example, or every week as you like. in the end, even if you can't do anything with it, you have at least learned something about Islam one of the Bigest Religions in this world and the fast growing.  And you really can't see that as a waste of time, can you?  Why ? Because knowledge is power.  but remember the Devil and his follower will try everything to keep you away from this knowledge and to distract you with worldly things.  if you disagree with what I say and mark it as a lie prove to me that I am lying but pls watch first all videos that saves time.  Of course you can  make kritik on me, for my bad grammar and English skills. I know that im not good at this,  but i hope i write it in a way, that you can it understand. Thats  the important thing. I know that my brother dont make this mistakes  he is a english,history teacher and make his Doctor and have much more knowledge than me. even at his acts he is better than me.  Maybe he laugh when he se this and see how bad my english is haha i will laugh with him. The point is im not my brother he have also his mistakes,  like me like you and every human being. Muslim, means,the one who submission to the will of Allah. Not that you a perfect person.  In the eyes of Allah it is important how you behave and decide wath in your heart is, and not your reputation, your knowledge, your appearance, even if you are a King who looks good, who knows a lot and does good. A person who has nothing, doesn't look good, has little knowledge and does good; can be much higher in the eyes of Allah.  Example Even if I did not believe in Allah and his Prophet, I would have to admit to myself, after all the knowledge I have acquired about Islam and all the things I have seen and heard, that Islam is the most logical and best way for people , Animals and this world.  Look at this beautiful world, how the animals, trees, all life lives in harmony with this planet and everything around this complex system that clearly comes in harmony and  how balance this exists.  And now look at the people we have Good and Bad , who are using this planet and acting in their favor, all of these bad qualities and not living in harmony. Where's The Justice, Why are it  The people who don't belong here and seem out of place. If You Come with a open mind and heart you will see that Islam is the only logical way that gives you the answer. At the End  you can belive in atheism, or evrey other Religion  for me its fine i have also non Muslim Friends and i respect every human i dont want to hurt anyone its your choice no one can force you stay with love ^^.   Do you accept islam, do not think that you have to change your life completely now everything comes with time inshallah  Inshallah means, so Allah wants, because nothing happens without his will https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgm3puP3tMA /The 99 Names of Allah.  You only need take Shahada in Arabic and your language with full believe to become a Muslim: that is the seed that that you put. With time you give the seed water, thats the way .when you learn something ,thats your water, when you do something good ,thats  your water, when you follow the rules of Islam thats your water, when you pray thats your water,  that you give to the seed.  So your seed grows slowy with this inshallah, you will become a flower. Wath happen when you stop giving water to a flower ? so dont stop :) pray to Allah  guide me und you get never lost inshallah.>-",4년 전(수정됨),0,

He’s been doing it since the beginning of Trumpism, and I can show many proofs.    There is nothing he won’t lie about - even events that were videotaped, he’ll tell obvious lies about it, knowing his cult will never fact check him, as you don’t care if he abuses your trust. In fact, you welcome dishonorable behavior and you demonize dissent. Any conservative who calls out any of Trump’s contradictions or lies, is immediately thrown under the bus, ostracized and demonized.   That’s what happens in cults — read a book on them and maybe you’ll someday find the courage to fight this horrible thing Trump did to you.   I feel sorry for you, as you’re dealing with something that’s very much like a drug addiction — it’s habitual and extremely hard to break out of...very detrimental to your mental, emotional and physical health.

Even if he tried that illegal stunt, the Supreme Court would have immediately over-ruled it for being blatantly unconstitutional.   Trump was told by every constitutional scholar that what he was asking of Pence is completely impossible and illegal, but he stomped his feet, ignored what he didn’t want to hear, and  just like a petulant child,  lied to you, giving you false hope.   Trump takes his base for complete fools who’ll never fact-check or question him, and you guys never disappoint with your sycophantic (cult-like) servitude.

@monmixer,Guess who is paying for the wall. The hard working middle class tax paying citizen. the exact same people who pay the highest percentage of taxes and especially federal income tax than any other group in the country or on earth that does business in this country. Also the exact same group that can't get any help when they need it because of this pandemic because Congress has given our tax money that we paid away to the billionaires and corporations that actually don't pay any federal income tax. I think we should start looking at tax payers like we do insurance policies. When you get help you get help based on the amount of money that you paid into the fund that is going to help you. you aren't entitles to money that some one else paid in taxes. that would be socialism and that's exactly what is happening right now and has been for ever. The middle class and working poor are paying for everything and get very little help when we need it. Especially if we make between 15 and 100 grand a year.,4년 전,0,

@derrickcox4233,"There are those who criticize Trump's ongoing effort to question the legality of the election process. He has that right. This is America and we are free to litigate on matters of importance. Biden may or may not have won the election legally, however, I do not feel Biden was deserving of the presidency. Here is why: I will keep this short: Burisma Holdings Limited (Ukrainian: Бурісма Холдингс) is a holding company for a group of energy exploration and production companies. It is based in Kyiv, Ukraine, but registered in Limassol, Cyprus. Burisma Holdings has operated in the Ukrainian natural gas market since 2002. It is one of the largest private natural gas producers in Ukraine. It is owned by Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky through his company Brociti Investments Limited. Ukraine was seeking to extricate itself from such corruption and transition to a more effective and legally clean capitalism.  Zlochevsky, who owns Burmisa, is known to be a huge part of that corruption and gave a 7 million dollar bribe to his government not to investigate him. Hunter Biden was put on that very same Burisma Board (who knows why? Unless it was to enrich an American who could not enrich himself?) Acting Vice President, Joe Biden, was then informed that a top Ukrainian Prosecutor was going after Zlochevsky, and VP Biden threatened Ukraine to remove this prosecutor...which they promptly did. Hunter Biden was then paid over 4 million dollars for being on the board, and was given several million more for related associations.  During this time, Hunter Biden engaged in business deals with China, including one which evolved giving military-grade anti-vibration technology to the Chinese government. The glaring conflict of interest was overlooked by the Obama administration, since Joe Biden was the Vice President. Instead they created out of thin air a diversion accusing Trump of conniving with the Russians. This was actually the brain-child of Hunter Biden to distract from his own corruption. It worked for a while, because he knew anything bad said about Trump...the DNC, Media, and the Left would eat it up, and detract from the reality. We are responsible for our evil. Those who voted Biden in will suffer consequences...as will we all. Btw...many Democrats are in the money with China...which is why they target Russia instead of China. Why would not anyone see that both are a concern?",4년 전,0,

@emilsinclair4190, @aljirou29  actually it isn't. There is even a social mobility index. And unlike your undefined word opportunity the social mobility is defined.   Take a look at how many people change their social class and you can see this.  Lol. To show you why your point of view is wrong I will use an example:  Let's say that the one system sends every child into school. The other system does not send anyone into school. The second system will only enable some to change their social class. The first system will enable more people to change their social class.  Hard work is good in both systems. But in systems with a higher    social mobility hard work is more likely to be successful.   I could also use human psychology to support my position.   Or that it is unlikely that we have a free will.   But this would change our debate.  So: how do you define opportunity?  And isn't there also bad opportunity? Things like stealing? Or killing?,4년 전(수정됨),0,
@aljirou29," @emilsinclair4190  I don't care if social mobility is defined.  So is systemic racism.  My point is that both are used by critics of America to concoct the most contrived examples to support their one-sided narrative.  In this case, you want to excuse the lack of effort by an individual with the ridiculous claim that society is holding people down.  And yes, we have free will.  To claim otherwise is preposterous.  WE decide what to do with our time.  WE decide to delay gratification.  WE decide to keep our ass in the chair in front of a computer at work when we'd rather be doing other things.  Frederick Douglass used to walk miles just to read a book.  So did Lincoln.  So did anyone with a thirst for knowledge.  These excuse-o-rama's today can't even make it to the local library or spend time using their phones and the Internet to make something of themselves.  All they want to do is whine.",4년 전,0,
@emilsinclair4190, @aljirou29  ... your thesis itself is wrong.   I will show you why: just because something is possible this does not means that it is easy or good.  You used the perfect example: yes it is possible to walk 20 km to school. But it would be way easier and more efficent for you to just walk 5 km.  This higher efficiency also creates a bigger output. The time you don't need to walk you can practice. This makes you better than other people.   Actually people that know way more about the human mind than I or you do don't belive in the free will.  One example is professor kay-michael voit.  Also: facts don't care about your feelings. There is no evidence that we have a free will. Yes. We only find biological and chemical processes in our mind. Nothing supernatural which would be needed for a free will.   And you have not defined the word opportunity. So what is opportunity. How can we measure it.   I would say that the social mobility index is a good measurement if it. Why? Because more opportunities make it so that more people succed.  One example: if you only except 100 people at your uni 100 people will be able to get their degree. If you accept more more people are likely to have a degree.   The job market is a good example: if you can choose between countless jobs it is more likely that you will find a job you are realy good at.  And if we just take a look at the facts you are the person that whines because people don't agree with you. You are the person that things it is preposterus to make it easier for people to succed.  You also totally dismissed factors like luck or different skills. Tell a child than can not walk to walk 20 km.   And you also totally missed that working smarter is more efficient than working harder.   And you forgot that in countries with a similar culture the system itself is the reason fordifferences.,4년 전(수정됨),0,

The how something is spend is far more important than the topic it is spend on.   Your comment about criminals makes no sense. Since we don't have a free will our minds need bad examples and consequences to follow rules. Or else we would just try countless things.  https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/  There is also no evidence for anything like a free will in your human mind. A true free will would need to violate the laws of science.   And I read your article. And this article itself just proves my position. Why? Let's take a look at the details.   He clearly proved that actions are caused by your brain. Theirfore we know that to have a free will we would need some reactions in the cells without any natural explanation for this reaction.  His conclusion is also not very good. Why? Because his stimulation was relative primitive. We know that our human mind is way more than our nerves. Our I is most likely an emergent property of our entire mind. So when one part of your mind is stimulated but the rest is not it is likely that the person will realise that.,4년 전(수정됨),0,

@aljirou29," @emilsinclair4190  ""A true free will would need to violate the laws of science.""  Sorry, but science doesn't explain everything.  The article doesn't prove your point at all.  It distinguishes between physical stimulation and the will of the individual.  When asked why they moved their arm or leg or whatever, the patient responds with ""I didn't.  You did.""  My comment about criminals makes perfect sense.  If they have no free will, they will just repeat the bad behavior, so no sense in letting them loose.  It's incredibly insulting to tell someone like myself who has worked exceptionally hard doing a lot of things I didn't want to do that we have no free will.  We do.  I can personally guarantee that I forced myself to do things I would rather not have done to achieve my goals.  The whole ""we don't have free will"" movement is just another way of allowing people to ditch responsibility for their current status in life.   My brain told me not to put in the work.  Uh huh.",4년 전,0,
@emilsinclair4190," @aljirou29  well I dont care how much it hurts your feelings. Because it is most likely the truth.  I read the article. And while the author may don't understand that this article actually supports my position I outlined why it supports my position. Why? Because it proved that actions are caused by the brain. I already explained to you that such a primitive stimulus is not enough to manipulate your brain into the belive that it did it.   There is also another experiment that perfectly supports my point. In your brain you can see an action way earlier than a signal starts to travel to your arm.   This perfectly shows us that the act of moving your arm itself is way more complex than just the output signal. Simulating the output signals without everything before causes the experience the people had.   But I already mentioned that this does no prove a free will.   To do that I would need countless different, much more focused stimulus.    Your claim that science does not explain everything is only right if we add a big yet.  Science does not explain everything yet. But with every year we understand more and the free will looks less likely .  Now about your part with criminals: no. A lack of a free will is not a lack of change. Not living things also change constantly. Our human mind is a computer with cide that changes because of our experience. The experience of prisons changes the likelihood of another crime from you. It is like the creation of a stone weapon. The stone alone is useless. Only after you have formed the stone into a spear you can hunt.  It is not a way to ditch responsibility. Why? Well for that you need to understand a different system of justice. You are not punished because you did something wrong and were at fault. No you are punished to encourage certain behaviour and make a different behaviour less likely.   I totally belive your struggle. A missing free will does not make this suffering impossible.  It is actually a good example why some people continue while others give up. Because a combination of their Gene's and their nuture caused them to give up.  Your actions to force yourself are just not the result of a free will. They are caused by your Gene's and your environment.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

I don’t get it because my old doc gave me ketamine and obviously insurance covered it. But he was a genius at getting insurance to cover things, and he was a cancer brilliant cancer doc. Some of my Friend’  take Kratom but I can’t my doc says no. And it’s hard to know how much to take, and I don’t want to guess. It also tastes hideous taste, I couldn’t take that taste cause you take it with water or liquid. And nothing kills that nasty taste.   I tell ya what if your pain gets bad ketamine is not an opiate and my cousin says some folks just get it by veterinary and take a small amount of that. I guess they order it though I figure the DEA will stop that. Anyway, it killed my severe pain in knee and back for two months. That was the injections. I know the loop in Chicago takes insurance and does the spray and the IV too although they only do one type at a time. I wish you the best. Be careful with your liver, you don’t want that hurt.   I’m a Louisiana cajien so if I do drink I usually drink a good wine, I have some wealthy cajien friends down in grand isle, Louisiana that introduced me to some good wines.

I bought some good German beer in Portland where I lived for a year, that my ex boyfriend loved. It may have been Dutch it was green colored. And I worked for the “denamarkians” as a beer model for “Jarlsberg” and it was good.   If you come down my way you gotta go try the Louisiana beer here at the draft houses. Chafunkta in mandeville, la has like vanilla and coffee flavor. And they got one where I am up in north la   now called great raft, which I have to try and let you know, hear it’s real good. Say the spring seasonal is delicious. They got oil rail brewing  in mandeville, la  too. That’s an old German brewery. Goes back got good ratings and is pretty well known nationally. Bayou teche (sound like tesh) Saison D’ Excrevisse and this tastes really good with Louisiana boiled crawfish. Nola brewing is in New Orleans with Nola funk series. Court yard brewery sonic youth in Nola. Parish Brewery Ghost in the machine in Broussard la. ( say it like brew sard) then we got Arpent in Arabi, la brewery Deutsche Has Oktoberfest we have Oktoberfest down here too because many Cajuns have German in them.

@bobbihearn6168," Busted Taco  since you're lost, I'll explain. When the Spanish influenza made it's debut, people didn't want to take it seriously. In fact they claimed it was a hoax and that Germany created it to cause mass panic. When told to wear masks to prevent the spread of such a deadly illness, many (if not most people) laughed and said it wouldn't work. They ignored safety regulations and it spread like wildfire. Vicks Vapor rub even took out an add in the paper claiming their products could fight the influenza better than anything (and they weren't the only company) it was, of course, a lie. Any of this sound familiar? Probably not to you, but it's literally how people have reacted to the coronavirus. That alone should frighten people because had people followed the safety guidelines and wore their masks the influenza would have been under control, but they didn't and it lasted a long time. You, and people like you, claim that covid is nothing more than the flu and you don't even know how bad the influenza pandemic was. And you want to go back to very first flus and colds, with the fact that medicines weren't around much back then, more died back then as well.",4년 전,1,
@hansmahr8627,"The CDC recommends wearing masks, stop spreading lies you've read on Facebook. Countless studies have proven the effectiveness of masks in reducing the risk of infection. Obviously the effectiveness depends on the type of mask you're using. Doctors have been using masks for decades but I guess some random idiot on the internet just knows more than doctors and researchers.  Let me quote some stuff from the actual CDC website https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html  'CDC recommends community use of masks, specifically non-valved multi-layer cloth masks, to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Masks are primarily intended to reduce the emission of virus-laden droplets (“source control”), which is especially relevant for asymptomatic or presymptomatic infected wearers who feel well and may be unaware of their infectiousness to others, and who are estimated to account for more than 50% of transmissions.'  ' Cloth masks not only effectively block most large droplets (i.e., 20-30 microns and larger)9 but they can also block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles (also often referred to as aerosols) smaller than 10 microns ;3,5 which increase in number with the volume of speech10-12 and specific types of phonation.13 Multi-layer cloth masks can both block up to 50-70% of these fine droplets and particles3,14  and limit the forward spread of those that are not captured.5,6,15,16 Upwards of 80% blockage has been achieved in human experiments that have measured blocking of all respiratory droplets,4 with cloth masks in some studies performing on par with surgical masks as barriers for source control.'  'A retrospective case-control study from Thailand documented that, among more than 1,000 persons interviewed as part of contact tracing investigations, those who reported having always worn a mask during high-risk exposures experienced a greater than 70% reduced risk of acquiring infection compared with persons who did not wear masks under these circumstances.'  'A study of an outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an environment notable for congregate living quarters and close working environments, found that use of face coverings on-board was associated with a 70% reduced risk.'

So don't speak as if you know me. You have no idea what my beliefs, education, thoughts, and life experiences are. You can't pigeon hole a person based on some YouTube comments. That's called stereotyping. You get all pissy when someone lables you a white supremacist because you support Trump, but 10 seconds later you do the same thing to someone who expresses different beliefs.   I never ""spit on Trump"" as a person. I was pointing out how he's got all of by the nose. You follow blindly without bothering to check if what he says is valid. He's lying to your faces but you've had so much Kool-aid that you can't see past your own damn noses. You all also go on and on about he rescued the economy....but that same economy had been trending upwards for 6 years prior to Trump's election.   If you're as rich as as you say you are, then you're part of the problem. People just sit on piles of more money than you could spend in a lifetime. Meanwhile, people are dying because they don't even have access to clean water. In areas where the daily wage is less than $0.25 a day, the couple hundred dollars it costs to dig a proper well might as well be a trillion dollars. For  $10 a month, a child could be able to  go to school and learn how to pull their family out of debt. Christ, Jeff Bezos' income in 2019 could feed and provide basic healthcare for the entire global population.

But more anti-trump or Pro buying rhetoric is it this point in my opinion, used up. Now it's just an excuse for the left to run all over things, possibly opening up borders and I don't like that idea.

So far as what anybody says on here that's straight malice, I just discard them after trying to engage in a real conversation until I eventually say screw it and run out of patience because it's not going anywhere. Also, both parties need to back off. Democrats got what they wanted, and that wasn't Biden , ALL they cared about was getting Trump out, nothing more and that was the motivation as you know on the left. Now the right sees Congress and the White House underneath Democrat control, marginally, and as they become more steadfast, angry and vitriolic in their agenda and with what they say, can't say that I blame Repubs for getting scared and now pissed, hoarding guns and ammunition multiple automatic firearms in every household around here (east coast) . I think every gun and bullet in this whole area I live in has been bought in preparation for the worst. Short example of the victriolic nature of this bullshit that is what is cornering divided people w assault rifles. I was watching a Buzzfeed video for a laugh trying to convince me to go vegetarian or whatever and they called me an asshole in the middle of video asking ""why the fuck aren't you a vegan yet.""  Yeah these people certainly love to dish it out but they can't take it. Yet, over 50% of the country Is ready to battle it out with the other 50%  and we're all fascists of course, which is the exact opposite of what fascism really is but try telling that to a snowflake or someone who's never actually had to do for themselves before. Even the capital, I need to research it and do a little bit more cross-referencing on the faces but a lot of those people look real familiar, like Sandy Hook and other false-flag tragedies that our leaders have used for  personal agendas and gain. If I match up any more than three or four faces from prior false Flags to just recently, and we all know bulshit when we smell it.  you can check it out too, this is something that I've been looking at for 5-6 years now and it's often the same damn people and every single one, paid actors.

There's one huge problem with some of the mail-in ballots and that the paper was never folded when you fold something to put into a envelope it leaves a permanent Kris so if they never were mailed and they must have been printed for the purpose of stacking the vote in the favor Joe Biden, facts. In Georgia they told voters that it was a water leak and everyone had to leave the building but that turned out to be a lie they did that to change the voting machines for Biden to win. In some states the government sent out a million plus mail-in ballots and over two million came back how can more come back then the government sent out?",4년 전,0,

@lowemichael03," gerizzy YMcrew   I at one time used to live in Georgia I moved away 4 years ago, I was trying to show my mom how to check to see if her mail in ballot was received so I put my information in for example and it said that mine was received in Georgia even though I haven't been there for years. So because of that I was unable to vote in the state that I currently reside in because of fear of being accused of voting in two places in the same election. So with that being said I know there was voter fraud the point that I also made is enough to reverse the results.

Ps Elisabeth Warren couldnt win the nominee on any scenario on the end but he clearly was teaming against Bernie Sanders so she stay only to get 40% of peoples vote who WOULD OTHER WISE VOTED BERNIE 70%+ and for Joe Biden 30% but now Sanders Got 35% warren 24% and 36%For JOE BIDEN and after That she dropped out so now the nominee WENT AKA STOLED At Sanders!

@katmeowgarcia7189," @patientlywatching7775  I know in Oregon white males got 650 acres off land absolutely free to start their families path to a new life and build their wealth and foundation for their families. Meanwhile Africans, women and Mexicans did not get jack and Indigenous people had treaty after treat broken by the government that was doling out land (and subsequently began destroying the environment) that the North American tribes used to have free access to.Historically there have been many advantages that many white families have had that brown black indigenous and women have not had. It is true that many  people think that the 14th amendment leveled the playing field for everyone in the US but it most certainly did not make up for the 400 years of free labor that directly benefited white families building up their wealth in the US while disadvantaging everyone else. It's not about feeling guilt or shame it's about recognizing that it still has impact today because the playing field was never leveled. IIt doesn't mean white people don't suffer or get taken advantage of by the owning class elites and the structures of capitalism. It only means that those who are white or adjacent to white people have an advantage still to this day. Conditions can exist at the same time. If you can't see that yet, it is okay.

@Skulldetta,"""If you think America is so imperfect then why does everyone seem to want to live here?  Why are immigrants flooding in? Because while America might not be the perfect place to live, it might be the closest thing to it.""  Nope, because immigrants are either a) uninformed and still believe the ""America is the greatest"" propaganda, b) don't have any other choice as the USA are the only country accessible to them, or c) because they're so rich already that the country's complete lack of care for its citizens doesn't have many consequences for them.  ""You can get a DNA test to find out who you really are and then go back to the country that you came from.""  By that logic over 95% of Americans need to be kicked out of the country as they're all descendants of people who illegally immigrated there within the past 500 years.  ""Why is America blamed for everything?  Every country in this world originally did not allow women to vote and had slaves.""  Complete strawman, nobody is claiming that the USA are the only country who had this problem.  ""Even in Egypt the pyramids where built by slaves so why won't you demand they be demolished along with the rest of the monuments and flags that define world history?""  Because they're historical artifacts that hold extremely high value in both a cultural sense to the people of the country and are also massive tourist traps. Neither of those things apply to Confederate statues.  "" We cannot and should not try to erase history.""  Nobody does. But statues generally exist to honor people - a country that waged war against the USA in support of slavery does not deserve such honors.  ""Point your finger at parts of the world such as the Middle East, Africa and China, if you wish to condemn someone or something for the transgressions against women, the poor and the weak.""  Pointless comparisons because these countries are authoritarian, monarchies, one-party-states or run by religious zealots. Neither of which apply to the USA. The USA's band of comparison are other developed democracies like Europe, and in comparison to most European countries, the US look pretty damn shit in almost every aspect.  ""We are blessed to be citizens of America. I would not wish to be a human being living anywhere else.  Women especially should consider themselves lucky to be living in this ""GREAT"" country.""  Yes, this great country for women where basic women's rights like abortion are still a major point of discussion and on the verge of being illegal.  ""We have never been forced to have an abortion if we conceived more than two children, female circumcision has not been forced on our daughters and our GREAT country does not mandate that females cover themselves from head to toe or stone them to death if they are found out and about without a male escort.""  ""We don't treat our women as badly as the Iranians do"" isn't exactly a convincing argument.  ""hame on you for not praising our country for the respect and dignity and opportunity that it gives it's female citizens.  KEEP AMERICA GREAT! There is no other place in the world that I would rather live.  God Bless us. TRUMP 2021.""

Telling his supporters to read the transcript when it absolutely damns him is the only thing Trump has done during his time in office that made me think ""maybe he is not a complete idiot."" He knew they would not actually read it, but they would assume, since he told them too, that it must vindicate him. I have read it, and it is the transcript of him committing the crime of requesting a foreign government to help him win an election (a crime that would carry jail time if he did not have presidential immunity, so definitely impeachable). And that is even without the quid-pro-quo implicit in the word ""though"", which, if you accept the implication (and I can't see how anyone doesn't accept it) means Trump is guilty of several more crimes (bribery, corruption, etc).

We need to ask why Fauci doesn't wear a mask or social distance.

@TheRainyKingdom," @mturner221  I’m a high school student with really bad ADHD, I’m really struggling in online school rn, but I also have issues with my immune system and I’d rather be slightly struggling with grades than dead from COVID. Masks are fabric, air can pass through fabric, that’s why your skin still has access oxygen even through jeans (which is a thicker material.), however spit droplets don’t necessarily pass through a mask, and it doesn’t hurt to wear one! I wear one when using spray paint, oil paints, or in an environment with lots of air pollution so maybe I’m just used to them but I don’t think it’s much to ask. And a lot of people aren’t necessarily “at risk” but a ton of people still are! A lot of people have underlying health conditions and if we can make a small “sacrifice” for them, it pays off in the end. I don’t know how my heart condition would react to COVID, but I don’t want to find out, so I do my own research into these types of viruses and what helps stop the spread and what will protect myself. I started attending online church instead of going in person, I go on more outside hikes rather then exercising in a gym, and I have one or two friends that I hang out with outside and socially distanced. I’ve cut out some parts of my normal life but it’s adaptation, and anyways, being American is being able to adapt and thrive! :) Anyways, hope you have a nice day and your kids do better in online school, it’s weird and difficult, but it can be done! :) <3",4년 전,1,

And we do all this while recognizing the God given rights that people have to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion and everything else even though it might mean they're used against us.

@aljirou29," @huh3265  Well let's see.    42,000 people voted TWICE in Nevada, about 4X Biden's margin of victory.   56,000 UNDERAGE people voted in Georgia, about 5X the margin of victory.  They also just showed how 17,650 votes were flipped from Trump to Biden.  Not to mention the video showing them illegally counting votes pulled from under a table or the fact that they just hacked into a Dominion machine being used in the current election during the Georgia Senate hearing.  Pennsylvania received back 2.4 million absentee ballots after only sending out 1.8 million.  They actually received votes for people before those people even received their mail-in ballots.   Wisconsin VIOLATED THEIR OWN LAW by sending out unsolicited absentee ballots.   Virtually NONE of the precincts in Wayne County (Detroit, MI), could get their books to balance including a number of them that had more votes than every man, woman and child living in the precinct.  Maybe that's due to the 4:30AM ballot drop of over 100,000 votes all for Biden for which people have testified under oath that the stated reason was to catch Biden up in the count.  It just goes on and on.  Of course, if the FAKE NEWS bothered to cover any of the hearings held by the state legislatures, people would know this.  As it stands, they're LYING and telling people that President Trump is trying to ""steal"" the election or subvert democracy.",4년 전,0,

@huh3265," @aljirou29  Attorney General Bill Barr, a Republican, said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Biden won the election in Nevada by more than 33,000 votes statewide. Voter fraud is a felony and carries a fine and jail time. The office also found five people voted twice, if you think 5 people is enough to overturn an election than you are absolutely laughable. the 42,000 court case has almost 0 evidence, in a court of law, it’s evidence that counts, not tweets or social media bluster, not hearsay or speculation, it’s evidence and that’s what’s missing in the record before the court.   Trump’s list of illegal voters is riddled with errors, based on faulty analyses and demonstrates a lack of understanding of election laws. In court documents filed this week, they say Trump’s list and the analysis that produced it are “highly inaccurate,” “wildly unreliable,” and “worthless.” i have no clue where you could have possibly gotten the 56,000 underage voter number from honestly. facebook maybe? Oan? Newsmax? Qanon?    i have no clue where you got that 17,650 votes flipped from trump to biden, the change in votes was a 0.26% difference and majority of that was for trump. and thats a very normal and expected change from a recount. Biden defeated Trump by 12,284 votes in the hand recount and 11,779 votes in the machine recount. and no they did not illegally count votes from under the table, election workers had put uncounted absentee ballots in ballot containers when they thought they were going home for the night, soon after they were asked to keep working and thats when you see them pulling out the ballot boxes. it was recorded the second time because the poll watchers left for the night, so they recorded it so they could watch it later to make sure everything was in check.    no substantial evidence for the hacking except a whacko saying he did, hes a failed inventor and a failed treasure hunter who claimed that a fake sword had magical magnetic properties and was proof that ancient romans visited north america in 200 AD. he claimed that meant that the entire voting system was compromised even though the poll pad is never connected to the rest of the voting system. the poll pads are the only piece of election infrastructure that is ever hooked up to the internet or connected to devices that are hooked up to the internet. AND in a statement, poll pad creator KnowInk said and i quote “The assertions made about unauthorized access to our systems are patently false. The man claiming that someone ‘got into’ our systems did not happen according to our forensic analysis. There was no ‘hack,’ there was no ‘back door’ entry, there was no ‘pump and dump,’ and there was no access through a ‘thermostat’ located hundreds of miles away in Savannah.”   wrong, pennsylvania did not recieve back 2.4 million absentee ballots after sending out 1.8 million. the numbers are real but they are a mix of data from the state's primary and general elections. in junes primary election 1.8 million ballots were requested, which is where you get 1.8 from. and 2.4-6 mil was sent back in the GENERAL election, not the primary. and in the GENERAL election, 3 million ballots were requested, not 1.8.   i cant find a source on your wisconsin claim so please link one, but as far as i know there isnt a law against sending out unsolicited absentee ballots, these are state decisions.   if you are referring to the infamous typo debacle, the author of the tweet, and i quote, said this: ""I have now learned the MI update referenced was typo in one county. I have deleted the original tweet."" at least he can admit when he harbors false information, wish the rest of yall could follow suit  anyways, i know what youre about to say, youre gonna say that im biased and im reading fake media and im a sheep. because yes, you sitting on the toilet with your phone scrolling through facebook and twitter are more reliable than officials and newspapers and news sources and college proffessors and scientists because the alien vampire pedophile lizard immigrants (who just happen to be jewish) are coming for our freedom and donald trump and alex jones are here to save us. i have no problem with questioning government, i have no problem with questioning the status quo, i have no problem with questioning authority. and after questioning it i have come to the conclusion that i trust reasearch and studies, i trust scientists and i will wear my mask, wash my hands, and get the vaccine. because i am an american, i beileve in american people and i love america i love the freedom it gives me, i do not love americas greedy capitalist ways, but regardless i love america. i am not a traitor like you, i am not a traitor like the confederates, and i am not a traitor like trump and his supporters. i do not throw out democracy and i do not throw out american ideals or order, if i must live in a capitalist society, no matter how badly i would love communism, i will do it with order and respect. you know what i dont respect? the military, i dont respect the military because i dont respect the war on drugs, i dont respect the wars in the middle east, and if i dont respect the wars, then i dont respect the people doing the wars. i dont uphold american imperialism, unlike you. do not call yourself a patriot if you support those things, you are not a patriot, i am a patriot. and i beileve in the integrity of the election, i beileve in our press and news, i beileve in socialized medicine, i beileve in free college, i beileve in marxism and pan africanism, i beileve in vaccines,  i beileve in reperations, i beileve in police abolition, because that is what is best for our country and i want whats best for america. you do not want whats best for america, you do not want whats best for our citizens, you arent an american, you just live here",4년 전,0,

Pennsylvania received back 2.4 million absentee ballots after only sending out 1.8 million. Wisconsin VIOLATED THEIR OWN LAW by sending out unsolicited absentee ballots. Virtually NONE of the precincts in Wayne County (Detroit, MI), could get their books to balance. It just goes on and on.

Same with SCOTUS.  No reason not to take up the case.  So yes, the establishment is in on the coup.  They've been trying to get rid of President Trump for four years with a bogus Mueller investigation, a bogus impeachment and now blaming him for the virus while keeping the economy locked down.  They've violated their own election laws in key states, and prevented us from inspecting the ballots.  They used social media to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story (among other things) which clearly shows that Joe knew everything about their dealings with China and profited from them.  They faked the whole Russian collusion accusation.  It was a lie from the start to help Hillary's campaign in 2016 as evidenced by CIA Director John Brennan's notes to the Obama/Biden White House.

@alindley3128,"OK, guys, look.  The neuromodulation tranquilizer that people have spraying in their homes and that they carry to spray on ""bad guys""when they're out in public if they need to, but usually just end up using to drug one another..... those drugs, when they hit a pregnant person give babies an IQ hit of 10 - 100 points, and cause early onset dementia in adults.   Can you watch this video and say, ""IQ Doesn't Matter.""????  Guys, IQ matters.  Watching this video, I have to say, IQ matters.  IMHO IQ matters.  Brain damaging babies before they're even born..MATTERS to the future when those brainwrecked dumb as doodoo babies grow up and vote.  And brain damaging adults so badly  that they think somehow that TRUMP MAKES SENSE...That.MATTERS.  It matters at the public health level in terms of the societal burden of burgeoining dementia, parkinsons, and related disorders occuring at younger ages in epedemic proportion. And it matters in terms of the epidemic of brain damage to babies and children being caused by the neuromodulation drugs that is TRIPPLING the number of schoolkids, the proportion of school kids needing special ed.  And then they're going to vote, also.   Neuromodulation makes people stupid and brain damaged.  Stupid and brain damaged voters elect fascist morons to be their leaders.  And fascist morons endorse MORE neuromodulation even as they, themselves, are showing the classic neuromodulation toxicity symptoms of florid disinhibition and burgeoning DEMENTIA.  When Trump shouts ""Bring it on, Rocket Man"", that's ""disinhibition"".  When he seriously considers starting a war to enhance his political chances in the election, that's disinhibition.  Even if you're personally immune to the damage caused by exposure to neuromodulation drugs used as security factors in public places, even if your liver is the size of a sockeye salmon there in your belly, a liver so big and active that you can easily drink the strichnine at a Pentocostal Meeting and hug the rattle snakes because you're  immune to all poisons from your SuperLiver, to the point that a little neuromodulatory phenothiazine based psychiatric tranquilizer in your environment or sprayed on you by your wife or neighbor doesn't make you even break step, .....You may be immune, BUT:  clearly these guys on camera are not or were not immune to the brain damage and creeping dementia caused by the neuromodulation drugs that are used for ""security' purposes and are now ubiquitous in our society.  .  God help us, they have the right to vote no matter how crazy they are, even if they're Mad as a Hatter from chronic neuromodulation overdose, and so do we have the same right to vote.  But as the brain damage and stupidity borne of neuromodulation toxicity creeps through society like the silent neuroplague that it is, They, the crazies, become ever greater in number, while we, the calm, rational, sane people with functional inhibitory cortex that keeps us from acting like a trumper...we are getting fewer every day as more and more of us are killed off by the toxic medical effects of chronic neuromodulation drug exposure..    Why would you brain damage ""your enemies"", when YOUR ENEMIES VOTE?   In your OWN country!!    So if you brain damage your enemies one by one with neuromodulation drugs, those thugs, now Brain damaged Thugs, are going to elect a Donald Trump. or his clone in the next election.  The more neuromodulation drugs cripple and damage American adult brains and brain wreck the children, the more it plays into the hands of Trump and his cuckoo bird supporters.  So even if the neuromodulation drugs aren't killing you quickly, even if you find them ""kinda relaxing"" and ""not a problem"",. how can you say neuromodulation doesn't affect you, when, even if you're immune to the neuromodulation drugs yourself, your bats^^t craz;y neighbors have been made imbicile by the drugs...and and now they've gone out and voted for TRUMP????  Part of the job of my profession is to fight against brain damage in individuals and in society as large. And our profession is losing the battle.  As the IQ sinks from population level brain damage due to Neuromodulation, we will see more and more Trumplike candidates and Trumper voters in the future.    Russia's present will be our future, thanks largely to Neuromodulation and the medical and public health phenomena that neuromodulation unleashes, namely massive, population level brain damage in adults and children.  But the average guy won't even listen to Fauci.  Though I trained in the same places as Fauci (in infant and foetal brain development, not in Infectious Disease), why would anyone listen to me? They're having too much fun drugspraying their neighbors, parents, spouses, and kids if they don't do as they're told:  pssss.  zp. zp. zp.  That'll LEARN 'em to shut up and cooperate!   I didn't make these facts up.  I looked them up in standard Pharmacology textbooks.  All you have to do is to look up the drugs that are now being used as public level neuromodulators.  It's not rocket science.  It's college level pharmacology. Get a clue. And get yourself a book or an article downloaded from MEDLINE and read about what these neuromodulation tranquilizers do to your brain cells when they are chronically overdosed in women and children and older citizens.

Biden got rid of the mandate and lowered our taxes, raised our wages and has created so much peace around the world.

Oh the trade war with China, I doubt you even know what a tariff is weather they are good or bad is a completely different debate but all I can say is at least he attempted to bring industry back into the US, Oh wait, he did though. As for Korea I’d like to know what he specifically did that you don’t like, and I’d also like to know what you think a candidate with no balls would have done if a country was threatening a nuclear attack?

You said 300k total (that's debatable probably much lower with the survival rate being 99.6%), here's the original death toll of 2.2million here if Trump didn't do anything. https://www.cato.org/blog/how-one-model-simulated-22-million-us-deaths-covid-19 The thing is though Trump was very quick to act and even enacted a travel ban as early as January 31st. Trump's already got a vaccine rolling out so my question to you is what in the hell do you think Joe Biden is going to do to end this pandemic?   The tax cuts. They helped more than just the 1% https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-27/the-trump-tax-cut-wasn-t-just-for-the-rich  If you knew the dictionary definition of a tariff you would know that it is a tax on the import of foreign goods. This, in theory, is done to increase the purchasing and production of that good in the country that implements them by making the option at home cheaper. Look up the dictionary definition of the word tariff if you think I'm lying here. As for jobs created you can see the unemployment rate here. https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2020/article/job-market-remains-tight-in-2019-as-the-unemployment-rate-falls-to-its-lowest-level-since-1969.htm  As for Korea, in what part of the agreement did the US lose anything? I mean Korea started to break their promise and trump said this on Twitter which was kind of funny ""Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way. He signed a strong Denuclearization Agreement with me in Singapore...""  Now please explain to me how you think trump is the one dividing us when you're commenting under a video calling half of the population idiots for not voting for a politician who has done absolutely nothing for the 40 years he's been suckling at the government tit.

Its difficult to even fathom billions, but TRILLIONS of dollars in debt! They have given more money, that we don't have to give, to other countries except for our own... And come on people, you actually believe that the democRATS didn't collaborate with China ( A Communists country) to cause a world pandemic just to blame it on Trump? Yes they are that disgusting. Do you actually believe that all of these people are suddenly crying race war not even two weeks after the pandemic occurred? All because of something that happened almost 300 years ago right? No, not hardly, maybe because they are terrified of not receiving their free rides? I truly think that Trump had to much faith in our FBI, CIA, ATF,  and Crooked politicians, buy he did do a good job at exposing them at what they truly are. Unfortunately though we already knew. He made the African American employment rate triple, more than any other president. He actually tried solutions to fix actual problems our country faces. If the RATS weren't demonic, cheating, scumbags who want nothing more than to kill and control us, the man could of stood a chance at actually making positive change in our country. Which is now full steam ahead into socialism. He has been the only president since world war ll, to purpose the gold and silver standard, or to reinduce it. Mean while our currency and its illusion to gullible free loaders its now full on collapsing. Democrats want to continue the decades of stealing from today to pay for tomorrow, but it won't stand for much long. Then we will see massive inflation on every day items. The price of living will be damn well almost unobtainable. I mean what is their plan? More complete control, digital currency? What? where every single transaction any being makes will have to be electronic?  monitored. And  its done nothing but leave generations of people to face homelessness etc dand sadly these generations have been completely mind warped by media and know shit about self sufficiency and providing for themselves, much less fixing a country. If we get Biden he will maybe stand 2 years than it will all be turned back over.Take a look around the globe at other communists ran countries. How well are they doing? And to blame trump for decades of shit presidents and sorry choices they have made is bullshit. RATS are liars, cheaters, want new world order, and dont care how many people they have to kill to make it happen. Their sick perversion is going to lead to them knowing every last move we make, throwing out the constitution, our rights, and people actually fall for this? I feel sorry for whats about to come, because they will be the first to succumb. No more free fish and a bunch of idiots who are to reliant on a government that wants to kill them. Good luck to them.

@ThucNguyen-bz7wh,"Our President Never Quits By Tuấn Minh Nguyễn  Born as an American tot,  A charming boy much blessed by God. Eager to find His glory torch, Donald J Trump with Midas touch.  Bold, clever, and so warm-hearted, He was held tight by Father’s love. “You are my Son, my Trump, my Truth. Never give up, never let loose.”  So hard he fought, his firms grew large, Years of triumphs, years of bad luck. All through the long rocky roads he picked, He won, he lost, but he never quit.  Dearest Father, a sweet grandpa, Struggled to stay far well away From “Game of Thrones’’ in the DC, Still, felt tons of pain cutting free.  One nation, one people, by God, Yet treated like hell in dark swamps. “How men live without compassion!” Trump of hope blew, billions rose.  Twenty sixteen, Demons were struck In the least way so unthought of. They brought up thousands of dirt fires, Constantly thrown at Man of Sire.  Four years in Palace, thick despair, He’s put things straight and stood up fair. Monsters have bowed, trolls have been drowned. Finally, His Trump's sounded loud.  “Oh, My Lord, please let us seek forth To the land full of morning fog, No miseries, nor getting lost, One nation, one people in God.”  Then once more His Trump blows for us, In the freezing, in the red thirst. And in every tweet, he now speaks: “TO OUR PEOPLE, I NEVER QUIT.”                 - To President Donald J Trump",4년 전,0,

@SixStringHarmonies,"America was the greatest during that 25 year period when it was the only nation in the World not destroyed by WWII. When there was no foreign manufacturing competition, and US bankers began exploiting poor foreign governments and their natural resources for their own personal profit. Then around 1970, others started to catch up. Been downhill since then. Also quite curious how America was at it's ""greatest"" amidst widespread union membership.   All that worker solidarity has been undercut. So that multimillionaires might make another dollar, your job is sent overseas. Sent to some worker who won't/can't complain that they work next to Acetone in an unventilated space, with none of that pesky and expensive safety gear. More dollars for the owner.  Most of these Trumpian dopes are actually Socialists, but are too stupid to compartmentalize political reality or thought. They have been brainwashed in Exceptionalism and Nationalism, and convinced SOMEHOW that if the rich get richer, then that makes their live better. Even thought that's never happened, and in fact the exact opposite is true.

I think majority of Americans don’t understand how our congress functions. The lower house (dem majority)- congress asks for a bunch of stuff. The upper house (rep majority) - senate can debate it. The special thing in the senate the majority leader (McConnell) can put a bill for debate on the floor or not - his prerogative. In this situation the Dems asked, republicans ultimately made the decision of 600. The president cried about 2000 but the bill is made. At this point the Dems in senate can and will ask to make it 2000 but that amendment has to be debated separately now. And the majority (Mitch McConnell rep) can bring the amendment to the floor or not. To say both parties don’t care is ridiculous. Mitch will refuse to bring the bill for debate. Republicans have spent a ton of money this presidential term. Some republicans would vote for the 2000 but not all. The ones that refuse would look bad and the senate rep majority is losing ground. Georgia could make the senate an even 50/50 dem/rep. So Mitch is looking out for the rep party interests in the future, that’s politics.
