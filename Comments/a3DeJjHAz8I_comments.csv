Thankfully I didn’t get injured really, just the wind knocked out of me. Glass had shattered everywhere and if I hadn’t been wearing the thick king coat I had on I would have gotten a nasty scrape on my arm because the coat had a slight tear in it.

@lordanthony8709,She made one mistake the chimp was given something like Paxil or an anti-anxiety pill along with a warm cup of tea warm liquids cause any pill or capsule to hit you twice as fast as it would if you just normally took it and it freaked him out because it hit him too quickly and I've taken some drugs like that they gave me 25 mg a day by the 6th day I was hallucinating it was Paxil so I can understand why this happened people don't realize animals are different are affected differently than humans if they are giving something that's why you got to go to a veterinarian and ask him what you could give them to lower the anxiety of the chimp I wish there was something we all could do for her but I did hear about a face transplant that was done several about 10 to 20 years ago,2년 전,2,

@cwvos,"So if she was contemplating continued surgery or not;  ""Seriously, what was the purpose of her being on Winfrey's show""?  Some of you guys have talked about the insensitivity of some of these anchors, but to me what's insensitive was Winfrey's remark like, ""Oh, you know they want to see you""!  That's TOTAL EXPLOITATION to me❗!❗  Even if she agreed contractually, she probably didn't know what she was getting into an I HIGHLY DOUBT, if she could envision Even an inkling in her mind of what she looked like after the attack she wouldn't have wanted to show her face.....I couldn't imagine her family members wanting her to do so!  I will never understand why something so sadly tragic had to be shown.  I could understand it better if there were photos of a progression of her making facial satisfactory type of progress where you saw her getting better an feeling better about herself, both her an her family, but to just sit up there an just blatantly say, ""Well you know everyone wants to see you"", what is she some spectacle or alien not of this world or something?  Don't blame the anchors an their dialogue. Winfrey should have never had her on that show to begin with!  Some things simply from the standpoint of common decency should be exercised, like ""I don't care what the public wants, I'm not having her on my show so she can be gaulked at an talked about an made fun of....  Let her have her series of surgery towards the best recovery possible an then let her an her family decide if she wants her before an after photos shown....

@cwvos," @Pyrostal    I don't disagree!   I'm just so tired of folks fringing off of others misfortunes for money, greed an, an unhealthy public consumption!  The woman made some seemingly innocent choices that ultimately disrespected a very powerful animal's boundaries of wild-life resulting in an unfortunate life altering experience for her an her family.....An that still applies to a neighbor or friend or whoever she was to the owner.  What I'd like to know is what was the full scope of communication that persuaded her to show herself on television for the world to see?   Did Winfrey need a boost in ratings? Was it the ✔ amount that convinced her to do what she did? You certainly can't tell me she decided for endorsement purposes.... It's just PLAIN SICKENING❗  I did watch again an agree, the anchors were insensitive through word choice, facial expressions, gestures, etc....  I was just so appalled when I saw it first that someone (Winfrey) who is suppose to be so respected, admired an adored by so many, would do something that I considered ""SO CLASSLESS""......😞◼  But that's the world for you. Someone's misfortune is exploited for someone elses greed an self acclaim. An that still applies when your dupped an fooled an taken advantage of, wether it be contractually, monetarily or otherwise.  Would Winfrey want to show her face? Would the woman Anchor want to show hers, if a vicious dog or some other animal altered their lives in such a way❓🤔 No, I don't think so.....",4년 전,1,

I don't know the full story but the police knew she had that chimp and I don't know where she lived but it couldn't had been that illegal if they was cool with it even ppl with hearts make mistakes and I'm sure she had one and sure she would take it back if she could on how she took care of him but I do agree with u on it being a bad idea to raise a chimp I wouldn't raise one knowing they can be this dangerous,2년 전,0,

@achilles9448,What happened is that her friend Sandra raised a trip like it was her son he learn to open doors even use keys to unlock doors and it was said that she even bathed with the champ and even slept with him I mean like just sleeping together so the Champs owner was a girl named Sandra and she had the chip when he was a baby with her husband and daughter but both of them passed away then and the victim Charlotte was a close friend of the family's my neighbor she even helped with the champ and The Chimps name was Travis but one day Sandra decides to give the champ Xanax and when she did that the monkey started it to get wild so Sandra called her friend to come and help her and that's when the champ attacked this young lady she tried to stab him with a knife but it just made the monkey more upset and when the police got there the monkey smash the side window of the patrol car show the police shot the monkey four times and then all sudden the monkey walks back inside the house so the cops follow it and ends up dead next to his cage and when the paramedics got there they thought the victim Sharla was dead and when they went up to her she grabbed or touched one of the paramedics feet and that's when they took her to the hospital they had to reattach her jaw she did get a new face and it looks a lot better now but we will always wonder why did Sandra give the monkey Xanax she didn't know the side effects that's why the monkey went crazy giving a monkey Xanax,6년 전,0,

@hiyapal7719," American Freedom World Peace  She actually didn't have the chimp. She was visiting a friend, that had raised a chimpanzee, and it is said that she had recently gotten a new haircut, that supposedly triggered the chimp. (Which seems to me, to be unlikely, considering that once a Male matures, they often become violent, when they've matured.) But, according to the 911 call, the owner of the chimp was exclaiming that her pet chimp had killed her friend. She even attacked her own pet, which probably just infuriated the animal, and made the attack worse. The woman that shouldn't have raised a wild animal, actually wasn't the one who was attacked. Even tv shows avoid using adult chimps, and usually opt for a baby chimpanzee; which apparently influences the stupid public to purchase dangerous, and wild animals. (Sorry, if that's too much info.

It bothers me that people tend to think about it this way. If you look at it in another perspective, someone CAN actually domesticate these kind of animals.   And I can't help but think, as cliche as it sounds, that the chimpazee's owner is the one at FAULT here. But for the wrong reasons (kinda).  She was the one that gave the chimpazee UNPRESCRIBED (xorax) medicine. The side effects probably made the chimpazee act the way it was. I mean, even some of us HUMANS can't handle this kind of drug. What did she expect? That the chimp would handle it just fine as we have?  We claim that we are the evolved versions of these chimpanzees, that we are the FUTURE.

@nodresiak,What have we learned from this? Don't have chimps as pets. They are half our size but 10x stronger. They attack the face and genitals. So if you don't want to be faceless or dickless don't get one. I feel so incredibly bad for this lady. Some stupid idiot below claims she abused the animal and that is why it attacked. That is bullshit? Just like humans any animal is capable of violence. Sometimes they get brain tumors just like humans and that can alter their personality.,10년 전,0,

@mamadookes407,"Ok so clearly this woman was being abusive to the chimp, or the humans who thought they could ""own"" an animal were the ones being abusive.  Animal behaviour is, in fact, quite predictable. They do not do things for ""no reason."" There is an explanation, and the explanation is clearly: someone was doing something to that animal that they should not have been doing. Someone should be charged with abuse and thrown in jail, whether it's the woman who got her face ripped off or her friends, I don't know, but clearly this was not investigated enough.  Animal psychology is pretty simple, there are very simple rules you do not cross with an animal. If you stay behind these rules, you are ALWAYS perfectly safe, cross them and you're playing with fire. Disagree if you want, ignorant people don't bother me. You'll learn one day.",10년 전,8,

What the hell are they thinking? They are not show pieces you brag about and show your little rich friends. These are animals who should be exactly that animals.

They aren't meant to live side by side with humans, they belong in the wild with their close-knit family groups.  It really isn't the chimp's fault for acting like the wild animal it is, although I do think it will be put down.  Continuing to live with humans is no longer an option and it cannot survive in the wild, especially not without an established social group.",15년 전,0,

We don't even allow domesticated farm animals in city limits, because of the exposure to people.  Yet a chimp is okay?  We're not talking murder, rape, etc.  We're talking animal owners",15년 전,0,

You punish the owners for situations like this, not the people who responsibly own animals.  That said, chimps are NOT domesticated, as they try to say on this vid.

An employei herd what was going on shot one of the chimps and the other one tried to run off while pulling the man with him.",15년 전,0,

@AL3XTH3LARG3,these are wild and very strong people need to realise they are not pets. Man has demesticated cows for eons and a cow will run you over or kick you with massive force. Horses are the same and even dogs have turned on their owners. A chimp raised by people all of its life has a very good chance of chewing your face off.
