@RewireToRisePodcast,"I’ve been following Dr. Gabor Maté for a long time and his ability to go straight to the emotional root—without bypassing, blaming or sensationalizing—is something I deeply admire.  The way he speaks about trauma, addiction and healing feels both profound and human. As a psychology coach, his work has had a huge and lasting impact—not only on my own healing journey, but also on the way I support my clients in theirs. His insights have helped bring depth, compassion and clarity to spaces where most people feel lost.",3개월 전,0,

@waris4thewealthy549," @danayarbrough7934  I’m going to say self limiting beliefs have ruined your life as an adult. I don’t dare say this to be mean spirited, I too was once destroyed and know all too well the pain of childhood trauma and abuse. They say success is the greatest revenge especially against others who have “tried to destroy your soul” and success is not dependent on being gifted, being gifted is helpful but not necessary. It comes down to what you think, imagine and emotionally feel in the moment, Many of us have had traumatic injuries to the heart and mind but the past events as ugly as they are to face cannot be the master of the mind, the regulator of triggers that produce inconsistent results throughout life which ultimately directs people thinking with a fear based consciousness. Self talk coupled with the “idea” of failure is a toxic pill to swallow…🤔😁",3년 전,14,

Eva's approach is so different from anything I’ve ever tried. It’s not just about thinking positive, it’s about aligning with real-world actions that bring your desires into reality. Now, I’ve manifested opportunities I never imagined possible, and my mindset has shifted completely. If you’re frustrated like I was, don’t hesitate. Read this book.

@peterorzol,I love what this Dr Gabor Mante talks about the areas where it's not being addressed. I live in Springfield Massachusetts I'm a product of 25 years of addiction. Until I started listening to his knowledge I did not know how to solve my issues in and out of detoxes for 25 years all kinds of treatments never worked. I started looking at the things Dr Gabor talked about and I started to recovering emotionally spiritually physically and addressing the reason for the symptom. Years of childhood trauma and suppressing my feelings and emotions because I come from a Eastern European country we're talking about it was not accepted has put me in a lot of pain.

@JamesHadfield-qz9rv,"Excellent interview!  Gabor is definitely the Most intelligent and Compassionate person Ive ever had the Honor to hear from!  Looking forward to reading his most recent book, ""the myth of normal""  ( Ive Always maintained there is no normal, that's a society thing, )  I was particularly impressed with Gabor's Humanity and humor after having read his book, ""in the realm of hungry ghosts""  (tremendous title and appropriate for subject matter)  the important point that he often makes is that Very often people become addicts from TRAUMA and environment more so than genetics or bad choices. he makes a statement in the interview related to his atheism anger about the holocaust taking his grandparents (and Millions of others) But he allows for a bit of softening his view somewhat after seeing + feeling in the place of all the Sickness, death and redemption of All the so-called incurable that he has Seen. hatred is a Poison.  in the wonderful interview was surprised and delighted on hearing he has done some work with Psychodelics!  wish they had Expanded more on the GREAT +  illuminous L.S.D. (not for myself, But for the ""others"" who have been deceived by the evil, restrictive government)   First time meeting Tim, he was pretty good + have subscribed (even though he mentioned psychodelics aren't for Everyone a couple of times, once would've been Sufficient!)

In a family of nine this was a very stressful lifestyle for each and every one of us. I shut down for many years, flew into the underworld with an almighty rage and I am so glad I was in this sphere because it allowed me to unload 14 years of rage, stress, fear and anger into a dark world that this behaviour is normal, accepted, and even condoned if one is to achieve success in this dark world without hurting anyone in the public arena - it was a godsend for me I can say today. Ihave served all my prison time (15 years in two jail sentences-very angry was I), and today I have managed my addictions I once had, and I now have much work to do in my path to enlightenment with the help of people like you Dr. Gabor Matë, much respect good sir, keep up the good work as it is clear as daylight you know what you are talking about.

@ItcheBrain,"It's so nice to hear a person use the word shame accurately. We live in an often toxic & ignorant culture, and words like narcissist, shame, and even more frequent ""toxic"" itself are often weaponized and used incorrectly. I mean it's pretty odd how everyone's ex is a narcissist considering how few NPD's actually exist. Toxic is likely the most frequently used, and used by people who want to get their way. All of these words are important, but often used to manipulate. I mean of course Gabor uses them right, as they are a core part of his work.  We can thank the socials for taking any good thing and using it reckless AF.",1년 전,17,

@rowanstarling3816,"My God!  That opening qoute floored me.  I was called the over sensitive child, told to me in adulthood.   I cried over the slightest nuaced injury, and big things i was in a state of such dysregulation i could not be comforted.  I have been to many counselors, self medicated with drugs and alcohol until i started having kids and then with food.   Fastforward 30 years later, painful breakup, counseling and self medicating again with food, wine and cannabis.  I've done this on and off for 7 years now and i am working on my mental emotional and physical health.   No alcohol 3 weeks or cannabis 6 weeks.  On an elimination diet and back in counseling,  finally with someone i really connect with.  Plus my fiance fell off the wagon about a month before i stopped, and then drinking hard leading to him telling me we needed a break...temporary,  but in my heart im doubting that, this comes 2 days before his court ordered treatment.  I'm numb.   And also just discovered attachment styles, which mine is fearful avoidant.  So my rejection and abandonment have hern triggered hard, but i still can't cry.   I've cried a billion tears in the past over my ex and I'm numb. Yet, I'm also like am old damn starting to crack.  I breathe, i do qigong, i drink tea, i shovel snow, i binge watch youtube.  I listen again to Gabor and others, like Michael Pollan.  Im ready for acid and psilocybin.  I pray.  I'm ready for my healing.

@robertdiggins7578,"Do you know much about chronic pain patients going through the CDC Crackdown on ""opioids"" (we were all taught to use this word in the last decade by the coordinated media propaganda campaign, which would do story after story of the random examples of people who got a prescription for pain killers and when it ran out they turned to street heroin. What they OMITTED was that the CDC had spiked the prescription death stats with ALL heroin deaths, bc they MIGHT have had a prescription drug.  The gateway to heroin use and death are almost always short term patients or friends and family who get ahold of it somehow.  Patients who've been treated successfully with ""opioids"" for over a decade, with monthly drug tests and pill counts were not the ones chasing euphoria or going to the street. Until the CDC Crackown caused, by using the DEA and AMA and law enforcement to threaten doctors' licensure, as well as pharmacists.  They chose to follow unethical (in their own words) orders to cut long term chronic pain patients' prescriptions by 80-90+%.  This resulted in a NET loss of life by patient suicide and heroin overdose.  Many patients were sent to methadone and Suboxone clinics (because every medicine has its own clinic category now), that serve heroin addicts and have dealers and access to dealers hanging out and in the waiting room.  It's my contention that this is where many of them found their CIA/Pentagon drug of choice. (Yes, read Dark Alliance and watch The Last Narco.  We have a precedent in recent history of our black budgets being used to fund black sites and explicitly illegal wars.  The Iran Contra Scandal saw some high level people go to prison for a short time (they were pardoned by H. W.) for funding and arming the Contras with the profits of illegals weapons trafficking and the evidence is very strong that they should have also been prosecuted for basically starting the crack epidemic in the USA.  DO YOU THINK THEY STOPPED OR ADJUSTED THEIR STRATEGY?)  We also have FBI Whistle Blower, Sibel Edmonds, who gave a sworn deposition in open court and against the FBIs demands that she didn't testify.  This deposition is in the public record, freely available online, and names names, crimes, and sources related to foreign and domestic Intelligence Communities luring, hooking, filming, and blackmailing members of Congress.  But she also talked about other crimes, such as trafficking and the sale of state secrets to the highest bidder.  She is someone who saw the evidence 1st hand and said a long time ago that the FBI had footage of Denny Hastert raping boys in his Chicago apartment/office BEFORE he was reelected as Speaker of the House.  You can read about the sworn deposition in (also free) the November 2009 American Conservative Magazine cover story, titled ""Who's Afraid of Sibel Edmonds?""  So, how would it feel to be a very close friend of Sibel Edmonds AND a chronic pain patient who's life was made non-functional by an 80% forced drop of your pain meds (knowing it's driving revenue into black budgets and you're dealing with a criminal syndicate), having stabilized but with new issues popping up bc of the loss of stabilizing muscles bc of the inactivity for over a year of dropping and years of stabilizing, to have a very understanding nurse who was good and then, suddenly, there are more threats and hostility, demanding the repetition of epidurals that didn't work previously and nerve ablation (RF Nerve burning) of which you've already done more than 20 times and had finally stopped, and to have recorded the audio of your nurse saying ""if you don't have the procedures, we're going to cut your pain meds in half."" and, after asking if you could get the procedures done at another clinic, being told, ""No, you have to do it here.""?  Then, when you got dressed and ready to go get the procedure, you just couldn't take it anymore and called your clinic and said you think they are profiteering from vulnerable people because of the demand that it must be done there, or else, and informing them you're having a nervous breakdown because of it and your functional life being on the line, and then passing out from the stress and waking up 5 hours later, feeling better (rested and more relaxed, but still physically weak), and getting a phone call from the owner doctor of the clinic, who wanted to let you know that he is OFFENDED by your accusations and asking you (illogically) ""Do you go to a restaurant and eat your own food?"" (He asked this twice.), and then ""Pain medicine prescriptions are the dirty part of our business and we don't want to do and we've been very generous with you and nobody else will help you."" and then, because he thinks your rational comment about never having heard such a thing from any medical professional before, he accused you of wanting ""an adversarial relationship"" and that he ""could tell that you weren't going to work out as a patient any longer. I can just tell. I had to talk to someone else like you just this morning.""?  And you can tell that what he says, when being asked if this is a specific clinic policy, is ""That's just the way things are now everywhere."" is dodging the question, but also mostly true, and you're actually scared that his threats of dropping you entirely are going to happen, so you negotiate further conversation and say that you now understand their policy (even though he didn't say it was written) and you can discuss rescheduling the epidural because you know you can't even drive your kids to practice if he pulls the trigger and you are forced to compromise when your entire life you have been anti authoritarian and have been fighting physically since you were young as the 7th boy in a large family and no younger siblings, so your sense of physical rage was developed before you were in kindergarten, but you always went after the bullies at school - the ones who picked on the vulnerable, and your older brother was a 4 time state champion boxer, and he picked on the brother who picked on you until you fought with that rage and loss of concern about your safety with your brother who is 3.5 years older than you when you're really young and even fought with the boxer once until your always non- violent single educated working reference librarian mother poured a little hot coffee on you both, which did stop the fight and is actually a happy memory, but you eventually controlled the rage and stopped yourself with fist cocked when you were a teenager, but, finally you are being tested, because you are trapped, scared, but being cornered again after already acquiescing in a major way 5 years ago with the first stage of the Crackdown, and your doctor isn't smart, but he's on a State Committee where the nurse said he's advocating for you, but you now know the inverse is true and he's implementing, ahead of the pack, another squeeze for the captured government health regulatory and enforcement agencies, and your fight, fight freeze response is vacillating between fight and freeze and now, even though you started doing the procedures again, next month they're going to start dropping your pain meds in half over the course of 4 months, and it's Christmas Eve, and you're feeling impending doom and considering going to Tijuana to get treated with Ibogaine (which Nixon made illegal as part of the big drug war, so you have to go to the place that's full of makeshift fentanyl labs that are the new leading cause of death in the USA, especially since they aren't regulated and the quality is too strong, but they also have a detox clinic, fully medically staffed, using ibogaine and a follow up with 5 meo DMT a couple days after, but the treatment lasts 2 weeks and costs about 12 thousand dollars, but it's already difficult to do much more than give your kids a ride to the school and back when your wife's at work?

@devonseamoor,"Great conversation, thank you! Fortunately, I'm a creative person who finds ways to heal from, mostly, short term suffering. With help from self-healing training in the 80's. Also no drama with the world outside, just chewing on an issue, giving it time, observe myself and gradually I'm gaining insight.   Never depressed, happy with friends, sisters, with what I have, and do in my life, working on the land as volunteer. I'm 72, passionately retired from the obligation to work for an income.  I've met depressed people in my life, and    one thing they need to deny, is suppression of their emotions.   It seems that because the depression is a coping mechanism, which is habitual, they don't want to let go of that what is like the last straw to hold on to, see?  I believe that this is why depression, and alcholism, other addictions as well, is explained as genetically determined. Or a bad functioning of dopamine levels in the brain.   So that such a person feels relieved, it's not his/her fault. The depression is enough suffering: ""No, please don't say it's my fault!""  And the medical industry has a loyal customer, as long as the cure is delayed or postponed. The loop closes.  I agree with Dr.Gabor  Mate's perception of depression and addiction, his skill of people-whisperer is showing in this video.",1년 전,2,
@matthewcarlson3408,The guru bit really is of interest to me because I have had a rough experience in my journey to peace. I had a rough experience with drug dependency throughout my teen and adult years. The rehab centers and AA were the main course when I started my journey to get my life in order. Although I managed to cycle out of the major destructive lifestyle The twelve step indoctrination eventually hindered me and if it weren't for me seeking answers and realizing I needed something I was not getting in twelve step  which is very short sighted in trauma. aa can actually exacerbate existing trauma because they are very closed minded and dogmatic about there own ideas. And certain trauma based destructive cycles found me in the confines of living in drug recovery community. Because of many variables that are at work the structure of AA and modern day drug treatment practices have the propensity to create conditions that promote abusive relationships. Although I hate the term narcissist I must say that AA attracts and even facilitates narcissistic abuse on vulnerable people. This is not just my observation. There is a growing community of whistle blowers that have had to deprogram from the brainwashing tactics of the cult like practice of twelve steps. And many many historical narrative s of AA are actually being disputed by people who have researched them. AA had a stranglehold on how we look at addiction but so much evidence is out there since the publication of their archaic text that really disproves what is practiced in AA culture. AA is not open to anything new. That's what makes it dangerous. Trauma in AA is actually made worse because they interpret their members as the problem. They put blame on victims and use fear to propell them into confession to complete strangers with no qualifications to receive potentially traumatic experiences from them. Many people myself included stay stuck in twelve step because they are brainwashed by it. They are told their guys or feelings can't be trusted. The disease model they push pretty gaslights members to think that their minds are their enemies and therefore if they have a thought that isn't in line with the approved literature in AA that is the disease talking and hence they need to dismiss it. I'm sorry if I sound like I have disdain for AA but I definitely don't for its members . I realize that I was once brainwashed by it so I tend to think that way about its members.,1년 전,0,

@ripadipaflipa4672,That profound feeling of love is from the hormone oxytocin. We are just a bundle of hormones that if off balance can cause negative effects like depression. Sadly most if not all antidepressants no one knows how they actually work. Too many psychiatrists don’t realize this so when people like myself that have the opposite reaction are unwilling to listen to the patient until they commit suicide.,2년 전,0,
@Survivalguy,"I NEED HELP! DR. Mate I know in my heart you could meet me and see without me saying a word what I have gone through. I am hyper creative and learn skills with my eyes and play music but I am so sensitive I can hardly exist. My mother verbally assaulted me daily as well as 10 fake suicide attempts in front of me. I have had a horrific life and just barley made it out of my self inflicted alcohol poisoning. I've been sober 3 and 1/2 years and all the trauma I've been running from for my whole life came out like a dam broke in my heart. My mom since died of health problems and I had no idea I was to inherit a little money. So I bought an acre in the middle of nowhere and I never leave unless I have to. I have been sexually assaulted on more than one occasion and all this stuff is causing nightmares EVERY night. For years, since I got sober. I don't know what to do, My dad is not a dad. I have no one. I let go everyone in my life that was bad for me and it turns out 99% of them were bad. If I can not find a way to process this trauma it WILL kill me. I am not sure how much more I can take. I am really worth looking into. I have so much insight on all these subjects. I have so many unbelievable survival stories I could right a serious book. Some with those skills needs to contact me. I need help and I have a goldmine of life experiences. Please Help Me...",2년 전(수정됨),0,

If sb experiences a traumatic situation, immediatly it is shown in the brain (check the 5 biological naturelaws and Dr. Ryke Geerd Hamer). And I think, also our genes are directly effected by that. If we heal the trauma before having a child, the child will not have the symptom. But if there is a child and I still live with a unhealed trauma, my genes show the trauma and the genes of my child can also show it. Depends on how the genes from mom and dad are mixed.

@Magazinelady,"I was not familiar with the Elvis Presley song Dr. Mate mentioned.  I found it and I listened to it.  I got to wondering about Elvis' childhood.  He grew up poor, lonely, and bullied. I had never thought about his childhood before.  I just thought that his fame gave him groupies and a schedule where he was going to bed late, drunk or high and getting up early leading to more drug use.  I see now that fame made him rich, but also compounded the problems he already had.  Thank you, Tim and Dr. Mate.  I always learn so much from the interviews.  In one of the interviews I recently listened to,  I learned that the highly sensitive person was the shaman in a traditional society.  I don't feel so crazy now.  Having been told several times, I was too sensitive, I thought there was something wrong with me.  Just that tidbit is so ""freeing.""  I looked for shamans in my area.  I found one that sounded good based on the information I found on the website.  I was glad to hear the two of you discuss how one has to be careful about working with any religious leader.  I also think  that working on ourselves at such a deep level makes us vulnerable.  It is time to go to sleep.  I will listen to the last hour of the interview soon.   Thank you again!

@InfiniteTravelingSpirit2BE,"When Dr. Gabor Maté says, ""We don't respond to the present moment. We respond to the past,"" he is highlighting the idea that our current behaviors, emotions, and reactions are often influenced by past experiences and traumas rather than being solely a response to the current situation we are facing.  This concept is deeply rooted in his understanding of how early life experiences and traumas shape our psychological and emotional responses. Many of our reactions, coping mechanisms, and even physical health issues can be traced back to unresolved events and emotions from our past, particularly from our childhood.  In this context, he's suggesting that our behaviors and emotions are often triggered by memories and emotions that are stored in our subconscious minds. These triggers can cause us to react in certain ways to situations that may seem unrelated to our past experiences. For example, someone who experienced abandonment as a child might struggle with trust and intimacy in their adult relationships, even if the current partner is trustworthy and reliable.  Dr. Maté's assertion underscores the need for individuals to delve into their past, explore their childhood experiences and traumas, and work through any unresolved emotions or issues. By doing so, they can gain insight into why they react the way they do in various situations and potentially break free from patterns of behavior that are rooted in the past.  It's important to note that while our past experiences do influence us, they don't determine our entire present or future. With awareness, therapy, and personal growth, individuals can develop the capacity to respond to the present moment in ways that are not solely dictated by their past. This concept is aligned with many therapeutic approaches that focus on understanding and healing past wounds to promote healthier responses to current situations.",2년 전,0,
@InfiniteTravelingSpirit2BE,"Wish he spoke more about #psychedelics. Dr. Maté has been part of the movement advocating for the responsible and controlled use of certain psychedelics, such as psilocybin (found in ""magic mushrooms"") and MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy), in therapeutic settings. Some of the key points he has highlighted include:  Trauma Healing: Dr. Maté believes that psychedelics, when used in a therapeutic context, can potentially help individuals explore and process deeply rooted emotional traumas. These substances may facilitate access to repressed emotions and memories, allowing for a more profound therapeutic experience.  Addiction Treatment: He has also spoken about the potential of psychedelics in treating addiction. Research has shown promising results in using substances like psilocybin in combination with therapy to help individuals overcome substance abuse issues.  Mindfulness and Self-Awareness: Psychedelics may induce altered states of consciousness, which can lead to enhanced self-awareness and mindfulness. This heightened state of awareness can be valuable in therapeutic settings for gaining insights into one's behaviors and thought patterns.  Importance of Context and Integration: Dr. Maté emphasizes the importance of using psychedelics in a controlled and supportive environment. The integration of psychedelic experiences into daily life and ongoing therapy is crucial for deriving lasting benefits.  Caution and Responsible Use: While Dr. Maté acknowledges the potential benefits, he also emphasizes the importance of caution and responsible use of psychedelics. These substances are not without risks and can have adverse effects, especially when used inappropriately or without proper guidance.",2년 전,2,

Tim was very open to describing what he was feeling and what emotions he was having, dissapointment, and anger. Dr. mate keeps saying those arent emotions, until Tim just agrees with the words the Dr. Mate says. Then Dr. Mate shoehorns him into a feeling of personal unworthiness, which if you listen tim repeats but doesnt seem to agree with. Just so Dr. Mate can attribute some child trauma to the event. I would say this is really bad therapy technique, and a major red flag on receiving therapy from anyone if they do this. Also his question on ""now what if you imagined you were Completely perfectly deserving of love and respect?"". Tim plays along by saying he would not feel the personal attack and would attribute more charitable actions to the guy. But the real answer is you would be a narcissist who all of your problems are not my fault. Dont pretend your perfect, and dont pretend you are 100% broken, just evaluate what you are.",2년 전,0,

@dujon,I spent the time writing this out for my friend. It's straight from these guys... As I have interpreted it. 38:01   Addiction is the mind trying to resolve a problem in the short term that often leads to long term problems. ADHD/tuning out is a coping mechanism a baby adopts as they can't separate themselves from their caretaker. When one tunes out that nullifies and depresses emotions (with good reason as a baby) This repetitive action (known as depression) becomes a conditioned trait/ mental pattern which in the long run is counter productive.,2년 전,0,

@karenkiebooms1373,"Change the past for a better future ...  During my life, 4 cycles have been completed (for the collective, not only for me personally) - easy to remember by the number 5555 ... The cycle of 5000 years has to do with my life as Khayat (sounds like Gaia with a soft G), The Maya High ptiestess, who married the Sun God twice (first Ry'an and later Amon Ra) The cycle of 500 years has to do with 2 lives, Belisa Barca was born in 1470 and Joanna van Castille died in 1520 => a period of 50 years, with an overlap of 5 years (1498 -> 1503) The cycles of 50 and 5 years return in my life -> the death of my mother in 2010 to May 3, 2015, the day I celebrated my 55th birthday I could make my story a tearsucker because none of my projects saw the daylight (and each of the was a one of a kind chance to see the beauty in everything), but that's only confirming the idea of losing everything because of the behaviour of a very small group of people. I want to make a different kind of mosaic from my strange and mysterious memories, certainly the 42 days between 20/11/2011 and 1/1/2012, when the process that will end on 5/5/'23 (because of the 555) started to accelerate. I am the Teacher who had to study herself to find the difference between science and knowledge and it started with the difference betweeen the Master (connected to the ba of ka-ba-la) and the Teacher (connected to the ka or female & spiritual energy).  The swastica is an example of negative linking because it was used for air-energy (counter clockwise) versus water energy (clockwise rotation), the color of the anti-clockwise rotation is red (warmth) and clockwise rotation is blue (light). Warmth can be transmitted to light and vice versa and these simple facts can change our entire system of sustainable energy. To make the subject of the swastika neutral again, I have the story of the L-K connection or Lobe-Kiebooms connection. The Lobe (meaning lion) refers to Daniel Lobe, Peter's grandfather, and the Kiebooms to Louis Kiebooms, the old mayor of Wilrijk. My father's name was Lode Kiebooms, which sounds a lot like Lobe Kiebooms and that's probably the mistake the medium made in the past, using her ouija board to channel the messages. Louis Kiebooms saved Daniel Lobe and his sister, Vogelina, from deportation because of the statement that mixed marriages did not lead to Jewish families (they both married a Belgian partner that was not Jewish. Louis Kiebooms paid a price for his humanity, he was deported himself and was captured for 4 years - deportation did effect all kinds of people, not only Jews. For me, it's not a matter of who's paying the price, but how can we prevent ending in the same mess again and again en because the story of my life depictures a whole different side of humanity, I want to give people different tools to make their own life an experience never to be forgotten. Every life (past, present, and future) is a unique story that can be used as an example for others - if you want to make the world a better place, behave that way to start with and none of my projects were judgmental and started with giving, in the hop of receiving something of equal worth. It didn't happen yet and, instead of being rewarded, they started to sabotage everything, or gave it away to their own favorites: my trust in humanity is severely damaged, but I do believe in my own strength to change the wheel of fortune into a new and much more desirable way. I'm not playing solo (another difference between the ba and the ka or society versus communinity) and got a one of a kind support team, I call my KNAP team (Kaey-Noa-Arne-Patrick). Instead of starting trials to get compensated, I'll WORK for a unique kind of salary (and my 4 KNAP members are my employers) - 3560 euro on my personal account every 1st of the month (so I get paid back the money I needed to have a 'comfortable' life and not having to take care of the finances at all (so I don't create debts in advance + they can't use financial pressure to manipulate my creative brain).  Yesterday, I got a special confirmation, watching a video about the movie Lnowing (Nicolas Cage). It was about a date that had nothing to do with the script: 15/05/'23 and that's exactly 11 years after ending my manuscript (May 15, 2012). For an unknown reason, I wrote the date when I started writing my temorary diary (April 12, 2012) and when I wrote my 'last word' ... the title of the manuscript is ""Words are alike water, they can take any form ..."" Some political and historical issues came to light since then, but we have to live our own lives at the present and allow others to live their lives. I don't want to be remembered as the angry teacher, but the loving mother of my 3 kids. I, at least, TRIED to find a solution and can't be responsible for the behaviour of people that should know better. It's almost time to go, but my nobody Sofie (356) Taes gets her own body, so the knowledge can be saved, and I get my own corpse (so there will be a period of 11+ years that shall be overwritten).",2년 전,0,

@stephen-wahl,"[Warning: a long one. Apologies for the essay but this is important stuff]    Alice Miller's The Drama of The Gifted Child is probably one of the most influential and seminal work I've read. In fact, I lent it to a friend who had revealed many of his childhood hardships and trauma but he didn't read it (or not yet) But at least he didn't lose it lol. Not important as I will be ordering another copy which will probably be my third or fourth because having shared it a few times, I always have to have a copy of it in my library.  Another one of her brilliant books also perfectly described my life as well: ""For Your Own Good"" details the rigid and regimented German pedagogy in which emotions are suppressed and contained in order to maintain a certain kind of social order, compliance, difference to authority and the emotional toll. It takes on the individual. Most especially how those deep-seated repressed anger must be released in some form, which Hitler harnessed and made full use of the scapegoat that was became the Jewish people. A fascinating and important must read. Most especially if you happen to be brought up with these kinds of child rearing protocols, an iron fist in hand, severe forms of physical punishment, etc and emotional distance and a lack of expressing love or tenderness. My father grew up in Germany during WWII and only came to Canada after the war ended as a teenager and I suppose the godsend was that he was a little young to be recruited for the Hitler youth. But he doesn't talk much about those days, stopped speaking German. The moment he came to Canada, wouldn't allow my grandmother to speak it at home when she visited but later she filled me in on her early experiences, Not only with my alcoholic mother after marriage but also the highly deferent fatherland as she would have to stand at the after serving dinner to wait for her husband and the golden boy, that became my father, to start eating. I think it was to ensure that everything was up to their standard or something and would prevent a strong rebuke as she could easily and quickly fix it.  I remember in my early 20s after moving away to New York City—pretty much fleeing from my hometown of Vancouver—and reading DotGC with astonishment and while it was 30 years ago, I can remember where it was, remember the place where I devoured most of it: Pier 46 in the West Village and Even remember the time and day and weather when I came to one of its most powerful and meaningful passages, as it basically described my life. I think my jaw stayed on the piers wooden flooring most of the time reading it. Fortunately for NYC in the late '80s going into therapy was a pretty standard practice— embraced actually— in contrast to my hometown which was pretty stodgy and backwards in that regard. It was a decade long journey that both the book, the city, and other positive influences would herald.  I'm not sure if it made me weep or not, but the same sort of sentiment occurs in Good Will hunting when Matt Damon breaks down with his therapist played by Robin Williams after using his typical protective armour, but his therapist is intent on breaking through:: ""it's not your fault, it's not your fault... [Will is like WTF, but is softening] .... therapist continue: ""it's not your fault....it's not your fault..d.. [and again and again as he starts to reach the core of Will's  demons, the ship on his shoulder etc..... ""it's not your fault, it's not your fault....."" and on, until Matt Damon breaks down in his arms. That gets me every time. It's usually pretty much sobbing and water works for me. Actually I just need to imagine that scene and repeat those words about 5 or 6 if I ever want a good cry.  Thank you Tim for having such gifted (that means sensitive) guests with so many healing gifts, illustrious and making the world a better..... Dr. Maté, who knowing his story and his loss of family in the Holocaust, has so many reasons to be angry and bitter, but he chose a path of healing and redemption, I regret not being able to see him at his ADHD clinic in Richmond as he was on sabbatical, but almost. Saw his colleague.  who also lives in my hometown and has worked for decades in our beleaguered downtown east side, probably amongst the most miserable and challenging inner city blocks for the marginalized and forgotten, dismissed, ignored and pretty much treated like they're expendable and just like the trash. The home of more than 1000 fentanyl overdose deaths a year, and it's only gotten worse. And this man spent so much of his career dedicated to the marginalized. So his seminal work, ""Realm of Hungry Ghosts"", a treatise on the roots of addiction, and his work for decades there, an almost brilliant yet simple hypothesis that addiction is the result of trauma. That's it. If we spent some of the billions devoted to the poverty industry and divert to mental health and treatment, that might be a better approach than our complete failure in offering the help these forgotten and disposed of souls need. I've been more fortunate with my own trauma based addiction issues only because I was able to avail myself of what is available, but I have had the support network and so many privileges and access not available to many of these marginalized people with addiction issues,.     Thank God there are wise enough people still that can elucidate such wisdom especially focused on those many of us walk by regularly who aren't fortunate enough to have the familial support and have become shunned and overlooked by those in their former lives. Can you let Dr. Maté know that i would love to have him as my first guest if I ever get around to being a content creator like yourself.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@Dowlphin,"He mentioned the common issue of sacrificing authenticity for attachment. But this seems like another of those popculture biases that creates an awful blind spot: Can we talk about the people who sacrificed attachment to preserve their authenticity? This is like that other one, the 'clichée' of someone not willing/able to accept help, which creates a blind spot towards awareness of people doing everything they can to seek help but not getting it. This is all perpetuating a very cynical situation where one type of suffering is normalized, where people actually thrive on the pain and then attain better means for healing it, whereas the other type are screwed doubly. Basically one type of misery has mainstream support.  1:59:00 Or maybe vacation with intention is just a further expression of your workaholism, whereas true recreation does not come from balancing unpleasant control experiences with pleasant control experiences but with embracing the true duality, the unstructured as contrast to the structured.  As for the victim-vs-self-empowerment approach, there another dimension of spiritual teaching opens, because if it becomes imbalanced, it can impair actual direct empathy, because then a value judgment might be made on those who self-victimize. The true power is in a decision made to affect someone else's life instead of putting up a wall of doctrine, which can manifest through talk. Often words are mere carrier waves for true caring behind them, or its absence. It is related to people mistaking a healing technique for that which heals. Present a difficult case of need of healing, then offer someone a million dollar for a success story, and see an arguably perverted version of true caring. - But there are and were a few exceptional people (like Bruno Gröning) who would give everything they have to offer without subjecting it to the condition of reward. All they are asking for is to receive what they need to fulfill their mission of sharing the best of their abilities. In fact, Bruno Gröning had people offer him immense riches for his work, but he rejected, in part from an understanding that it would get in the way of the healing - of that which truly matters. (Although he had the cynical benefit of an ability that would rally enough popular support for his mission to make it sustainable. - And still, eventually he was lawfared to death. Because while he healed many people, very few people could return the favor to him. His mission was inherently sacrificial and he paid the price for it. Although from his viewpoint it was humankind who paid the real price, for not appreciating a gift enough. - Fast forward to Julian Assange, somewhat cynically since his name has gained so much prominence, but it serves the point.)",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@bobhumid,"Mates. This was intense! And marvelous ... I am speachless, uncountable epiphanies and conclusions are floating around my head ... Thanx galore Gabor and Tim!  I am also smitten by the sheer fact that I did not experience any thematic redundancy over the whole length of this upmost interesting interview  - nor did I detect the slightest tone of biased thinking. or opinion. More over Dr. Gabor Mathé´s argumentations, even when he formulates a dogma like that ADHD is not a genetical mandatory defect, but a copying-mechanism of an embryonic little yet underdeveloped young human in its mother´s womb, reacting against her stress. There are no culprits here. He follows a benevolent, life-embracing and truly humanistic phenomenological analytic path, which  radically uncovers many of the hardened blind spots of the postpostneurotic-modern human and its society.  But, Dr. Gabor Mathé manages to perform this art of analytic psychosocial surgery without harming anyone. There is only to be gained here.  <3  Personally I feel and perceive Dr. Mathé as being historically related to R.D.Laing, who by unmasking the concept of ""love"" in family systems of the 60ies as pure violence (Using game-theory btw.) helped identifying mental illnesses as results of socialy divided minds forced into total personal desperation. But Dr. Mathé is at no moment as sad or desperate as Mr. Laing was in its darker moments. Then, wenn he fought to harmonise human violence with his love for humans (""Few books are excusable. Only blackness on a canvas etc."" is the opening sentence in his great oeuvre ""The politics of experience"". Maybe this is by random forces, but I can easily crossread Mathé and Laing. It is also to be noted, that Mathé does not evoke any pseudospiritual connotations on the overly abused term ""hope"", since he is obviously more the kind of person who lives by radically accepting existence and has searched for real answers as the modern Buddah that he is. Also he does not chronically regurgitate the overused adoration for the concept of ""empathy"" (As if such emotion could be forced), as so much mediocre ""healers"" or lifeless life-coaches throw into the ""mindfulness"" debate in sheer lack of real effective solutions. You´d better focus on the pain of a person with addiction, instead of trying to fight the addicition alone, as if it was the problem in the first place. No, he obviously went through a universe of work, effort and experience to know how to deliver precious concrete solutions to to fight the ablaze burning phalanx of actual human dilematas and psychological crises  which decorate and infested our current existence.

If I have the energy I will see if I can capture how much time Tim speaks vs. how much time we hear from Dr. Maté.  Very disappointed because I had saved this for a longer drive and had to quit in the middle.  The interview would have been much better if we could have focused on the learnings and findings from the Doctor's incredible work and had Tim asked more thoughtful and less 'winding' questions.  Some of the questions started/stopped, indicated he would get back to them, took a left turn and then ended up as a whole 'nother question.  I felt like Tim was on the couch, Dr Maté had his pad of paper and that's what we had to observe.

@terrohudson4531,"Dr. Gabor Mate finally I've heard a viable reason for addiction. The PTSD calls addiction a comorbid or not a symptom of PTSD. I resisted illness especially historical trauma and yet another illness that native American people can have. Then years later I'm diagnosed w PTSD. Which was a lifesaver to have something besides addiction to provide an excuse for health care providers to drive me down that road. A lifetime of using drugs and alcohol w long periods of sobriety and ministry and alternative energy healing training. I've been on a pro drug campaign or in other words standing up for those who use drugs. It's biological for one reason. The health clinic Indian Health Service refuses to send me to the depak Chopra center in Canada. Who shares my ideals and beliefs. I tried traditional treatment I lasted three days. Voluntarily I went to a dirty environment w prison mentality. My counselor at hope dropped me as a patient. I need clean living nurturing and honest environment to heal. I've been isolated for years now. My mom died my siblings rejected me as well as my two daughters. I'm struggling with getting a life to rebloom and renew into a more beautiful life that is ME. Thank you. I was in the hospital and received surgery twice by the time I was five days old. Mom had to give blood w rare blood type only the two of us had. Alcoholism, violence, sexual abuse, crazy! Childhood, the youngest of a group of living alcoholics and party life with long spells of Lawrence well night etc. Two PhD aunts in education who we visited annually a few times. They took were lifesavers. My intelligence was high so I was 4.o grades and the biggest stoner in the school. Adolescence I lost again. Moved to a big city from small twin Idaho. Lots of love and lots of violence...59 years old and digging my way to the skies once again. Love the work.

@PinkHairIcon,"As much as I love Mate my personal bone to pick: it was that Spock advice of self soothing my loser mother and sociopath stepfather employed for my 9 years younger brother.  I knew that was retarded advice and so I became my infant brother’s care provider.  I was “raised”by my grandmother so I’m was able to identify the hopeless circumstances.  The best solution other than accepting the responsibility I could come up with at that age was to poison them and runaway with my infant brother.  I did the quick math in my head and determined the success rate wasn’t favorable.  I’ve been running away since then and I’ve been trying to redirect my family since 1980.  I finally gave up for good when my youngest brother assaulted me for calling 911 on him.  My mother is a monster 👹. I’m free now, I’m just overwhelmed by the tyranny of choice.

@akasha11111,"In almost every podcast or workshop Gabor Maté would ask someone: when was the last time you felt anger? The person describes that situation and Gabor asks: how does it make you feel? In other words: what does it mean about you? Then he would challenge that perception with other possible explanations of what happened. Finally Gabor would ask when was the first time you had this perception of not being good enough, coming from childhood. Maté says your brain jumped automatically to that explanation/perception.  So it seems to me that Gabor Maté considers a trigger as a top-down approach where thoughts create an emotion, when in fact it’s stored material which comes up first (that was once in the past created by a perception). Gabor explores other explanations, so questioning the belief, but it’s stored material (that was once created by a perception, but that already happened before). Now it’s already in the body, so isn’t that what you work with? (bottom-up approach of Somatic Experiencing)",2년 전,0,

A lot of people use drugs for self medication. If it gets out of hand, we call it ""addiction"". If it does not, it was ""never an issue"". It's not that simple. There needs to be done a lot on education on drug usage in our societies. If someone using drugs is reading this, if there is only one rule i would argue to be important, it's you should always as truthfully as possible know why you take something.",2년 전,0,

The thing is, everyone has trauma. its more pronounced now, because we are not related to nature. we live in isolated community, etc.. This is part of it. I had a very tramatic childhood. I have been off and on for many years= including a 5 week trauma rehab.  Im 68 and I know that therapy can only do so much. I have been helped tremendously by. connecting my spiritual practice to nature. And Im not  really interested in  loving kindness. Im interested in seeing who I am, and in that seeing is the transformation. I was taught this through the Gurdjieff teaching. But even that was lacking until I studied the Bhagavad Gita.  We cant wait to go to a therapist. or maybe your super lucky to have brilliant  one.

@sandraarista3121,"Interesting how these are topics I learned about in church. They call them generational chains. They are written about in the BIBLE. It even mentions that HE (God) knew us in the womb-- making reference to our consciousness, development, and existence prior to birth. In addition, you can find the relationship between emotions and sickness in the Bible, too.  It is believed that children require parents who are deeply rooted in YAHWEH. Therefore, the decision to find a spouse is not one to make with haste. The parents who follow the ways of YAH will therefore take mindful care for their children (as it is considered a ministry- a job given by GOD to represent who HE is). Marriage is also considered a ministry and therefore considered sacred. Unfortunately, the pure teachings of Christianity are not revered nor followed by many Christians today- perhaps that's because there are not many TRUE practicing Christians around today. Myself included. The only way to be truly delivered from TRAUMA in the view of Christianity is through the reconnection and consistent UNITY with the Creator. Through the re- identification process that you are set free. It is no longer about who you think or say you are. This unity brings awareness when one is out of line. It is the Holy Spirit that comforts and convicts the follower to analyze his or her ways and come back to TRUTH.  Funny that what Dr. Gabor Maté is mentioning is nothing new at all in Christianity either. I wonder if he's aware of the correlation? This is good news.",2년 전,1,

For years I’ve had a pretty good idea as to where the trauma and addictions in my own life had stemmed from but hadn’t the slightest idea how to truly address them and make peace with the past. Above all this has given me hope. I know that there may be much in my own journey that still needs done but it now feels so much more feasible than I would’ve originally thought.

@christineploeg1992,Comparison between dr mate and dr Peterson.  Both care deeply about people’s well being.  Both are very open and raw about their personal struggles especially with stress and drugs  Both manifest anger toward the way things just are in society Both highly intelligent and sensitive Both seem to have difficulty smiling and laughing.  Both Canadian  Both superstars  Neither seems to call upon  a personal God for strength or personal forgiveness  Please comment with other similarities. Also differences.   Seems like Peterson emphasizes the role of personal responsibility in creating maintaining good mental health.   Seems like Maté believes the human is perfect until he or she gets interfered with psychologically  Peterson is pro spanking(?) Maté sees spanking as abusive and damaging.  Peterson sees government as a net detriment as well as abusive and damaging (somewhat “right wing”) Seems like Maté sees government as provider of benefits (More “left wing”) What else?,2년 전,0,
@AwakenedGoddes,"I’m a licensed mindfulness-based psychotherapist. The thing is you want therapist to be the gate keepers and the healers to help people do this work.

@jcchrism,"🧘‍♂️THE TECHNIQUE👁️ The goal of this technique is to activate your Pineal and Pituitary Glands/ Third Eye. You must realize that the metaphysical experience is the direct result of a physical process that you force to occur within your body. Begin by laying down in a safe place. Do a basic meditation to relax your body and clear your mind. Once you are relaxed, you are going to start squeezing and expanding your brain. Your brain is attached to muscles and tendons  let you expand and squeeze it. Bring your focus to your forehead and try squeezing and expanding your frontal lobe. Concentrate and keep trying until you can get it. Once you can feel it moving then move to the center of your brain, (this is where the glands are located, the Eye of RA) and do the same thing. Squeeze then stretch it out, feel it expand as if past your skull, squeeze, expand... After a few minutes move to the back of your brain where the Claustrum is located. This is where the Sacred Oil is produced. Do the same, squeeze, expand over and over. Once you get the hang of it, start doing it in a wave motion from the front to the back. Continue squeezing and expanding repeatedly until you can start to feel the fluids moving, such as mucus running down the back of your throat. Some people, myself included, experience something that sounds and feels like a crust breaking off the outside of your brain, this is normal. The objective is to get your brain working, you have never used it like this before. Once you get the fluids moving you want to push the Oil from the Claustrum in the back of the brain down the back of the spine, down your nervous system and back up the front. Using your back muscles, push the fluid down the back of your spine to the bottom. Squeezing your muscles in your lower area like your buttocks and sphincter. Then start pushing the fluid up the front of your spine. Men as well as women have kegel muscles, use these like a pump. Using your stomach and your chest muscles, continue pushing the fluid up the front of your spine into your brain, pumping the fluid up the front of the nervous system into the Pineal and Pituitary Glands, the Promised Land of Milk and Honey. Continue repeating this pattern, from the front of your brain to the back of your brain, down the back of your spine to the bottom, and up the front of your spine into your brain. Repeat this process as long as you can. When I did this I was not staring at a clock but it felt like an hour. Realistically I would say 15 to 30 minutes. I did it until all of a sudden I couldn't close my eyes! Not even to blink. This lasted for several minutes. At first I thought I broke my brain! As soon as I was able to relax enough to barely close my eyes, I slipped...   Some things to note:  1. I know to a lot of people this sounds weird, (like it's not already weird) but you need to make sure that the Moon is in your Sun Star sign. The Moon affects the fluids in your body and helps the Oil be created.  2. The ancient gnostic text talk about sexual abstinence in order to get this to work. I refrained from having sex for two weeks before I did this. 3. Make sure you are in a good place in your head and that you have pure thoughts. Because if you don't, you won't go all the way to the end and meet the Light.  4. If this does not work the first time, try decalcifying your brain for six months and then come back and try again. I put in a reverse osmosis machine under my kitchen sink for $150.00 and I quit using fluoride toothpaste. Fluoride calcifies the pineal gland, which is what we are trying to activate.  5. This last one is a WARNING. Working on yourself is PARAMOUNT beforehand so that you have the best positive experience you can. Also, you need those skills for afterwards. I was super high for about 2 weeks and then I became insanely negative. It took a lot of hard work to crawl out of that hole and then maintain the connection, so you need to be prepared for that mentally. SUICIDE HAS OCCURRED IN THE UNPREPARED. THIS IS LIFE CHANGING. Make sure you have some good meditation techniques. Maybe have a friend handy to lean on a little. In my experience I was granted one wish, I wanted to be emotionally healed from the damage caused by being an innocent man on death row. I was also gifted with a vision. The Chrystal Light Being touched my heart in order to heal it so that I could love my family properly, and it showed me that everyone on Earth has this Light Being inside of them. Everyone will have their own experience. This is how to have a true Kundalini Awakening, but it's also called the Anointing of the Christ/Chrism Oil, the return of Christ is the return of this knowledge to you. This is what it means to have Christ in you inorder to enter Heaven, it's something you do while you are alive. Email me at jcchrism at yahoo. com for a free pdf with more info. Good luck my friend.

@NicoProv,"Eternal life is truly a FREE GIFT. It cannot be earned but must be received by faith alone in Jesus Christ.If you don't receive Jesus Christ as your Saviour you will die and burn in hell for eternity. But that fate is sooooo preventable.  Only pride or some other sin would stop you. The bottom line is this: your a sinner and there is an eternal penalty for sin when you die. Someone will pay that penalty. It will either be Jesus Christ or it will be you. Please do not let it be you. Jesus Christ paid the full penalty for your lifetime of sins on the cross with his own blood and death on your behalf.  He took the death penalty in your place then rose to life the 3rd day and offers you a pardon. You must simply believe he did this for you and call upon him with your mouth to save you from hell trusting in him and hi finished work on the cross alone as your only means of getting into heaven. I pray you receive Jesus Christ as your Saviour today before its too late. Go on youtube and type in : "" How to know for certain your going to heaven when you die- Dr.Hank Lindstrom""  .

My Peruvian friend said something about this and never even thought that deeply about this.  I’m planning to go to Peru in November to heal with plant medicines and really need this.

@sanataj,"As Gabor Mate says, you need to reconnect with your true feelings, your original self, before the response to trauma distorted the beliefs and reasoning for life and caused more damage. Does anyone know how to do that? It seems to come down to somatic therapies, journaling and meditation. And shrooms??  But are they safe to take, when you are isolated and alone? For awareness have you looked into (negative) core beliefs'? Morty Lefkoe has a list of them on his website(s) e.g. 'I am not good enough'.  They are misinterpretations we make, based on the way we are treated as children, which seem to fit the facts. We then go on to base our other understandings and interpretations of behaviour and situations on the shaky foundations of negative core beliefs. So we then unknowingly create  our own torture.  The solution is to find out what your core beliefs are and to challenge the unhelpful ones.  CBT therapy tries to do that.  About insight, here is a guy on Youtube called Steven Stokes from Australia, who explains in slides the theory of the mental processes in C-PTSD, from childhood onwards.  He calls it something like developmental immaturity. It leads to addictions as coping mechanisms. That is relevant, because he was an addict himself and he now works in a therapy institution. The name of the channel is South Pacific Private. Anyway, see what he has to say, it's very informative, if complicated.",2년 전,0,

I have, in a way, always understood why, as a long time sufferer of childhood PTSD.  Also, I have autism on top of it.  But yeah, it makes absolute sense that he brings that book up.  I hope that one day I will feel like that little girl and her army of stuffed Care Bears and colorful ponies are still alive somewhere inside me.   I haven’t gotten there yet, and still find myself crying at the end.  Hell, I’m in tears just typing this.  That simple little book…so profound for me.  As far as Dr Gabor goes - I feel like we have a lot in common, having experienced both deep, layered trauma along with neurodivergence.  I have never had a substance abuse problem myself, my issues have turned into disabling autoimmune diseases, PTSD, major depressive disorder and dissociative disorder.   Basically, severe mental illness that is “treatment resistant.”  Despite never trying any hallucinogens, Ayahuasca has been on my radar for over a decade and I wonder if it could help in some way.  I don’t know.   I worked so hard and lost everything - I used to work with the elderly and disabled until I became too sick to work.  I am struggling to find something I CAN do.  Regardless, I’m sending my love to all of you who are here for similar reasons, anyone who may be reading this.

Start treating each other like we want to enjoy ourselves together in our moments and watch what happens to almost every problem we have. Religious or not. Not understanding this or choosing to do this has always been the root of every single problem we've ever had. One big problem. One simple solution. Our ends and happy beginnings have always come from how we relate to our environment and to each other.   That's what is being recorded in our bodies and this is the relationship we have to ourselves. It's just one large circle of cause and effect. Do this alone and watch what happens to your life and how you feel about it and each other:),3년 전,1,

If a child is raised in a home with a poor diet, will that child function as well as a child raised in a healthy household? Is crime, poverty, or suicide connected to diet in any way ?? I was learning about fecal transplants and how it affected mice and humans, the study provided incredible results… the took feces from healthy rat and transplanted it into a sick rat, not only did the rat improve but the sick rat increased its lifespan by 30%. Another example was a woman who received a fecal transplant from her cousin, because her cousin was 32 lbs heavier , the microbiota in the feces changed the entire body to fit it’s preferred environment, and the woman who received the transplant gained exactly 32lbs.

@Nicoladen1,"Good and bad are learned concepts. Pain itself is just as neutral as love. Neutral unless viewed from a limited point of view. There's no good and bad outside a limited point of view, and no truth to be found within one. Pain is a mechanism to ensure our survival, so it's good. Romantic relationships are the accidental entanglement of two egos who then become dependent on their established emotional feedback-loop. Technically bad. It all depends on the stance you take. Everything is good and bad, we just never look at things from more than one angle. Because we never question the narrow personality that we've adapted during our upbringing and early adolescence. To question oneself is to be open for truth. Only then is there potential for growth, and only then is there the necessary clarity for telling truth from lie.",3년 전,0,

@SuperMrHiggins,"I disagree with Mate on a few things, least in his book. His reliance on or at least his deference towards the 12 step model, in particular. It is more harmful than it is helpful, and studies have shown that exposure to it actually worsens most peoples substance (mis)use. (The Sober Truth: Debunking the Bad Science Behind 12-Step Programs and the Rehab Industry by Lance Dodes and Zachary Dodes. Though you can find other sources easily online.)  He does great work, and having said that, we - meaning people with addictions whether they are active or in remission - are not broken or sick people. We are human beings with trauama. We are human beings who overwhelmingly (something like 95 percent) have CHILDHOOD trauma. Those that don't have adulthood trauma. Addiction, whether it is to a substance, videogames, Television, Pornography, Sex, Food, Gambling, or whatever else one can be addicted to (which is pretty much everything) is a trauma response. Why that is so confusing is anathema to me. It's not some spiritual malady. YOU ARE NOT BROKEN. I PROMISE YOU. SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU, AND THOUGH SOCIETY MAY DELEGATE THE ROLE OF OUTCAST TO YOU, IT DOES NOT NEGATE THE FACT THAT YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING AND THUS HAVE SUCH GOODNESS AND LOVE INSIDE YOU THAT THOSE YOU KNOW WILL BE SHOCKED WHEN YOU SHOW IT TO THEM!",3년 전,0,

@johnmatallana8106,"Wow! one of the best interviews I have ever seen. It seems very complicated getting to the source of why we form bad habits or behaviors or why we are the way we are. It's a complexed web of emotions, traumas, frustrations and experiences. Definitely an opportunity to dissect and further look inward to find solutions to the self. Also, I have personally been part of an Ayahuasca ceremony, also known as Yage in Colombia and it was mind transforming. It definitely rids the you of the ego and you deep dive into inner demon but also an overwhelming sensation of absolute LOVE like Dr. Gabor mentioned. Everyone experiences Ayahuasca differently however there are certain trends or patterns. Thank you so much for sharing knowledge, this is tru love here.",3년 전,18,

@saviaescrita9307,"About 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with a severe mental disorder. I spent thousands of dollars in therapy (which always felt insufficient), multiple psych hospitalisations, suicidal ideation, etc. In my desperation, I tried many alternatives and arrived to sacred Ayahuasca. I would be short of words to explain the healing it has brought into my life. I was very scared but found a real shaman, prepared accordingly and researched well, and I feel I wasted so many financial and human resources in mainstream medicine. I feel the field that attends to the psyche must evolve and listen to the real needs of its patients, not just what's been predetermined as the norm. May you all find healing.",3년 전,1,

I was in a taxi once with a little boy who was screaming a name from the story!  So, I got my phone , turned on YouTube & played Winnie the Pooh & played it for him & he calmed right down!

@lucasholthuis5871,"FYI; in cultures that maintain shamans, the person who is sick or plagued or in need of healing g or spiritual insight DOES NOT consume the toad or vine or mushroom. THE SHAMAN consumes the entheogen, and in that state performs the diagnosis and cure and deliveres advice.  Someone who gives entheogens to others is NOT a shaman. The keeper of the medicine is beholden to the spirit of the medicine, and to administer it appropriately and in keeping with the spirit of medicine. They are in charge of recipes,  dosages, and ritual around the medicine.  Critically they are responsible for gatekeeping the medicine and administering it only to those who need it a d who the medicine approves. A medicine keeper will refuse to give the medicine to someone who it's not right for. Someone who gives  the medicine to anyone is called a drug dealer.  You can think of it as the difference between a doctor of surgery (shaman) a doctor  of pharmacy (medicine keeper) Anyone who claims they are a shaman should be able to enter trance, commune with spirits, and come back with useful information.  Anyone who claims to ""have"" a shaman - especially when they are describing someone  who will administer  entheogens, should  be considered  at best confused and at worst dangerous.  Let's also add that a medicine man is not a witch doctor. Medicine keeper = Pharmacist  Shamans = Surgeon  Witch Doctor = Oncologist  And last but  ot least, the medicine chooses the patient, not the other way around.

@miapinewater6339,"My dear friend, thank you very much for this wonderful sharing. ANd this is why I'm sharing this here, hoping you 'll read it. There is always a part that is missing for me despite the already very advanced approach and it is the clarity around the method of integration in a mental therapeutic way, which refers classically to psychotherapy. I strongly encourage you two looking at Teal Sawn process called The Completion Process, which is as clear as water and for which I'm so veery grateful because it has the parts that was missing :  Fragmentation is what you're referring to when the child has to choose between Love/Attachhment and his own Truth/Self/gut.  Shadow Work is when you ask yourself 'when was the first time I felt this way?' and you trace back the first traume AND, and this is what's missing in your explanation that is CRUCIAL for the biological shift to happen/change the pattern/heal, is to talk to this part and save him out of the situation he is still stuck : which is literally the definition of trauma ; an unresolved pain.  This is where Parts Work takes place, which is another step of the Completion Process that can be done independently (for example, I just want to know why I have this part that wants to do this and another one that doesn't? It can just be use as a self-inquiry, acquaintance). So you start asking questions to this part as if you were literally in presence of a child/baby (whatever age you went back) in front of you and you are the only one who can rescue this little one. You will try to know as much as you need to take him out of the place of trauma. The great advantage with this technique is that you can do whatever you want since it is in your mind. Imagination is your limit. You can create a safe heaven and whatever saviors you want to involve because, in this space, everything is possible. You, as the adult, guided if necessary, is the one allowing anything to happen.  That is the part that makes all the difference. Changing the story. Healing : which really is experiencing the opposite. When a bone break, to heal is to put the bone back in place and state. Being abandoned is to be saved. And we can to that with this process.  English is not my first language, french is. I hope I convey clearly my point to participate to this most dearest subject that we could called egology, as to ecology. ;-) With all my love, Fragmentation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeUlPO2iXb4&t=729s The Completion Process : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jty-QG_N8c Parts work : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxMD4tSHwfc",3년 전(수정됨),0,

They say success is the greatest revenge especially against others who have “tried to destroy your soul” and success is not dependent on being gifted, being gifted is helpful but not necessary. It comes down to what you think, imagine and emotionally feel in the moment, Many of us have had traumatic injuries to the heart and mind but the past events as ugly as they are to face cannot be the master of the mind, the regulator of triggers that produce inconsistent results throughout life which ultimately directs people thinking with a fear based consciousness.

In relation to AA, it's not accurate that AA doesn't talk about Bill Wilson's childhood trauma or LSD use (or extra marital affairs). AA literature covers all these in numerous publications (not so much in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous). Bill was not the doctor, the co-founders of AA are Bill W & Doctor Bob. AA was the earliest of peer support networks, where the real expertise is, the lived experience and the solution for me is a safe space to connect with others who share similar lived experiences and the solutions they have found to the 'spiritual malady' (as termed in AA). Much of the solutions to my on going recovery have been covered in this podcast so I really appreciate this confirmation that I am 'trudging the road of happy destiny' (from BB of AA) and find especially helpful an artistic practice (individual and with others) and physical movement (with or without music) and sharing with others in a safe space my experiences and what is most beneficial for me, and hearing from others this same generous and loving (even if painful) information.",3년 전,0,

@mariekurka4518,"Your so intense and so insightful, I cannot sit through an entire video...too much processing.  I am excited to see someone else talking about pain on a forum that might be able to help people. I regularly point out how, when a child experiences any variety of pain, there usually is not someone around to ""help process"" the emotion (or energy)  So the child throws the pain/energy into a black bag called a subconscious and goes on.  They/we develop a lifetime of throw and go and throw and go.  As adults, that black bag can begin to tear and things come out that we don't know what they are or what to do with them....so we call it anxiety and medicate it.  One woman frantically stated ""I'm so anxious I cant stand it"" when asked what happened she said ""my grandkids came over and tore up the whole house.""  She was told...your not anxious, you are angry.  She said ""Damn right I am!!!""....and that I believe is most anxiety.         We also use the variety of techniques to push down or distract from the multitude of emotions/energy we threw into that black bag.  Going through my own tramatic experience causing me to cry for years and then burying the energy with food, I knew I had to find a way to deal with pain.  I found that writing allows me to transfer the pain/energy to the paper using the right and left hemisphere of the brain.....and burning allows for a true release.   You mentioned EMDR.  Walking naturally causes the eyes to move from right to left.  In walking the mile circle 2-3 times with a friend....I always felt I had a therapy session and didn't know why till ten years later...very basic, very accessible form of EMDR.  I also learned about the tapping technique or Emotional Freedom technique.   I nor the people I know, will never get to the level of therapist you talk about.  I have often wished I could try aouwaska(?).  But I feel I have been blessed to deal with the level of pain I have dealt with. Im guessing I got through about half the pain in my subconscious.  Life is so much better.  Self worth exists and has saved me from some serious individuals who wanted to take advantage.  I know I got more to do and will use the tools I have, but it helps that others have pinpointed the issue of pain. So many people are afraid of it...thinking it will never go away.  Only problem is...it doesn't go away until you deal with it.",3년 전,0,

@ladybug5859,"I want to make a comment regarding the word ""sensitive"" as opposed to ""gifted"". I actually feel both are incorrect words being used to  describe a person. IF you want to say someone is gifted then I think you have to say everyone is gifted and if you want to say that person is not gifted then you have to say no one is gifted. I simply think this is an overused word.  AS you can see it has lost all meaning.  As for sensitive, Tim makes a good point about negative emotional reactions being usually attached to people that are called sensitive. He does not possess that reactionary attitude and yet his friend said he was sensitive. I prefer to use the phrase that u used in it podcast with Russell Brand when you said-- if society accepted that we all have souls, they would not treat each other the way they do.  YOU said it in a slightly better way but I think you will recall that statement.  Piggybacking on that, I would say that people that are considered sensitive by society or even by themselves or their mama simply are still attached to their soul while others have become detached from their soul due to their interactions within their family and/ or within the society in which they live. This leads one to say once again that we are ALL sensitive and we ALL feel but some of us are detached from that while others persevere-- remaining attached to their soul and their sense of feeling their own pain and others' pain. AS you have noted many times in many podcasts, that often leads to a person becoming an addict to drugs etc to dull the pain but some people do persevere with the pain & eschew drugs  and r creative as you noted.  I too like Tim avoided that book due to its title-- THE Gifted Child-- which I don't agree with as it already implies exclusivity which is wrong and harmful to both the person who thinks they're gifted & to the person who thinks they are not gifted. IN all events, it's a harmful label.        I was living in a city that was slowly becoming a  majority of foreign-born children coming with a different language and culture and my neighbors-who were very average, blue-collar people from very average or even less than average backgrounds- decided their son was gifted because he was put in the gifted program which simply meant he understood American culture inside & out and the dominant language used & all the culture's innuendoes due to being born within the dominant language &  the dominant culture into a family that only had one child and babied him to the  extreme. HE was NOT ""gifted"". HE was NOT particularly ""sensitive"" but he was immersed in a culture that he was able by osmosis to absorb and consequently perform well on all the little tests they give these very young children to decide if they are ""gifted"". A highly unfortunate process that they NOW do & which they did NOT do when I was young, thank goodness.  AT that time of my youth,  one of my teachers said we should NOT separate the students into those that want to go to college and those that have absolutely NO desire or ambition or ability to go to college because the child  will NOT understand the full panorama of how people are.  THAT actually is the ONLY thing I remember from that class and the teacher said it ONLY to those of us  lingering after class-talking more to himself than us- but my young self knew instinctively he was right.  THE Mozarts; the Beethovens;the Leonardo Da Vincis are  or course symbols of giftedness-tho often not recognized as such in their time- BUT WE ARE NOT. We individually  have certain proclivities and may be attracted to certain things in life that we love and that we excel in but I do not believe that translates that we are gifted. TO use that word and that concept creates more harm for the individual & the society at large then to simply avoid that word entirely.  Definitely the original title is the best descriptor & is truly inclusive of all mankind because are we not all from time immemorial prisoners of childhood?",3년 전,0,

@robertgeraldwalker4987,"Mate's logic: the mind creates the world, but no, the world creates our minds. So the ancient wisdom got it wrong. Thanks to the power of modern thinking, modern society, we can go beyond that.  This is crude arrogance. Problem: but what created the world? A previous mind, one would suppose, which was created by a previous world. It's an endless regress. The Buddhist understanding is one of beginninglessness. Therefore there is no one to blame, nothing to blame. And in the absence of blame, there's a genuine way forward.  Mate reduces suffering to definite causal childhood experiences, which is also his understanding of politics. It's fallacious, and misunderstands both the Dhammapada and buddhadharma. He claims to provide a means for bringing people in the present moment, but with this materialistic-psychological perspective, he will always be trapped in the peanut gallery of bad analytic thinking, which always brings one to blame, attack and counterattack, accurate critiques, as far as they go, but no real way forward.

@yacovmitchenko1490,"When it comes to suffering, the Buddha nailed it. Of all those exploring the origins of suffering, none went deeper than he did. Using my own language, we shouldn't look at the branches, but go into the roots. The root is identification with a false sense or self, or ego. (I'm not excluding the branches, as they are relevant: such as poverty, socio-economic conditions, parental stress, and so on. I'm only suggesting these considerations don't go sufficiently deep.)   Ever since the child begins acquiring language, he begins developing an ego, separating himself from others and from the environment generally. He (and unquestioningly) identifies himself with his personality, body, the group, the nation. Along with these identifications come comparisons and measurement: how do I compare with others, in terms of intelligence, outward wealth, social position, outward beauty, and so forth. Moreover, with this identification it is ""I"", the ego, that takes responsibility, that must assert itself among other competing egos. This sense of individuality of course leads to conflict, a sense of failure, incompleteness, that something's ""always missing"", on which commercialism, advertising, and the economy feeds.   The crazy thing is that this ego doesn't really exist, though the unwavering conviction that it does leads to massive damage, including exploitation and pollution of the environment, from which people feel they're separate. Parents, all of society emphasize your personal identity, as though it were the foundation of all action. Example: ""I feel guilty"", ""I am angry"", ""I feel guilty about my anger"" are all fictions: there is guilt, there is anger, yes, but no ""I"" that is angry, guilty. This ""I""  that feels ""I am happy"" or ""I need to become more responsible"", ""I need to change"" are on a par in a way: for they all strengthen the sense of what isn't really there. If you go the way of this ""I"", your problems will never end. This confusion is the source of never-ending trouble. This false self, while repressing one thing, or seemingly solving one problem, creates 10 fresh ones, because the false self is by nature incomplete, fragmented, divisive. You're taught to be ambitious, to prove yourself against others, to surpass others, to be special (as opposed to others who aren't really), and this process leads to a great deal of depression, because along the way you get sick, you lose that for which you strove, you lose your abilities - without ever having discovered what you really are.  Beware 99 per cent of self-help books, as they only strengthen a false sense of self.   5 poems here, the first 2 about chaos (suffering), the other 3 about self-realization:  Shattered Mirror  Anonymous One, The mirror once stood still as Your radiant smile. The stars' clarity bowed before Adam's eyes. Then it shattered somehow, and the fragments' guile Started playing out with scheming surprise. Each deemed itself a unique culture and nation; It dreamed forth different faiths and hierarchy; It dreamed forth good and evil; each person's station Competed with another, and the enemy Or one fought against was inevitably born. Someone posted up a flag, and a flag was torn Or burned by someone else; the crusader's mind, Sword-intent, tried converting the equally blind. Much later, there was the democratic crusade, The axis of evil parade and charade. What the axis of evil intimated was not That the good would flower forth, be gloriously brought Into the open, once light had vanquished dark, But only how destitute both sides are of Your spark. The source of chaos and madness is not a foreign kind, But the long-divided, fragmented mind.   The More and Emptiness  Anonymous One, We can trace spiral staircases of ocean waves, Geometries of blue reaching for the sun. Eyes and universe can become good friends; The contact can unfurl order in all we do. If we can embrace that which is prior to thought, Stars will take off their haughty robes and bow; They'll be as loving as leaves are to the bough. But thousands upon thousands of years Have been transcended by only a few Because the More's been master in much that we do. The master has taught us a few things, yes; He may be a friend but is an enemy too, For he builds walls, and therefore emptiness And isolation are; hearts are heavily billed When the mind pursues, pursues, when mind is filled. The More convinces us there is something to become, That without becoming somebody, there's no progress. Yet the More's wife is Irony: mind's made numb, Repetitive, conflicted; She has an attractive dress That shimmers and glitters when She dances, But no gate of heaven is, only emptiness. The striving, striving is only more of the same. Without the heart's stillness, order's only a name.   Everywhere  Anonymous One, I am everywhere, as much a dandelion, tulip, or rose As the most distant galaxy, all of space, and beyond those. I am Your mystery: I am neither Hindu, nor Christian, nor Jew, Though I am blood, bone, tenderness of friends, All the craziness of lovers, and the estranged making amends. I have no identifications, or if Soul Does, it only identifies with the Whole. If what I say weaves nicely with the words of Christian or Jew, Muslim or Sufi, it only does because reflection And stillness of mind have discovered it to be true. And truth does not belong to a culture or faith or what not: A fisherman simply waits on glassy waters and something's caught. Though he has a home and address, wife and friends, Though he loves his time by the fire, his children's play, Though he might even be an assembly's part, He never forgets the sun-hushed invitations of his heart. His real home is nowhere, heart's nakedness. The language of fear and profound loneliness, Helplessness, that makes one want to identify, Has no hold, for truth alone would satisfy.   Meditation  Anonymous One, Sometimes when cranes circle overhead, A person washes dishes with a circling hand. Sometimes when a bear runs and catches a silvery prize, A tennis player finds his perfect stride to the public's cries. Sometimes when a brand new car is first driven out, A bunch of new stars shed their cocoon. Sometimes when green leaves blush with the dawn of June, A virgin overcomes her awkwardness and doubt. Sometimes when it snows in Montreal or Edmonton, The flakes floating down, calm, That means that though the person has never known snow, His mind's calm, as he sits under a palm, While a lake in Vermont evens out to staring trees, And a dragonfly's perched on reed, at her ease. A leaf has fallen and a wind has blown In Africa, and a famous man emits a final moan. It's not quite synchronicity, it's much more: It's perhaps meditation, an awesome whole; It belies individual effort and control.   Amsterdam Park  Anonymous One, The mature bloom of yellow afternoon Waved at us, and we entered Amsterdam park. September spoke softly to beach and sand dune, Passersby, deer, trees, red-berry bushes, till the Moon-Dark Of ourselves and aloneness silenced words, Scattering them as though they were a flock of birds. My friend and I - we walked and walked and some profound, Vast and alien meditation suffused each trail and mound. I could no longer say the rabbit stirred the grass Or deer leapt; any movement that would pass Was rather some anonymous force bending space In infinite ways; the green-glowing beetle was Your Face. We stopped by somewhere and only felt there was no mistake, That we had never been elsewhere or ever could be. I say now that we had come to some water With austere presences, each towering tree, But it was Aliveness before the world began: The horizon and shoreline were arcs, and in between Resounded ruffled echoes, cries from the Nothing-seen.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Sounds crazy, but I had clients who have ADHD choosing to have ADHD as a coping mechanism to minimize past life trauma.

@wonderfulpeoplesavingtheearth,"I love everything Dr. Mate says and the actual conversation of listening and responding going on here. The thread disconnects for me when it comes to psychedelics. There's just too much history with addiction here. Look at what happened to many people in the 60s. It didn't turn out pretty. The problem is you think you need it to continue to have the insights, healings and the intense feelings of love. Many people used it as an escape. What was his definition of addiction? It helps until it doesn't and you keep on using it. One starts thinking they need it. There's better ways to go, non-substance ways. What Dr. Mate discovered can be revealed through pure spiritual experiences, chanting, deep reflection and meditation, and it doesn't have to take 10 years. I chant nam myoho renge kyo, which was the Buddha's last teaching of the Lotus Sutra. The chant purifies the mind and body so that the Buddha's wisdom, which is in all of us, can surface clearly. In my opinion, psychedelics take us to a state of bliss (not nirvana) or a high, which is transient, not transformative or transmutational, and can be risky. When ayahuasca was practiced by the original Amazonian tribes, it was a completely different setting, as Dr. Mate said, a different culture and time. Just because it started way back when doesn't mean it's the best for people. Just because it's an old practice doesn't necessarily make it a good one in the end. There are many things people have done for millennia, including war, rape and pillage. They don't pass the test of time. It puts you in an altered state of mind, not reality. IMO",4년 전,3,

Dr. Maté's book ""In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction,"" is on a reading list in one of my social work courses titled Human Development and Environments. I have been sober myself since August 26, 1984 and have suffered trauma as a child.   After just watching the video, so many things are going through my mind that I do not know what to write. I am just so blown away. And Tim, so good to see you, as a young man, seeking the truth about your own life. How inspiring. I have been doing the same for the past five decades. The journey continues. Your video helps.   One suggestion. I have tinnitus and I use closed captioning when watching videos on YouTube. Apparently, because the captioning is auto-generated, it creates numerous typos. I believe that anyone posting on YouTube can manually edit their own auto-generated closed captioning. The current version of captioning is terrible and detracts tremendously from the powerful messages in the video. Please keep up your great work. I cannot wait to start reading Dr. Maté's book.

I think in all cases, we become defensive and feel so much more onslaught from the world than (nonsensitive?) (other?) people. It ends in chronic anxiety, tension, anger, health issues and negative traits. We can all agree that living in a perpetual defense mechanism is exhausting and painful.

So she was caring for an infant during my gestation - AND - simultaneously she was involved in caring for her father, who she loved dearly, who was dying horribly of black lung disease.  He died 2 months after I was born and I was placed in the care of a relative for a few weeks while she was attending to funeral, supporting her mother etc.   I've not wanted to sound corny that I never believed my mother truly loved me but Dr. Mate'  affirms that my irrational fears and insecurities began in utero.",4년 전,18,

@mbrights3158,"This is fantastic and wonderful...Thank you.  I'm wondering about sensitivity. Dr. Gabor says a sensitive person ""feels more""....  I do trust what the doctor is saying.... but I'm struggling a bit with the concept that some are more sensitive than others.  Let's say--for the sake of argument--that two people were born into identical circumstances---(identical, of course, is impossible--but again, let's just say identical for the sake of argument). The reality of ""sensitivity"" would mean that one individual could be more impacted...affected more deeply by those circumstances. I think that this is true...BUT at the same time I question it....because it would mean that sensitivity is a genetic trait (aka it exists absolutely separate from experience). Are we really born with different levels of sensitivity??? Or...could it be that what we call ""sensitivity"" is actually just a correlated response/burden/impact of specific struggles and trauma? Perhaps someone who is ""more sensitive"" simply had a circumstance that created a higher level of struggle and/or suffering. I'm leaning to the latter belief--for one reason---because someone being more sensitive genetically seems to be profoundly difficult to prove---because even if analyzed the behavior/responses/reactions of newborns you could not draw any conclusions about a genetic existence of sensitivity....because that newborn has already experience 9 months in the womb...having experienced unique conditions such as stress of the mother, chaos in terms of the mothers behavior and circumstances; or conversely peacefulness of the mother's mental state and/or circumstances. Having been pregnant myself--I felt/believed on an intuitive level that my every experience and particularly my response and reaction to them directly affected the state and development of my unborn child. I'm just wondering if sensitivity is a ""thing"" that exists in us (irregardless of experience/circumstances)...or if it is a trait/condition that directly correlates to the level of challenges/difficulties they have experienced. Maybe it doesn't matter either way, but for me it is worth wondering about. Thank you, best regards",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Moreover, if our understanding of compassion is selective, then it's untrustworthy. It's just a self-serving idea we fancy.

I have done psychedelics before and have dealt with addiction as well. I don't want substances in their life and want to discuss these things based on their merits. Knowing the root of a lot of issues and being able to go down the path of discovering yourself without substances would have been a lot more beneficial for me. I totally understand the benefits of psychedelics and how closed off people are before taking them but at the same time focusing so much on them is not healthy as well.

And this is by design. N.E.T. neuro emotional technique using applied kinesiology does address and reaches that initial trauma and helps the body heal; recover,  cuts the cord.  Another observation is how we, the audience, feels about Dr Mate. We relate, we appreciate him. We love him. But if you were raised by him, married to him; what would be your perspective? I think of what people would say at his funeral. I also feel funerals are really for US, not them. They're gone. When you die, the body and the ego drops, so you're already a nicer 'person"" (lol). If you have negative feelings towards someone and think it's not appropriate to express out loud how you really feel; its BURYING YOU too so you might as well have two funerals. The OTHERS would think ill of you to say such things . . at a funeral. Judgment, and more SHAME.  Book, Power vs. Force has a scale of 1-1000 frequencies. Love:528, hope: 310, FEAR: 200, patriotism: 175, anger 150 and SHAME is 20. TWENTY! We lose ourselves with; what's acceptable, what 'appropriate"" in XYZ moments.  Book, Metaphysical Anatomy: your body is talking, are you listening? By Evette Rose. EVERYTHING relates back to emotional traumas. So back to his funeral.  . if one of his children or wife expressed THEIR FEELINGS; THEIR EXPERIENCES, would everyone else who didn't have those experiences, get ANGRY for those words? How dare they ruin his funeral. Define, ruin. Funerals puts up a mirror to our own life and (should be) a place to say YOUR peace or anger. Better up and OUT than stuck and BURIED inside you. So; I suppose we should or could be saying, thank you for doing THE WORK on yourself. Otherwise we wouldn't have heard of you . . unless you would have stayed in that angered-depressed soup and spiraled down to cause someone's else's death and then maybe read about it in the paper (news). So, thank you for doing the work AND sharing your life's lessons. According to Brene Brown, you have addressed and overcome SHAME and VULNERABILITY. One down; 7.7 billion to go.

@rebeccamiller3248,"I agree with Dr. Gabor mostly but his saying addiction is not a choice is bullshit. Cigarettes are historically known as addictive containing nicotine. Starting to smoke is a choice. Same with alcohol, heroine, meth, crack or any drug it's a choice to take it that first time. Today's society is inundated with labels, media information and propaganda on what these drugs do and yet people still choose to use. So taking the first hit is a choice. Only ones who are innocent are those born addicted because Mom was addicted or those forced to be addicted. By forced those who literally were tied down or those who became addicted due to prescribed drugs when given by a doctor. My addictions were valium and xanax. I am try to avoid opiates at all cost. Both were prescribed. I use Tramadol for pain now even then it has to be at its worst level. My other addiction that I cannot beat is to sodas and dill pickles. As in if I have them they are gone with in 48 to 72 hrs. We are talking 4 liters here of soda and a gallon jug of pickles. Its tame compared to the prescribed drug I am addicted to but the sodas are almost the drugs.",4년 전,0,

About Buddha [@19.05]: Dr Gabor said that Buddha didn't say that world creates* our mind with birth. Well Buddha indeed stated it. According to Buddhist teachings, *that's the part of karmic conditions that we bring from the previous lives. Karmic conditions, reincarnation are two of the fundamental elements of Buddha's teachings. Some of the unexplainable traumatic events that we bring into our life, can stem from these past karmic events, that sets the condition for birth, early life and even later life. It's the cycle.

@cribriformplate5409,"The exercise done two hours in was interesting, but what if your frustrations don't come from personal slight. What if I am simply angry about the fact that the job is not done? These emotions exist independent of any assumption about the person doing the job or their perception of me, I just want the job done and it's not materializing. I suppose that what I'm getting at is that anger and frustration don't always seem to have to have deep and profound connection to things that have occurred in the past. In other words the intention of the worker is not the irritant, just the result in general. It doesn't matter that there are 50 million alternate explanations for why the person may not have gotten the work done, just that the work is not done in general. Of course this changes if there is obvious lack of respect behind the reason why the work is not done, but my first emotional response is to the result, not the intent therein. Also I don't necessarily see this as a negative thing because this frustration will serve as a catalyst for finding a solution to the problem.",4년 전,0,

Empathy is the antidote to all of the pain and cruelty that humanity inflicts upon its own kind ( and also against all animals )😢 Unfortunately dear Radoslav, many people are born without the empathy gene… so it’s not always possible for some humans due to their genetics to feel empathy.   In a recent extensive study at Cambridge University scientists postulate that empathy is not just something we develop through our upbringing and life experiences - it is also partly inherited.

@bp6877,"worthwhile interview, but I have issues with Dr. Mate's philosophy:  1.  That people are basically good?  Now what, exactly, were the Nazis/Arrow Cross doing to Jews that would convince him of this, not to mention a world that stood by and did nothing (as it'd do again today)? 2.  Indictment of President Trump for his belief that his enemies were out to get him?  They were!  ""Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not to get you.""--Abba Eban.  This interview evoked Karl Marx for me:  ""The philosophers have interpreted the world; the point, however, is to change it.""  Why?  Because many people, it seems, are too focused on interpreting themselves, rather than changing themselves.  Take personal responsibility, for God's sake!  Also, Marx's indictment of religion as the ""opiate of the masses.""  It seems, in our secular society, which gives no credence to the wisdom of religious tradition, suggests that peoples' ""religion"" IS ""opiates;"" i.e., any quick fix substitute for the work of getting in touch.  Like grief, the only way around trauma is going through it, which requires hard work; it's painful, but it's the only way.  A religious lifestyle, with strong traditions of modeling correct behavior and thoughts, combined with the collective wisdom of thousands of years of lived experience, would go a long way towards improving a secular society devoid of an informed, wise spirituality.  By avoiding or discounting religion, secularists have effectively thrown out the baby with the bathwater, and then they wonder why so many are so lost.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

I have consumed a number of pyschodelics ... mushrooms ... lsd ... etc. It was all very absorbing and entertaining at the time ... it wasn't until much later in life that I wound up in therapy with the VA ... I agree with all you say in my way but I live basically by inclination with the poor ... or mentally impoverished ... not such as yourselves who are very much part of the bourgouis and empowered ... your sound to me like the socio-political talking heads on the media who are so far removed from the issues in the street  that their testimony is lost on we the people ... at one point in my life I was down too giving up even coffee I was so straight ... and it was not helpful ... the first releif (psychological) that I ever felt was with my VA therapists ... they encourage me to tell the tales and then they the ask if I feel this way or that about it ... and they are usuaally right on the money ... they know how I feel ... if you think someone who has all the advantages is still traumatized and dealing with it ...  can you imagine what it is like for people who live in the drug ridden streets ... I am traumatized but I can introduce you to someone who can wear my dog tags anytime as a symbol of her journey thru the american nightmare and the massive trauma she has suffered at the hands of her fellow man ... anyway I am hopeful but an entire range of healing modalities are still very illegal in america ... listening to all this discussion is like listening to doctors discuss treatment for themselves that are not available or even illegal for we the people ... what you entertain and then share publically with the larger world lands many people in the streets in jail or abusive (sexually) experiences ... I have since a very young child have entertained out of body experiences ... encountered aliens and ancestors and ascended beings ... and still do ... I have found it all to be a virtual mind  game ... humans entertain a psychology and experience that are as far beyond their ablity to intergrate as astronomy would be to a chimpanzee ... we are ill equipted to understand and integrate circumstances beyond our insight ... I feel for all the folks that have been tramatized by a paper cut giving advice to others who who are living life dismembered in body and mind ... all the metaphysical work works, but meanwhile your shaman, priest, pastor, guru or guide  wants to screw you ??? it is all very interesting ... sorry your mother wasn't perfect but ... maybe she was ... meanwhile we the people live in a culture of ignorance and abuse from the streets to jails to psyche centers to each other ...

@andreaandrea6716," @theinngu5560  NOT to diminish the point you just made re. the risks and dangers of Ayhuasca, because there are risks and dangers associated with ALL drugs (obviously, some more than others) ... and with Ayhuasca there CERTAINLY are. It is a very powerful experience that SHOULD be undertaken in the proper setting, with Guides who know what they are doing (and HOW to do it) and with The Highest Intentions. Guides that support each individual ... and this should be understood. It is not something you take prescriptively ('take two aspirin and call me in the morning'). It is a SACRED journey that should be conducted PROPERLY, with all the respect due a 'drug' this powerful.... and with the history of its indigenous origin. Western mind calls it a 'drug' because of its altering nature. But it is, in fact, a Sacred Plant Entity. I did not get (from listening to Maté's talk) that he was suggesting this as a 'quick fix'. THERE ARE NO QUICK FIXES when it comes to the psyche. It's just not the way the psyche works, despite Western Medicine trying to treat it that way (VERY lazy).

@annabambus6572,"I find the quote Gabor reads, from AH Almost incredible and wonderful.  I also find that it's exactly what God wishes for all of us. People complain that a loving God would not allow pain, nor injustice, yet they don't seem to get, and neither did I for a long time, that he did exactly that, and specifically for you, for he can count every hair on your head, and knows what you desire before you know it. But the choice on how to respond to every hardship is yours. If this was not so, God would be a damaged tyranical dictator. But instead, God loves you so much that he gives you chance after merciful chance to choose the way for your ultimate healing and inner truth. You're His child, and He created you in the womb, and continues to work on you as a potter does with a piece of clay.

His wife is to me, a remarkable woman.",4년 전,0,
@annabambus6572,"I deeply question whether it was the experience of taking a psychedelic plant that was what was truly what was transformative in opening to love, or whether feeling connected in a safe environment with people who cared deeply, wasn't in truth the real reason for this opening awareness. That it's not the psychedelic doing it, it's rather the safe environment, and feeling of connectedness that really was the reason. Jesus in only 3 years of his life, through firm, and deeply loving compassion, including miracle healings, did the same for so very, very many without psychedelics. When I talk about Christ, it's not the Christ, and biblical teachings, that many religions have twisted to benefit themselves. I also find it extremely interesting, and wonderful, that it was a complete stranger, who was Christian, that unquestioningly took Gabor in when his mother was so determined to save him. This christian woman kept Gabor safe, until he could be reunited with his mother. Of course his childhood trauma would continue to effect him for years, and years, and probably to some extent still does. God works in mysterious ways.",4년 전,0,

Plain good old common sense makes it obvious that people try to medicate their past and current hurts  away , not only with the use and consuming of substances, like drugs and alcohol but also with having  undisciplined  sex,  with going hard and at all costs  for the mighty buck , pun intended of course, and  by their  seeking of power and the pride of  having it all , and  preserving  it,  like conquerors and as ''winners'' in the game of life, AKA,  the proverbial ''rat's race'', as old timers would call it.  Although the above is true and  the trama of our childhood will make a definite mark  in our lives,  it also  doesn't have to be a defining and everlasting imprint  in our  psiquis ;  we can all grow beyond that and become stable adults indeed, but it takes hard  but freeing work in seeking nothing but The Truth, who is  higher than ourselves (and higher doesn't mean as the result of partaking of crushed and simmering in water Andean hierbas, nor LSD of course). The same developing and pruning of our brains that go on while we are kids, responsible for our heighten feelings and emotions at that '' Age of possibility'' , might also be the reason for why children  (even the more sensitive ones) are known to be less aware of the nocive and traumatic situations going on in their surroundings  and why they probably  assimilate and even tolerate physical  pain better than adults.

@DougWilderMusic,Thank you both for your courage to walk the hard road back...helping others and thereby yourselves. Holy men or people who dedicate their lives to charity/seemingly selfless dedication to others are actually very self interested however they are also wise. They have discovered as Ram Dass said that “helping others to help yourself is what the emerging game is all about!” The best feeling you can experience as a human is loving others and feeling the effect your love has on bettering their human experience. The true purpose of life. We are all just walking each other home.,4년 전(수정됨),3,
@elisabethdevyt2195,Thanks for the extraoerdinary information both  What I need to say is that I had 2 intense 'high level'  moments of high unconditional conciousness  This during the dying of my beloved aunt that raised me  I had a very very very lucid dream with the appearance of our Maria (I am not practicing religion; but the prayers of my mother felt me guilty and sad and I spent 15 years iun a very catholic school  So culture played a role  But the white radiant shining  light was NOT earthly Too real full of unconditional love I had a NDE at the age of 9 I think that this played a key role  So  When my aunt died on a distance without I knew The news of 8pm began  That man only spoke to me! And the contenence of the news was a detail of no importance  Then I saw the papers  I title of an article said it was for me non importance what it was about  I felt someone was with me  It was SO SO SO warm and loving and beautiful  My aunt came to tell me goodbye and see you later The gave her euthanasy without bmy knowing at 8pm  But never ever I needed medicine or good or bad drug at those moment  I only had the hallucinatiuon experience by eating rotten pistache nuts It was funny I went to bed and a whole orchestra started a beautiful piece and the sound and playing was perfect I play flute and heard it was very right and perfect that concert  Thanks if it can help you,4년 전,0,

The title gave me the false feeling of smartness until I started reading it. That instantly brought me back down to earth. She was onto something. Gabor described it perfectly, it was the same beginning of a very long journey through the dark knight of the soul.  When he Gabor summarizes his decades of research. I think back to all the times when I was a kid getting yelled at for something I did wrong I would just zone out and daydream projecting myself anyway over there. when I will get lectured you can’t hurt me I’m in my own little room in my head did you yell as much as you want as long as you want my ass is hurting. One time I was sending it so long I passed out Ha ha  It’s so good at the end when he is hitting a wall with him he is just very nice softly finessing the drilling a hole into the brick is easy Peezy for Dr. neighbor you know Tim looks like he’s going to cry for talking about it although he’s been licking his room the whole time. That’s not mean this or disrespect I think it’s a great learning tool for all of us that the intense emotions turn always be broken down from a thought to a quarter basic needs that was not meant usually one of her parents didn’t. Oh Tim I wanna give you a big hug both of you. We are all just hurt little kids inside. I knew the moment he sat down that you need to come there for a reason leave the news or not and I can tell right away when he was asking you directly questions for you to answer that he was going to help you get there.

@katerinalavrjuk791,"Hello, Tim, you asked at 1:10:50 about some recommended yoga for people dealing with trauma. Actually there is one - if you are interested, look for a David Emerson´s book called Trauma-sensitive yoga. Good job done there - described a lot about trauma mechanisms and how to understand and deal with them. One of the most important ideas presented in the book was following: nobody can heal your trauma. Because this is not how it works. (And this is, actually, why so many therapies brings nothing or almost nothing to change your life.)    Perfectly explained by Gabor - trauma is not what others did to you, trauma is how you deal with it - you disconnected yourself from your pain, your feelings and your body. Let me say it fully - your trauma is WHAT YOU DID TO YOU YOURSELF. And this is how it could only work. My disconnections couldn´t be repaired by anybody else, than myself.  Trauma-sensitive yoga goes so far, that all presented ""exercises"" are only ""recommendations"" and each of them start as an offer ""if you want - you can try..."" . Why? Your connection with your body needs to be restored and this approach (reminding you again and again ""if you want you can"") is bringing your competition back. Your competition to feel, to move, to change.  (Sorry if my translation is not that perfect, but I believe if we have the book already in Czech language, you´ll find it easy in English). Thanks a lot, both of you, for your taking time and sharing your ideas and opening new space for people dealing with trauma. Your determination to go deeper and discover the real truth is breathtaking and highly inspirational. Hats off, gentlemen!",4년 전(수정됨),1,

No vomiting, diarrheas', anxiety in the muscles etc. I was sleeping and eating from the first day. Normally i wouldn't have even got to day 2, but I KNEW God had done it for people who come to Him before, and I knew this time round He was going to make it easy on me. The Holy Spirit almost knocked me off my feet. Never before or since have i felt the Holy Spirit of God like I did in those days i was getting clean, going through the process of withdraw, what little there was, His love was overwhelming. I felt weak, that was about it. But God is AWESOME. We don't need anything but Him. Psychological issues, especially the new ones they're coming out with nowadays only want you to spend money.

@JaneCooper190072," @MT-sw8rf  Question,, why do you automatically assume that parents as addicts would be neglectful?  I've been a heroin addict my whole life. I don't hang around other users because I don't trust them. I'm nothing like the average user. One thing is,, I would NEVER neglect animal or child no matter WHAT. So that was just a huge assumption that Mikes parents were not emotionally available due to their addiction. Although the majority, or large amount DO neglect everything except their drugs, not everyone is like that. I have my priorities in order, and if I do it's not impossible for other addicts to also be able to function and have their priorities in order. Also you stated that he needed to change his environment, which also is not true. I thought moving to the other side of the globe would help me, and believe me it doesn't change a thing.

@patrickmccartney7544,"This is a great talk. I'm Learning a lot. My ears pricked up about yoga. I appreciate that Gabor is not an expert on yoga. It must be made clear that any sort of applied therapy  of ""yoga"" to healing and ""union"" in this wellness sense is only a very recent innovation. The first times ""yoga"" is used in the rgveda relates specifically to martial ""action"" toward protecting and acquiring property and prosperity. That is, going to battle to gain fame and wealth. The later upanishadic and tantric buddhist inspired ""yoga"" that evolved into hatha yoga was aimed at accumulating power. Even the mid 19th century origins of ""modern yoga"" in the Indian independence movement grew out of body building and wrestling and the project of building hypermasculine bodies. The point is that saying something like ""yoga means union and its original intention is healing"" is historically inaccurate. It's a romantic lens. Though Sadhuru is a grifter with many issues. Know one seems to know for certain if he killed his wife. His organisation is allegedly involved in illegal land grabs which have affected green corridors for migratory animals and the theft of cultural indigenous pharmacological knowledge by local forest dwelling adivasis.  He is a charismatic mouth piece for hindu nationalism, which is ethno-nationalist supremacism different to Indian nationalism. It is clear that this sort of guru is involved in grooming people to support by a distance, banal hindutva-lite sentiment.  But actually, when you analyze his discourse, it's mostly pseudoscientific gibberish. The thing about these gurus is that the pedagogy is disintellectual. One is not taught how to think but rather feel. Even though people are sitting and listening and the guru expounds perennial sorts of wisdom, it is not the cultivating of critical enquiry skills that is the aim. It is the cultivation of affect. It is codependent. People, adults, become child-like in front of these sorts of spiritual masters.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@MP-cm2nt,"Curious - with all the hype there currently is around “narcissistic style and or NPD” & narcissism in general ... while I was listening to Gabor discussing his own behavior, “obsessive workaholic” and intermittent “rages” at home ... would he or has he ever considered himself a “narcissist” at any point in his personal life history?  Why or why not?  I’m not saying he has ever looked at anything from this perspective ... I’m just curious about what he would say given the cultural popularity of throwing around the “narc” terminology, especially given many “addicts” are considered narcissists when under the influence ... Gabor willingly admits to his ADHD ... I get ADHD (understand), I have ADHD (diagnosed), but it took a tremendous amount of self work and reflection on my part to figure out where my “protective parts” ended, my narcissistic tendencies ended ... and my reaction to my abusive partner’s withdraw and invalidation ... began ... I know my heart and I know my whole-self is “recovering” ... my ADHD, my sensitivity, and beautifully, my creativity, has persisted, so I feel confident that I’m not a “narc” ... but I wonder if Gabor has ever put his thoughts into the ring of this popular topic??  Anyone know?",4년 전,1,

I've been living with the outcomes of severe trauma with onset right after I was born for all of my life (I've turned 56 recently, trauma symptoms have rendered my disabled and incapacitated/unable to work).

That said, they'd hardly ever meet me at eye's level, but always in a sort of condescending way even power trippin' many times.

@miriaml.150,"So to challenge the idea that getting upset that somebody didn't follow through with something they said they were going to follow through with, necessarily means that we don't respect ourselves really leaves out the possibility that it's okay to get upset when someone doesn't do what they say they're going to do!  Everything is not a lesson of self-reflection. I'm saying that as a psychotherapist. Sometimes things are exactly what they seem and sometimes they aren't.   I suppose if a person reacted by thinking that that person who failed to follow through is irresponsible and they won't use them again, that's different than feeling disrespected. BUT, it can indicate a lack of respect not to do a job you are hired to do. In most workplaces, if you don't do the job you're hired to do, you'll eventually lose your job. No psychotherapy necessary.   I think there's a lesson to be learned. But it's not the lesson that continually gets shoved down most people's throats these days. Everybody is not a mirror to us. There may be a lesson in everything. But that lesson doesn't necessarily mean that everybody reflects us.  Maybe the lesson is that we have the right to expect others to be responsible and if they aren't then they deserve the consequences. We don't need to psychoanalyze ourselves when people don't keep their word. If they don't keep their word, that reflects on them, not us 99.9% of the time.",4년 전,0,

@jennyjones1429," 6GDC  maybe you’re missing something, yes…Not sure I’m the one to explain it, but I’ll give it a shot. One of the brain’s main jobs/functions is to protect us, to ensure our survival. But, our brains can’t tell the difference between real and imagined danger. So if an early experience with a hearing a tiger, in your example, led to a child being taken and thus conditions a response to panic, grab your children and run every time you hear a tiger in the future, then yes that is pure survival. Considered smart, most would say. However,  20 years later you’re in a mall and hear a tiger (let’s say it’s on a TV in an electronics store) and your brain has conditioned you to panic and run and you react as such, you’d probably be viewed as insane because there is no real threat. If you’re paying attention, you probably would panic initially due to your past experience, but you’d have to remind yourself that you are in a different environment so that you don’t overreact. With the kind of trauma they’re talking about here, I think most of us aren’t really aware of the initial trauma. Maybe a vague recollection or awareness. I don’t have many memories of my childhood, but I know there was trauma. My mother left me as a child, as a result I have an irrational fear that everyone will leave me at some point and until I became aware of this I would often behave in ways that I would not call my most shining moments. And, even with awareness it’s taking practice to control my initial protective and irrational reaction. One of the results of that trauma is constant chatter about how unworthy I am going on in my subconscious. For me casual drinking turned into an addiction because I found that alcohol numbed and quieted those thoughts (albeit temporarily). Now that I’m seeing all of this, the awareness has allowed me to address the root cause instead of just trying to survive by blocking out the thoughts. There’s a lot more to it, of course but your question got me thinking 😉😊",4년 전,4,

@nextlevelintactivism8195,"Doctors Opposing Mutilation FB Page https://www.facebook.com/DoctorsOpposingCircumcision/  Recently a mother-to-be wrote DOC asking whether circumcision pain could be quantified. Our answer follows:  Dear Mrs. McGuire,  You wrote DOC to say that your husband wants to know the exact percent of pain an infant feels during circumcision. Please share the following with him.  There is abundant literature to show that circumcision is painful, that the pain cannot be fully controlled with even the best local anesthetics. The post-operative pain –days, a week?--is fully unavoidable. Most circumcisers use nothing for pain. Those who bother apply EMLA, a topical anesthetic, mostly to placate squeamish parents. EMLA is rarely allowed its required ‘soak-time,’ and the effect does not cross over folded layers of skin. EMLA is contra-indicated by the manufacturer for use on mucosal tissue and contraindicated for infants due to the risk of methemoglobanemia, a blood disorder.  Moreover -and this point is important- pain for a newborn comes at a time when his neurological system is ‘wide-open,’ every stimulus keenly and deeply felt. He also has no rational understanding of what is happening to him. It must seem a complete betrayal after nine months of your warmth and comfort.  It is impossible to quantify the resulting pain in raw percentages as your husband asks, due to the subjective nature of pain. All humans are hard-wired differently as to pain tolerance, even at birth.  Even more troubling is the fact, we now know, that pain in infancy has long-term consequences. There is the Taddio study that showed six-month-old circumcised boys are easily identifiable by their dramatic response when immunized. The researchers called the boys’ reactions ‘an infant analogue of PTSD.’  Pain studies done in England have shown that preemies who suffered daily painful 'heel-sticks, blood draws, scalp IV's, etc., have problems with opiate uptake in adulthood. Thus the more cautious and humane neonatal intensive care units (NICU) try to keep all procedures in the NICU carefully vetted for pain inflicted weighed against the diagnostic information derived.  And circumcision, as you surely know, is unnecessary and non-therapeutic.  But I sense another issue here. You husband is likely cut himself or he would not ask questions about pain or hesitate about avoiding circumcision after a close reading of our website, the work of many kindly physicians and nurses.  He may have what we call 'adamant father' syndrome. This manifests itself as a spoken concern for the child that is more likely an unconscious concern for the father’s own comfort with an intact son around the house, reminding the father of his loss. It is entirely understandable to want to ‘match ones son.’ There is even a hint of the masculine notion that ‘my boy will be tough; he’ll be able to take it.’  I have to say we believe it is the bravest and kindest of fathers who say, “They did it to me without my permission, but they are not going to do that to my son.”  We regularly counsel parents where the father agrees to keep the son intact, and then begins to restore his foreskin ‘non-surgically’ so that he and his son will eventually ‘match.’ It is a charming and creative idea we encourage for those adamant fathers who need ‘comfort’ with the issue.  And finally there is an issue that far exceeds concerns for pain (though those concerns are completely reasonable and compelling on their own.) The Sorrels study (California 2006) and the recent Bossio study in Canada, demonstrate without doubt that circumcision ablates (removes) the most sensitive part of the penis. This has sexual consequences for the man’s entire life. It might not be felt when one is 25 or 30, but the day will come, that mortgage will come due.  We know that young men function despite circumcision, but they might want back the erogenous tissue they lost in infancy as they age. (And sorry for the personal detail, but ask me how I know —I am 72 and my nurse wife would dearly like my erogenous tissue back.)  There are other reasons to avoid circumcision:  1) Your son will be born into an English-language world where the practice is in steep and steady decline. Why force him into a minority he can’t escape --and might resent?  2) Why not give him the gift of the body he was born with?  3) Why compromise breastfeeding, or maternal bonding, by injuring him on day two of his life?  4) Why risk a botch —too much tissue removed, a lifetime of painful erections, or painful urination due to ‘meatal stenois,’ a urinary opening that is too tight, or worse? These are very common side-effects.  5) Why fuss with wound-care when you can safely ignore his penis for his entire childhood? (A penis requires no special cleaning or care; sterile urine washes it out several times/day; normal secretions fight incoming bacteria.)  6) Why not let him choose for himself? You (and he) have lost nothing if you wait until you can hear his preference.  And he just might (as the intact men I hear from regularly do) THANK YOU from the bottom of his heart for the fact that you gave him the gift of a fully functioning male body when he becomes sexually active in adulthood.  We at DOC (I’m having breakfast with the president and Board Members today) wish you the best with your son and hope this letter helps you. We are going to the premiere today of the award-winning documentary “American Circumcision,” that we helped bring to life.

@nextlevelintactivism8195,"""The worst circumcision scar is the one left in the brain of its victims.""  Psychological impacts of male circumcision http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/  Psychology effects of Infant Genital MUTILATION I   Psychology Today:  1. Circumcision Causes Immediate Harm  Circumcision is often performed on infants without anesthetic or with a local anesthetic that is ineffective at substantially reducing pain (Lander et al., 1997).  In a study by Lander and colleagues (1997), a control group of infants who received no anesthesia was used as a baseline to measure the effectiveness of different types of anesthesia during circumcision.  The control group babies were in so much pain—some began choking and one even had a seizure—they decided it was unethical to continue.  It is important to also consider the effects of post-operative pain in circumcised infants (regardless of whether anesthesia is used), which is described as “severe” and “persistent” (Howard et al., 1994).  In addition to pain, there are other negative physical outcomes including possible infection and death (Van Howe, 1997, 2004).  2. Pain from Circumcision in Infancy Alters the Brain  Research has demonstrated the hormone cortisol, which is associated with stress and pain, spikes during circumcision (Talbert et al., 1976; Gunnar et al., 1981).  Although some believe that babies “won’t remember” the pain, we now know that the body “remembers” as evidenced by studies which demonstrate that circumcised infants are more sensitive to pain later in life (Taddio et al., 1997).  Research carried out using neonatal animals as a proxy to study the effects of pain on infants’ psychological development have found distinct behavioral patterns characterized by increased anxiety, altered pain sensitivity, hyperactivity, and attention problems (Anand & Scalzo, 2000).  In another similar study, it was found that painful procedures in the neonatal period were associated with site-specific changes in the brain that have been found to be associated with mood disorders (Victoria et al., 2013).  https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/moral-landscapes/201501/circumcision-s-psychological-damage   Roi HuPer The trauma issues, pain of an infant, the way this effects attachment bonding, latching behaviors, creates dissociate experiences and post traumatic stress, elevates cortisol, causes brain damage from severed nerves and hugely damages a man's capacity for full orgasmic pleasure are not to be overlooked. The rest of the fallout such as sexual dysfunctions will also need to be addressed because big pharma will lose millions from a lack of boner pills not being sold!  Karen Kelly Glennon When you wound a man in the very place of his deepest union with another, you forever alter his connection with himself, with others and with the world in which he lives - a disruption most men never articulate and understand.  It's tragic.  Psychologists Talk About Damage of MGM Psychiatrist Richard Schwartzman discusses his personal experiences with, and feelings about circumcision; his observations about the importance of early childhood nurturing, and protection from trauma. https://youtu.be/117vEwBtEY4 Professor Gregory Boyle speaks frankly in condemning forced genital cutting of children, revealing his personal struggles with this issue and his observations about the psychological motivations behind childhood genital mutilation. https://youtu.be/FNgerSYsHEw  Looks like I was mistaken, it was Oxford University. ""Scans also showed that babies’ brains had the same response to a weak 'poke' (of force 128mN) as adults did to a stimulus four times as strong (512mN). The findings suggest that not only do babies experience pain much like adults but that they also have a much lower pain threshold.""  http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2015-04-21-babies-feel-pain-adults  Kennedy and Hansi, ""Trauma in Childhood: Signs and Sewuelae as Seen in the Analysis of an Adolescent,"" Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, (1986), Vol. 4 P. 220.   Peter's analysis lasted for six years and started at the age of 13. Early traumatic and disturbing events played a striking part in his pathology and were vividly reexperienced in treatment. This short paper describes some of these reenactments and gives reasons why the experiences from which they derived might properly be described as ""traumatic.""   There can be little doubt that the somatic and psychological experiences occasioned by the phimosis and circumcision were experienced by Peter as abuse and victimization. http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/kennedy/   Effect of neonatal circumcision on pain responses during vaccination in boys Using data from one of our randomised trials, we investigated post-hoc whether male neonatal circumcision is associated with a greater pain response to routine vaccination at 4 or 6 months.  Circumcised infants had higher behavioural pain scores (8 vs 6, p=0·01) and cried longer (53 vs 19 s, p=0·02). Thus neonatal circumcision may affect pain response several months after the event. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673695902783   TORONTO - A study led by Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) researchers has demonstrated that not only do male infants feel pain during circumcision, they remember that pain six months later when they receive their routine vaccination.   http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Newsroom/Past-News/1997/Study-shows-that-infants-feel-and-remember-circumcision-pain.html   Effects of Trauma on infants   Dysregulation of the Right Brain: A Fundamental Mechanism of Traumatic Attachment and the Psychopathogenesis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder http://www.trauma-pages.com/a/schore-2002.php   Breast Feeding Disrupted  There is scientific evidence that the trauma of circumcision makes it harder for a baby to learn how to suckle. http://www.circumstitions.com/Nursing.html   Newborns experience 'too much pain' during procedures, pediatrics AAP In an updated policy statement released Monday, the AAP said pain from these procedures can be significant, especially in premature infants. “Research suggests that repeated exposure to pain early in life can create changes in brain development and the body's stress response systems that can last into childhood,” the academy said in a press release. http://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/health/newborns-experience-too-much-pain-during-procedures-pediatrics-group-says-1.2750960   AAP on MGM:  This is the same AAP that also says, ""Evaluation of current evidence indicates that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks and that the procedure’s benefits justify access to this procedure for families who choose it.""

I see no point in amputation of a healthy functional body part in a child who cannot give their consent for the procedure.

""Circumcision is a cruel PERMANENTLY damaging barbaric  maiming, mutilation & disfigurement of your most intimate pleasurable personal private organ. This is a complete ASSAULT on the self & THE SOUL."" ~ M. Hakim, MD clinical physician & psychologist   Bad Medicine: Men matter too Des Spence British Journal of General Practice 2019; 69 (687): 509. DOI: https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp19X705857  Female genital mutilation (FGM) is wrong and we have rightly legislated against this as an obvious contravention of a child’s human rights. However, very large numbers of male children still undergo a form of genital mutilation: it’s called circumcision. Virtually all circumcisions are for religious and cultural reasons, and are not medically indicated.1 I have avoided certain topics such as this over the years, too afraid of the anger lying in my email inbox. But even upsetting truths need to be said. We legally allow the continued mutilation of baby boys. The GMC condones registered doctors to carry out this act without any threat to the doctor’s registration. The GMC hides behind parliament, suggesting it is not for them to make a judgement about the legality of male circumcision. While parliament is banning smacking of children, frets about intimate partner abuse, and seeks to ever more intrude in micromanaging all family life, it allows this practice to continue without question. Why are none of the institutions willing to consider framing circumcision as male genital mutilation? This debate is kicked into the long grass, waiting a legal case or some expert panel of ethicists and worthy theologians to rule on it. No one wants to make a decision or even a comment. So it just keeps happening. So let’s deconstruct the argument. Many academics and scholars defend circumcision, asserting that it offers health benefits. But let’s be absolutely direct: there is no benefit to non-medical circumcision. There are potential harms both physically and emotionally. Importantly and fundamentally, the child gives no consent to this permanent disfigurement. Reflect on the fact that it is registered doctors carrying out this procedure. There are certainly cultural or religious sensitivities, but there are also numerous precedents where religious and cultural practices such as forced marriage and polygamy have been banned (indeed there is a very long list should you wish to google the topic). This is another case of society being blind to evident reverse sexism and boys being valued less than girls. It is time we rethink circumcision. Time for faith groups to review their doctrines and question whether this act has any role in a modern interpretation of any religion. We need people from within communities and religious groups to speak out against circumcision. But it is most definitely time too for the profession and, in particular, the GMC to take a stance, show some leadership, and question the unquestionable. The medical profession has the power to force the debate. It is time to stop non-medical circumcision because it is bad medicine and an obvious infringement of a child’s human right to decide. Society must open its eyes and see that men matter too. © British Journal of General Practice 2019   The Nurses of St Vincent who refused to participate in child sexual torture and abuse.

@nextlevelintactivism8195,"Nurse’s View on Circumcision https://peacefulbeginningsrosemary.wordpress.com/circ-information/nurses-view/ Dear Mothering, The responses about circumcision really struck me. When my first was born I still wasn’t sure about it and luckily we had a girl. Since then I’ve become very sure of which way to go. Definitely no circumcision for my kids! I’m an R.N. who has worked for one and a half years in a newborn nursery in a hospital. I hate a lot of the practices that occur in hospital nurseries (even that there need be a nursery is contrary to my feelings) but I’ve found my place helping newborns and parents in a generally unfeeling place. I can give a newborn silver nitrate drops in his eyes and the routine vitamin K injection, even though I feel it unnecessary.  In fact, since that baby is going to have these things done anyway, I’d rather it be me to do it. I can do it gently and as untraumatically as possible. Often with my gentle touch, soothing voice and explanations, the baby won’t even cry. But circumcision is a different story. When I have to set up a baby for a circumcision, I feel like crying and often do. I feel like I’m betraying that being behind those eyes, as I calmly and easily strap him on the “circ board.” I talk to him about what will be happening and apologize. A baby will cooperate even with being restrained, but there’s no excuse for the torture that happens after that! After witnessing many circumcisions, I can say, yes, it hurts. It’s pure and simple torture. As often as I can I leave the room for the slaughter. I just can’t bear to watch another. Sure, some babies cry more than others, but they all cry. But more than the cry, it’s the look in those trusting eyes as it all begins (before they are squeezed closed in terror.) I’ve talked to parents many times about their babies’ circumcisions before it’s been done. I see fathers just sort of shrug like it’s one of those things boys have to go through. And mothers wince at the thought and hope not to hear his screams but still sign the papers of permission. Parents ask “Does it hurt him?” and I tell them, “Yes, who else would they do surgery on without anesthetic? But they always have a “good” reason to go ahead. … “He would be teased.” “He wouldn’t match his dad (or brothers.)” “It’s too much work if he’s not circumcised.” “It’s not healthy.” “We’ve always done it in our family.” “I’d hate for him to have problems later.” “It’s so much worse if it would have to be done later.” * Maybe some facts about the care of uncircumcised penises would be helpful. Let’s hear response from the parents of boys and from men who are not circumcised. The only advice I have is from Dr. Spock’s Baby and Child Care.He very conservatively says., “The third method of care is to leave the foreskin alone. This is the simplest way and the one used throughout a great part of the world.” Thanks for listening, Terry Schultz, Somerset, Kentucky     Reprinted with permission from Mothering, Vol. XII, p. 83, Summer 1979.

Do NOT help a doctor harm a child.  https://youtu.be/IShBq5kzGqo   This plethora of nonsense does deserve a reply. In thirty years of medical practice in Australia I have not seen a single medically-necessary circumcision. Not one. Globally, the rate in <1:10,000 EXCEPT in the U.S. where for bizarre reasons of their own doctors attribute all sorts of things to being uncircumcised. Not much more sophisticated than removal of the uterus because it was thought to cause “hysteria”. Regardless of the above, routine neonatal circumcision results in a plethora of human rights abuses. It is surgery without consent. Dr Peter Farnback   Bill Guthrie  I watched one in real life when I was in nursing school.  I was appalled. The most disturbing thing I had ever witnessed.  I actually knew the physician who was teaching an intern and  walking her through it as she did it. He was a physician I had known from a church I had attended and he was my sisters dr.  But I didn't know him personally.  Any way.  I was thinking... how could he be a sensitive caring Christian and not see the insanity of what was happening right before our eyes. Horrible.   Dr. John Fitton: All Genital Mutilation is a Violation Dr. John Fitton of the East Midlands Regional Council of the British Medical Association spoke up recently against the BMA's motion 324 (pertaining to female genital cutting) because it fails to protect all children regardless of sex (male, female and intersex). Dr. Fitton begins in this video at minute 13:10: http://vimeo.com/99675872 He states: This motion discriminates. It is downright sexist. [...] The billions of normal, uncut world populations would think it is absurd that we are even debating this in our tiny, tolerant time, let alone qualifying the phrase 'genital mutilation' with the word 'female.' FGM, MGM - all GM - is a violation.   I was over 50 before I saw my first case of screaming infant after mutilation at one of the cutting clinics that had sprung up in our shire counties. [...] It is disgraceful that the general medical council turns a blind eye to this trade. And what a profitable bloody trade it is too! And I use the word 'bloody' to remind us of the occasional child who bleeds to death.   This cutting trade has no place in our profession and any doctor who is profiting from it should be ashamed. And be warned, if molestation can be prosecuted after 40 years, so might mutilation. The male (left) and female (right) clitoris/penis and prepuce are analogous and homologous organs. During the first trimester, they are also visually the same. Both are natural, normal, purposeful body organs that equally contribute to the health, functioning, and well-being of their owner. ~~~~     Podcast 064: The Facts & Myths about Circumcision | Dr. Adrienne Carmack, Urologist http://capwellnesscenter.com/podcast-064-facts-myths-circumcision-dr-adrienne-carmack-urologist/",4년 전,0,

Let's see 'doctor', if you gouge out one eye will it affect your eyesight?  Oh, it does?  Do you have a 'study' to prove that?  Or would common sense tell you that?  If I stick a pencil in one ear will it affect hearing?  Yes? Again, 'doctor' do you have a study to prove that?  Or would common sense tell you that?  We gouged out an eye and he could still read the letters on the opposite wall with the other eye. No loss of sight here.   Headline: 'Gouging out an eye has no effect on eyesight study proves.'   We played the piano and he still heard even with a pencil sticking out of one ear.  See that tympanic membrane of one ear is just vestigial tissue left over from when mammals needed to triangulate sound back when humans hunted.  We have fast food which has made two ears unnecessary.  That's really how dumb you sound to normal, educated people.   You saying it doesn't affect men when I know men that can reach down and stroke that skin and say, 'Ahhhhhh now THAT feels good, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY GOOD!"" After I have described the anatomy and explained a quick self test any intact man can do, this is EXACTLY how it is according to quite a few European and South American men I have talked to.  In particular the ridged band, the frenulum, and the frenular delta.  Not surprising how they follow the studies of Taylor and Sorrells.  But that's just conjecture, RIGHT?  No need for actual brain cells firing that would completely support such a notion.  You want US to believe that removing 1/3 to 1/2 of the SURFACE area of a SENSE organ which uses skin surface area to interface nerves with the partner directly during intercourse has NO EFFECT ON SENSATION???? WOW!!!!! JUST WOW!!!!!!  Not only that, you want me to believe some completely ridiculous subjective survey some quack pseudoscience moron supposedly did that proved no difference in 50% surface area which happens to include 75% of the nerves vs 50% of the surface area which happens to have 25% of the nerves?  Let's play in la la land with you for a moment.   Some subjective surveys done by quack doctors with a huge profit motive as well as personal ego involved showed mutilated men are just as satisfied as intact whole men.   You want MEN to admit their dick is reduced when they never experienced the actual sensations all without medical knowledge and imbued with cultural ignorance?  If they were MUTILATED as adults, YOU want US to take the word of some socially beaten-up, ostracized, insecure shamed man who probably has never been laid and blames his Saturday night wanking and a lifetime of public shaming on his extra flap of NORMAL MALE GENITALS?  Maybe he was just born into an ignorant child abusing child torturing child mutilating culture full of quacks with no knowledge of the basic anatomy and function of the male genitals and how they function in nature with the female genitals who tell him it’s better and healthier.   Have you heard of sociology? Cultural anthropology?  WE are not that stupid doctor.  Neither is the world that is waking up to the pedos in the mist.   Meissner Corpuscles don't contribute to sexual sensation?  Curious, what make lips so fun to kiss with?   Maybe it has something to do with Meissner Corpuscles?  Naw, can't be that.  Sure taste buds and rods and cones don't sense light and the tympanic membrane has NOTHING to do with hearing.   You really believe that?   All senses are decoded in the brain.  Those nerves are no longer contributing to the brain.  It's a penis reduction surgery no matter how you 'slice' it MORON!  My god, you can't be THAT DUMB!  Another basic FACT of biology: natural selection doesn't select for an inherent disease-causing tissue.  I have NEVER heard of a cat needing a mutilated penis.  I have NEVER heard of a dog needing a mutilated penis.   Yet 5,500 mammal species survive in the wild with all their penis.  Isn't that unclean and a source of disease and infection?  Can you tell me how many of those species know how to shower?  What about women?  Are they not MORE likely to get infections? Do they NOT have a LARGER crevasse ripe for disease and bacteria?  cough cough microbiome.  You might want to google that word 'doctor'.   Genghis Khan, Alexandar the Great, Hitler and too numerous people to count conquered large parts of the world all without their dangerous disease-ridden foreskin reaching up in the night and strangling them.  In fact, all of human history, men lived just fine with all their genitals.  Who needs circumcision? Homo Sapien Sapiens?  Or your neck?  One needs it for sure, just hoping this elementary exercise in common sense will illuminate which circumcision the world needs.  Who knows, maybe nature made another mistake.  Natural selection violating the laws of ecology again.   UTIs, HPV, Penial Cancer, AIDS all debunked, trivial at best, pseudoscience NONSENSE!!!!!  AND YOU KNOW THIS!!!!  AND WE KNOW YOU KNOW THIS!!!!!   One only has to use common sense.  It's called SUBTRACTION!  If you SUBTRACT dense nerves, as demonstrated under the microscope of Taylor and the filaments of Sorrells and lying ass Bossio, you REDUCE SENSITIVITY!!!!! Do you need a calculator 'doctor'?   BTW if you don’t even know the names of those researchers you are extremely negligent in your duty and you need to cease and desist from TORTURING AND MUTILATING CHILDREN!!!  Okay, can't be that.  You can't actually believe that garbage a five-year-old can reason through. Cut penises don’t work any better then chopped up ear lobes or tongues. Nature didn’t make a mistake YOU DID!!!  Number two reason someone could possibly conceive of chopping up infants - culturally brainwashed people.  Oh, but aren't you taught to be non-biased and objective? Logic and science 101?  Again there would have to be a little to a lot of trisomy 21 in your profession just to fall for this complete fuckery.  Third and final option of what could make someone an open to see self marketing child sexual abuser is CIRCUMFETISH PEDOPHILES of the like of Brian Morris and Vernon Queintenence.   It's simple.  Circumfetish pedophiles gets off on the power, mutilation, torture, and pain of mutilating the sex organs of helpless infants.  So which is it doctor?  Are you a complete idiot who somehow made it to and through Medical school?  Maybe you were the star quarterback?   Who knows but the blatant emperor has no clothes nature of the FAILURE of your profession is TRANSPARENT DOCTOR!!!!  Is it because everyone else is doing it?   Are you sooooooo completely culturally brainwashed that you hideously and disgustingly violate the basic tenets of your profession to do no harm while you strap down and torture and slice at helpless infant’s most private parts while they scream in excruciating pain?   Does the screams of the babies weigh on your mind as you alter and damage both their psychology and sexuality?  Do you have a soul?  You despicable sicko coward.   Maybe the truth is pure stupidity combined with simple easily brainwashed minds is the cause of the majority of medical students who love helping children to become money hungry psycho idiot cowards who must hide behind the thin veiled ignorance of our society of the basic anatomy and function of the human male and female genitals and how they interact. It’s BASIC 101 level knowledge doctor.  Psychologists will study you in the future. You will be viewed correctly by the future of humanity. How coupled this be possible?  Fifty years of disgusting cowardice and child abuse by thousands of fake healers turned sexual predators chopping up normal healthy kids genitals.   Just THINK about that. You are worse then a Catholic priest using parents beliefs to prey on helpless children. I promise you you piece of shit I would have rather been played with massaged and even penetratingly raped. You see, I’d still have fully functioning genitals. One KNIFE rape by you damaged me for life and I will never in my entire LIFE know what my birthright MY SEXUALITY would have been like without your astronomically stupid coward knife.   Why do I have to pay for YOUR IGNORANCE FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE???? The future will judge you severely coward.  The world is going to have knowledge of the male genitals. That will happen no matter what you do. That means everyday people will know what you and your profession has done to the America’s Children.   We will look back on you as the sickos you are.  We will KNOW and the world WILL KNOW!!!  Your legacy will be the world hating you with as much vitriol as I HATE YOU and as many AWARE MEN AND WOMEN HATE YOU!!!    WE GROW UP 'DOCTOR'!  And quite a few of us have two firing synapses.  And quite a few of us are learning what you yourself should have long ago. Basic human anatomy structure and function.  I'm just saying.  That’s the beauty of variety in the human genome and the epigenetic influence you caused.   You are no less sick and evil as Mengele.   Man will come for justice, doctor.  You and yours are being exposed.",4년 전,1,
@nextlevelintactivism8195,"""CIRCUMCISION IS A TRAUMA.""  COUNCIL OF EUROPE CIRCUMCISION DEBATE -  Psychologist Ronald Goldman, PhD, testifies at the historic Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) hearing in January 2014, an unprecedented debate on child circumcision:  ""As a Jew and a psychologist, I understand the stress that religious communities feel in connection with questioning of circumcision... I raise these questions out of deep caring and compassion, for our community generally, and our male infants in particular. We are inflicting, generally, unrecognized harm with circumcision, and the perpetuation of this harm is far greater a concern than the discomfort that comes from confronting the advisability of this practice. Many Jews who do not circumcise in North America, South America, Europe, and Israel support this view.""  ~Ronald Goldman , PhD, author, ""Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma - How an American Cultural Practice Affects Infants”  http://www.circumcision.org/cht.htm   https://www.facebook.com/172212266252130/posts/1122572807882733/",4년 전,2,

Our parents loved us and one another, but they had some serious problems that took them decades to work out.  And I was seriously, horribly, dangerously ill for two years in early childhood.  I know that’s why some of my coping mechanisms have not been very healthy; they work in the short term, but they have bad consequences.  It’s nice to hear someone lay all this out in such a cogent discussion.

@jakestewart5899,"I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.   1. What do you think happens to someone after they die? 2. Do you think there is an afterlife?  3. If heaven exists, how do you get there?  4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?   Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person:    1. How many lies have you told in your whole life?  2. Have you ever stolen?  3. Have you ever used God's name in vain? 4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust?  5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day?  6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?   The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell?    2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us.    What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus.    When are you going to do that?

The most painful thing is that I was pregnant with our second baby. I wanted him back. I did everything within my reach to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so badly because of the love I had for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back , I had no choice than to try it. I messaged the spell caster called dr unity, and he assured me there was no problem and that everything will be okay before 11 hours. He cast the spell and surprisingly 11 hours later my husband called me. I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that had happened He wanted me to return to him. He also said he loved me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again.thanks to dr unity . if you are here and your Lover is turning you down, or your husband moved to another woman, do not cry anymore, contact Dr.Unity for help now..

It was until I came across some reviews and testimonies on ""google"" about ( Molemen Herbs Cure"" ) in December 2018 and I ordered their successful and wonderful holistic healing medicine I was a bit skeptical, but slowly the results proved that I was wrong. I had been reluctant; it`s difficult to imagine that ""Molemen Herbs"" can cure something such as Herpes Virus; this is a fast and useful remedy.

Nevertheless, I still find it inspirational and helpful in many ways. Traumatic experiences can ruin our life and change our path. If we find a cure on time, everything can change. Unfortunately, there are so many physicians that are not competent to work in their branches, despite their titles. They give the wrong therapy and fool you and your family. I'm saying from personal experience. Also, the lack of empathy is a huge problem nowadays as well as lack of patience.

@EricWenders,"He says at one point you can be traumatised just by your parents being stressed, the way it feels to be held by a stressed person. He also talks about the idea that being dissociated comes from not being able to react honestly to your parents being difficult. So I thought about how tense I've always felt and how that absolutely feels related to the way I was held by my very stressed mother. And then I had the tantrum about that I couldn't have as an infant – kicked out, beat my fists, shook my head – and then I had a very satisfying and relieving cry and now feel a lot more present and a lot less tense. There is still more crying to come. I also found his idea of saying goodbye to the ""stupid friends"" very helpful with this. The tension is one, but also vanity and perfectionism and probably some others.   Anyway, in sum, I'm very glad of this interview. Thanks.",5년 전,0,

It seems the world creates our mind in childhood if we don't understand our infinite nature.

To stop you have to eliminate the oven out of the house.Attention: radiation goes through  walls, it can come from your neighbours. The plug out of electricity net because the oven has also radiation when it is not in use.And out of the house because the oven has a high voltage capacitor. The distance between an oven and a person is very important.After a 3 months without microwaves health becomes better. The victims are more sensible and also the distance between victim and oven is important.After long time obesity is possible. (Also possible: nightmares, change of character)Most people with a microwave arent chronically ill because some people are more sensitive for microwaves, also the distance person/microwave is very important. The oven in another place is more safe. The radiation become less when the oven gets older.Some ovens give less radiation then others. In Russia the less radiation is allowed by law.

I have a family member who has suffered with addiction, and it has always been my question... why don't they ever try to treat what's wrong with someone that they became an addict?  It's clear that there is something underneath, something broken, something that causes pain.  For my niece, it has NEVER been addressed... ever.  And she has struggled with addiction for almost 20 years.  I firmly believe that every addiction is caused by some underlying problem with how the brain functions, and we still refuse to look at this.  Like he says, it isn't even taught in med school -- right now.  It amazes me that so many here are concerned about microphones, stand/no stand, placement etc.  Will we ever learn to avoid spouting negativity about anything and everything????

@Sabnock1990,"Show Notes  Gabor shares his family history and how it motivated him to understand people as a medical doctor. [09:58] On influential books and gaining, rather than losing, something in translation. [14:06] The link between sensitivity, pain, and creativity. [21:33] How does Gabor start helping someone who’s outwardly successful but inwardly tortured? [24:31] When did Gabor’s interest in medicine begin? [29:58] How did Gabor end up working in palliative care? [33:49] How did Gabor start focusing on his work with addiction? [36:29] What nontraditional methods did Gabor use that raised eyebrows and got him fired, which opened opportunities he couldn’t have foreseen? [37:10] How does Gabor define addiction, and how is it at odds with other definitions? [39:16] What prompted my high school drug addiction? [41:32] How a coping mechanism becomes the root of addiction. [47:39] Looking at the causes of addiction instead of the consequences. [52:10] To what extent do genetics play a role in addiction? [1:01:56] What do the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) studies tell us about the nature of addiction? [1:04:50] How I’ve used loving kindness meditation to shed certain behaviors. [1:07:17] Once Gabor identifies why an addiction exists, what’s the next step? [1:11:37] Recommendations for someone looking to reconnect with themselves. [1:14:34] After a lifetime of believing himself unaffected by the benefits of yoga, what kind of yoga has Gabor recently started practicing with great success? [1:18:42] How did Gabor begin researching the therapeutic value of psychedelics? What was revealed by his first experience with ayahuasca? [1:20:56] The right way and the wrong way to experience ayahuasca. [1:26:46] Where can people learn more about current scientific studies into the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics? [1:30:40] An important caveat about powerful tools and exploitative gurus. [1:35:05] How I’ve been trying to reconnect with myself and my own gut feelings. [1:38:29] Why we shut down our gut feelings. [1:41:14] Elvis Presley’s lack of love song. [1:45:55] Some powerful modalities aren’t for everyone. [1:47:26] How did humans discover ayahuasca? How might it differ from place to place? [1:49:17] Gabor’s pre- and post-ayahuasca practices. [1:53:14] The importance of integrating by sharing our powerful experiences with others. [1:59:41] The clear intention you set is not the same as an expectation. “The task which hinders your task is your task.” [2:01:20] How can we view such a task as a gift? [2:05:07] An exercise for understanding how we respond not to what happens but to our perception of what happens. [2:07:18] Why blaming others for our problems turns us into victims, while identifying ourselves as the source of those problems is empowering. [2:14:01] What Gabor’s books are about and where he and his work can be found. [2:19:25] The problem with the way the United States deals with trauma. [2:24:47] Parting thoughts.

There is a diagnosis alongside PTSD of C-PTSD. IT means complex PTSD.

The word stress was used a lot but stress is not an emotion it is a physiological sensation and some people use the stress word to describe fear (trauma from the past or imagined futures) or anger (mobilisation - which can be constructive or destructive). My book is ""The Penny Model"" which explains where depression comes from (The unhealthy use of anger energy (which is fuelled by trauma and fears of the future). We are emotional beings not logical or mental and need to get the message from our emotions, else they become inflated and debilitating.

The unintended point is that we see what we want to see and hear.  He is obviously not a Trump supporter.  Therefore, he is buying MSM’s point of view and not digging into a possible alternative awareness.  This comment is not about politics.  It’s how seeking out evidence to continue to prove our beliefs help maintain our sanity.  Seeing two possibilities of a situation can cause extreme anxiety.  So we seek out evidence to sustain our current belief system, thus both perceived comfort level and sanity. Very interesting that with his brilliance, he is still subject to the maladies of the rest of us.  Brilliant individual.",5년 전,0,

However, I am old and should be retiring from running what is essentially a halfway house for people who have broken lives. Still, I have not had great success and certainly not so economically. Why do I get up every day? Why do I travel on my own buck to help the Mama to be, who is on bed rest with twins and suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. I had it to the point of almost dying with my first child and I prayed and figured out how to treat it. So, I had twins to save. They were born 6 weeks later at 3 and 1/2 pounds apiece and only spent a short time  in NICU. Talk about the beauty of my existence! I am an INFJ on the Myers Briggs scale, so I have a rare personality. I sometimes test out INFP, mostly when I am introverting and running from my own childhood pain. Talk about sensitive!

I thought I was in love with her strangely. Mother because if we were jumping on bed or holding on to shower rod I got the whipping for both of us. I asked Mother she said if she whipped Joyce her being an only child her babysitting job would be over. I accepted this but kids like seeing other kids get whipped. Can not remember if her doing this caused me more whippings; and plus, Mother would in public slap me in the face.

@marin_plemeniti," @aaronjsolomon    (Sorry for the late reply, I guess I missed the notification) > ""Perhaps the doctor should go through his own exercise while examining his disgust for Donald Trump and his supporters. ""  I agree. I would wager he probably does do that in periods of introspection, maybe specifically for Trump, or maybe more generally reconsidering views he has internalised. I don't think he mentioned or expressed feelings of digust, and he definitely didn't say anything about Trump's supporters.  > ""In the meantime, I'm not inclined to take spiritual instruction from a person so obviously uninterested in following his own teachings.""  That is just a simple, short exercise, that you don't have to take anyhting away from - not really specific spiritual instruction.  Also, I think you're setting an unrealistic expecatation on him (any other teacher, or person even) to be impeccable in what he does and says, to not have any mishaps, to perfectly and consistently do everything in accordance to what he's saying. People are imperfect. I don't think you'll find a single person/teacher, however brilliant they may be, that will be perfect and whose actions will be in perfect accordance to what they say. You set an ideal to which you aspire, you accept that you won't achieve it 100%.  And the fact that you didn't completely achieve it, and that you made mistakes along the way, doesn't make that ideal invalid.  Ideas are separable from, and can be justified without, the private actions and struggles of the person espousing them.  I think you use his (perceived) failure to hold by his teachings 100% to then justify your complete dismisal of him, even though the real reason is you just got offended by him having a disparaging view of Trump. It's not acceptable to you that Gabor might make a comment regarding the statements and actions (possibly misrepresenting those, I'm not saying Gabor was right) of a political figure you care about and also at the same time have useful, correct ideas in a different domain (psychology, therapy). That's not a rational view that you would hold if the political figure in question was somebody that wasn't important to you.  But because it was Trump, and because you were transitively offended as (I'm guessing) his supporter, in your eyes Gabor had to lose all credibility, completely. All his work became invalid just because of that.  I don't think that's not an objective assessment - I think there's ego defensively tainting the interpretation of an objective situation.

@KathyHussey063,"Knowing that the early conditioning & programming (that's largely on a subconscious level) of our young brain & the relationships with the adults around us early on is where trauma often originated can help because once you identify where (for example) feeling unvalued, unsafe, unloved or fearful etc. comes from, why you may think & feel the way you do, why some things cause us to react as we do, why you shut down when you feel hurt.... just knowing these things THEN lets us address & work on using new tools, skills to make conscious decisions daily to choose to make different choices, we can choose to stop believing the old story of ourselves we held & start telling ourselves a different more empowering, more compassionate story to understand ourselves with compassion as we work on eventually reprogramming our subconscious to be fully aware of or beliefs , choices & how we talk to ourselves inside 24  hours a day.     We can learn coping mechanisms that ARE USEFUL beneficial in place of the more self destructive habits we may have used in the past. Day by day, by exercising kindness to ourselves you can teach yourself (or reprogram your brain's circuitry) to react differently with more healthy functional reactions to the painful things we might face       I made more progress on battling lifelong depression in 2011 when I realized acceptance was the key to progress & change for me. (Acceptance; defined as; ability to sit with reality, with my real feelings & accept them as they ARE, allow them to BE for awhile even if it hurts right then, to be authentically me & not just try to bury my feelings or thoughts, deny them or not have to feel them.) That was the key to changing everything about how I viewed & felt about life.       Acceptance of all things, that they are what THEY ARE, that you won't die if you allow yourself to feel it, first lets us release the tension on the mind if you 're fighting what you feel all the time. 2nd; Often you'll decide you don't care that much about something then you CHOOSE to let it go...3rd; I learned tools to use to get through the really painful feelings & let them out , instead of trying to dull the pain temporarily, in harmfu ways. 4th; I let go of the old coping mechanisms I'd learned to use as a child, since they were not helping me as an adult. 5th; As issues came up from my past then, I started forgiving myself for anything I'd been holding against myself & I started to love myself, to feel compassion for the hurt chid inside who needed someone to acknowledge she'd been hurt, especially for myself to say it, admt it & to grieve what I'd lost in childhood or not had.      A load of resentment I'd felt towards others & towards myself lifted bit by bit.  I had harmed myself numerous times in my life, since age 13, but since I learned acceptance & to stop judging everyone AND myself I've  stopped hurting ME, realizing I'm the last person I should add MORE pain to when I'm already hurting so I started learning better methods of self soothing, how to ride out a horrible day, ya know?  I realized it's healthy & helpful to show enough strength to let myself reach out to others to receive comfort when I need it.       I learned to speak my pain when others hurt me, instead of shoving it down, continuing to suffer, acting like I am fine. You can only act for so long,,, you must look inside to find & work on healing, repairing whatever was harmed in your childhood. Our brains are very malleable, trainable and fixable....set yourself free it is possible.(It is a process, but you can feel better each week instead of staying stuck in one place.)",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@johnstark5254,"So interesting and a great healer Dr Gabor Mate;  if interested in other book with same principals I would also read John E Sarno MD book The Dividend Mind.   Dr Gabor Mate said –  The trauma is what is happening inside you.  So, address this in a compassionate way … you no longer a prisoner of your childhood.  Say no today when you could not say no in childhood. Where are you not saying ‘no’ in relationships, job, etc.   What do I need?   Also, he talks about parents can cause due to lack of compassion that cause trauma … does have to be severe trauma to cause issues.  Reconnect with the body Dr Gabor Mate talks about various therapies.     Dr John E Sarno – started to uncover many of his patients who had severe body pain, anxiety, depression had repressed personalities .. he did family history and learn these people had goodist/perfectionist personalities as a result to please people from childhood traumas.  Dr John E Sarno states this is all unconscious, in the unconscious, and the unconscious knows no time and it never goes away.  We have to go inside and address these issues and continue to work on this, and for more severe  cases takes life long work and most can help themselves and 20% of the people may need psychology.  His therapy included educating yourself on the psychological process, journalize on the traumas in your childhood and life … they are inside of you and you do not feel them.  Make a list of all things that may be contributes to these feelings from childhood up to life events like job, relationship, etc.   I have to work on this almost daily but by working on it, I am healthy, free of anxiety and panic attach and no longer have severe back pains.

@yourhealinghome8812,"Tim - on the issue of your sensitivity; My experience has suggested to me that all of us have a significant tendency to take our own features as baseline, or norm, and then measure those features as we witness them in others against our own; assuming ours is the norm, and theirs is stronger or weaker than ours. I think this seems the natural method, because our own level is the most readily available scale we have to us, so we just run to it. We start out this way in early childhood, when it's done subconsciously; then we do it continuously and habitually until it becomes germaine to the way we assemble our world view. Once I recognized this, I became aware that now I have to find the yardsticks externally. This is the only way to be fair with ourselves in the process of recognizing, accepting, and becoming comfortable taking credit for our natural gifts. If you've spent a lot of your life's attention building up your weak areas, it can feel uncomfortable accepting praise for those gifts, because your focus has mainly been on weakness, and we tend to become comfortable acknowledging our weaknesses, and when someone praises us for a strength, it's the last thing we expect, and we  don't have much experience in responding.",5년 전,0,

@totalcontrol4205,"In all I listened to today, the thing that got to me is that the knowledge you gained, can be nothing but a beautiful memory if not continuously practiced.  He said nothing that was new to me, my shamanic experiences began in childhood, I was reading Freud in my early teens, had my first kundalini experience in my 20s, but over the last 30 years, I became a carer and in order to achieve this role, I had to die.  My mother, the last person dependent on me, died last October.  I'm free, but now I am lost, I don't know anymore what I like or don't like, how to go out with people, I am am starting life all over again, carrying a lifetime of trauma.  I have gone into crisis mode, seen a counsellor, who has led me to seek treatment from trauma informed therapists.  Some are spiritually aware people.  However, still, been here, done that, seen shrinks before, done things before, but they worked only a little at best and whatever I gained, I lost.  The psychiatrist I saw, wants me to undergo a three week inpatient treatment which uses yoga, emdr, etc, for healing.  I wasn't going to do it. After hearing that phrase by Gabor though, I think I will go.  It's not enough to know, you have to live that knowledge, and preferably in community or your knowledge, experiences and even your sense of 'I' is nothing but a memory.  Cool.

@jasonmoroney9814,"Performing - to create something different/external to them, that feels better than how they feel inside.   Though when they close off that performance, they're left with how they feel.  Almost to escape how they feel, they go out to perform, to keep their mind on something different than what hurts them, something that stimulates them, something that brings them joy, something that they feel will help what troubles them, not be there to trouble others, because they don't want any other to have to feel the pain they have felt, that they still feel when they take their eye of their counter triggers for what saddens them.  I cried whilst typing this.  Whilst I find all of the above to be true. I have since learned that happiness is a choice, a default or premise mental and heart state. We have to choose what we want thoughts and feelings to compound with.   If we allow external scenarios to influence us to be sad, and if given the opportunity, to saturate your entirety with sadness, every negative then compounds on this, building a wall of hurt with loose bricks wavering, giving the feeling that a collapse is coming.   Leaving you to scatter and scale the wall to push and shove, to keep these wavering bricks in. You may get to a state where more are coming out than you can keep in, and if you've been holding yourself back from reaching out to ask for help, this is the time to allow and accept that no one achieves anything alone.  Once we realise that we want to be happy, that we want our premise thought and feeling to be that of happiness, then from here we can become that, and we can become that straight away.   Some may have more groundwork to do, and so there will be more curves to come around. And by groundwork what is meant is the asking and answering of certain questions.   A good starting question is;   Q: what is the MVP of my happiness?   I found it helpful to separate ourselves from others, by asking this question inwardly for me only, and again externally for others I care about besides me.  A good following question is;   Q: What is in my control and what is not?  With the realisation that I can only control me, and I can only influence others. If I focus on what is not in my control, I am focusing on what I can do nothing about, and so I am tormenting myself, which often is a go to for when we want to feel self pity, when we want to give in or when we want others to see us in so much pain that they will feel obliged to help or to change their behaviour (if it is this that hurts you).  Pity state behaviours form a dependent state. And if you are not receiving the help you need from dishing out these ques, from those you are prompting to act not caring or not feeling capable of being of any help, or from simply not interpreting what you are trying to convey...  developing a habitual pattern of dependence, dependence of assistance that you are not receiving will leave you there where wounds are likely to widen the longer you stay there.  There's more to convey, though Im supposed to be writing a critical review, so best get to the activities allow for me to skip along the stepping stones of happiness.",5년 전,0,

I believe there is also a bible passage that reads something like, ""If you want to enter the kingdom of heaven... be like a child."" I interpret ""kingdom of heaven"" to be peace, clarity, happiness ... and the most untainted and open form of ourselves is that of when we were a child.

That was mind blowing what you share about how heroin feels like a warm, soft hug  for someone who missed having their endorphin receptors developed due to emotional neglect.  For me, I have had an intuitive awareness that due to my early trauma, that any mind-altering substances  could be particularly addictive for me.  In my last relationship, I can say it was an addictive one.... strangely I was addicted to the chemicals released when I received trauma due to abuse.

@angiemmorris1978,"I was led to this video a couple months ago and this is why. I am a living, breathing, walking. talking example of dr. gabor's methods and his theory on childhood trauma.  I had never heard of dr Gabor before, in fact, for the last 2+ years, I have searched and watched  100's of videos on self-help and self-awareness and the healing of self and not once did I come across dr Gabor name. not until I had gotten to the point of my first childhood trauma and could go no farther did I find this video on my youtube feed with recommended for me attached to it. but it being a Tim Ferris video I was under the assumption that the content wasn't what I was looking for and had almost skipped it. but I didn't and 45 minutes into it I started crying...... I was on the right track and watching this video validated what I concluded for myself, I had used dr Gabors' methods on myself and I am an example of his theory on what happens from your first and ongoing childhood trauma.  and because I did all this on my own and have now come full circle to finally feeling whole I feel I have something to add to this conversation. the universe placed a purpose and a dream in my life for the first time ever about 2 years ago but a couple days ago I found the answer to what I needed to feel whole and my purpose became abundantly clear. I am to share my experience with others and to let people know what happens to a child when they are raised in a non-nurturing and at times hostile environment. and how I figured myself out and now don't feel the need for anything outside of myself to feel good about myself. I have something good inside me now and I need nothing else. except to share this and help children by showing adults what i believe is wrong with how we talk to our children. based only on my own 55 years of experience and knowledge and by the validation, I found in this video. with dr.

@raphaelvincentrossi6151,"First time listening Tim's podcast. Brilliant interviewer work. I know from my personal history and professional experience that conversations with deeply inter-disciplinary people (and open, creative people in general) can be tricky : they go different places at the same time, especially when those people are both plural in their inspiration and verbal. Here Gabor goes these different places, tackle many different subjects at the same time, so as the linear conversation unfolded I was like (at several moments) : ""Damn, that's an interesting thought/example he offers, too bad that the conversation went passed it..."" And YET at multiple times Tim managed to take notes along the way, go back to a certain point of the discussion. He never loses the thread. That is an amazing journalistic work. Bravo !",5년 전,1,

@Theflowoflove,"Please research regarding Sadhguru, he murdered his wife Vijakumari. Vijakumari was a respected teacher. A cult has been slowly growing around Sadhguru. He learned from Vijakumari, then killed her. Vijakumari gave compassionately. Sadhguru is a person that needs deep public scrutiny regarding his past, not constant public adulation. I highly recommend people watch a documentary called Kumare' 2011, before you go on any retreats; do your research.The documentary Kumare' 2011 never got the respect or attention it deserved. Sadhguru public health warning! Gabor Mate did a training talk with youth group workers, where he discusses cult members & causes.  I fully respect that Gabor Mate is most likely unaware of Sadhgurus background. There are many excellent ashrams. On the subject of E.M.D or any guided process, it will be as effective as the practitioners abilities to transcend projecting "" I can cure you ""attitude . Some practitioners project impatience onto their idea of what your process should be. Be brave & speak up for your self, if you want to change your practitioner or healing process, keep doing so until you feel the practitioner has earned your respect & trust. Compassionate enquiry works where the intent is rooted in love, self compassion. Cautionary tales are all about to warn us about cults like Sadhgurus.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@colloredbrothers,"I'm currently at the stage of the abusive human whisperer, I see the dysfunction in others and it makes me angry. I know that when I meditate I'm able to heal people from being in their vicinity, from telling them certain things that make them change the way they perceive themselves, or bring to light something which they must be careful of. The thing I need most in my life is far more meditation and mindfulness, and its so hard for me to not be distracted but its truly the only thing that will raise me to the level which I know I can attain.  A good example of an abusive form of this is the following. Imagine you know someone and they are working their ass off, they've become too old and its taking a toll on their health, what a machiavelian might do is tell that person that they look like shit. What does this achieve? It jolts the unconscious human being (unconscious of their own errors) that things must change, and you do this by attacking the ego of the person.   The idea is that they will start asking themselves, do I really look like shit? Should I perhaps take it more easy and be less stressed? Some people have told me that I'm a very anxious person at times but I never believed them, and here a completely unrelated person is strengthening the comments of the previous. The person then realizes that perhaps there is something to this and begins to look for ways to manage their stress levels, they become more conscious of what their body is telling them.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

If you don't believe me read the biography of Idris Shah, Sufi teacher, which he says ""Indian gurus came to him to find out how to exploit westerner, when he told them that he do not do such a thing, which is immoral and is not a spiritual thing to do. They replied, westerners have exploited Indians for so many decades, now it is our turn. I have seen with my own eyes, how these gurus are abusing their victims mentally and sexually.

@Mickeycuatropatas,"First time watching Tim - very thoughtful and brutally honest interviewer. Dr. Maté is always so interesting and insightful. Tim giving up coffee caught my attention as I have just done so recently to alleviate anxiety - which has been a wonderful help (cut back on the chocolate as well as it contains caffeine). Living here in the NW Amazon where yagé is made from the bark of ayahuasca -(Banisteriopsis caapi) which contains the MAOi and the chaliponga leaf (Diplopterys cabrerana) which contains the DMT plus additional tryptamines, so it is a different experience than the chakruna leaf (Pychotria viridis) that Tim mentioned. The Shamans here are called Taitas and they adjust the ratio of the 2 plants, so the drink varies (B.caapi:D.cabrerana). There are different subspecies of B. caapi which affects the type of experience (visual, auditory, physical). You will look at plants very differently the next day with respect and a little fear of their power over you if you are honest. Proper diet and mental preparation before with an intention/goal/question is important as well as set and setting and a good Taita.",6년 전,1,

While other kids played computers and jumped into and out of their parents fat wagon cars, those kids got fatter, their parents drank lots of wine, we were tee total rode bikes and spent holidays in the same town playing down by the sea, it was awesome. We were bullied by fat rich kids, parents wouldn't speak to us because we appeared poor.

@nikkibaxter5550,"I totally relate to what Dr Gabor  is expressing and agree 100 per cent, it was only when I began to deal with All the pain and suffering I injured as a child and into my early teens, that I began to heal from the experiences. Bringing with the healing insight creative abilities empathy and other gifts that I didn't even now I had the ability to do. I find most people I come across are so.scared of revisiting those painful experiences even as adults. Not knowing who they are, scared but not acknowledging their fears, scared of who they are, what they are capable of doing, feeling they may lose their minds if they let all those emotions come to the surface. Yet they lose their minds through not dealing with the pain they are carrying inside them. It takes serious courage and consistency to deal with our pain, but most people I have come across just like myself when I was in that dark place want someone to fix them, a quick fix, some one to get to the root of their problem, but without them having to delve into themselves. Thinking that doing things outside will.change the way they feel on the inside, yet I have found that it the opposite way, things change on the outside when we change for  within. Thank you for sharing  what I feel is lacking in the majority of the medical proffessions, and to be honest seems quite obvious, that abuse and childhood trauma causes illnesses and unwanted behaviours that continue to keep that child in a cycle of suffering into their adult life.",6년 전,0,

@nextlevelintactivism8195," @JaneCooper190072  So much failure of your own ideologies.  You should just spit on Jesus when you see him and tell him he wasn't enough.  The basic position of Christianity on circumcision, laid out in 1442 AD, is that it:  ""firmly believes, professes and teaches that the legal prescriptions of the old Testament or the Mosaic law, which are divided into ceremonies, holy sacrifices and sacraments, because they were instituted to signify something in the future, although they were adequate for the divine cult of that age, once our lord Jesus Christ who was signified by them had come, came to an end and the sacraments of the new Testament had their beginning. Whoever, after the passion, places his hope in the legal prescriptions and submits himself to them as necessary for salvation and as if faith in Christ without them could not save, sins mortally. It does not deny that from Christ's passion until the promulgation of the gospel they could have been retained, provided they were in no way believed to be necessary for salvation. But it asserts that **after the promulgation of the gospel they cannot be observed without loss of eternal salvation**. Therefore it denounces all who after that time observe circumcision, the sabbath and other legal prescriptions as strangers to the faith of Christ and unable to share in eternal salvation, unless they recoil at some time from these errors. Therefore it strictly orders all who glory in the name of Christ[ian], not to practise circumcision either before or after baptism, since whether or not they place their hope in it, it cannot possibly be observed without loss of eternal salvation.""  Doesn't get any clearer than that. Ecumenical Council of Florence and Council of Basel.  http://www.catholicdoors.com/faq/qu340.htm  Remember that in 1442 there was no Protestant church; all Christianity was one and the teachings were universal. Even Martin Luther, the father of Protestantism, abhorred and denounced circumcision.",4년 전,9,

@nextlevelintactivism8195," @JaneCooper190072  I'm soooo embarrassed for you. You lived your whole life thinking you were part of a religion that you don't even comprehend.    The Christian Apostle Paul, was the first - whole - intactivist ♥️🙏🏻😍  For Christmas I asked my family for the three book set “Commentary of the Holy Scriptures”, to give me more of a context of each book and verse of the New Testament; it also shows the scene which the passages were set within the second century.   In this day/age, local pastors/churches, friends, and family really suck with their narrow and limited (as well as ignorant) interpretations. They’re too confusing and silly, and my own interpretations I see don’t matter either. Everyone throws their own interpretations at each other, and it’s become annoying.  So I figure, it should be each of our goals to look into history (pre-10th century), to understand the one European view of these New Testament books. Not 40,000 new age American views.   My family was very kind, and I now own the set. It was written from Orthodox Archbishop Averky (Taushev), and they are the volumes that are widely circulated today in Russia which help others strengthen their faith.   Point being, I’m looking into circumcision specifically as my starting point. A quick glance over volumes II & III and trying to remember where I saw circumcision being spoken about...  I see two areas:  In the book of Acts, chapter 11 Volume II: the circumcised Christians at the time (Jewish Christians/Judaizers), were upset that Peter sat, lived, and ate with the “uncircumcised”. (P.56). These Judaizers were upset that these new people who also called themselves faithful Gentile converts, saw the “holiness of the Old Testament Law” as a false teaching. The Judaizers feverishly began to rebuke Peter for allowing this in his household, and it’s noted that this was only the start of Peter’s mission, and catechization of the faithful was not necessary at this time. “With this account, Peter did not directly answer the issues raised by the Jewish Christians, instead he showed them the will of God; to accept  those within the Church as brothers; and Peter’s account calmed them. (P. 57).  Volume III, p. 53 The Epistle of the Holy Apostle Paul to the Galatians:  I see that Galatia was a region in Asia Minor, neighboring Cappadocia, Lycaonia, Pontus, and other regions. The country was originally settled by Greeks, but soon the Jews moved to Galatia when Jews were forced out of Palaestine, Emperor Augustus gave special patronage to the Jews that moved to Galatia, which is mentioned by Josephus.   The Christian communities in Galatia began growing in large numbers, first with Paul, then Silas, and Timothy as they went through the cities delivering the news of the missionary journey from the apostles and strengthing their numbers.   P. 54. The purpose of this epistle was the apparently rabid Judaizers in Galatia, who began to insist on the necessity for circumcision, and other rites of the Old Jewish (Mosaic Law) for salvation. The Judaizers saw how lax Paul was, and his favor with Pagans, and they belittled his ministry by saying he wasn’t of Jesus Christ; he was only of his own selfish lips. Many Judaizers fell away by the time Paul arrived, (Gal 1:6). And he was astounded at how foolish and frivol the Judaizers were.   Paul immediately began to write to the people, to uncover their delusions. He wrote it with his own hand. (Gal 6:11).   Galatians is mapped out as follows:  1. Prologue, Paul’s greeting and introduction where he expresses the main theme. 1:1-10 2. A defense of Paul’s apostolic diginiry, which had been brought into question by the Judaizing false teachers. 1:11-2:1-21 3. A dogmatic section, in which Paul powerfully and completely reveals the main theme of his epistle — the reference of the Old Testament to the New, and the end of the importance of the Law of Moses (Jewish Law) after the coming of Christ the Savior. 3:1-29 & 4:1-31 4. A moral-instructive section, in which the foundation of the Christian life, separate of the Old Testament Law, is described. 5:1-26 & 6:1-10 5. A conclusion, in which concrete instructions are given concerning circumcision and reverence due to the Cross of Christ. 6:11-18  A few really cool points to summarize from the book of Galatians:   • Paul accounts his attendance to the first Christian Council of Jerusalem. (All Christians should additionally research the 7 important councils central to the faith).  • This Council declared Mosaic (Jewish Law) unnecessary in the life of a Christian.  • St Titus was one of the first uncircumcised (whole) men to be baptized and presented to the apostles, they did not require him cut for good reason.  • Paul’s epistle received sanction of all the elder apostles at this council. • The eldest of the apostles acknowledged how the Apostle Paul had a unique calling to preach to the uncircumcised; just as Peter’s calling was to the Jews.   ... SO MUCH MORE INFO. Christians who hadn’t already had a Jewish background, absolutely never cut for sure.",4년 전,5,
@JaneCooper190072," @nextlevelintactivism8195  I like how you write one sentence and copy and paste all the rest.  I'm  not reading a whole book you wrote, especially when it's a view of an atheist.

If you have a question put it in one comment, don't cuss me then expect me to answer several questions at once. The Bible agrees with the manuscripts Martin Luther was a translator of the Greek and Hebrew into the German language in the 1500's which even the atheists know was NOT when Christianity started.   Any questions put in one comment, otherwise i'm not answering any more. We are told don't cast pearl before swine, so i won't any further unless you want to speak with respect.   Lastly, i haven't been a Christian my whole life. I wish i would have been cause God is AWESOME!!!  I know circumsicion is no longer required today, all blood ordinances have been nailed to the cross but there's nothing wrong with having it done. Sorry it's such a sore subject for you, guess you just had bad luck huh..  In Acts 15 the gentiles wanted to be circumcised but it wasn't necessary, they just needed to abstain from fornication and meats offered to idols. We KNOW it's not necessary today. Circumcision is of the heart since Christ.  So i read it what's your point?? You think i think circumcision is still necessary today to be a Christian???? We know that,, I never said it was, so i really don't know what you're trying to prove. I like how you assume i know nothing, without ever knowing me from adam.",4년 전(수정됨),3,

@homesgui_chrome9186," @carinnegbeke7414  . Thank you for your concern thoughts, and taking the time to respond but, I am petrified, scared of the future. My past is filled with sorrow, depression, emotional sensitivity, rejection and awkwardness around women. I usually get nervous and make excuses to run away from them. Before they reject me ""imposter syndrome"", another is a Huge Loss of my best friend who had unconditional love for me.   My best friend now, is Henry,  a terrier mix, who I inherited by my friend after losing him. That is a huge part of my depression now losing Ray.  Ray's kindness and man-childlike behavior. Allowed me to trust in him and vice-versa. I deal with my depression one day at a time. Trying not to offend or socialize much but that causes other issues. 90% of my social life now is on line. Email, socializing, commenting, learning new things etc. Which helps.  But still miss the touch of someone. It's ironic that i don't like to be touched.  I am a scientist and critical thinker. I see facts and numbers which is tangible here..  My faith in a God is no longer there, but still hope I am wrong about an afterlife. Maybe returning to the Energy source we call the universe where I can experience Unconditional True Love again. I have never seen a miracle or the presence of a diety. Have had a NDI and found there is nothing after death. Just more permanent EMPTINESS as I have experienced it.  All of us will pass through that paradigm reality of death, which is why most fear it or else we be happy to see it. I am just waiting patiently.   Substance abuse is a temporary happiness. But don't experiment anymore.  Don't need it. Not without my dear trusted friend who past away from a fall, hit his head and past after.😪 There are a few people we fall in love with. Cherish your time with them because that will pass and then left with only sadness, regrets, and sorrow.  👋🖖🤟 👬👫💑 Just love.  The only true happiness.",3년 전,1,

@bellasflores3834," @JaneCooper190072  that was the old covenant, that no longer was applicable after Jesus came.  He is the new covenant and the sacrifice for humanity.  Jesus' blood on the cross.  Galatians 5:6  For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.  1 Corinthians 7:19  Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands is what counts.  There are many more references but the point is, nobody gets saved by keeping any law....Jesus is our savior and our hearts need to be circumcised, meaning renewed and our Spirit filled by the Holy Spirit, by grace we have been saved ONLY.  I hope this clarifies some more.",2년 전,3,
@JaneCooper190072," @bellasflores3834  OH so we are allowed to murder and steal now? Have those laws been done away with?  Only blood ordinance were done away with because Jesus being nailed to the cross fulfilled those.   Mathew 5   Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil   For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled   Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  Christ BECAME our Passover lamb, Jesus IS our SABBATH, Sabbath means rest, and we rest in HIM..  Christ fulfilled the feasts and the passover. But that doesn't mean we're not under any laws. The food laws still stand, what's good for consumption and what's not, that hasn't changed.  Each land has it's own laws, and Christians ESPECIALLY should be following the laws.   1st Corin 5  Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us  But we still are very much under the law, again, only the blood ordinances were done away with, not the law.   Don't ignore the old testament, it gives us much insight on the types that are to be fulfilled in these end times.  Also Christ Himself and the prophecies of His coming is in the old testament, mentioned many, many times.",2년 전,3,

@jeffayya,"Does sensitivity really magnify the pain we have? Or the lack of experiencing a stimulus in life where certain sensitivities exist or sensitivities are involved, that makes it feels more painful than ever?   Your sensitivity depends on the frequency of your experience to a certain stimuli. Like for example: if you keep on using your fingers for playing the guitar you develop callouses on your finger tips. And so it will be lesser and lesser sensitive to pain while  playing with the strings on bear fingers than it was before because of the callouses that becomes a protective covering over the tip of your fingers from a stimuli. Your sensitivity becomes less and less with higher frequency of experiencing a stimuli. Then you begin to be more skilled or creative in playing as you become less sensitive to pain that you can ignore it, so you can focus on the music being created like you can begin to appreciate a tapestry being created than the chaos you see behind while weaving it.   Some of us people just go through life thinking we can just cherry pick the easy and the shortcuts and the joys of it all without suffering. But life is not like that at all. We either go thru life or not. With plenty of both joys and sufferings or none at all. Some of us people think we can avoid pain all the way so bad that we don’t know we’re missing out in life and can’t even know we are not experiencing life at all. And we don’t know we’re living more in pain trying to avoid pain than facing life as it is. Sometimes we are self-medicating pain or trying to not feel the pain and we don’t see how we are deceiving  ourselves. Sometimes we don’t see that the only way out is to experience that pain so we are through with it and get to that other side where we are supposed to be/where we desire/where we are called to be.   Be it with suffering and  joy, life goes on. In life we either keep going or stop. As if we can stop life. The moment we try to stop thinking we got everything  under control, life drags us anyways. And so life feels like everything is out of control. And that’s when everything becomes painful.   Life goes on until it doesn’t anymore. As we live, the question is, do we keep playing with the guitar or do we stop playing. If we stop, callouses begins to come off. And the next time we play again, our fingers will be as sensitive to pain as it was the first time we played the guitar.   I’m not for people who goes finding every pain that exists out their, but I’m for facing the ones that is in front of you. It didn’t happen the other way coz it didn’t. Your facing the pain in-front of you coz you have to. You’ll never see the purpose of that pain until you go through it. And if you have God, you’re only promised to go thru pain and life victorious in His guidance.   Some people knows the principle in life and they just keep going and facing life braving through all its joys and it’s sufferings coz they know that when they stop, it’ll be more unbearable. It’s when we stop that pain stays painful. It’s when we stop that pain stay stuck and the same like a stone remain unturned.",2년 전,3,

We would be in Spiritual bodies if that was the case and not only that we still have prophecies we are waiting to be fulfilled, the millenium has in no way, shape or form come to pass, and is definitely still future, all scholars would agree on this. In the eternity, after the millennial reign, after all things are put under Christs feet, THEN we will be in our celestial bodies once again. We are changed at the 7th trump, at Christs return, the millennium is to teach those who are still liable to die, they have put on their celestial bodies but since they have died in sins they still haven't put on immortality.

@AntonSlavik,"I love both of these guys and the very human dialogue the interviewer has with Maté, but I feel a bit suspicious and at the very least betrayed that diet isn't factored in here. Maté mentions the traditional preparation for ayahuasca, which is basically a fast. Ask any culture around the world what it means to not eat meat or dairy products, and they'll tell you it's a spiritual fast. It's really irresponsible for Dr. Maté to not mention that veganism shouldn't be a lifestyle, but it seems he's suffering the same blindness his colleagues suffer when they don't take trauma into account as such a huge factor - he's not taking diet into account. We're eating all of these antinutrients and pro-inflammatory foods as one kind of coping mechanism. But just like growing up in a community full of alcoholics or drug addicts, this form of self abuse is normalised and even seen as a healthy life choice. Vegetables, grains, and seeds, are poisons. Some are beneficial as a form of medicine (such as during a fast), but we live in a culture here in the West that glorifies these medicines as our saviours which must be eaten EVERY DAY.

@steghuman9063,"First of all a great interview. After reading the comments here, I am a bit skeptical.  Does anybody not notice the psychological techniques Gabor uses? I think it would be interesting to actually see how Gabor reacts if he is disagreed with.  Subconscious suggestions,  used by control freaks,, ""Emotionless face <hard to read, feel sympathy for me ( a sob story),,, If I were to attack you,,,, pretend to be interested and empathetic toward in this case the interviewer but only interested in getting his own narrow point of view across as important"". While childhood trauma may have adaptive responses to problems later on in life, problems arrive regardless, he is obsessive about this rather narrow view. Ultimately it comes down to you and you alone to the way you maintain balance and problem solve. The fundamental problem that humanity has are religions.  Entheogens do help dissolve problem boundaries, but most people are too gutless to try them, ""It's about intention"", LMAO  the experiences don't adhere to any specified intentional path. I found it best just to be curious and learn more about consciousness, keep it as broad as that, you can't go wrong and don't fight it, feel the vibes go with the flow the nightmarish stuff is juxtaposed with the profundities and helpful stuff, fight it and it will punish like nothing else could for it is intense inward focus. Inexpensive alternative to (retreats) hint (cow paddocks, humidity after a few days of rain)< study species identification get it right. Ayahuasca and high dose P.Cubensis, people think they are very different experiences, I think they don't know what they are talking about.

His concepts of treating not just the medical condition but the root cause is not a new concept by any means, it just is NOT being incorporated in the medical field. Why? My guess is that most health care professionals only have time to administer a quick fix (medications), which is really only a bandaid and not a fix. I am also sure that many doctors (and I have met some in my time) do not have the personal experience or empathy to care beyond the quick fix. If more doctors and health care professionals, (be it mental or physical) actually took the time to CARE about why people end up the way they end up, our world would be a much better and healthier place!!!!

The interposed foreskin decreases the friction between the introitus and the glans. The unretracted foreskin consists of a thin dermis that is folded on itself with very little friction between the layers. As the penis advances, the foreskin unrolls so that the portion that makes initial contact with the introitus is 6 cm. Up the shaft before any friction occurs between the device and the skin.

Also lost are branches of the dorsal nerve, and 10,000-20,000+ specialized erotogenic nerve endings of several types.

A circumcised (anyone can use this - for us circumcised, this is our only way) man can assess how important his missing skin is by testing his remaining sexually sensitive tissue as follows: In an aroused state, caress the skin downwards, starting from the end of the penis. When your stroke crosses the scar line, note the stark difference in sensitivity. The amount of sensitive area you have remaining between the scar line and the glans is just a sample of what you had before your circumcision. This sensitive region is normally much larger and folded inside the foreskin in the intact male, where it is moist and protected from constant stimulation. After circumcision, what remains of this region is exposed, dried out, and greatly desensitized. Child circumcision was designed in an attempt to reduce the sexual appetite by reducing the amount of pleasure sexual stimulation can provide you.",4년 전,0,
@nextlevelintactivism8195,"Then this:  Infant torture.   Baby struggles for breath after circumcision http://youtu.be/zHW930zGdNA   Vomiting It was my sad task to publish a case report about a baby who experienced severe vomiting after being circumcised. Following the vomiting spell, the baby stopped breathing and had to be hospitalized for five days so that he could receive intravenous antibiotics. Needless to say, this never would have occurred had the baby been protected from circumcision. Infants respond to the pain of circumcision by screaming, just as we would if someone slowly crushed and cut off part of our sex organs without anesthetic. When the crying is especially intense, the baby may swallow air. Then, when the mother tries to soothe her baby by feeding him, it may lead to vomiting, followed by apnea.  Apnea (Stopped Breathing) Apnea is the temporary cessation of breathing. The pain of circumcision is so severe that some babies stop breathing during the surgery. In an important study on the pain of circumcision published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers discovered that serious complications occurred during circumcision. One infant experienced the same level of extreme distress as all the others in the study, but two and a half minutes after the conclusion of the surgery, the baby developed an abnormal posture, stopped breathing, and suffered projectile vomiting even though he had been denied food for more than three hours before the surgery. Another baby experienced a choking spell and stopped breathing three and a half minutes after the surgery. The researchers noticed these serious complications because they were looking for them. One wonders how many babies suffer without anyone taking notice or caring, or even thinking there is anything wrong with projectile vomiting, choking, or cessation of breathing. Rupture of internal organs Circumcision is so traumatic, painful, and frightening that it literally terrorizes the baby. Some babies have suffered extreme reactions to this experience that few adults could ever imagine possible. Rupture of the Lung The medical literature details cases of circumcised babies whose lungs have burst as a result of intense crying. In one case, at Georgetown University School of Medicine, a fifteen-day-old baby with severe respiratory distress was circumcised. He turned blue, started breathing frantically, and cried incessantly. Finally, doctors discovered that the crying had caused the baby's right lung to burst. A drainage tube was inserted and the baby was hospitalized for nineteen days. Blood Clots in the Lung A case of life-threatening blood clots in the lung was reported following adult circumcision.  Heart Damage The serious injury that circumcision can cause to other parts of the body is made clear in reports of babies whose hearts were damaged as a result of circumcision . In one case from Rochester, New York, a newborn baby was circumcised in the delivery room, even though the American Academy of Pediatricians has condemned this practice. The baby immediately turned blue, experienced grunting respirations, his temperature dropped to a dangerous level, and his heart muscle was damaged. This baby miraculously survived, but spent eleven days in the intensive care unit of the hospital. In another published report, four babies who were hospitalized following circumcision turned blue, were lifeless, had elevated heartbeats, frantic breathing, grunting, and extremely poor breathing. The liver was enlarged in three of the babies, and all babies showed signs of acute heart failure, enlarged heart, and fluid in the lungs. All four babies had been circumcised by the same circumciser, who had tried to controll the bleeding with epinephrine solution. The doctors who fought to save the lives of these babies believe that the drug may have induced the chain of events that nearly killed these innocent babies.  Rupture of the stomach In Richmond, Virginia, a healthy two-day-old baby was prepared for circumcision by denying him food for five hours. Terrified, the baby began crying hysterically as soon as the circumciser strapped him to the restraining board. After half an hour in this position, the baby vomited. Doctors pumped his stomach. The circumciser proceeded to amputate the baby's foreskin without anesthesia using a Gemco clamp. The baby cried vehemently throughout the ninety-minute ordeal. After the surgery, the baby refused to feed. His abdomen became distended and doctors discovered that his stomach had ruptured, requiring emergency abdominal surgery and the insertion of a feeding tube. After twenty-five days in the hospital, the baby was released. This baby had a perfectly normal stomach when he was born, but the trauma, excruciating pain of circumcision, and his prolonged crying caused his stomach to burst and spill its contents into the abdominal cavity.""  -What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM): Circumcision: Untold Facts on America's Most Widely Perfomed-and Most Unnecessary-Surgery   Stick a pencil in your baby's ear. I doubt it will affect its hearing and I'm sure he'll be fine with it when he grows up. And cut out his tongue. You never know, he might be able to taste better than ever and sing like a fucking angel. You never know until you try it. Poke one of his eyes out, I doubt if it will affect his vision, he might even be able to see better. Try cutting off one of his feet, he will probably grow up to be an record breaking sprinter. How could it possibly have any adverse effects? How would you know until you try it? Or just cut the end of his knob off, I'm sure it won't reduce his pleasure during sex or make his glans have all the sensitivity of a dried up fucking walnut. If everybody does it, it will seem like the most normal thing in the world and he might not even hold it against you.   BABY SCREAMED HIMSELF CATATONIC ""My daughter had jaundice as a newborn and ended up in the nicu for a couple of days. Her bed was right next to the ""procedure"" room. One day, I was nursing her and they hadn't pulled the curtain all the way closed over the window on the procedure room's door. I was hearing a baby scream, so I looked through the hole in the curtains and witnessed a circumcision being performed. The baby was strapped down to one of those plastic boards and literally screamed himself catatonic. At first he was just gasping and screaming, then he got totally quiet and was just shaking silently. I was bawling. Before that, I didn't really see a reason for circumcising, but, I figured I'd leave the decision up to my husband since he must know more about it than me.

@nextlevelintactivism8195,"Then this:  THIS. IS. CIRCUMCISION, people. I heard the screams they're talking about. I could hear it from outside the room and down the hall in the lobby and I buried my head into Nicholas' dads arm because I couldn't stand it. All I wanted to do in that moment was go get my baby out of that room. I still haven't fully forgiven myself for Not. I will never forget the way he looked when they brought him back to me. It took me several minutes to calm him which was very much unlike him. He was such a good and happy baby when he first came home. He wouldn't latch on and nurse readily. He looked lifeless and his face was so red and blotchy from screaming and crying. They told me ""this is normal"", but its not.   I will never forget the way his little penis looked, so bloody and raw like a giant wound at his first diaper change. And thank God he healed quickly because I cringed at every diaper change. It broke my heart every time he flinched and cried when I'd wipe him or put ointment on, as instructed. It. Was. Awful.  Still, I defended my decision vehemently for years, partly because I really believed it really was the best thing and partly because I didn't to believe I had made such a permanent mistake that only my son would have to pay for. I permanently altered his genitals without his consent. And once I realized that the reasoning behind it is bogus and that no medical institution in the world recommends it be done routinely, I was devastated. But I really thought I was doing the best thing at the time. I wish I had known better.  <ETA: The story above is my own, The photo and description below are a repost from Black Moms Blog.>.  ""You take a freshly born little boy and you strap him down into an apparatus that holds his legs apart. It’s called the Circumstraint. There are Velcro cuffs to keep his arms and legs in place so he can’t move while you’re slicing his genitals. Then, you coat his penis in antiseptic. The topical is as much medication as the baby will have during the process and it does nothing at all to alleviate the pain. You can’t sedate babies or give them anesthetics for this procedure — or most others — so he’s literally going to feel every rip, tear, yank, and slice as he’s strapped down to a device in an operating room.  ""Now, because it’s meant to shield the baby from foreign materials such as fecal matter, the foreskin’s opening is incredibly tiny. The doctor is going to procure some forceps to place them into the tiny opening and widen it. This rips the baby’s synechia, the bit of skin that’s attached to the head of his penis and the inner lining of his foreskin. This is also where the newborn’s screaming becomes so shrill and heartwrenching, where he screams until his lungs have nothing more to offer so his mouth becomes stuck in a silent, breathless, crimson-faced gape of anguish. What we’re doing to our newborn boys is nothing short of barbaric. ""But we’ve only just begun. ""As the blood begins to form around the tip of his penis, a clamp is attached to his newly stretched skin. Then, a slit is cut into the dorsal side of the tender flesh. The skin is peeled back, revealing the raw and bloody glans (head) of the baby’s penis. Once that’s exposed, a tiny bell-shaped cap is placed on the glans, and the foreskin is stretched over that bell. A string goes around the object to secure the skin, the tighter the better, for it will ooze blood and obscure the view of what needs to be sliced off.""

Injurious experiences, such as malnutrition, exposure to chemical toxins or drugs, and toxic stress before birth or in early childhood are not “forgotten,” but rather are built into the architecture of the developing brain through the epigenome. The “biological memories” associated with these epigenetic changes can affect multiple organ systems and increase the risk not only for poor physical and mental health outcomes but also for impairments in future learning capacity and behavior.

Humphreys, assistant professor of psychology at Vanderbilt. “Given that the hippocampus undergoes rapid changes in the first years of life, the effects of stressful experiences during this period, even those the child doesn’t remember, may be particularly important in understanding the development of this region of the brain.”  https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2018/12/19/stress-and-trauma-in-earliest-years-linked-to-reduced-hippocampal-volume-in-adolescence/  http://www.kathrynhumphreys.com/   Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Thickness Is Related to Alexithymia in Childhood Trauma-Related PTSD  https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139807  Abstract  Alexithymia, or “no words for feelings”, is highly prevalent in samples with childhood maltreatment and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been identified as a key region involved in alexithymia, early life trauma, and PTSD.  Functional alterations in the dACC also have been associated with alexithymia in PTSD. This study examined whether dACC morphology is a neural correlate of alexithymia in child maltreatment-related PTSD.  Sixteen adults with PTSD and a history of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, or exposure to domestic violence, and 24 healthy controls (HC) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20 (TAS–20) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging.  Cortical thickness of the dACC was measured using FreeSurfer, and values were correlated with TAS–20 scores, controlling for sex and age, in both groups. Average TAS–20 score was significantly higher in the PTSD than the HC group. TAS–20 scores were significantly positively associated with dACC thickness only in the PTSD group.  This association was strongest in the left hemisphere and for TAS–20 subscales that assess difficulty identifying and describing feelings. We found that increasing dACC gray matter thickness is a neural correlate of greater alexithymia in the context of PTSD with childhood maltreatment. While findings are correlational, they motivate further inquiry into the relationships between childhood adversity, emotional awareness and expression, and dACC morphologic development in trauma-related psychopathology.   In the human brain, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is the frontal part of the cingulate cortex that resembles a ""collar"" surrounding the frontal part of the corpus callosum. It consists of Brodmann areas 24, 32, and 33.  It appears to play a role in a wide variety of autonomic functions, such as regulating blood pressure and heart rate.[citation needed]  It is also involved in certain higher-level functions, such as attention allocation,[1] reward anticipation, decision-making,[2] ethics and morality,[3] impulse control (e.g. performance monitoring and error detection),[4] and emotion.[5][6]  Stress and trauma in earliest years linked to reduced hippocampal volume in adolescence  https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2018/12/19/stress-and-trauma-in-earliest-years-linked-to-reduced-hippocampal-volume-in-adolescence/?fbclid=IwAR0VaWVlSPKRL_CCuVOxMiNx08jKrsCOmUQ3pmKR64ZogLs_P8x03YAiTSs  CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT PREDICTS REDUCED INHIBITION‐RELATED ACTIVITY IN THE ROSTRAL ANTERIOR CINGULATE IN PTSD, BUT NOT TRAUMA‐EXPOSED CONTROLS  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/da.22506  Findings highlight individual differences in neural function following childhood trauma, and point to inhibition‐related activation in rostral ACC as a risk factor for PTSD.  Early Life Stress and Morphometry of the Adult Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Caudate Nuclei  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006322306001405  Background Early life stress (ELS) is linked to adult psychopathology and may contribute to long-term brain alterations, as suggested by studies of women who suffered childhood sexual abuse. We examine whether reported adverse ELS defined as stressful and/or traumatic adverse childhood events (ACEs) is associated with smaller limbic and basal ganglia volumes.  Conclusions Reported ELS is associated with smaller ACC and caudate volumes, but not the hippocampal or amygdala volumes. The reasons for these brain effects are not entirely clear, but may reflect the influence of early stress and traumatic events on the developing brain.   Childhood Trauma Exposure Disrupts the Automatic Regulation of Emotional Processing  https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2014311  Results showed that trauma-exposed youth failed to dampen dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and engage amygdala–pregenual cingulate inhibitory circuitry during the regulation of emotional conflict, and were less able to regulate emotional conflict. In addition, trauma-exposed youth showed greater conflict-related amygdala reactivity that was associated with diminished levels of trait reward sensitivity. These data point to a trauma-related deficit in automatic regulation of emotional processing, and increase in sensitivity to emotional conflict in neural systems implicated in threat detection. Aberrant amygdala response to emotional conflict was related to diminished reward sensitivity that is emerging as a critical stress-susceptibility trait that may contribute to the emergence of mental illness during adolescence. These results suggest that deficits in conflict regulation for emotional material may underlie heightened risk for psychopathology in individuals that endure early-life trauma.   ACE What are ACE?

@markcaseon7136,"When it comes to property and human capital, our postmodern society is wealthier than ever. In terms of social capital, we are slowly inching toward the poverty line, metaphorically speaking. “Social capital,” which seems to be declining at an alarming rate, refers to the social networks of relationships among people who live in a particular society and the norms of reciprocity, trust, and cooperation to which those networks give rise. Social Capital Theory posits that our lives are made more productive with social ties. Just as we have basic needs for food, water and shelter, the need for social connection is crucial to our well-being. Sadly, as our communities are unraveling, Americans are becoming more isolated and disengaged than ever before.  The weakening of community networks didn’t just occur overnight  Since the 1980s, the percentage of American adults who report being lonely has doubled from 20 percent to 40 percent. More than a quarter of the population lives alone, and marriage rates and number of kids per household are dropping. According to researchers, formal group membership in professional and local community organizations has declined by 10–20 percent over the last five decades. Participation in social groups has been on a downward slope for years and it only appears to continue today.  As our civic engagement declines, so too does our civil engagement. Not surprisingly, recent analyses have suggested that widespread smartphone use has diminished the quality of our interpersonal exchanges. It has become acceptable to ignore texts and emails. If an invitation or even a salutation to a friend was extended in person, and the response was no response, this would be considered rude at the very least. But today, with texting and emailing becoming our primary modes of communication, this type of dismissive behavior has become the norm. And norms are what shape societies.  What is driving the trend toward isolation?  This is no one single culprit responsible for America’s disengagement. A multitude of contributing forces have given rise to our current state. In his book Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, Robert Putnam attempts to solve the puzzle. “Postwar generations,” he writes, “are simply less community-oriented than their parents and grandparents—more materialistic, more cynical and less politically interested.” Drawing from research, Putnam lays out some of the most significant factors driving our social disconnectedness.  Changes in family structure  Families are spending less time together today than in previous generations. Over the last 30 years, family dinners and conversation declined more than 30 percent, which, according to the American College of Pediatricians, has a significant impact on children as they grow up. Children learn socialization through live interaction with adults, and when this is compromised, language delays can result. At one time, the classroom may have offered a satisfactory substitute to a lack of interaction at home. However, when the pressure to achieve at a high academic level in competition with peers takes priority, another area of socialization is lost.  article continues after advertisement  Suburban sprawl  As many city dwellers began fleeing to the suburbs, farther apart from our neighbors, we traded tight communities for vast—yet mostly empty—spaces and empty voids we seek to fill with food, shopping, or television. Commutes are longer, usually spent alone in a car, draining time and energy and with them the inclination to participate in social or community groups.  Misguided priorities  Another factor Putnam and other researchers blame for our increasing social disengagement is misguided priorities. Sociologist Philip Slater, author of The Pursuit of Loneliness, writes that the root of disconnection in America is “the collective obsession with the success of the individual.” Though written more than 40 years ago, it appears not much has changed since. Money and status are increasingly prioritized, sometimes at the expense of the quality of our relationships. We were brought up in a culture that tells us that the more money we make, the more things we accumulate, the better title and fancier job we have, the happier we will be. However, the science tells us otherwise.  Technology  One of the biggest culprits of social isolation and disengagement, according to Putnam, is the “privatization of leisure time.” Technology and mass media have become the medium of choice through which many of us spend our free time—usually alone. This is sometimes true even when we are in the same room. The phrase alone together has become such a ubiquitous cultural reference that it is now the title of a television show.  article continues after advertisement  The internet offers a wonderful alternative to stay connected for those who may be confined to the home due to health or age-related factors. The use of Skype and other VOIPs, for example, has made it easier for friends and families living on opposite sides of the world to keep in touch. Technology becomes detrimental when it is used as a primary form of communication, which, sadly, seems to be the direction in which we are headed. Although we cannot only blame modern technology, it has certainly made an already growing problem even worse.  Consequences of our disengagement  As multitudinous as the causes of social isolation and disengagement are, so too are the consequences. Higher rates of crime and violence, competitiveness, inequality, addiction and loneliness are some, to name a few. Those who experience chronic loneliness are at a significantly greater risk for developing the conditions that lead to premature death such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, altered immune systems, and depression.  It is important to note the difference between loneliness and social isolation. Although they often co-occur, one does not necessarily beget the other. Loneliness is a subjective feeling of distress, arising when social connections are perceived to be inadequate or unfulfilling. Social isolation is the absence of meaningful social relationships. It is possible to be isolated but not feel lonely, and vice versa.  Public Health Implications  Nonetheless, self-reported feelings of loneliness and the objective state of being socially isolated have negative effects on our health. There is compelling evidence that both are associated with poorer physical, mental and emotional well-being. So much so that the American Psychological Association (APA) is calling for social connection to be made a public health priority in the US. Loneliness is as important a risk factor for premature death as obesity and smoking. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists “social support networks” as a determinant of health. A sense of isolation or social rejection, researchers say, disrupts our cognitive abilities and our immune system, making us more susceptible to disease. Essentially, our disconnection is making us sicker and more addicted and our lives emptier.  article continues after advertisement  A recent study examining the relative roles of social capital and income as determinants of happiness concluded, “Communities and nations with better social capital, in other words, quality social networks and social norms as well as high levels of trust, respond to crises and economic transitions more happily and effectively.”  We are hardwired for social connection. It is what enabled human beings to survive as a species—in other words, our interdependence is critical to our well-being and ability to thrive. “No democracy, and indeed no society,” says Putnam, “can be healthy without at least a modicum of this resource.  What can we do?  Putnam argues that America could be civically restored by encouraging adults to socialize, join more groups, or volunteer more in the community. Another way he suggests is through teaching children the value of social connection.  The APA is working on an agenda to integrate social relationships into current public health priorities in a manner that is more consistent with the empirical research, which involves ""directing resources, time, and energy to those issues that are deemed most critical and practical to address” . Some of the APA's recommendations include:  Greater priority on research and resources directed toward prevention efforts, education, public health policy and interventions. Greater emphasis on social skills training for children in schools. Doctors should be encouraged to include social connectedness in medical screening. People should be preparing for retirement socially as well as financially (many social ties are related to the workplace.) community planners should include shared social spaces that encourage gathering and interaction. All human beings desire to thrive, as do societies. Perhaps instead of moving further and farther away from one another—geographically, socially, and politically—a better option would be to lean closer together. Ultimately, if we are to learn to live with one another, we must come to the realization that we cannot live without each other.  References  Putnam, R.D. (2000).

The Fourth Step does Indeed address this, albeit in a subtle, compassionate and realistic manner. ""... the exact nature of our wrongs..."" The word ""exact"" is extremely loaded for anyone who has gone deeper into this step. It was worded this way, I believe, in awareness of the vast range of participants, in their variations of consciousness, self-awareness, personal history. Yet invited one to take it all the way if they could and/or wanted to.  The exact nature would include the origins of our"" defects of character"". In the 1940s when the 12 Steps were written (received), psychology was still  young. The very idea that character and personality formation were in large part due to our early environment was not currency as it is now. The risk of disturbing the myths of perfect parents and childhood happiness was great, and could have derailed a prospective healing and sobriety. The Twelve Steps left no stoned unturned, is the ultimate home-grown modern wisdom to this day.

@Mo-pm2oi,"I get tired quickly when I read. Been this way my whole life. I figured out after decades, that ... I have floaters in my vision. These floaters cause a continuous distraction for my brain, which I have to overcome ‘continuously’ in order not to loos my focus on wgat I read. Reading takes allot of time for me, always has and probably always will. So, I too love to read, but... I don’t do it so much. I fall asleep, for it takes allot of energie to refocus on the substance of a text, after each moment I’m distracted by my floater vision. I also got high pitched ringing added to the distortion of my senses. Somehow, I feel that the whole world, all life... is just passing me by, while all I can do is witness those who try fix things and feel ... some kind of joy, love and a bit of pride, for not all of us are unable to relate to the suffering of others.  Nobody asks to be born. We have to respect each other and recognize our strengsts AND weaknesses.  It took me decades to become aware to why I don’t read.   So anyone who’s got floaters and doesn’t read much anymore, just know it’s okay.  I am someone who would understand your perspective.   Try to consider yourself a human being, no matter how far you get left behind. We all need information at some point to move forward. Forgive those who set us off on the wrong path.  Brain gets stressed and that can cause a lifetime of struggle with addiction.  Love yourself and don’t be sad, cause your reading ability is slow and you get tired quickly. Pushing yourself to get a degree is not always the best choice. Aim for a sustainable job and keep your body healthy.  Sooner or later, the proper information will be brought forward by good people. People like mister Gabor and those who upload his video’s or video’s regarding the topic of human survival as a species in the cosmos.  May God protect us from harm and heal us from all unnecessary the hurt we caused each other, based on false and faulty reasoning.  The kingdom of God is in all of us together. In the future that must comes, the more material things one has, the more he or she will want to share that with his or hers fellow man.  Theirs nothing more joyfull than to bring a smile to your brothers face, by lending him your bicycle (or car) for a day or two, while you change your routine.  Everything material, belongs to this realm (the cosmos). It’s an illusion that we ought to ‘own’ things so deeply. Much hassle could be avoided, if we just see the material world as it truly is (temporary).  Just felt like writing. Tired now.

@angelablackthorne3026,"There’s a lot of good information here, and good insights, but with all due respect Dr. Gabor Mate is showing the age of his medical degree. In the past fifteen years neuroscience has advanced significantly. Substance abuse disorder is a brain disease caused by a combination of identified genetics and brain dysfunction caused by repeated dramatic dopamine surges resulting in feedback loops in two  important brain areas that result in a shutdown of the prefrontal cortex creating a condition called “hypofrontality” that impairs judgement, decision making and behavioral control. He’s right about so much but wrong on the science there. That’s crucial. If you want to hear a thorough explanation of how addictive and compulsive behaviors are a medical illness as well as an emotional  illness watch “Pleasure Unwoven” by Dr. Kevin McCauley. The things Dr. Mate describes don’t explain why childhood trauma makes some people addicts and others not, the answer is because of genes and gene expression. Much like Type II Diabetes. This is important because addicts feel shame and feel that they are bad people. Not everyone with the genetics for Type II diabetes become diabetic either, and yet you can’t become diabetic unless you have that predisposition. That is why so many trauma victims do not ever become addicts.",6년 전,0,

@garyweglarz,"Actually Dr. Mate is quite up to speed on the research and the neurobiology of trauma in terms of the developing child's brain changes, epigenetics and trauma research (The ACE Study, etc.).  The physiological changes produced by childhood trauma both wire the brain in patterns different than non-trauma experiences, AND can produce epigenetic changes that can pass to offspring.  To take this complex mix we are just beginning to better understand and do the typical Western reductionistic medical model routine of labeling something a ""disease"" strikes me as rather bizarre.  The ACE Study shows quite clearly the very powerful dose/response connection between multiple childhood trauma exposures and increased incidence of adult addiction later in life.  The medical model of addiction you are referring to is actually the ""old model"" of addiction that is being challenged powerfully by a constellation of cutting edge research from the ACE Study, to the ongoing neurobiological research into the impacts of trauma on the developing brain, and including breaking research in epigenetics.    Having worked as a therapist in addiction I am deeply grateful to the fact that we are better understanding the connection between childhood trauma and adult addiction.  The traditional medical model of ""addiction"" basically ignores childhood trauma as if the fact that all the neurobiological impacts on the brain mean nothing, and simply ""stopping drinking"" or ""stopping using meth"" will change everything.  I can assure you it does not.  One addiction is simply replaced by another unless trauma is addressed and people learn new ways to self-soothe, to manage stress, to deescalate triggering events, related to the impacts of that past trauma.  Mate's discussion of this around the 51 minute mark are right on the money with the current research.",6년 전,1,

Perhaps in some cases nothing (or very little) was actually missing, but the craving comes from a lack of balance and/or unwillingness to take personal responsibility for seeking balance and attempting to heal addictive/impulsive behaviour?

@whotelakecity2001,"I have a similar story with discovering or uncovering the real family history.  My family's official version is that my maternal grandparents met in Dachau (in Dachau!) when they were sent to Germany from different countries ""for labour"". They both survived (and died) holocaust without having that word in their vocabulary. My grandmother survived Stalin's hlodomor (before the word was coined) and  Hiyler's holocaust without knowing it.  In my thirties, I picked up some pieces of the puzzle and put it together. The biggest one being watching the german movie ""Nowhere in Africa"" when the main protagonist tells his wife that the short telegram she got from her sister telling her we (sister and mother) are being sent for labour to Poland for work means DEATH and how her sister wanted her to know... A fight breaks out between the two of them because she is a spoiled hausfrau and has hard time grasping the reality and he is losing patience with her.  Yelling at her ""Your sister wanted you to know. "" and envying her because he doesn't know what happened to his father.  They escaped Germany just in the nick of time and managed to land ""Nowhere in Africa"", today's Kenya, because they didn't have any money to emigrate anywhere else. That is when something clicked in me. Being sent ""for labour"" to Dachau, a concentration camp is not normal part of grandparents history.  My grandparents didn't know...It's like surviving the school residential system or Magdalene asylums but probably worse without knowing the term and being able to own and tell your own story and experience of it.",6년 전,0,

@cvrki7,I really wish I could ask Gabor a question in regards to the “gut feeling” suppression that he illustrated with a child being angry at their parents for not getting a cookie. Because I’m genuinely curious.  Is there not also a risk in just being “patient” with your child’s anger while they’re throwing a fit in that you never teach them how to properly regulate their visceral reactions. To a point where they grow up still throwing fits when they don’t get what they want as adults?...I can’t help but feel like that’s what we’re dealing with currently in Universities with the students getting triggered by every little thing and bully the faculty into getting what they want by throwing fits. The same students that also account for higher rates of anxiety and depression than ever before.  I don’t believe that unlimited tolerance and compassion as a parent will develop a healthy and resilient child. Some discipline needs to be enforced. The question is how to do that without having the child disconnect from their gut feelings.  I’m curious what everyone thinks.,7년 전,0,

@EveningTV,"Its easy to start wondering even where to begin chipping away at all that is involved here.  When my son overdosed 2 years ago I decided to work backwards starting with addiction treatment reform.  It blows me away that this antiquated system is being sold to the public as a solution for addiction when at best its a temporary respite from active substance abuse, a chance for the body and brain and worried loved ones to relax, but if they aren't getting any 'treatment"" for the reason they began using in the first place I don't know why anyone would expect outcomes to be any different than the almost complete failure that these programs are.  At worst, they are exploitative scams where it is possible to pay outrageous fees only to leave in worse shape than you arrived.  In 4 years my son had been through 7 programs ranging in length from 30 days to 9 months and in most cases, especially those where he stayed multiple months trauma treatment was listed allegedly included and it was discussed, and also the need for it was confirmed by thieir own psychiatrist, yet shortly before my son died I realized that he had never received any treatment for trauma besides drugs to manage the symptoms! So, in other words exactly what he was doing on his own and the very reason he came to treatment to stop.  He was everything Dr. Mate described very sensitive, a wonderful songwriter and musician who wanted to live and he succeeded in every program in full compliance but he still died .  It is especially tragic when people are willing to do anything to help themselves, and there are therapies available, and even with the luxury of time they didn't manage to bring in EMDR, teach him EFT or anything for trauma, but in addition to go to countless 12 step meeting you know what he did get to do?  He got to jump out of an airplane, pet  horses and fly on a trapeze, but he didn't get any help with the core reason he used drugs to begin with.  How is this even allowed to go on?   This was an excellent interview!  Thanks to you both.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@carl8568,"Quality interview. As far as using psychedelics under the watchful eye of an adept, as Gabor suggests, the issue is finding such a trustful adept in this world, and preferably someone that you don't need to jump on a plane to visit. You could chance it and take it with a friend who you think may be up to the task, but if they haven't dealt with their own internal pain it could easily go pear shaped.   I've been using psilocybin and Ayahuasca methodically for a couple of years, alone, and seen good results. Dose needs to be carefully measured every time. It is definitely risky, but taking these compounds in large group/ceremonial settings with unfamiliar people at an unfamiliar dose is also risky, if not more risky. Especially if it includes hundreds of years of cultural baggage via the popular South American shamanic setting. I don't deny i've bitten off more than I can chew a number of times- having sedatives on hand may save you from going insane. It's obviously best to try and avoid that scenario until you have done a shit tonne of shadow work and are ready to take the leap into nothingness with little resistance and then you realise it felt like going insane only from the perspective of the conceptual mind. If you are using for deeply spiritual purposes, at some stage you are just naturally going to bite off more than you can chew, in that there ain't gonna be a person there with which to chew anything.",7년 전,0,

@debsvanefelt3990,"What a really nourishing conversation this is - I've been a trauma therapist working with children and families for over 30 years - it's very reassuring to see how progress is being made in understanding the impact of trauma on human consciousness... which clarifies how our early experiences with trauma functionally shape what and how we perceive life.  And I'm not talking about just traumatic events - I'm including living on a traumatogenic planet which has been reeling with planeatry and species (as in the human species) catastrophobia that's been buried in our collective unconscious, and carried in our DNA, for a very, very long time.  I love Barbara Hand Clow's understanding about this too. Having been engaged in 'talk therapy' (within many creative and alternative modalities), personally I've found working with sound and frequencies to be faster, and more efficient - we can train our brains away from over-developed stress circuitry, and into states of consciousness connected to empathy and deep creativity, profound relaxation and compassion... and step into our own personal potential. That's how we create change on our planet.   Thanks for such a deep and wonderful conversation about what underlies human suffering.",7년 전,29,

@antheahubanks2004,"Thanks, Tim, for doing and offering freely this interview. Gabor Mate is an amazing human being, doctor/healer, and inspirer of others to seek their own healing.   My ears perked when I heard Tony Robbins name mentioned in this interview. When this interview was recorded, Tony Robbins had not yet opened his mouth and inserted both feet as he did this past weekend.   Men like Gabor and Tim (and many others) will hopefully call this out. Men like Robbins who make mistakes of this magnitude then sweep them under the rug need to be willing to publicly show remorse and apologize. This shaming and labeling of people/women who are finally speaking out about their #MeToo experiences pertaining to sexual abuse and harassment is cruel and very sad -->  (see video linked in this article https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/business/tony-robbins-me-too-apology.html).   Robbins is quite misguided for all his tall-man bluster. He attempted to backpeddle (note his statement at the above NYTimes link). Based on what Robbins wrote after being called out  on twitter, it appears he has not viewed the very video showing what he actually said and did in front of a live audience. The part where he explains his reasons to not hire good-looking women is particularly disturbing and shows Robbins is fairly clueless about his own ignorance relating to patriarchy, capitalism, and power structures.   My hope is that this mega-rich 7-foot man-god will be open to hearing from wiser men like Gabor and Tim where he is wrong and how to correct his error in thinking/feeling. Hopefully, the man-god will get some sensitivity training and offer a proper, heartfelt apology.   Robbins appears to not know that to be vulnerable shows ultimate strength. Robbins performance and weak response shows there is a scared little boy hiding inside his skin. I wonder if he has read Gabor Mate's book, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, or any other of Mate's great books? One can only hope Robbins will get around to it.",7년 전,10,

@findingjoy4725," @barbaralenox7092  Yes, sometimes this can happen.  It may be the frequencies aren't the right ones for you.  But often I've experienced the frequencies I use can dislodge a block in me, and this can create discomfort when I resist letting it go.  For sleeping, I really like dolphin and whales singing - it's so gentle, and I wake up feeling calm.  Maybe keep trying til you find what works?  Sending you blessings on your journey.",5년 전,0,

@antheahubanks2004,"Hi Karen. Yes, Robbins has a massive reputation here and usually has positive things to say. The way he presents his message is a bit over the top at times. This just goes to show how deep run the roots of internalized sexism. I suspect Robbins would not see himself as sexist, and for the most part he is likely one of the more open to change guys out there. The internalization process that oils the wheels of patriarchy and capitalism makes it hard to change. I discovered that I, too, have some internalized sexist beliefs about women. I learned this when I earned my college degree recently (English lit, sociology and gender studies). As a woman in my 60's, I grew up with a lot of indoctrination that I work daily to be aware of and to hold myself accountable for changing. That's the key...being willing to change and seeking new information when we discover that the initial information was incomplete and/or inaccurate. All of this leads to the suffering that Gabor Mate discusses so eloquently :)",7년 전,1,

Definitely not by talk therapy. it's great to hear more professionals come along side to give more exposure to the neuroscience and ability to create new neural pathways in the brain and therefore increase resilience and heal the person. Different approaches than Mates' but same science and high efficacy especially for PTSD, anxiety, depression, etc. Working with trauma in a neurobiological way to discharge excess energy in the nervous system by completing thwarted fight/flight/freeze cycles creates a regulated nervous system with fewer symptoms and more room for resilience and joy.

@nextlevelintactivism8195," @Optymystykal   A Nurse’s Experience  https://peacefulbeginningsrosemary.wordpress.com/misc-articles/a-nurses-experience/  “I received a Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing 6 years ago. First semester clinicals were in a nursing home where I saw all sorts of things that would make others’ stomachs queasy. Second semester clinicals were on the Medical/Surgical floor of a hospital where people are being treated for everything under the sun. Things that smelled, things that oozed, things that would make the regular person faint of heart. Decubitus ulcers that were inches deep, things coming out of or put into all orifices of the body. Nothing made me queasy.   “Third semester clinicals were in Obstetrics – my chosen field of practice. I was so excited!! At this point in my life, like many others, circumcision was what you did, it was no big deal and I had no clue how it actually happened. My OB professor showed us a video of a circ in class and the baby’s tortured cries made me so sad. But it wasn’t until I was in the hospital for a clinical day that I truly grasped the torture that baby boys go through with this unnecessary surgery.”   “I witnessed the mutilation of 2 newborn baby boys that day. I watched them get strapped to the Circumstraint board, draped, pacifiers and sugar water shoved in their mouth and betadine spread on their most intimate parts. One of the boys’ fathers stayed to watch the procedure and while holding the pacifier in his mouth kept saying to his son “It’s OK, be a man!”   “I stood there, watching, horrified unable to move. This is the one and ONLY time in my nursing school career and one and ONLY time in all of my years as a nurse that I felt nauseous, lightheaded, and almost had to sit down, sweat beaded on my forehead and pupils dilated.”   “Then I had to watch it again. There is a sound that the cutting of foreskin with scissors makes (the plastibell method was used for both procedures I saw) this sound is seared into my brain and mind and will be for the rest of my life, and when I take myself back to that moment I can hear it and I get nauseous and sweaty all over again. The baby’s cries are also etched into my memory and I will never be able to watch another circumcision video or be in a doctors office when one is being performed, and I will never be able to work at a hospital that performs them because I could not mentally take it.”   “One thing about the circumcision debate that I have always had trouble with and still cannot rectify in my mind is how a provider and a nurse/assistant can watch these surgeries repeatedly and continue doing them. I understand that once you’ve done/seen a few you can become numb to the procedure. But I don’t think I could ever become numb to watching and hearing that… Ever.”   “I feel very fortunate that the hospital I work at as a Labor & Delivery RN does not provide circumcisions in hospital. They are only done out of hospital at pediatricians offices around a week old. I do everything I can to educate my patients who are having baby boys the fact that circumcision is unnecessary, cosmetic as well as very painful to their perfect baby boy. I can tell some parents shut down their brains when I start talking about it however, I have saved a few babies and at least planted seeds in other parents minds.”   “Being an RN in this field of work is on the front lines of the circumcision battle and it’s a tough gig to be exposed to people making this irrevocable decision for their son. I only hope that my small part in spreading the word will assist with male genital mutilation becoming illegal someday.”   “All 3 of my boys are intact and I’m so happy I learned about circumcision in nursing school.”    A mom & nurse",4년 전,1,

He was already crying when we strapped him down. Anyway we got him some sugar water and then start the block. He screamed so much during his block (it's lidocaine in the most sensitive area on a baby boy... it hurts) he started throwing up. We wiped him off and turned his little face to the side but couldn't unstrap him. During the procedure he wouldn't stop screaming and eventually he went dead silent with his eyes open but not moving. From the screaming he has an episode of shock and started shaking like he was having a mini seizure and breathing went shallow. We gave him some oxygen through a mask so the doctor could finish what she was doing and finally after everything was done checked his oxygen levels which were only at a 46. We upped his oxygen and I picked him up and gave him as much cuddles as I could. He was still shaking but breathing improved once his oxygen levels reached 98 we got him dressed again and swaddles him, gave him a formula bottle (he was supposed to be breastfed) and a pacifier and brought him to his mom and told her 'he was so brave he didn't cry a bit'.

Again because of nurse training I was only scheduled to assist with two. Both babies were for the same doctor, so I set up two sets of equipment as well as two boards in the room. I wheeled both boys in and strapped them down side by side. Both began to cry, feeding off the noise of the other. Then the doctor came in with two residents trailing behind him, all were garbed.    ""Brief introductions were made, and I was informed that they would be watching the procedure today. The doctor disinfected the first boy and then draped a cloth over him. He then went over the instruments with the trainees and then went to work. He slowly inserted the probe between the boys foreskin and moved it in a circular motion, all the while explaining to the residents.    ""Apparently satisfied, he pushed the skin back and made a vertical slit with a pair of scissors very slowly, explaining the procedure to the doctors. He was taking twice the usual time all because he needed to explain things!! The baby bucked and pulled at the restraints, but to no avail.    ""The doctor then exposed the bleeding red glans further pointing at it and making more medical observations. The two trainees looked on very intently. The doctor then selected a bell and placed it over the glans, and pulled the skin back over. He placed the rest of the clamp around it, inserted the safety pin and and screwed the clamp tight.    ""Now at this point when there are two or more babies, the doctor would begin to clamp the next one. Instead he just waited and discussed the procedure with them. When I commented on this, he just said ""One of these two will do him after right?"" And he looked around and winked at them. UGH!!    ""After about 5 minutes of pause, the doctor took the scalpel and as the residents looked intently on, he began to make a circular cut. He stopped halfway and did some more talking and then continued on as the baby wailed.    ""The doctor then removed the clamp and bell, revealing a completely exposed glans. The doctor then made a visual inspection and pointed out some details. He ran his finger around the glans, oblivious to the sensitivity of it and the cries of the infant and then told them to do the same. ( This was to check against cysts of some sort I guess). He made more observations about how much exposure of the glans is acceptable and pointed details out.    ""He then picked up the scissors to remove the frenulum, pointing out what he was about to do. He made a snip and the baby bucked in pain. But instead of going through with it, he stopped halfway and made another talking point!!!! The baby was in AGONY and I wanted to stop the pain, but I could not.    ""He then snipped again, completing the circumcision. God Almighty. The circumcision had taken 25 minutes instead of the usual 10-15. All for training!!! The baby lay limp in the restraints, exhausted from his ordeal. I bandaged him up and tried to comfort him the best I could.   ""But that is not the end Oh no! The doctor turned to the next baby and asked ""Which one of you wants to try?"" One of the residents stepped forward and in front of the whimpering boy.    ""He sterilized the area with ointment following the doctors example. Then he began separating the foreskin from the glans with the probe, but haltingly, looking up for assurance from the trainer who just nodded.    ""The boy began screaming, but none of the doctors took notice. He made a dorsal cut and placed the bell over the glans. He attached the clamp as the doctor monotoned and coached ""Good, now draw the foreskin up, a little further, great! Now secure it with the pin...""    ""The trainee fumbled here inserting the pin through only part of the foreskin. The doctor stopped him: ""No, through both sides, take it out and try it again."" The poor baby had already been stabbed once and now it was happening a second time!!    ""The trainee did as was told and secured the clamp, tightening the bolt as the baby screamed. He let go as the clamp did its work, and the doctor said ""That wasn't too difficult, now all you have to do is...."" and he went on to describe the rest of the procedure which I am sure you do not need to hear.   ""Once the 5 minutes were up, the foreskin was excised, and the bell removed. This boy had been scalped!!! There was no skin or slack at all left. Just an exposed glans on a shaft which stuck straight up and down, such was the tension.    ""As the doctor examined the work he just said, ""Its a little tight there I guess, next time don't take off quite as much but he should be fine.""    ""Next the student tried to snip the frenulum. He made the cut as the baby screamed in pain. The doctor took a look and said. ""You missed a bit, do it again."" And the rest of the frenulum was removed from the screaming boy.    ""The doctor said ""Well that's it for the procedure. You all understand it?"" They nodded eagerly. ""Well, then I'll see you both tomorrow, and you'll get a try,"" he said pointing to the one who had not performed the circumcision. They all left and I bandaged up the screaming boy, and wheeled them both back to the nursery. Another days work done.   ""Now I apologize for the graphic content of this post, and I do not wish to offend anyone. But I feel that the best way to stop this is for parents to hear the truth. These babies were put through a tremendous amount of excess pain due to training that their parents will never know about. Seeing is believing. Thank you for listening."" ~Nurse Sandy",4년 전,3,

@MelanieSakowski,"Brilliant two humans hash out addictions:  Human nature is one that uses the protective coping mechanism of dissociation and avoidance when we face trauma or pain.  ""Trauma"" is a loss of self. A disconnect from our present states because the situation is so overwhelming and shocking that we choose survival instead of fear and pain. What then is recovery?  To ""re-cover"" something is to re-find it. Recovery is therefore a reconnection with the self. Gabor talks about how the very meaning of ""yoga"" (""yo""-""ga: ""mind""-""body"") is that of connection with oneness; source, self, mind, body, whatever.  ""Depression"": to ""de-press"" something is to push it down. Depression is therefore an avoidance of feelings.  Instead of asking ""why the addiction""? We look at ""why the pain""?  Also: genetics plays less of a role in addictions than does upbringing. Back to my bread and butter which is the ""stress"" factor in health; a stressed out mother will have high levels of cortisol in her placenta, transferring this to the baby. This child will have significantly more issues from birth.  Whoa. Phenomenal, albeit long, watch.

@amandapoyner8141," @riniks112  This is late in the conversation, but just to add a perspective here if that is ok. Well … I'm doing it anyway, lol.  You will find that you played or still play a role in the family dynamic. You are ….. to each of your siblings, parents, etc. So, when you are questioning the fundamental workings of you as a person, then voicing what you are thinking to your family, it will naturally bring up all their resistance. Resistance to change, to losing you as that 'persona' that they rely on so that they can keep from having to make those fearful changes for themselves, or the foreboding thought of taking responsibility for their own lives (if you have been the scapegoat for instance). Ok … it's the natural defensive, mostly unconscious reaction to you wanting to talk about these things and potentially get them all looking into that Pandora's box. You poked the nest of spikey, defensive, shadowy things. This is why it takes so  much courage and perseverance to awaken and heal and individuate … because it will mean loss of the way things have been, even while bringing you, eventually, to a freedom to be who you truly are … it is really an epic journey, and takes an inner hero to commit to it.",6년 전,2,

To live fully in the present, all of the past has to die. Not forgotten, but forgiven, integrated, healed and released. To feel everything so fully that there is nothing left to carry forward, except you, present, here and now. Finally … fully human. To feel it all and be free of any left over contaminated experience, or relating and to know who (and what) you truly are; this is freedom. We each find our way through this inner landscape.

@kurtklingbeil6900," @amandapoyner8141  wow Great summation I usually feel quite sad listening to Gabor Mate.. I am struck by the depth of his insights and their truth while simultaneously recognizing my almost complete failure to apply any of these insights or methods of personal inquiry to my own life/self. I am into my 60s wanting to do some kind of psychological salvage operation... been poking away at it for a decade, but never gained any traction. Introspection always leads to emotional churn with no insights nor resolution whatever. I feel doubly defective since I have no awareness of how I was traumatized - either by the presence of ""bad"" stuff or the absence of ""good"" stuff. I feel stuck in the zone between being so clueless that my narcissism is fully intact and causes no discernible grief, and so cluefull that my narcissism yields to introspection and shifts if not resolves. He talks about not really being able to live until one has confronted death - and that psychedelic experiences  can help get there. I engaged in medicine journeys specifically to find out what is broken and how to fix it, but haven't encountered death or ego-dissolution, or love or oneness with everything - any of the things people describe... just my self-centered self...",5년 전,1,
@amandapoyner8141," @kurtklingbeil6900  - The journey always brings us into direct conflict with our own shadow and sometimes the only thing one can do, is to feel … including surrendering to not knowing, to just feeling the 'churn' … the knowing comes, gradually; often when we stop trying. Just that act of internal surrender seems to unlock the resistance. And, I am thinking that if you were truly so narcissistic, you would not feel the 'churn' and that lack of feeling most likely points to dissociation, so that memories and feelings and connections to 'why', 'what', 'when' are hard to make. For me, a lot of it was past life, but I didn't get to that material until I had dealt with the patterns in this one. Maybe, it's hard to be here at all, so we feel lost between worlds and reluctant to be in the body; we can be ghosts in life.

@MarcusEMunya,"SpockCanYouSaveme I honestly don't believe he does, I think his arguments against say, identity politics are as sound to me as a self proclaimed liberal as they are to a conservative.   The only thing is that there seems to be a vacuum of  liberal media who's creators are willing to have an honest, open and dare I say progressive rather than stagnant or regressive  conversation about this among other things with Jordan peterson because of a misplaced belief that Jordan Peterson is a threat. His interviews with vice and channel 4 were   That is possibly with the exception of joe Rogan (assuming you don't include him in the alt right lol) that srilankan looking Dutch dude who's name I can't remember and Russel Brand of all people to my knowledge but even he hasn't really challenged Peterson as we might expect given he's a comedian after all.  Given Jordan approaches the political and theological landscape from a psychological point of view he emphasises the need for both ways of thinking as I mentioned earlier.   For example he advocates the need for free competition a conservative individualist libertarian idea.   But he makes clear that in order to have a balanced society you must provide a safety net or solid socialist foundation to which poor young men in particular can cling and climb when and if they find themselves down and out. This is vital he says to avoid a critical mass of these men, who inevitably make up a large proportion of society from rising up and destroying a hierarchy that they perceive to be unjust.   This socialist foundation also gives them the opportunity to rise up in the hierarchy (hope) and ensures that those with abilities and talents valuable to society are not lost to undue poverty, and they can share their talents with society with steady personal growth and contribution.  This, at a very low resolution is Petersons political message and isn't controversial.  What I find suspicious is the fact he fails to use his intellect to challenge the pseudo intellectual, inflammatory and dangerous Rhetoric of personalities such as Ben Shapiro and Manopoulos in the same way he shuts down sjws.",7년 전,2,

Agree on the meaning rant. Neurotic, narcisstic, depressed and (likely) xenophobic are character traits too and JBP has talked about all of these. My big question is - could you link to some lectures from which you\v picked up what you'v picked up - i'v watched him a lot and most times come out quite opposite conclusions from what he says than you.

@edgarallerman9187,"@vaultsjan By understanding what Gabor Maté is saying you can understand how opposite Peterson's ideas are. Peterson believes in social adaptiveness, the child's identity needs to develop as a reaction to social interaction, Peterson emphasized many times that the parent's over-protectiveness will create antisocial children who will suffer in life. This is a gross distortion of reality as the child can only experience the safety it needs with the parents that allows it to have a balance between introspection and extrospection necessary for a healthy sense of 'self', without that 'self' (or connection to the gut self) the child would just learn socially adaptive skills which could result in codependent behavior or NPD. It's not surprising Peterson takes this position when you realize it hits much closer home to the Humanist agenda who believe that the next step in human evolution is to institutionalize paternal care (eugenics). Don't forget that Peterson is a Darwinian and a evolutionary theorist, they do have their own ideological school, if you make yourself familiar with those ideas then you know what to pay attention to when Peterson is saying things or not saying things. http://nwo.11syyskuu.net/UNESCO.pdf",7년 전(수정됨),9,
@vaultsjan,"Yeah, so next link is from Alex Jones? Could you point to link where JBP says that parental care should be instutionalized?  Parents can be overprotective, this claim is not in contradiction that children need parental care and love. Also when claiming that child needs to develop through social interaction (outside of family) - this claim is true or false depending on age and what stage given child is. I agree (my partner works  in the daycare and has studied it, she also was stay home mom) that sense of self starts from love and care, but there are more stages after that where children will start to become more and more independent and self-aware, care taker and parents response is to help their children on doing it.  Darwin and evolutionary theory are powerful theories not so sure what it has to do with childrens development in what we are talking here. It is ok for 2/3 year old not able to resolve conflicts with other children but 3-4-5 and up has to learn step by step with little guidance and support that they can work out the social interaction problems (other kid takes somebodys shovel, you as parent do not go and ask other kid to give it back or why they took it but you suggest themselves to do it).",7년 전,0,

@edgarallerman9187,"Peterson as an evolutionary theorist has a duty to take a stance in his views on the POLITICAL theories of Julian Sorell Huxley specially since he has expressed a potential interest to go into politics, it's mainly the failure of all of his interviewers who never seem to be critical in anyway.  I think we agree on the role of parenting, in the first 4-5 years a child should have limited exposure to peer influences but Peterson was doing 'time out' training on his son when he was 2 years old, in this phase learning capability only involves classic and operant conditioning which means that the child learns that attachment and love are conditional to behavior and repetitive abandonment anxieties at that age can develop into PTSD and developmental problems (Gabor talks about that a lot). The natural process would be for the child to feel safe and from thereon develop exploratory instincts, as long as the child remains anxious it will not develop those exploratory interests. If the parents are narcissisticly abusive or over protective and neurotic the child will be 'psychologically challenged', I would not use the word 'pathological' as that would require us to make some assumptions on the meaning of life.",7년 전(수정됨),2,

@vaultsjan,"re video - i was trying to point out that independence/co-dependence is a problem that parents/children have to solve. I'd say that starting from 2-3 years children should start with having more and more social interactions with other kids. However, i also think parents should also control/limit who their children interact with even at 10/13 years old. Its gradual process. On time out thing i agree, this seems premature indeed.  re evolutionary theory and JBP and politics - absolutely no, same way as any physicist that wants to go to politics should not have duty to apologize for atomic bombs or whatever. I'd say there are reasons to be very critical of JBP but admiring Darwin or evolutionary theory is not that. Evolutionary theory was hijacked by (quite)some nutjobs but Its a powerful tool (hey, it actually helps the development of new treatments and medicine).

The real problem is that the humanist in it's pursuit of order and 'end to suffering' has no regard for ethical and moral boundaries like the ones that are faith based, traditional and 'unscientific'. If I were an interviewer I would ask Peterson to comment on Aldous Huxley's view of the future:  “An impersonal generation will take the place of nature's hideous system.

I wonder what negative personality traits would show up in the result if you stated you wanted to do some traveling and find yourself. That's another thing with the personality tests, this is not science, he has drawn so many inferential conclusions about these tests that are speculative but it's his drive for ORDER that makes him want to categorize everything and everyone, obviously with consequences for people in those categories, it's so creepy and unlike anything that we have seen in politics.",7년 전(수정됨),1,
@sameelatif,"there are many ways ones perception can be blinded/distorted/diverted/translated which would be varying degrees of ""involuntary"" behaviour, and when we strive to reduce ignorance to realistic ideas in ourselves we are minimizing the involuntary behavioural consequences of either holding incomplete viewpoints or lacking thereof. So the dependency on viewpoints being aligned with the reality you inhabit is a constant and has nothing to do with being infantile, its an ongoing process, if it wasn't an ongoing process we'd be ideologues. Look at it this way (i raise dogs lol and i like the analogies), you don't actually ""train"" a dog to walk on a leash  on good behaviour.. instead you simply walk.. and correct any misbehaviour before it has a chance to flourish into a full action / change of mindstate, its all done as you go along and it is quite literally a ""balancing"" act, especially so with the initial moments (just the same way we must balance our selves)  Secondly, youre not thinking he wants to legislate and enforce the idea of finding life meaning are you lol? dude he just teaches, if we want to judge his character on the respect for the integrity of the established laws that work, we have our example and its the reason he even exists to us to begin with, by no evident intention of himself either. The proposition given for happiness is as a consequence of living a meaningful life, we know happiness is not achieved by simply looking for it therefore the idea of ""im gona find my own happiness somewhere dont tell me what happiness is"" is only part of the picture, the safest way to define would be ""happiness is achieved through balance within the mind and the body"", which doesnt take away ANY ability to find ones self. Lastly if... ""a sense of meaning"" (the words ""a sense"" indicating subjectivity) is what produces happiness or contentment, (as a consequence of a balanced phsyche) then its safe to assume a continued lack of contentment will 100% lead to resentment given the right amount of time...  and continued, sustained resentment WILL lead to pathology(or another word you like) which will indeed sorely affect your surroundings, even if only by way of you not existing in the capacity you should be by your own admission (which is exactly the epidemic you see today, which is exactly the reason why extremists of all beliefs are the ones we let fight for our issues to see who wins now, instead of being a strong majority of citizens)",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@michaelmethexis,SpockCanYouSaveme Gabor is a self proclaimed Marxist so he’s not beyond that paradigm but I do appreciate his wisdom. I disagree with him that we can social engineer trauma out of existence on the societal scale. It starts with parents taking personal responsibility at home which is Peterson’s message. Add/mix in Gabor’s idea of reducing trauma in that micro environment and I agree it can be done. You have take from both gentleman if you want to get a full picture.   Gabor has a good diagnosis but his prescription that we can eliminate trauma from the face of the planet is naive and idealistic.,6년 전,1,
@michaelmethexis,High Thoughts check back on some of his recent interviews. The alt-right does not like Peterson and a tone of his earlier followers are finding coming to realization that Peterson’s doesn’t like right wing identity politics as well. He’s been stating this repeatedly lately. He also said that if Kavanaugh was sworn in that he should step down. Not a right wing thing to say. This is because he feels that seeking peace is necessary if you have any sense and that the right and the left need each other. He’s said multiple times that it’s the tension between the two that keeps everything falling into tyranny or chaos. On his fairly recent podcast with Aubrey Marcus Peterson stated specifically that “if you have any sense you seek peace.” Hope this helps clear the air on any of alt right misconceptions about the man. ✌️,6년 전,0,
@michaelmethexis,"Breezy Bear That is one of the most important points that I forgot to mention. Peterson pulls people away from the alt right.

@Rick-zw7zv," @michaelmethexis  Even Hitler sought peace, order and an end to suffering, he just thought that killing the Jews was the best way to achieve that. Tyranny is excess order. Peterson's ideology is an ideology that is based on science, or rather, arguments deduced from scientific observations, this he calls 'truth', and that's how he ducks under the ideology radar detection, his arguments seem objective and stripped of cultural biases, they are called 'facts'. Obviously a skeptic would rip his arguments apart but that won't happen soon as his message of peace and order has a natural appeal to the palate of many lost souls who are disillusioned with the competitive free market society.",6년 전(수정됨),1,
@DavidJeromePutnam,"Great debate here, but you could create instant intuitive understanding and „mirroring“ of Peterson and Gabor, if they first both took Ayahuasca together.

Gabor reacted with ADHD, depression, book writing and addict care. To be continued.",6년 전(수정됨),2,
@Rick-zw7zv," @DavidJeromePutnam  You need to do some research on Ayahuasca, specially some of Jan Irvin's research that shows that the CIA and Tavistock society were behind the psychedelic propaganda and the counterculture revolution (look up Gordon Wasson and Aldous Huxley), they distorted many of the facts concerning the true nature of these substances which in fact acted like psychotic drugs which tribal natives used in combination with ecstasy rituals to fortify the 'group consciousness' and suppress the individual sense of morality and consciousness (usually before entering in brutal tribal conflicts). Maté has gone off the rail in that respect and judging by the druggies he lets into his circle (like Russel Brand) I'd say he's about a few years away of losing the plot. He already confessed to being a Marxist (collectivist) so he's well on his way.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
