@crossvinburn831,"For anyone that is curious, here are the three steps that are needed to get saved and be right with God who loved us all, for eternal life with him!  As everyone and anyone can get saved if they make the choice to do so! :[)  1-Admit you’re a sinner and be willing to turn from your own self righteousness to God.  Romans 3: 23 (KJB) “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”  2-Believe onto Jesus Christ, who being the only begotten Son of God He loved, died on the cross, was buried and resurrected for the full forgiveness of our sins, all as a freely given gift out of God’s genuine love towards us sinners.  Romans 5: 8-9 (KJB) 8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" 9.""Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.""  1 John 4: 9-10 (KJB) 9.""In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."" 10.""Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.""  1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB) 1.""Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2.""By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.” 3.""For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4.""And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”  3-Confess onto God, asking to be saved accepting this loving free gift of salvation, to start a new life of being born again, after being saved and forgiven from all your sins. :)  Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB) 9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 10.""For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."" 13.""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.""  John 3: 15-17 (KJB) 15.""That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life."" 16.""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" 17.""For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”  Ephesians 2: 8-9 (KJB) 8.""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:"" 9.""Not of works, lest any man should boast.”  Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB) 27.""And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"" 28.""So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”  Revelation 21: 8 (KJB) ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”  Romans 6: 23 (KJB) “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  (Lastly here is an example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.) “Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving. I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me.  I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ. I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins.  I trust in him alone to save me.  Nothing else.  Not my good works or anything else.  Only Jesus.  I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”",2개월 전,0,

@zap_sigma1,"It isn't racist at all. I'm from the projects & know that happens all the time (I have seen things.)  Guarantee those calling this ""racist"" are blasting rappers brag about murdering black men, shooting up local blk churches, robbing black owned businesses & disrespecting black women at top volume from their cars tho.  Rap about helping blk men grow, helping local blk businesses, being a faithful church member & living blk women won't cut it in the music industry. That's nice & all but if it ain't about sex, murder, drugs & violence, it ain't putting another Grammy on your mantle or making your money long.  Now, connect the dots. You telling me this isn't by design?  And it all lines the pockets of white liberals & fake Jews.  So, the real question is,  who's really the black faces of white supremacy, here, the one singing the song or the one who is ""offended?""

The United Kingdom company, Morgan McKinley with their artificial intelligence program that tried to teach me workplace skills then wanted to sell me off to some other company with the transition handle by the company LinkIn, which in comparison is like training a slave from one white man to another with a slave broker to facilitate the transaction. Does this program not see the similarities because no one made me aware of its implementation in my life. This program comprises every piece of property I have, and gives me money only for the program to take it and recycle it to the next month, that is why I spend everything, because the program just takes all of it away anyway. That means I am basically with no property to call my own, no money, being traded of from one program director to another, and I am Filipino. In what way the previous sentence doesn’t that sound like a Filipino slave in every way except the title?

This means Jesus paid the debt we owed but couldn’t pay. “For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” ‭‭(2 Corinthians‬ ‭5‬:‭21‬ ‭NKJV‬‬).

Obviously, the lyrics here are exaggerated to make the racist undertones obvious for comedic effect.    Still, each racial line has a double entendre. “Have Ourselves a Hangin’” on the surface means the boys will get together and hang out.

@CT-5555-7,I love how you put Republican when the south was vehemently democrat until fairly recently in US history. These are some old school country songs that democrats would sing. Peele himself made get out as a critique of white liberals. The new song you’re mentioning is talking about violent criminals. What’s wrong about referencing those events? They happened and it ended in innocents dying and billions of dollars in damage. This skit has absolutely nothing to do with that,1년 전,0,
@tonypringles2285, @CT-5555-7  yeah but lets be honest those democrats back then are republicans now,1년 전,0,
@VigilanteVegan," @CT-5555-7  But I’m only talking about “fairly recently.” Most people now who listen to country music and are racist are Republican. I don’t care about the semantics about the party names. Yes, democrats were racist back then. 👍🏼   Aldean’s song doesn’t target solely for being violent criminals. He’s referencing the riots because they’re black, because they’re probably left-wing, because they probably support Black Lives Matter. He has an agenda.   If Aldean didn’t have a bias here, then his “try that in a small town” would also target police who use excessive force (George Floyd), the Jan. 6 protest, even international terrorists.   Aldean is subtly and safely saying “if you’re black and you want to loot in a small town, we white Christian folk will shoot you with our big guns.” That’s the message he’s saying without directly saying it.

Until I'd get on the internet and see things like Fox news and realize these folks really are racist and believe just because they don't use derogatory terms in front of you, it somehow doesn't mean they aren't racist.

@evanmbiter,"God is love. We all fall short and sin. Love is just and merciful. Because God is loving He must judge sin, we all stand judged. Because God is merciful He provided a way out from under the weight of the law and for us to be regenerated. If we trust Jesus shed His sinless blood, died and rose from the grave He forgives us of our sins and gives us a new heart that wants to look God as our Father genuinely and delight in Him, freeing us from being slaves to sin. The rest is our mind catching up with that reality until He returns, or we die.  We aren't saved or kept saved by obedience. We can only be lost through unbelief (trusting in our own righteousness/forced intentions of obedience to be or remain saved) or blasphemy of the Holy Spirit (attributing clear works of God, healing/deliverance, to demons and Satan).  Commandments aren't have to's, they are what we do because we actually want God's direction and It's what fulfills us. You can't be born again without the desire to honor God. (Works based salvation and ""lawless Christians"" are both wrong.)  If it feels like a weight, burden, tension or strife, it isn't God. Inform the catholics, orthodox, and even many protestants who disguise their works based salvation as love or relationship, or leave and cut off from their teaching. We aren't under the law or ten commandments, but we want God's direction. (Jesus is God, the Son.) We love because He first loved us.",1년 전,0,

@agonzalez8924," @danepain  I'm not a savior, and if i were i would not be trying to save you. I don't need to gaslight you, the proof is already in pudding.  Gaslighting is what you do.  I'm gonna assume you're a black trump supporter; trump on average gets about 10% of the black vote.  That means 90% of everyone else sees what you see, and says naw that ain't for me.  But you, being in that 10% minority goes its not me its everybody else.  That's the real gaslighting my dude.  I couldn't care less if you were a black conservative or liberal.  But since you chose conservatism because it aligns with your world views, let me ask you a serious question.   Why did you choose trump?  There were several other republican candidates to choose from back in 2016.  There are several candidates to choose from right now, and they are all in favor of the same policies,  so why did you choose trump?",1년 전(수정됨),1,
@danepain,"@agonzalez8924  Look at you assuming that I support trump. I don't even like him nor Biden. I'm just saying that black people don't all think the same way you expect us all to think. It's funny when people blame white supremacists when a black person leans right in the slightest. Being a right winger doesn't automatically make somebody a hateful bigot anyway. There are plenty of left wingers who are extremely hateful people as well, but you don't wanna admit that.",1년 전,0,

Very opening line said: “Now I like honey and I like tea, but I don’t like n*ggers- no siree!”   Another line that comes later: “Cuz what the heck, you gotta be black to get a welfare check! And I’m broke no joke! Got no nickel for a Coke! And the NAACP can’t wait to get their hands on n*gger hating’ me!  “J*gaboo, j*gaboo where are you?” “I’m hiding’ from the white man it’s a-true!”    That’s all I can remember since I haven’t heard it in 5 years, but despite hating the context, damn if it wasn’t an ear worm.

@akhiuqhbqoggq," @hinata1ize  thanks for answer. But still, why hanging is relevant to racist thing?",2년 전,1,
@blitzn00dle50," @akhiuqhbqoggq  hanging references a lynching, which was a type of hate crime prevalent in the united states from the 1830s to the 1970s. they were usually extrajudicial killings of black people who were accused of a crime, and in the majority of cases that crime was later proven or confessed to be a false accusation. most victims of lynchings were hanged after being mutilated while still alive. you can read more about lynchings here:  Warning: the Wikipedia article has some incredibly violent depictions and photographs of real lynchings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@glp.1337,"@MsBea Bea Glad we first established the definition of racism. Let me remind you since it was more than 1 day ago: ""prejudiced against people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group"" Him agreeing with that stereotype = racism (by definition)   Now you are getting personal for no reason saying I don't want to see a black protagonist? Where did you get that preposterous idea? And yes of course I've watched ""Get Out"". Loved it, great movie.  Also, the prejudice you have about my knowledge in movie industry is again... getting personal for no reason. Try and stick to the topic/facts instead of attacking ones person. It doesn't become you.   Again, I am glad we established the definition of racism first. Because I actually agree with you on that part. But according to modern society, sadly it is not. It is the definition we both agreed upon. I wish it wasn't just stereotypical behavior but both you and me don't have a say in that.  (On a side-note, yes my nephew still has a very low opinion of an entire race. He didn't get married, he did have a child with said race. He could be considered a ""real"" racist old & new definition of the word)  I know the history and frankly would be amazed if people didn't know this history as it's been in our faces for the past decades. But you kind of missed the point. It was him talking about the stereotypes as if they are true => racism (by definition).   You can find the examples unconvincing. But I don't need to convince you, I just wanted to help you in the right direction. Whether you see it or not it doesn't matter, it might take some time. Or you might not see it at all.   I hope you keep thinking the way you do. I still do. As I've said, I agree more with your definition of racism than I do the modern definition. But sadly, the world sees these things differently now. I mean, just look at the people that called Joe Rogan a racist. It was basically for the same stuff I'm calling Jordan Peele a racist.",3년 전(수정됨),0,
@glp.1337,"@MsBea Bea We established the definition. I even gave you the chance to correct the definition which you didn't. Your intentions don't matter as there is no way to verify them.   Secondly, acknowledging stereotypical behavior exists is not racism. I agree. But when he says: ""I don't think so"" - quote, he is confirming he is agreeing with those stereotypes, not simply the existence of it. But also what they represent.   Lastly, it's a bit sad you claim to be condescending whilst failing to see the point being made. I will spell it out to make it more clear: I, personally don't believe Peele is a racist. As I also don't believe Joe is a racist. But the sad truth is, that my definition of racism (which is quite similar to yours) isn't the general view. People nowadays (as shown by the definition) have a new more radical / general definition of racism. Which is why the entire media was on board with calling Joe Rogan a racist. Again... I don't agree with that.  I wanted to show how ridiculous this is.   And you are correct, I made a mistake. I'm not a native English speaker, so I said wife. But it should have been fiancé, they broke up before getting married. I could've googled the word but I might have been a bit lazy. My bad.    But let's just end it here. I agree with you and your definition of racism, which you seem to have missed in the entire conversation. Just wanted to showcase how ridiculous this new definition is. To which I'm still technically correct to call Peele a racist. Even though I don't personally believe he is.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@Falcodrin," @YangYang-rh8uy  Has to do with the content. Hanging was used for lots of different people but the get the boys together part is indicating more of a lynching than a proper rule of law penalty of dead hanging. Lynching was typically group vigilante ""justice"" that in the US disproportionally involved racially motivated hangings. Similar acts of vigilante justice also included the tar and feathering. The symbolism behind it was even evident long ago. This is a quote from an interpretation of a work by Edgar Allen Poe. ""the notion of race is embedded in tar and feathers and gains a psychological connection to violent slave uprisings. The image of the tarred and feathered body as ape, for Poe, is the embodiment of white terror associated with the chaos of rioting and insurrection.""",3년 전,34,
@smallcheddar3012," @YangYang-rh8uy  hanging refers to hanging from a tree aka lynchings, which were commonly done to black people in the south by the Klu Klux Klan.

@_Mr.D," @Falcodrin  Well young man, the term ""Vigilante"" would in context imply that a CRIME had been COMMITTED for which others were trying to bypass due process so as to mete out their sense of justice.  From like 1880 to 1950 there were over 4000 Black people that were hung. Most of those had NOTHING to do with Vigilante JUSTICE because nothing illegal had transpired, it was straight up racial genocide, period.   In MY lifetime in the 60's if you were Black and in the South (For Yang. Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, Louisiana and some other areas) and you were in the wrong place at the wrong time you could very well end up being hung and it would have nothing to do with you breaking the law.  So I appreciate you trying to educate Yangyang, but I wanted to make sure that he understood that this had nothing to do with Blacks breaking any laws.   There was one time in my life as an adult in the 2000's that I felt that something like this was gonna happen to me, and I don't even live near the South.   But thanks",2년 전,4,
@Falcodrin, @_Mr.D  I mean I'm sure plenty of it was a breaking of the law but of unjust laws against them like mixed race marriage. Plenty of people were hanged for stuff like that afaik. Batman is a cautionary tale about what vigilante justice gets you. The answer is nowhere.,2년 전,0,
@_Mr.D, @Falcodrin  it's been a while since I looked at the information and if I remember correctly that number did not include hanging for committing a crime.

@Drelam," @_Mr.D  I live in Greenville, SC atm and was born in 89. Grew up all around Western North Carolina and Upstate South Carolina. I'd say covert racism will never go away unfortunately, humans are too tribal it happens all over the world, but I refer more to overt violent racism its something that is extremely rare in the south east in modern times, it saddens me to think that black people might be genuinely afraid to travel to the south in the past I absolutely understand it, but these days integration and the information age has changed things the south isn't as backwards and rural as many think as it once was the old racists southern dinosaurs are dying off and the young ones are ridiculed and shunned off enough to to let their true feelings be known.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@davidtaylor4989," @YangYang-rh8uy  I would say the tire swinging one is ""more difficult"" than the first one. In the United States, people refer to their friend's as homies (homeys) all the time, regardless of ethnicity. However, originally it was specifically meant to identify black people, but younger people today don't necessarily know that. So, you could easily miss the racial context of ""homies"" as someone whose say, under 40 years of age. The food choices don't help because in the south, where you would expect the singer to be, fried chicken and all those other things are, and always have been, extremely popular regardless of ethnic background (going back to slave days/post-reconstruction era nannies/food preparers being the ones making many meals for their masters / more affluent ""employers"").",2년 전,0,

@sr0917,I will try. When he thought of a tree and a rope he thought of a tire swing.  I see them around town and don't think anything of it. It's mainly for kids to play because the branches may not sustain an adult's weight.  But let's just say someone took the tire home to replace it but left the rope hanging from the branch in the meantime. Well if I walked by it the tree and the rope would make me think of something else. The singer finally saw that part of his lyrics.  Read the lyrics to Strange Fruit to help you get a better understanding of the symbolism behind the tree and rope.,3년 전,0,

If you are just showing a dislike towards a set of people because of their individual circumstances, regardless if those in said circumstance may be a higher percentage of a certen type of race isn't racist, its just being prejudice towards that set of people.

@christophermyers8157,"Triple speak.  This skit beats double speak by George Orwell as is implied by the main joke, but the sub-text is much deeper, which is why it is so shocking of a joke.  The racism is not conscious for most people on most levels, so does that make them racist or victims of not having freewill?  Freewill is the big joke here.  These comedians put one of the most cutting issues of our time in such a great context to make a brilliant joke.  But as Edward Bernays implies, if our sub conscious rules our conscious, how can we be implicit in the crime of racism rather than victims ourselves of the puppet master?  The fact that only certain races of people can make certain jokes is proof that the guiding hand of racism is alive and well, and being played like a poker game by the powers that be.

@mnpd3,"Anything can be racist, because the determination requires a subjective interpretation by the listener or viewer that conforms to their own bias and needs.  Something to remember is that while quid-pro-quo discrimination is illegal, anyone has the perfect right to think or not to think, like or dislike anything and everything.  That's a right, and it was guaranteed long ago only for those we disagree with - if we all agreed, there would be no need for the right.  Am I a racist?  I can't answer that just as you can't, because someone else gets to make that interpretation within their own framework.  And since active discrimination was outlawed many years ago, the movement is in need of a great many racists to take its place.  Improper thinking, as decided by others puts racists in great demand, so watch out if you don't want total ruination to befall you.

@jakobbauz," @DontGoToHell  Our opinions differ in every regard, I think: No ""white country"" is ""forced"" to do anything; countries with largely white populations are mostly democratic nations (and it's actually the less democratic ones like Russia that are less diverse). There isn't anyone telling white people ""to end"" their ""race and culture""; I don't even want to know in which corner of the internet I could find such ideas. ""Immigration and intermarriage"" are very common all over the world throughout history; there are exceptions that look like North Korea or Nazi Germany and the like, but every historian knows that people keep finding ways to 'mingle' even under such precarious circumstances. I think the goal of anti-racism is to fool the ever-racist human mind into forgetting its own stupidity long enough so that it may actually evolve (to put it poetically). No one knows how that is going to work, but the results of the last 50 years do look promising in some regards.  I'll give you that: Sometimes anti-racist advocates argue against white privilege in a way that's racist against white people (and that's awful, of course; anyone who says differently is simply racist too). But in my experience there are more than enough white people around to defend themselves in most of these instances; it's just not a dramatic thing by any stretch of the imagination (whatever some people on TV or on the internet may say). And apart from that the whole discourse often isn't about white people at all, you know; in my experience, people from other ethnicities tend to be way less concerned with white people than some white people seem to think (and I do mean: way less).  Look: Maybe you're a troll who doesn't listen to one word of what I'm saying, maybe you're a good guy who's confused and doesn't know where to go with the pain he carries in his heart. Either way, let me say something to you as a German who's ancesters had stories to tell of very troubled times: The train you're on intellectually leads into desaster; it fills you with fear and hatred until your good years are over. And in really bad cases it won't 'only' hurt you, but others too who where just trying to follow their own little path. What I'm trying to say is: Please get away from the tree line and come back onto the big central clearance of life where people are actually happy and friendly and deal with said pain we all feel without leaving each other alone. I know it might not be easy, but please try, you know. Life's short enough as it is.",3년 전,1,

Through history, our nature is ""unite and fight others"", due to the reason, we always find stupid excuses to unite (race, country, blood, color, culture.) and fight whoever is not following the flag.  That's our nature, but I think a lot of you guys can choose to follow this stupid game or not( By ignoring the physical fact that you have from your parent, like skin colors, family or country cultures, or the history that your country had with other countries.) and start focus on more interesting game, focus on knowedge like science or art, and join the people who has same interests, and discussing, learn, even debate about it.

@KelKilimanjaro," @adgcih1689  the very last song where Key goes “ohhh now I see it” talks about a hanging, or a lynching. Lynching involved a mob ambushing somebody and literally hanging them from a tree via noose. The victim would often be tortured or beaten beforehand. It was a somewhat common and often-racially-motivated threat throughout the Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, especially in the Southern United States (in this instance, Texas). Even in some rural areas today racially motivated lynchings can occur. The song right before that (the tire swing song) was assumed to be talking about lynching, due to the “find me a rope and find me a tree” bit.",4년 전,26,

Just as their opposites did to them at one time or another.  Many white missionaries to Africa were murdered for being white.

@ralphralpherson9441," @user-xw9lt1em3m  They are prominent ""black power"" activist types. And not the wise likable kind like MLK Jr. or even Malcolm X. Sharpton thinks he is Lord Emperor of the Black People and could find racism at an all-black BBQ in Alabama, and Farrakhan tries to act like he's this pro-black holy man, but he really just hates anyone who ain't black, especially whitey.  So the joke is, ""you're getting a little crazy trying to find the racism in these songs"" implying that he would think ANYTHING is racist.  The joke of this skit was that the songs were indeed VERY racist and the singer didn't even realize it.  And no, not all country music is racist.  One of the biggest country radio hits of the past 30 years was Darius Rucker's cover of Mama Rock Me or ""Wagon Wheel"". And Charlie Pride was one of the highest grossing stars in country music a few decades back.  Dont forget that Ray Charles and even Aaron Neville both could be considered ""country"" music, for both men at least some of their catalogues fall under ""country music"".

I think he had much more work to do. But I would disagree with the idea he was somehow ""white washed by conservatives""... I just think parts of the hard left fringe are FAR more radical today than MLK Jr was then, and frankly, are motivated by irrational hatred and prejudice unlike MLK JR. who was motivated by the demand for justice, equality, and a fair shot at the American Dream for the disaffected minorities of his day.",4년 전,0,

@ClaudiusPtolemy,"I agree, and I see where the confusion is.  “This Sketch is funny,” as an objective claim is neither true nor false, because funny cannot be possessed as a property by an object.  But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t subjective claims about humor that can be true or false.  So I like this sketch, so the claim “this sketch is funny to me” is true, when uttered by me.  But that same proposition uttered by someone else could be false if they didn’t like the sketch.  For subjective claims such as this one, the truth value depends on who is making the claim, whereas an objective claim, such as “2 + 2 = 4” is true no matter who says it, and another objective claim, “World War II started in 1739” is false no matter who says it.",4년 전,0,

@anonperson3197,"HOW TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE IN HEAVEN WHEN YOUR BODY DIES AND HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD WHO LOVES YOU: believe in the Son of God:  ~John 3:16 (NIV) ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."" WHAT EXACTLY DOES BELIEVING IN GOD'S SON MEAN?: accept God's testimony about his Son:  ~1 John 5:10: ""Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son.""   WHAT IS GOD'S TESTIMONY ABOUT HIS SON? here it is:  ~1 John 5:11-13 ""And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.  I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.""   DO I HAVE TO DO ANY WORKS? no! you are saved freely! you will go to heaven when you die now! Reference verses:   ~John 6:26-29 ""Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”""  ~Ephesians 2:8-9: "" For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—  not by works, so that no one can boast."" ~Romans 4:2-8: "" If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God. What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: “Blessed are those     whose transgressions are forgiven,     whose sins are covered. Blessed is the one     whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”""  ~Romans 3:20-31: ""Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin. But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus. Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.  Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.""  Am I saved forever now? no need to worry? yep! you are sealed with the Holy Spirit!  ~Ephesians 1:13-14: ""And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.""   I still find myself sinning- why?  ~Romans 7:14-24: ""We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.""   -",4년 전,0,

@seonfps,"The fact that you guys have to only believe those who have been found hanging must have been lynched is astounding to me. There are other possibilities, and suicide is surely more likely and plausible. Do not say shit like “there’s no way this happened, family said they were happy.” No one knows what is going on inside someone’s mind, the pain or suffering they might be experiencing, not even close family and friends. Just because they happened to be black, does not mean they were killed, that’s forcing them to be a victim without any evidence. Did anyone expect robin Williams to kill himself? No. Do not make, oh just because you found someone hanging, a race issue. This is a fucking comedy sketch, and it’s meant to be enjoyed, laugh about, bring us together.

It's not enough to be offended by something personally upsetting to you, many feel the need to be deeply  offended on behalf of others - usually others who aren't there, sometimes others who may not even exist.  People have been denigrating, insulting and defaming members of the race told they belong to and even the whole race itself for as long as people have been arbitrarily assigning racial catagories based on assumption and superficial physical appearance...

@jakestewart5899,"I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.   1. What do you think happens to someone after they die? 2. Do you think there is an afterlife?  3. If heaven exists, how do you get there?  4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?   Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person:    1. How many lies have you told in your whole life?  2. Have you ever stolen?  3. Have you ever used God's name in vain? 4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust?  5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day?  6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?   The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell?    2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us.    What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus.    When are you going to do that?

@unclecreepy4185,"The superintendent of my school district sent an email out (to staff and parents) about the school year starting with the fear of the unknown since this was going to be something unlike anything anyone had seen. So he shares a store (a fable of sorts if you will). “A prisoner is sentenced to be hanged. The day of his execution, the judge says you can pick death by rope or pick what’s behind the door. Not knowing what was behind the door, and fearing it’s something worse, he picks the rope. But before he’s hanged, he asks, what was behind the door? The judge says, it’s interesting because no one ever picks the unknown. It was freedom.” It was a weird story to compare going back to school, but basically saying, just because this school year is going to be scary because it’s new and unknown doesn’t mean it’s going to be worse than what we’re facing. We have to embrace the change, etc etc etc.   A few days later the superintendent sends another email out. Basically saying “I want to apologize for the story I shared. I in no way intended it to reflect what African Americans went through in the past...”  “Rope and a hanging! Clearly this is a story about hanging black slaves and promoting slavery. He acting like African Americans never had it rough.”",5년 전,0,

Donald Trump took out full-page ads in all four major New York newspapers to argue that perpetrators of crimes such as this one “should be forced to suffer” and “be executed.” In two trials, in August and December 1990, the youths were convicted of violent offenses including assault, robbery, rape, sodomy, and attempted murder; their sentences ranged from five to 15 years in prison. In 2002, after the discovery of exonerating DNA evidence and the confession by another individual to the crime, the convictions of the Central Park Five were vacated. The men were awarded a settlement of $41 million for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and a racially motivated conspiracy to deprive them of their rights. Trump took to the pages of the New York Daily News, calling the settlement “a disgrace.” During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump would again insist on the guilt of the Central Park Five""",5년 전,0,

@umungus518, @haruhirogrimgar6047  trump was talking about the peaceful protesters on both sides. In that same speech he said white nationalists should be condemned outright. It is a statistical fact that people who enter the country illegally have a higher chance of already being a criminal in their home country or committing crimes in the US. Not sure if you know it but there are a lot of bad people in Mexico and other places in South America. There are something called cartels which commit horrible crimes on a daily basis. If Mexico was such a nice place with such nice people why would they all want to come to the US? Also you do know that Obama deported more people in his first term than trump has right? Was trumps work on prison reform racist? Was his development of opportunity zones racist? Was the record low unemployment in the black community racist? Biden said if black people don't vote for him then they aren't black. He said poor kids are just as bright as white kids. He said black people all think the same. He supported segregation. I applaud people who want to this country LEGALLY to try and build a better life. However there is a difference between legally entering the US and illegally crossing the border.,4년 전,2,

@puggedpoetry129," @umungus518  I wrote this month ago. He has done much more and much worse since I wrote this. He called for The Oath Keepers wearing their Nazi 6 million were not enough shirts to overrun the capitol and murder Mike Pence and Democrats and stop a legal election and install a dictator. I assume you would agree that a Nazi is racist. I wonder what it's going to take to prove to Trump supporters that he's a Nazi. He is an authoritarian president with plummeting poll numbers before an election who is dispatching federal secret police to cities to illegally brutalize people of color to satisfy his racist base’s bloodlust. . he retweets a video in which one of his supporters shouts white power twice. And refused to take it down for hours.  He has been pushing the boundaries to see where they are.  He has repeatedly  said he's going to stay in for longer than 8 years.  He has repeatedly called for his brown shirt troops to bring their guns and go after the left and he has repeatedly called for his brownshirt troops the Nazis the proud boys the Boogaloo boys the KKK to beat up and kill the left. He has repeatedly called for beating and killing reporters. He has repeatedly attacked the Free Press which is the first thing a rising dictator does.   And now he does the Nazi red inverted triangle ad.    Aside from the explicit Nazi symbolism of the inverted red triangle, there were 14 words in the first sentence of every version of the ad, and 88 versions. Those numbers are very meaningful to white supremacists and Nazis. They come from David Lane's 88 Precepts, a white nationalist tract in which he coins the term 14 Words: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."" 88 is code for ""Heil Hitler"", as ""H"" is the 8th letter of the alphabet.  None of this is a coincidence.   What does he have to do to prove to you that he is a Nazi? How is everything he has done not enough? His speech writer is a literal Nazi. He just appointed another Nazi to a high place in the federal government. His vice president is a dominionist theocrat. He chose to make a speech on June 19th and Tulsa Oklahoma, the place of a horrific race riot and then he chose to make a speech in front of Mount Rushmore which was built in the 1920s on sacred Native American land and partially funded by the KKK and whose sculpture was a member of the KKK. Not a coincidence. And look at that speech. It was 100% authoritarian fascism. Fascism 101. This does not even address all the times he has said to his white followers at rallies that they have superior genes. And it does not address how many times he has refused to disavow white supremacists and neo-nazis.  Our ""president"" is an outright Nazi. Stop the Denial. And even if you don't think he's a Nazi his Nazi and KKK and other white supremacist supporters do",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@neemahkiarie9360,Lyrics Well I'm just a good old American boy With a heart that's red white and trueee I'm dreaming of a the girl with the red hair and freckles  And her eyes like the skies of blue   Keep her safe from the homies  In the wrong side of town Where they're smoking the reefer and acting like clowns  Keep that pretty white dress from getting dirty and brown Cuz that's the American wayyyy (weehouuu)   Some folks wear their hat way off to the side With their pants down low and a gun tucked inside Take their beer by the forty and their chicken deep fried I think we all know who we're talkin abouttt The only dark I like is when I turn off the lights The only hood I love is pointy and white Can't trust you if I can't see your face at night  I think we all know who we're talking abouttttt  Hidey lidey lidey lee Get me a rope and find me a tree  The banjos are strumming  And the drums are a bangin Let's get the boys together and have ourselves a hangin',5년 전,477,

And I've caught clips of some lesser known young country artists who are pretty damn good.    But I can't stand the dumbass culture of modern pop country.  Merica!  Men are men and women are women blah blah blah.  So much of it is so ""normalizing"" and regressive.  Which at it's core in a traditionally racist country, is generally racist.  Of course modern racists don't sing about lynching and stuff.  That's satire.  Modern racists say things like Make America Great Again in response to advances of civil liberties for people of color and glbtq people.   Pop country culture is most definitely the bastion of a lot of  right wing racist fuqs and I think right wing racist fuqs are some of the worst people on the planet right now.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@mynameismanic,Henry Whitworth make America great again isn’t racist. Implying the worse ideas into something is wrong.

But generally racist no our constitution gave us the ability to do away with racism.,5년 전,0,

@satidog," @mynameismanic  Denying that this country is traditionally racist is racist in and of itself.  Basically the same as people denying the reality of the Holocaust being anti-Semitic.   Maybe you genuinely don't understand it but people not understanding that they're racist doesn't make them not-racist.  At least you asked the question though.   Some white people think as long as they don't yell n---- at any black people it means there's no racism.  It completely denies the experience of black people in this country.  A country that allowed for black people to be enslaved at its founding.   Over a generation enslaving black people and their bodies became the single most valuable property in the country.  That's who they were in this country, who they were forced to be.  White people in the slave states aspired for nothing more than to acquire a ""breeding population"" of human beings.    Then the nation is almost destroyed by a faction rich and powerful enough to do it that fought a civil war so they could enact a constitution where ""negro slavery"" is the official law of the land and abolition is outlawed.  They narrowly failed but the ""freedom"" won for black people in driving them down remains limited by law and by terror campaigns for more than another century.  More than 4 thousand are lynched, beaten or burned over decades and the law does little to stop it and often sides with the murderers.   There are heroic monuments of those who tried to make white people a constitutional master race and symbols of their almost nation are popular up to this day.   ( popular in some country music circles, in fact) How is this NOT a traditionally racist nation?  It's absolutely central to who we are. I cut this hugely for time.  One could fill books (many have) making the case with thousands of well documented laws and events that this is a traditionally racist nation.",5년 전,0,
@mynameismanic,Henry Whitworth you cant be racist unless you believe you are superior based on your race or believe someone is different based on their race. Neither of which I believe. This nation fought a war to end slavery we did not fight one to keep it. The confederation states of America fought a war to keep slavery. We are the United States of America. When led by republicans it has moved away from racism. No one in this country was enslaved. Everyone who experienced slavery and enslaved others is dead. Those are the sins of the past. You think this country is traditionally racist because you are mixed into leftist culture. This country has rejected racism at least the right in this country has rejected racism for more than 50 years and imo that is long enough to consider that tradition of this country is non racist I would put the caveat that when you look at the political left you do see traditional and modern racist. Every racist aspect of this country that has existed has existed in the left and been rejected by the right. Those statues were put up by the left to intimidate black people. The civil rights bill was rejected by the left. The party that succeeded from the union was the left. Those who hate black peoples today is the left you patronize and kill blacks with abortion and anti policing beliefs. You believe black people cannot be good you believe they cannot rise above therefore you must pass laws to give them an advantage. The leftist must step aside they lost the civil war they must step aside and allow republicans to achieve Martin luthers dream and stop gendering and setting us back with your bigotry and hate...,5년 전,0,

@kcburner01,Christopher Seelbach that was pretty much the point lol. that racist lyrics are disguised through metaphors. the idea is that key is singing songs literally instead of coding racist lyrics. the songs sang here are to bang the real racism over yout head that certain country songs aren’t so literal in. hopefully that makes sense for you,5년 전,1,
@kcburner01,"poppaluv i don’t listen to country music. if you are an avid listener, you shouldn’t be surprised to the message of this clip. even guns and roses have literally said the n word in songs. you would have to be delusional to think there aren’t country songs or even rock songs like this. it’s exaggerated obviously, but do you think they just pulled this out of your ass? you are a fool",5년 전,0,

Mississippi and love it there as well. There is just something to being proud of who you are and where you came from. I'm sorry if this comes off argumentative. It's not my intent.

YOu see that by saying those last words, you are saying that it is racist, but not ""overtly"" racist, which is bs.

@shiroshnur,"I would say there's a difference between the possessive use of ""homies"" vs using ""the homies"" as an object. Using homies in a possessive way always implies a kinship between you and those who are you are calling your homies.  If we looking to the history of the word homie, we find that it was heavily associated with gang culture. Homie is short for homeboy, and a homeboy was a person from your hood, or a boy from your home turf. However, white gangs like the Aryan brotherhood or the mafia we're not prone to using homeboy. Now, of course a black guy and a white guy could be homies. This just means that they're friends. But nobody is going to call an adversary their homie. You can say ""him and his homies,"" and this makes the homies an extension of the ""him"" that you were referring to.  If you are adversaries with the ""him"" that you are referring to, then his homies would also be your adversaries, but they are not your direct adversaries, and are only your adversaries due to their connection to the ""him"". In this context, you could substitute homies with the word dogs and it would have the same effect. In the context of the song, the homies were obviously adversaries from the point of view of the singer. He said they were from the hood, which is historically a nickname for underprivileged neighborhoods usually populated by black and Latino people. Taking all of this into account, in the context of that song, homies was obviously referring to black people. Your homies can be black, white, Latino, Asian, or whatever. But whenever putting ""the homies"" in the context of an adversary, they are always black or Latino.",5년 전(수정됨),25,

A city dude talkin about his homies? Probably just talking about his close friends of any color.  A black city dude talkin about how homies are always gettin done dirty by the government? Probably referring to to black people with endearment.  Hope that clears things up.,4년 전,0,

For a certain segment of people Sharpton and Farrakhan would essentially almost be the black equivalent of a prominent white racist like David Duke.",5년 전,24,

@animalcookie," @seg162  I'm referring to the segment of the population whom would feel that those descriptions are accurate. Others may find the descriptions defamatory or exaggerated. I wasn't trying to express my own feelings about them, only what purpose they serve coming from Key's character in the skit. I don't think his character merely thinks of Farrakhan and Sharpton as activists, but at bare minimum as agitators (or worse, as I described in my op)--which would be consistent with the feelings of the sort of people who sing obviously racist songs. That Key's character is seemingly unaware of the racism and stereotypes in the songs he sings--rather than a knowing participant and champion of those ideas--doesn't change that that he would probably share the same perception of Farrakhan and Sharpton as the people who are aware of the meaning of the song.",5년 전,2,
@jasonperdue2554," @animalcookie  That segment would include Peeles character, who instantly facepalmed and shook his head at the comparison, in much the same way i would if someone were to cut me off mid sentence and said im getting all David Duke on someone.   Unless you hang out with a bunch of sympathizers of Sharpton or Farrakhan, you'll end up in the ""segment"". Which is to say, the majority of the population. The only reason they are not derided more strongly then they are is because of the moronic assumption in the minds of many people that it is impossible to be racist if you are black, because of past wrongdoings to that race.",5년 전(수정됨),3,
@BeggarsNight,"....the joke is just that he’s telling him that he feels like he’s seeing racism where it doesn’t exist.  Al Sharpton and Farrakhan are regular targets of white people who deny that racism is a problem, and they’re often accused of raising issues of race where there are none.  Whether you believe they’re right or not is totally immaterial to the joke, no matter what some wackos in here are saying about “the REAL racists” (which implies that black Americans don’t actually experience racism). The general implication of the joke is that there are people who will flatly deny the existence of racism even when it’s flagrant.",5년 전,1,

Someone can have some racist ideas or be racist in general but still make an exception for their friend. ""You're not like most of them, you're alright"". Or ""Nah, I know you were born here, you're good. I just hate those damn immigrants that I can see and recognise because they look different and are trying to cultural Marxism something something"". Ignoring that they are prejudging others, not knowing if they are immigrants or not.  That is just two small examples, there are so many more, like someone just hating one specific race, maybe even having justifications like ""I was attacked once"" or ""I see scary stories about them"" because yes, it is complex. But people being complex doesn't make it impossible to label specific things they do, as being something. It just means that isn't all there is to them.

@peterhepworth4105," @stevied3400  Stephen, do you not understand the concept of ""fake friends""? Are you THAT naive? You believe that everyone who calls themselves a friend is really a friend and that's the end of it. This concept doesn't even have anything to do with racism, that's just life in general. Now add racism into the mix, there are white people out there who don't like black people at all and would rather not mix with them. However, work and labour laws FORCE them to interact with blacks so they put on a fake smile and pretend their friends - smiling in the black person's face but talking racist crap behind their back and blocking them from promotions and all sorts (I've witnessed this several times). And think about it - a white person only mentions the ""I have a black friend..."" line in defensive public situations. Either they are about to say something racist or are defending themselves against the accusation. Otherwise, it doesn't come up in normal conversation. In that particular moment, they would rarely EVER admit publically that they are prejudiced against blacks so they find the nearest defense they can - ""Oh I'm not racist, I have black friends at work"" TRANSLATES TO ""I know this one black guy in the copy department and I have polite watercooler conversation with him every other week. But in reality - I would never want to mix with him outside work, would never want him to mix with my family, etc. Happens all the time. Stop being naive and randomly believing people are somehow inherently good. They are not.",5년 전,17,

How do you know that when a white person says “I can’t be racist, I have black friends”, it “TRANSLATES TO” that?

Especially if they will use that information and possibly be more on guard around a group of Black people as opposed to a group of white people? On that same token do you think people who believe white people or disproportionately racist or wield power and used to hurt other groups of people, do you believe those people are racist? Or are they justified? Both of these beliefs are pretty common but the different says the right wing believe, they recognize has nothing to do with skin color and they don’t bring that into the conversation, people who are concerned about white people’s behavior constantly bring up race and skin color as if that’s a factor",2년 전,0,
@jessejive117," @peterhepworth4105  It doesn’t matter if they have a black friend they aren’t racist lol most Black people, even though the country they live in is almost entirely white, still have a majority of black friends and their circle. Pointing out white people have the majority of white friends and their circle doesn’t discredit their argument they aren’t racist because they have friends who are black.

@jessejive117," @dreamshakegaming  how long earth could you possibly know that? You were just saying because he’s white he’s racist and if he says he has black friends it’s not because he actually likes them but he’s being their friend just to not be called racist. Do you know how incredibly racist that is? Again when there’s no evidence someone’s racist and there’s actually evidence they aren’t racist, you just ignore the evidence and double down. That’s called being a bad person.",2년 전,0,
@jessejive117," @carmensandiego3584  I agree and gave you a lie but the problem is they just call everyone racist. If you were anything other than far left on social issues, at least racial social issues, if you don’t constantly doglike on anyone accused of racism and throw them under the bus, Then they will call you racist. Not that I would care what any of these monsters think. They seem to be all Hellbound. I hope they get saved I’d be incredibly Skeptical If any of them are and have and hold so many evil beliefs. But you are exactly right. If you are accused of racism and say, hold on a minute I have very close Black friends were deeply love and care and respect regardless of their skin color, then they just say well that’s racist for you to bring up you having black friends. That is so incomprehensively stupid that it is nothing other than pure manipulation and extreme dishonesty. And it’s accusing somebody of something awful that they are not. That being said the original comment is hilarious",2년 전,0,
@jessejive117," Actually YouTube  I agree with you and I think we are on the same side but because they are accusing somebody of being racist but clearly the person being accused of racism agrees with you and says skin color does not Matter because they are friends with people and love people regardless of their skin color. But it’s clear who the actual racists are. They are just accusing this person of racism because they disagree on politics or probably just support Donald Trump who is clearly not a racist and since that person is white, they accuse them of race schism. How many of these people saying having a black friend doesn’t make you racist would say only white people in general are even capable of being racist and how many of them ever accuse black or brown people of being racist when they only evidence is that person skin color. Probably not a lot lol my standard is if you have a double standard for people based on skin color. If a white person says Black people can’t be racist, they are a racist. if you think your skin color has anything to do with how you should be treated for what you were capable of morally, you are a racist. If a black person thinks Black people are in capable of making good decisions, they are a racist against Black people. And I do agree even if you are white and have white friends and you talk about white privilege and then you accuse other people of benefiting from white privilege when you don’t know anything about them other than their skin color, you are a racist. If you could use Black people of probably being a criminal without evidence other than their skin color, you are a racist. If you won’t vote for Black people even if they agree with your politics because of their skin color, you are a racist. I know people who claim this, even though they are also voting for Herschel Walker lol I have met racist people against Black people. But the level of normalized racism towards white people is so ramp it and it’s in mainstream media and there’s headlines and main stream media called, the problem with whiteness, or the problem with white people. Or the angry white male and why they are a problem in society. It’s genuinely $hit you see from the 50s about black. But it’s towards the white people so he’s actually racist in the comment section don’t care.",2년 전,0,

@moeaburwein9729,"Stupid Comedy Central! They just want any excuse to throw some comically racist material out there. Playing the black guy who doesn’t know he’s racist and says the most horrid shit. While the whole time the people watching are amused by the racist songs. We’ve seen similar bull during the Chappelle Show. The black KKK leader who is black and just spits racist/“funny” crap. That kind of material is pushed on performers and that’s what drove Dave Chappelle mad and abandon $50 million contract to be isolated in Africa. Kat Williams also pointed out the offensively racist scripts that networks give out to black performers when discussing Flava Flav roast. Whether it’s Key & Peele, Chappelle Show or other shows we all are guilty of watching, racist generalizations and especially about minorities are a common theme.

Nowadays I see this also a lot, people hear something they don't like, reflect it onto themselves and they make it about race, and suddenly the other person is being called a racist only because of their misinterpretation.

The mom of the other family kindly and jokingly pointed out the issue to my mom and we all watched my mom just about die from embarrassment.  Now we are still friends with this family to this day and they dont think we are racist and we are not no mater what you say to this.  i ask you this we did something that can be construed as racist by accident and with 0 malice in our heart but according to you we are still racist.  how? and if you think my mom is fuck you and that will be all i have to say about that.,5년 전,2,

@InfernalBanana,"hardwire Your tone kinda tops off that you’re taking it personally. The other person was just saying one can do something that might be seen at face value as racist, usually by referencing a stereotype, like giving a black person fried chicken or asking that one Asian kid to help you with math homework. Could the black guy actually love fried chicken? Sure. Could that kid be the top of your class in mathematics and actually be offering tutoring? Sure. Are you racist by doing those things? Not necessarily. In your anecdote, you said none of you were aware of the stereotype. That’s fine. Now if you gave them that every time they came over though, that may be a different story. If you just walk up to that Asian kid and assume he’s good at math, that’s racist. See, it’s all circumstantial; context makes all the difference. You have to know that what you’re doing is racist to be a racist person. Accidents happen and you can very well be in the dark about a certain stereotype, and that’s fine. What matters now is what you do with that new information. If you know the person well enough and they fall into that stereotype, that’s fine too. You’re not assuming anything.  TL;DR It’s actively assuming something based off of a stereotype that makes you racist (e.g. They’re black, therefore they love fried chicken). If you know the person well enough or are ignorant to the stereotype, it doesn’t make you racist. Your intentions determine if you’re racist.",5년 전,2,

@TheseH0esLoveChiefS0sa," @rakuhusky8427  I'm sure everyone agrees that nothing is ""perfect"", so by that logic, every ideological system is inherently flawed to some extent. The main reason I prefer capitalism to communism is that it encourages an individuals excellence and progression within their field of work, rather than valuing a janitor just as much as youd value a brain surgeon, at least on a monetary basis. Also it advocates some form of freedom, at least more so than communism does, look at China.",5년 전,0,

@TheseH0esLoveChiefS0sa," Hayao Kakizaki  Perhaps I phrased that poorly, I meant in terms of the prerequisites to reach that field of work, the stress it induces, and the difficulty it poses to the average person. Which admittedly isnt necessarily quantifiable, but I'm sure most people would agree that to the average human being, it's a lot harder not only to become a brain surgeon, but to conduct a brain surgery than it is to clean a restaurant for example.   Capitalism isn't perfect, but I believe in a monetary sense, it's a lot more reasonable than communism.  You are paid on the basis of your ability to contribute to society in a significant way, and while that isn't unequivocally true in all facets of capitalism(as made evident by the salaries of certain professions like a pro footballer or celebrity) it's a largely prevalent foundational aspect of the ideology. Please feel free to refute anything I've said as I'm not an expert by any means.",5년 전,1,
@TheseH0esLoveChiefS0sa," Hayao Kakizaki  That's a fair and valid point, but I'm afraid communism just isn't the answer to that. The quality of life of the people under communist regimes is far poorer than those within a capitalist country. Hierarchy isn't great, but isn't that exactly what the totalitarian communist states have too?   I do believe that there is a dire need for a re-distribution of wealth and resources to some degree, and there is a lot of corruption within capitalist societies as we're seeing happening right now with this pandemic power-grab. But the result of this is only that capitalism is abused to ultimately impose a communistic totalitarian ideology that mirror's China's with a ""social credit"" system.   Neither ideologies are perfect and if there was a clear superior alternative to capitalism I'd happily welcome it, but in the current state of affairs that simply isn't feasible. One thing's for sure though, the global elite, cabal, or whatever you want to call them are corrupt and need to be disbanded, and power needs to be reallocated to the people, where it belongs.",5년 전,0,
@TheseH0esLoveChiefS0sa," Hayao Kakizaki  I had figured you were going to use that argument, but tell me, seen as every communist country to date hasn't utilized ""real communism"", then how do you propose that we'd establish such an ideology? Without it being abused of course.",5년 전,1,
@CHURCHISAWESUM," Hayao Kakizaki  it's significantly harder to become a brain surgeon than a janitor. It takes more investment of time and resources both from individuals and society.  If you don't think that should be accounted for in compensation which then also becomes tax revenue btw to support the janitor, then you will end up in a society with a critical shortage of brain surgeons.  If they pay the same, who the fuck would go through the 15 years of trouble to become a brain surgeon?  Sure, a mass of janitors is as important as a mass of brain surgeons. But end up with a shortage of brain surgeons and suddenly they become more important. Vice versa (though that has never happened in history and never will) too btw.

Why do you think some committee is even capable of accurately pricing goods and services for hundreds of millions of people?

@CHURCHISAWESUM," Hayao Kakizaki  Also I read your document. When I see that it's a simple average, it completely loses all meaning.  Example: sample population of two just to demonstrate my point  Soviet: Guy 1 eats 1 food. Guy 2 eats 4: average 2.5  American: guy 1 eats 2 food. Guy 2 eats 3. Average 2.5  Simple averages tell you very little. You'd need to see min, max, median, mode to draw any conclusion about how the country is actually fed. Some regions could be systematically starved, like Ukraine and Siberia, and still end up with a national average the same as a much more equitable fed country. You fools understand this issue with averages when it comes to income but not nutrition? This is also not a CIA document, it's a report of a CIA study but we can't see the actual study, so evaluating the methodology is impossible. It's just an abstract.  Also, it was conducted in 1983. Wasn't this one of the better years for the Soviet Union? The worst of it had already happened in preceding decades. Are you going to pretend the Holodomor never happened? That there wasn't mass purging and starvation for decades? Stalin was already gone in 83. Hell, Brezhnev was gone. The fuck is this, how is this an argument that mass starvation never happened? Are you serious?  Amazing, your counterargument to my point that millions starved during the tenure of an 80-year government is to point to 1 abstract of 1 study we can't even read conducted in one of the better years of the government, therefore no starvation or breadlines ever happened?

@CHURCHISAWESUM," Hayao Kakizaki  I wouldn't call mercantilism, capitalism. Those were state-led and financed ships. Companies back then were commissioned by the state as state monopolies and could be decommissioned by the state at any time.  Of course, later, privately owned businesses did participate in the slave trade. But they didn't start it, and they did help end it too, by the way. A private business is as ethical as it's owner (s). With state monopolies, you better hope you have a wise and ethical ruler/""Comrade"" or the entire system is rotten top to bottom because it's just one entity, no margin for error.  The Soviet Union literally had slave labor camps. There's no grey area here. They had an entire system of them, the ""gulag archipelago"" so large it was essentially a nation within a nation (We do now too btw, thanks to the drug war, but capitalists would want to sell drugs, not lock you in prison for possessing them, and at least our prisoners are not worked to death)   In many ways, any decent standard of living they had at one point or another was always tainted by the shadow of gulags. And when several percent of your population was confined to them, with it not being that hard by western ""freedom standards"" to get locked up in one for life, I'd question if the standard of living can really be called decent at all. Only if you hid that fact in a dishonest, out of context average.  Mass slave labor. In the 20th century. Usually for political opinions or being a homosexual or anything that didn't fit into the rigid confines of the society they were building by killing off those that didn't fit into it.

@ErroneousMonk1,"n smith No, of course not. Don’t be ridiculous. I’m sure YOU don’t believe ALL LIVES MATTER, do you???  What a ludicrous thing to say. Police lives don’t matter. Asian lives don’t matter. Black lives don’t matter when other blacks are doing the killing for NO reason except someone’s pissed at someone else. Right?  No way do ALL LIVES MATTER.  I never thought that would be controversial but here we are - thanks 2020.",5년 전,2,
@InfernalBanana,"Erroneous Monk Dude, why were you even watching this sketch then if you knew it was just gonna trigger you? You knew what you were getting into by seeing the title: someone unwittingly being super racist. That’s the joke. Sure, they go for the low hanging fruit of “Everyone from the South is racist,” but the joke is that a black guy doesn’t notice the blatantly obvious racism towards blacks in his favorite songs from growing up. It isn’t about some political “every little thing you say and do is racist” BS. Keegan’s character in this is so completely oblivious to what are so clearly racial remarks. Basically, if they were snakes, he would’ve been dead ten times over. That’s the joke. You’re supposed to watch this and go, “How does he not notice this stuff as he’s saying it?”",5년 전,2,
@ErroneousMonk1,Orion Pax Ooooohhhhhj. Now I get it. So people from “the South” are so blatantly racist but they don’t even know it. I’m just trying out this whole ‘being professionally aggrieved at every little thing’ thing. It’s not fun. I’m not sure why the left loves doing it so much.,5년 전,0,
@InfernalBanana,"Erroneous Monk Actually, yes, you are getting aggravated over every little thing. I never once said that you in particular are racist. You just saw the part where I mentioned Key and Peele using the stereotype that “everyone from the South is racist” to make their jokes, and that triggered you and made you ignore everything else I said. Rewatch the skit. Keegan’s character says he’s from Texas, and then starts singing songs from his childhood that are super racist. That’s what I meant. However, due to the fact that even the slightest implication of you possibly being racist made you blow up in this thread in the first place, I’m gonna guess a lot of people tell you’re racist on a regular basis, which I’m sure pisses you off. I’m whiter than the Michelin Man, my dude, but I don’t usually have to defend why I’m not racist. I can also take a joke. If this is triggering you so much, again 1) Why did you watch this in the first place, and 2) Maybe you should re-evaluate your behavior, because you could be acting racist without having any intention of being racist.   Look, I don’t know you, nor do I know your life. You could be a very nice person for all I know. However, when even the slightest mention of racism is brought up, it pisses you off and has you make a mountain out of a mole hill; there’s clearly something going on with you personally. No one in this thread full out said you were a racist. Let me repeat that: NO ONE . You’re the one who immediately made it about yourself and went fighting windmills. So yeah, you are taking every little thing seriously.  Edit: Ok, maybe Beautiful Woman implied it, but she was the only one.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@ErroneousMonk1,"Orion Pax No, my dude. I’m only called a racist on YouTube because I don’t kiss anyone’s ass. I’m called a racist as soon as people think I’m white and not bowing down to the left’s war on whites, disguised as some culture. This is a reaction to the past few years of one segment of the population being called racist. I am from the South and I do feel I’m being attacked by society on a regular basis for that simple fact.  I’m not allowed to defend the police, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, the 2nd Amendment, Christian values, etc without being called names. And yes, at this point I don’t give a rat’s ass about anyone on the left. They’ve created these ridiculous rules of engagement with the ongoing professional victim game and I’m turning it right back around. Deal with it or don’t. I don’t care. I love watching these guys for the most part. I think they’re funny. But then they started getting political with their stuff and it usually only cuts one way. So I’m pushing back. It’s a fun hobby.",5년 전,0,
@InfernalBanana,"Erroneous Monk 1) I’m moderate, not that that matters, 2) you’re the one who went hyper politics on this thread, and 3) if you’re getting so up at arms about this, it’s probably best for you to log off of YouTube, or really any social media, sooner than later. There are plenty of people on here who live off of getting a rise out of others, so if you take every little thing like it’s a national emergency, log off and unplug your router right now, because the internet is clearly not meant for you.",5년 전,0,

Brown Skinned tinted poeple are no black people calling a brownskinned tinted man black is in my eyes more racist. Brown Skinned tinted people calling the Brown Skinned tinted people Nigger is also allowed. So again there was and is nothing racist in the word Nigger. So also dont make it a racist word.

Although the word has been around since WW2, Mexican gangs made it popular again in gang culture in the 80's and it became widely used in rap to describe a close friend or fellow gang member. So I guess thats why a black guy might think the word spawns from their culture but as it derived from the word ""homeboy"" which derived from the spanish word ''homebre'' I rest my case.

Black people in general are actually the most racist people I've ever known. I lived in a Hispanic hood, they were all nice as long as you didn't fuck with them. (Not ""all"" obviously). I lived in a bunch of black hoods longer and was in fights all the time over my skin color. ""Yo pinky, you know where you at?"" To which I would always say something like ""yep, a few blocks from home brownie."" Then I would either beat the shit out of a black guy or get jumped by more than one person. (Most blacks in the hood fight like bitches). I always found it funny how they would say SUPER racist shit to me, then as soon as I stand up for myself ""RACIST!!!"". For real, no joke, black people are objectively the most racist people in the US. I used to re-up (I haven't fucked around in like 15 years though after I went to state prison) from a Cambodian gang and they weren't racist for the most part. They didn't have an issue with anyone but the blacks for attacking them all the time, unprovoked. That's actually how their gang started.   So, whites, not racist for the most part. Hispanic, not racist for the most part. Asians, not racist for the most part. Blacks..... racist as shit for the most part with a select few that see the truth like Candice Owens.",5년 전,1,

@McFlingleson," @platterjockey  I get that, but what I'm saying is when I hear the line ""I think we all know who I'm talkin' about"" I interpret that as saying that if you thought there was some way that this song could not be racist, then you were wrong because it totally is racist. From a comedic standpoint the line works, but in terms of the actual plot of the sketch I think it leaves a hole. Maybe if that had been addressed in some way like he did with the other two songs where he thought that homies could be any race and that the song about a rope and a tree was referencing a tire swing then it could have worked, but I'm just left wondering, who did he think he was talkin' about?",5년 전,0,

Where everything is black and white.” Clearly a reference to southern culture and the segregation of the races.

The fact that it crossed over and became widely accepted/mainstream in other cultures does NOT change or negate its origins. Tell me the history of other races using it outside of or independent from the influence of black urban and/or hip hop culture. You can't. And, in fact, anytime I have typically heard other races use black slang terms it's because they grew up in ""the hood"" or were heavily influenced by black culture. You do NOT hear rich or rural white people or culturally rigid groups using that kind of slang. The term has now been appropriated so that other people do use it, but when they do they are usually trying to seem ""tough"", ""street"", ""hood,"" ""hip,"" or even sarcastic for their friends and fam.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@jer1014t2th," @Ay0godd  good question. Um, states' right to self-determination? So... The United States federal gov't came to be as a necessity for acting on the global stage. I.e. building and maintaining a military to be used against foreign threats, prevent invasions like the war of 1812, etc. There were some more things, but essentially the states came together for mutual protection, and the states all independently voted to ratify the constitution. So...since the states legislatures voted to join the United States, can't they also vote to leave the United States?  Bear in mind that every state was keen on maintaining its own authority, and on limiting the authority of the federal gov't from the start to the end of the constitutional convention.  So slavery isn't something I support in any way. I'm glad it was ended in the US... And I'm kind of glad the US is still one big nation with 50 states... But well, I can also acknowledge that Lincoln's war to accomplish both of these things wasn't strictly legal if you remember how the country came to be. Rule the strong is a real thing, as old as humanity - if you have the guns to enforce it.",5년 전,3,
@jer1014t2th," @FrancisR420   At the end of the day, slavery is the issue that made up the southern state's minds - the efforts by states where slavery was illegal to make that ban nation-wide.  But that's not where I make my stand. I don't support slavery in any way, shape or form - but I do think those states probably had a right to secede if they chose. At the end of the day, I do prefer a United States that is unified and is without slavery, but that doesn't mean it was accomplished by strictly legal means. And it definitely doesn't mean that the federal gov't should have the final say on all matters.",5년 전,3,
@jer1014t2th," @FrancisR420  again - owning slaves was the excuse that started it all.

Seriously, point out 1 person currently displaying a confederate flag who advocates killung people. You'll probably find 1. You might find 100.

I'm saying that in prosecuting the civil war, Lincoln and Congress exceeded the authority granted to them by the constitution - by the people - and waged a war they did not have the mandate to wage.  Now, it may have been necessary. I'm rather fond of the country as it is now, with some normal exceptions. But that does not mean it was moral, legal, or right. The world might've gone a very different direction if we'd just...let the South secede.

The early flag of America? Said it represented racism?  The American flag is meant to be a symbol of the best parts of America. Kapernick took a knee, yes, and that's not a bad thing in and of itself - but what he said next is what upset people.  He said the flag stood for racism.  And the Nazi flag is used as a call to white supremacy, not least because white supremacists are excellent trolls. Hate is a good promotional tool. But they don't own it, and I refuse to let them. Just as I refuse to let Kapernik own the meaning of the US flag. He's a privileged black guy (nothing wrong with that, alone, either) working to increase the divide between Americans - to me, that's what he stands for.  His history is my history, and vice versa. What has happened in the past affects everyone Kapernik seems pretty firmly on the side of the Black Supremacists, and I don't rate them any higher than I do the white ones.

Keeping as much power in the hands of the state's as is realistically possible serves as a check and balance against a tyrannical federal government that oversteps it's bounds. It keeps power from being centralized, and then abused on an un-manageable scale.  The South chose to use it's right to secede over the issue of slavery - their fear that the North would legislate away their way of life and wreck their economy. They held onto slavery like addicts, and they rationalized it like addicts, too (willing to damage what they had in a unified nation to preserve what they thought they needed) - but that didn't grant the North the right to force them to remain in the US - and two wrongs don't make a right.

@Pops646,Wayne Clark Lol most rich people date people from different countries all over the world. Yeah there are some who are racist but not most. It’s a gross generalization based off of nothing. I’d say people who aren’t rich tend to be more racist since they don’t have the money to escape their environment and are prone to picking up stereotypes about other people since they’ve never actually came into contact with them. A good rule on how to not be racist is travel and experience other cultures. That way you can better understand people rather than just assuming their stereotypes are true or that “white people and black people are all racist.”,5년 전,13,

@coptickansan4025," @D0UTEI  That's very insightful grammar. But it's the singer and his buddies that are 'ourselves'. So say, ""we had a hanging"" and ""we had ourselves a hanging"", the difference is the first one the speaker could identify with the persons doing the action (say they are apart of a town that did the hanging, though the speaker themselves did not participate) In the second, the speaker is making clear they directly participate in the action, not just identify as being a part of the group that carried it out.  That's my best explanation of Southern US slang, speakers do the same thing with the term 'myself'. Honestly though, don't worry about understanding this rule, to most every English speaker you will sound backwards constructing sentences that way",5년 전,2,

It's funny to think of this skit in it's entirety and laugh to myself. If I start singing them out loud then I'm out of line.    Even if I described the skit in full context and sang the songs to another white person then I am doing a racism.  That's just how it is.  The fact that it is not socially acceptable for me, as a white person, to sing these songs even as a joke in reference to the skit, seems obvious to me, but the reasons why it's not okay are actually nuanced and interesting.  The answers to questions like ""Why is okay to say I'm proud to be black, but not okay to say I'm proud to be white?"" are well thought out and relevant to a postmodern society.",2년 전,0,
