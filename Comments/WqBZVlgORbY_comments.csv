@Praise___YaH,"Guys, HERE is THE TRUE SAVIOR  YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified for our sins, NOT jesus, and “HERE IS THE PROOF”  From the Ancient Semitic Scroll:  ""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moses wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)  Ancient Semitic Direct Translation Yad - ""Behold The Hand"" He - ""Behold the Breath"" Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion He - ""Behold the Breath""  “Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL”   PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified  That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote  Here is what they mean  YaH's Name: (Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)  YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)  YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”: Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)  How YaH arrives: YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...  Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”  The Hebrew Book of Isaiah  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name!

@WASPfreak,"Pawn Stars: Curdled Chaos (Opening Scene: The Gold & Silver Pawn Shop. It's a disaster. Chumlee is wearing a gas mask, Corey is trying to hold back a gag, and the shop is filled with the unholy stench of aged dairy products. Rick, however, is in his element, wearing a hazmat suit and giddily examining a jar of something suspiciously green and fuzzy.) Corey: (Through a bandana) Dad, this is… this is beyond gross. It smells like a gym sock died in a cheese factory. Rick: (Eyes gleaming behind the hazmat visor) Corey, my boy, you lack vision! This isn't just… expired dairy. It's vintage! Aged to perfection! Chumlee: (Muffled through the gas mask) I think something in here is… moving. (Rick holds up the jar.) Rick: This, Chumlee, is a rare specimen. A 1987 Limburger, cultured in a forgotten cellar. The bacteria are… thriving! Corey: Dad, you're severely lactose intolerant! You'll explode! Rick: (Waving a dismissive hand) Details, details. It's about the history, the fermentation! The art! (A customer, MRS. PLUM, walks in hesitantly, holding a sealed, antique-looking crock.) Mrs. Plum: I… I found this in my attic. It belonged to my great-great-aunt. I think it might be… cheese? Rick: (Rushing over) Cheese? Let me see! (Rick carefully opens the crock. A wave of pungent odor wafts out, causing Chumlee to faint.) Rick: (Sniffing deeply) My god… it's… beautiful! A Roquefort, aged for… decades, perhaps centuries! Corey: Dad, I'm calling a hazmat team. Rick: Nonsense! This is a treasure! A dairy artifact of immense value! Mrs. Plum: I just want to get rid of it. It’s… unsettling. Rick: Unsettling? It's… transcendent! I'll give you… $500 for it! Corey: Dad! No! Rick: (Ignoring Corey) But first, I need to get it authenticated. I'm calling my buddy, Professor Curd. He's an expert in… ""extreme dairy."" (Cut to Professor Curd, a wizened old man in a lab coat, examining the cheese with a Geiger counter.) Professor Curd: (Voice trembling with excitement) This… this is extraordinary! The microbial activity is off the charts! It's practically… sentient! Rick: So, how much is it worth? Professor Curd: (Eyes wide) Priceless! A relic of this magnitude… it defies monetary value! But… I must warn you, Rick. This cheese… it possesses a certain… je ne sais quoi. Rick: Je ne sais quoi? Professor Curd: An… unpredictability. Handle with extreme caution. (Cut back to the pawn shop. Rick is holding the crock, looking torn. Corey is trying to barricade the door with shelves.) Corey: Dad, you heard the professor! This cheese is dangerous! Rick: But the history, Corey! The cheese! I can't resist! (Suddenly, the cheese in the crock begins to glow. A low hum fills the shop.) Chumlee: (Waking up) What's happening? Is it… singing? Rick: (Mesmerized) It's… calling to me. (Rick reaches into the crock and takes a bite of the glowing cheese. His eyes widen, and he begins to twitch.) Corey: Dad! No! (Rick starts to speak in a strange, guttural language. The shop begins to shake. The shelves collapse, and a shower of expired dairy products rains down.) (Cut to the shop exterior. Emergency vehicles surround the building. Hazmat teams are entering. News reporters are broadcasting live.) News Reporter: We're live outside the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, where authorities are responding to reports of a… ""dairy-related incident."" The situation is… unclear. (Cut back inside. Rick, covered in glowing cheese, is levitating in the center of the room. The shop is a swirling vortex of expired dairy.) Rick: (Voice booming) The cheese… is the answer! Corey: (To the hazmat team) He ate the cheese! He's gone full cheese! (The hazmat team cautiously approaches Rick, armed with… cheesecloth nets?) (The episode ends with a shot of the shop, now a biohazard zone, as Rick continues to levitate, chanting about the power of aged dairy. The fate of the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, and Rick's sanity, hangs in the balance.)",5개월 전,0,

I doubt the pawnshop has wire strong enough to hold a person wearing a suit of armor but there is no chance that you will fire an arror into a building that will anchor that line securely enough for you 3. The armed guards will be shooting at you once you shot the window, ziplining in, and roller skate past, suits of medieval armor do not deflect bullets, and if they did they would shoot your legs, stopping your skating 4. If you are going fast enough to crash through a bank vault door you're going fast enough to die on impact 5. Cartoon money bags are tacky 6.

It's understandable that someone who doesn't live in the US would lack perspective, but the US is a massive country with a LOT of land.

@ppunion,"There were so many things wrong with this plan: 1. Attaching stuff to arrows will make them wildly inaccurate. But hey. With enough tries you could certainly hit a window. 2. Shotgun shells are unlikely to break windows at a bank. Just saying. 3. Attaching a zipline to an arrow could absolutely work. But remember that you can generally pull arrows out of stuff you have hit... And now you want that arrow to support your bodyweight? Yikes! 4. Why don't you want the bottom half of a suit of armor? They don't restrict movement all that much. I knew a guy that did cartwheels in full suits of authentic full plate armor... With the padding and chainmail underneath. 5. Unless a suit of armor is specifically made for it, it will not bounce bullets, unless the angle is just right and/or the caliber is very small. There were fullplates with chestplates that was designed to deflect musketballs. But those only protected certain areas of your body because making the entire suit to do so would make it prohibitively heavy. 6. The guards are unlikely to shoot at your legs. There is a reason people wear body armor for bullets only on their chest. Everyone is taught to shoot for centermass because it is the biggest least moving target on the human body. When you are shooting a moving human target, most people become significantly more inaccurate than they would be on a gun range, because of adrenaline and a natural tendency not to want to shoot people.  But damn the brother watched to much road runner and/or bugs bunny... Because this sounds exactly like some cartoon stuff.",1년 전,0,

@TheColosiss,"This is funny but tragically true. I used to work retail at a sporting goods store. From my experience, there are those who want to do something bad; and there are those who don't even realize what they are trying is bad. One perfect example would be this one kid that came in all the time. One day, he tried to buy 8lbs of smokeless powder. He was not only too young (like 10 or something), but he wanted to use it to ""get rid of a tree stump in his front yard for his dad"". He just didn't know what he was doing was a very bad, illegal, and unsafe idea.  I told him that A. He was too young. B. Without proper licensing and training, that was illegal. C. That was not black powder and wouldn't work the way he thought it would. D. There were far safer ways to get rid of a stump. E. If he lived in town, that would be very illegal.  The kid was shocked and didn't even realize. He just thought he had a good idea. He asked a few more questions and I gave him a piece of paper that explained the dangers of reloading, black powder, and some of the legal stuff. Since the store sold Tannerite, We had a few safety pamphlets printed out after all the baby-shower stupidity. He took them, said thanks, and left slightly embarrassed.  It is a small town. I saw his dad nearly every day when walking to work. I knew his dad would be in and this would be a great story. They were regulars, and they came in all the time. The kid normally came in once or twice a week when he was on his way home to look at the airsoft stuff. He played Airsoft with his dad often so they were in all the time getting the bulk packs of BBs. The kid would drop by to see if they were in stock, ask me to set some aside; and then the next day the family would pick them up. Good people.  Later that week the family walked in and I inquired about the stump. The dad laughed and said that they had to get a professional to come and grind it. They tried everything to get it out short of using massive equipment and there was just no space. The dad also mentioned that his son came home after trying to get some powder. The dad apologized profusely and said he had zero hand in that crazy idea. He had already called to get the thing mulched. We both laughed for a bit and the dad thanked me for the pamphlets and telling his son that maybe that wasn't such a good idea.  Apparently, the kid was just trying to help his dad. He just didn't know.",2년 전,0,

@Raven_Leblanc,"1:58 Actually, a bullet to the leg will (in some cases) shatter bone and render you crippled for the rest of your life. Otherwise you'll hit muscle mass or tendons, of which the second will need to be grafted probably in a long proces after which revalidation is required and fairly slow. In the unlikely event that you get shot in the upper leg, you might get hit in a major artery from which you'll bleed to death in just a minute if not sooner. If we take into account that we're talking about hypothetical police officers shooting hypothetical bullets, we might think of hypothetical 9mm bullets that, in case of a legshot, will cripple you if it hits your anckles or can seriously harm your knee beyond saving (and thus require an ENTIRE new joint) or piercing the before mentioned major artery.

Both parts unfortunately hold other pieces in place. I inherited it from an Uncle. Appraised as is for $11,500. Would be closer to $50K if complete. I have an undated coat of mail as well.

@timothyjacksondrake4454,In answer to the question of how fast you have to skate to get through the door: I will be using (P=mv or mass times velocity equals momentum) [105kg (the man with armor on) times V]= 375kg (vault door+man) x. V represents the velocity needed and x is the applied speed it would take to sheer the door off. My guess is you need to roller skate around light speed to take out the door. On the bright side you won't get shot by the guards if going the proper speed.,5년 전,2,

Also, it might factor in if he gets a good runway leading up, allowing him to bend through his knees in the final approach, lowering point of gravity and compacting the mass into a smaller section of the door - the door, of which we don't yet have the specs.... Also, it would help to know at what hight relative to sea level the door is... if it's high up in a very tall skyscraper, lower air pressure and stuff... though, at such a height, the guy would then likely also be shopping for breathing equipment/oxygen... or stuff to build a portable compression chamber, which regular rollerskates wouldn't be likely to support the weight of...",4년 전,0,

@justinakers6320,"People are hammering you for calling it predictable. How about this twist; skit ends showing the man sitting in a rocking chair at Christmas. The family is all opening gifts shaped like the things he was trying to buy at the pawn shop. But when the nephew opens up the bow and arrow looking package it’s actually a tee-ball set etc. As the man is smiling, the frame zooms out. Nephew says “Where’d you get the money to buy all this uncle crazyakes?” “Eh, don’t worry about it” he replies. You see the suit of armor in the background with bullet hole deflections in it and see a lime green lambo through the bay window. He stands up “I’ll make breakfast” and roller skates toward the kitchen” as the scene ends.",4년 전,7,

I was there during the k2 raids and prior, and God damn do I miss the commission from back then, that being said I'm glad that stuff's off the streets. In my experience I try to politely cut people off when they are about to tell me something illegal but I've yet to find a nice way to do it. Believe me I try. The way I deal with kids in my shop is I ask at the door for ID. Especially since the smoking age jumped to 21. Now there's a nice way of doing this: don't just jump at them asking for ID, first start with a ""what's going on guys"" then a ""looking for anything in particular today?"" Wait for a response and then hit them with the ""do you mind if I check out your ID first?"" It is a shitty part of our job but it's a $400 fine in the state of Texas selling tobacco or tobacco products to minors and I personally have seen ATF send kids in to set us up.",5년 전(수정됨),7,

@ninnavinna,"I used to work at a liquor store, every teen hated me because I made it a personal goal not to let them get away with buying alcohol and cigarettes even when their parents would bring them in and buy it for them in front of me. But the whole irony was when the police sent a decoy boy and I checked his I.D. told him I could not sell him alcohol but sold tobacco to him because I was still ""new"" to the country and was still reading dates the rest of the world way. So immediately they came in and got me for selling tobacco to a minor. I was like what is the point of doing everything right in life if some b.s. like this is going to happen.",5년 전,4,

Since a lot of these kinds of videos sometimes don't have captions, and you obviously can't have the whole script in the video description, then the only way to make sure some easily searchable keywords from the clip show up in Google (which are often what most people know from the clip/show, and are what they have to go on when searching for it, as opposed to knowing the exact video title on the YouTube channel) is to put them in the comments section.",5년 전,6,

He's honestly the closest thing to a dictator that America's ever had.  How is that? -He attacks the credibility of the legitimate press, which is a tactic common among Fascist dictators, in order to erode the media's ability to put a check on his corruption. -He tries to make himself above the law, including by firing the very people who investigate him. -He tries to make himself above the law through witness tampering. -He tries to make himself above the law via witness intimidation. -He tries to make himself above the law via judge intimidation. -He tries to make himself above the law by floating the possibility of giving presidential pardons to his co-conspirators who face incarceration. -He tries to make himself above the law by defying congressional subpoenas, encouraged his subordinates to do the same, and refusing to enforce Contempt of Congress charges against his subordinates to defy subpoenas. -He tries to make himself above the law by conjecturing that executive privilege applies to basically every crime. -He tries to erode checks and balances by whipping Republicans in congress into submission. -He's tried to make himself president for life by suggesting the possibility of eliminating term limits. -He's tried to make himself president for life by suggesting the possibility that there will not be a peaceful transition if he's voted out of office. -He's tried to make himself president for life by threatening that there will be economic repercussions if he's impeached. -He's tried to attack faith in our democracy by spreading lies about millions of illegal votes. -He's attacked our democracy by inviting numerous foreign adversaries to interfere in it. -He's utilized significant propaganda campaigns to bolster his support.  This includes employing numerous media-facing subordinates like Press Secretaries who lie to the media on his behalf.  It includes using social media and television to spread thousands of documented lies.  It includes coordinating self-serving lies with Fox News anchors.  It includes benefiting from social media influence campaigns: one operated by Russia, and one operated by Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon. -He's tried to elevate the level of support for dictatorship relative to democracy by praising the world's dictators while attacking the world's democratically-elected leaders.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

Trump recently hired Alan Dershowitz to be his lawyer, who is also accused of having sex with Epstein's child prostitutes, and who also worked as Epstein's lawyer.  It's too bad you live in a false reality and have unbridled devotion to Trump.  Because with your anti-Epstein, anti-pedophile values, if you simply looked honestly at Trump, you would realize that he's the worst one there is, and then maybe you would walk away from the Trump cult for good.

I guess this might explain some of that.   I’ve ran into some weird people but nothing like the one Key is portraying.  Makes me wonder wtf is wrong with Florida.

@toniroberts8117,"Monk Kenyon  Well thank you.  And I wasn’t trying to imply that everyone (or even most) Floridians are mentally unstable but I’ve always wondered why my friend from Florida has so many bad experiences socializing with locals.  Then I see the comments in this post.  This Key and Peele episode mentions nothing about Florida but so many posts are saying things like “yup, this is Florida” (& not just in this thread mind you).    I spent several years in living in San Diego (many years ago) and never met someone like Key lol.  I’ve lived most my life in a small town on the Oregon Coast.   It’s pretty laid back.   We also have probably “better than average” access to adequate (& affordable) mental health treatment over here.  Or so I hear that.  😉",5년 전,0,

It was fun and I mingled with many Floridians and didn’t meet any crazy’s lol.   But yes I agree,  mentally people are everywhere,   But this thread was started by a Florida person “Lily” claiming this guy is from Florida about to raid Area 51.   So I get it.

Very random.  They didn’t know me,  didn’t know if I had insurance.

I got a new model 3 Tesla recently so I don’t have to worry about that anymore fortunately 😁 I’m personally not much of a weed smoker but I will occasionally put some CBD drops in my tea at night if I’m really sore from a workout or something.

They want to keep neighbor kids from breaking things in their property, they want to get rid of random birds or rabbits or whatever destroying their gardens, etc. Lots of confused people like that.

@superthickjonwick9734," DA BOUL BLACKLUNGZ  the part about it being quick doesn't sound right. But as i agree with the first half of your statement, there's usually 3 day waiting periods (at least in my state) it's not a very ""quick"" process that you described. Also a gun shop owner can simply choose not to sell to you because you are being very strange. From the ones I've talked to they take subtle cews if the person says something strange or off putting. I'm hoping you've taken the time to attempt to buy a gun, not gonna say you haven't, but from everyone I've talked to the process is not as streamline as you have described.",5년 전(수정됨),6,

@Athena_said," DA BOUL BLACKLUNGZ  You're literally describing one place, he could live in another state/city. The process of buying a gun in New York is not the same. In Hawaii you are required to have a permit which is only granted to people who really need it, people who actually do need it for protection. Other states/cities require a license followed up by a waiting period. Philadelphia is not the only place that exists in the US. Gun laws vary from state-city.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@Athena_said," DA BOUL BLACKLUNGZ  ""The first thing you said doesn't even make sense""  I have heard of the second amendment. If you look at Hawaii's gun laws, what you can find is that permits are not given to people often. They are primarily given to people who are in desperate need.  ""How do you decide who needs a permit and who doesn't"" -  Someone who has had their home broken into before, or someone who is in trouble, etc... I'm not quite sure. Hawaii's policies are the strictest policies in the country.  I know it's your right to bear arms. I never said it's not. I was explaining Hawaii's gun laws. ""He tried to say that my first comment seemed strange"" I'll go back and read his reply.  However, you also replied with ""I don't know what weird city/state you live in"" as if such policies barely exist, so it wasn't just him who was at fault.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

""Your gonna shoot arrows with shotgun shells attached to 'em to bank window to blow out the glass then you're gonna shoot a zip line through that window and you're gonna slide on into the hallway,  you're gonna be wearing roller skates so you can just skate on past the armed guard, who will be shooting at you, and you're gonna hope that they both won't hit your legs,  and, if they are aiming at your torso,  the suit of medieval armor will deflect the bullets . Then you're gonna hope to gather enough speed to burst through the big bank vault  at the end of the hallway  where you're gonna collect the money in a cartooon moneeyy bag."" ""-Well, NO.""

@TheNameTag,"The funny thing is I'm pretty sure that the shot gun shells attached to an arrow wouldn't break a bank window. Mainly because the shells need to be triggered in some way and I'm pretty sure that won't do it. Second bows are harder then you think to shot and I doubt an old man who is un trained would be able to use one accurately or with enough force behind it.  This also mean the zip line would most certainly not work either. And even if he managed to attach the zip line it wouldn't be secured and he would fall and hurt himself or die.  While the arrow stuff and zip line sounds really cool and might be do able with proper skill and training but still unlikely. The stuff he wants to do after he gets in the bank is just really stupid. But let's say he gets to the vault what now where's your get away car and now your cornered in a room with all the ""guards"" still alive and no hostages. To top it off your brilliant plan to use roller skates to dodge bullets is now ineffective because you would need to build up speed and well you don't have enough space to do it.",6년 전,0,

I always hoped to see another  comedy duet act as ingenious as those two were, that could lure the audience into their innocent appearing attention trap.  Then they would walk the onlooker slowly down a path that we the audience thought we know what will happen in the end.  But then they show us, in a very humorous and supposing accidental way, how stupid we are for thinking that we know anything at the same time, they themselves are victimized.  This is humor. I've been watching these two guys for many years and I think they are the best, as a duet and individually.  Very intelligent, deeply humorous people.

I can probably imagine peele as the customer but I don’t see key as pulling off the same kind of performance for the character of the clerk, like how peele talks in a monotone sort of white person voice with a bored expression type deal. I don’t see key doing that because I feel like he is generally more charismatic to play a character with a personality like what they pulled off with the clerk. I don’t know maybe that’s just over speculation but I’d call it good judgement for role selection anyways they both have their own things that give them a dynamic range of characters types to play as",6년 전,4,

@Praise___YaH,"Guys, HERE is THE TRUE SAVIOR  YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified for our sins, NOT jesus, and “HERE IS THE PROOF”  From the Ancient Semitic Scroll:  ""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moses wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)  Ancient Semitic Direct Translation Yad - ""Behold The Hand"" He - ""Behold the Breath"" Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion He - ""Behold the Breath""  “Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL”   PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified  That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote  Here is what they mean  YaH's Name: (Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)  YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)  YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”: Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)  How YaH arrives: YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...  Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”  The Hebrew Book of Isaiah  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.  Isaiah 43:11 I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.  Isaiah 45:5 I am YaH, and there is none else.",3년 전,0,
