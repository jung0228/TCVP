@burntbeansoup,"If you have a standard awkward normal-weight not curvy and not sticklike white person build, please try Lucky for jeans. They are so nice, at least in the low-mid waist versions I buy. They are all around $60 and Lucky offers so many discounts if you sign up and wait a few days.  If you think dr. Martens boots hurt and are hard to break in, try the Combs Women's Poly Casual Boots (or Combs W; they're not actually just for women, they're quite unisex) or other sneaker-material boots by them. For some reason, leather boots are fine with me, but the shape of docs hurts my ankles.",6개월 전(수정됨),0,

@dotdotdot...176,"I'm back watching this video after 3 years, having finally found the perfect pair of jeans for me! My criteria was: light blue or acid wash colour, appropriate leg length (usually jeans are too short for me), high waisted yet not tight or uncomfortable on the tummy, not skinny jeans for once, good quality denim, not super cheap fabric but not breaking the bank either. And the ones I got are light blue in good quality denim with a bit of stretch (but not like jeggings) so they are comfortable yet not unstructured, with a kind of wide leg at the perfect length for a kind of... 90s inspired look? Also the fact that they aren't skinny jeans makes them even more comfortable and also versatile for both winter or summer. I'm so happy with my new jeans!",3년 전,0,

@szdigi,the thing is when you buy cheaper ones the quality of it is also going to be cheap and if it lasts you under a year then thats not good becoz ur gonna have to constantly replace them. If you invest in good quality ones they will last you for years for example i brought a hoodie from a high end store and it lasted me 6 years and i only recently got rid of it. You are saving more money in the long run if you buy the good quality clothing.,3년 전,0,

@SeaGatos,A couple tips. I hope these help :) Affordable Jeans: I find that cotton on is also a good place to shop for jeans. $49-60ish in AUD. They have a few different styles so they work well with a few different body types. For me personally I have a thinner waist and wide hips and these fit perfectly.    White shoes: I know these aren’t sneakers but I have white converse and they go with everything!! There are lots of cool things in the already worn section and they usually go for a bout half price.

@moonface,"I keep coming back to this vid so here are some tips: -Write down all of these pieces, like a list, then check off all the things you already own, i.e. you might already have a white tee and some black boots but you're missing white sneakers and brallettes. -Customize! Customize! Customize! While some of the stuff in this vid are obviously good to have, like a good pair of jeans, some stuff might not work along with your style in the way you want them to. Normal black boots don't fit into my style super well, but mary janes and loafers do, and they are based on the same idea without being the exact same. Just finding mods to the list that work for you. I added separat points for good jeans WITH rips/holes and one WITHOUT rips/holes, because I love jeans with a distressed look.  -piggy backing off the last point, add stuff! Do you LOVE a good skirt? Do you wear hoodies twice a week? Then, add these things! I personally added a good pair of leggings, a pleated skirt, both simple and patterned, fun sneakers, a good backpack, and several other things that i found essential. -Don't be afraid to get multiple of the same item in diff colours. If you're working with a smaller wardrobe, it's often easier if you have a strict colour pallet. Maybe your thing is white, black, and beige. You find a top in white and you can envision 10 outfits with that top. If you get it in black aswell, suddenly you have 10 more outfits. This is also a great way of outfit repeating without actually outfit repeating. -when looking for fits and styles, don't look at what you're ""supposed"" to like, look at what you actually like. Just because low rise flare jeans are trendig rn does not mean I will be wearing them. Just because something looks good on someone else doesn't mean it'll look the same on you",4년 전,1,

(there are obv a lot that is to small tho don’t get me wrong here)  also kids, while your feet is growing, never buy a lot of pretty expensive shoes. just buy a pair of athletic shoes for summer, a pair of wintershoes that is water and cold/snow proof, maybe a pair of nice shoes for when that’s needed. +shoes for activities you need special shoes for (or whatever fits your day to day life) that’s what i did, i picked shoes that i could use, not many expensive shoes that i needed to be careful with. i always had one pair of summer running athletic shoes that i could run outside and play with without being scared(most in black) and a pair of wintershoes+ soccer and ski shoes.   the same with jackets.   only now that i’m pretty sure my feet has stopped growing i have bought shoes to style.  and winter jackets i just have one thicker black i like, and a thinner black.  please be careful when spending money on clothes when your still growing. i still buy a bunch of cheap clothes, because i know i’ll either grow out of the size, or the style.",4년 전,0,

I know not everyone is comfortable wearing dresses and heels and there's nothing wrong with wearing them, but these are just some options instead if you don't like heels or dresses. These are pretty much all unisex clothes so feel free to try these too if you're a girl.  Here they are:   Instead of a Nude Heel, get a nice pair of dress shoes. The color depends on what you normally wear but I would mostly recommend a brown dress shoe in an Oxford style but you can mix it up and get a Wingtip or Double Monk, etc. style too if you're adventurous.   I know that the chunky sweater she shows in the video may not be right for you for a variety of reasons. Try maybe an Aran Knit Sweater (beware though, they're itchy) in grey or cream.  Instead of the summer dress, you could instead get a loud short-sleeved dress shirt. Pattern is up to you but I recommend a floral or striped print.  The purse I guess just get a nice satchel or bag in your preferred style like a knapsack or something, whatever goes with your style.",4년 전,1,

@mommallama81,"Oh my god, I like you!!! You're super chaotic with a plan, it's amazing! The ""50 new outfits"", or whatever that video was called, was like the 7th video I watched in am attempt to get ideas for...redesigning my super exhausted shorts. So your video was not even close to on track hahaha still watched the whole thing. You are the only person I've heard give explanations for why you choose high waisted, why it's important to wear a lower heel when you have a super short skirt on. I think these kinds of tips should be taught, like as a general class or some shit. Very few people understand these concepts and then wonder why they dont get the look they're wanting.  Personally, I'm 5'1 (and 3/4, but whatever) and I wouldnt fall in the skinny category, but add that my torso is the longer half of me and I have huge boobs. Learning why  ""short and sexy"" jeans were no different on me, or that diagonal stripes help with a longer, thinner look has made huge differences in my fashion choices. Anyway, I ramble, point; loved the video, you are super fun, thank you for all the ideas. I'm still lost on the shorts but I have other ideas now lol",5년 전,0,

@Feliciatanktop,"This 100%. I’m 24 and I’m in the process of investing into quality clothes. I’ve gotten rid of all of the Forever 21, H&M, Zara, etc in my closet and just shop at sustainable stores with good quality clothes or I buy from goodwill outlets and thrift stores. I started building a tiny little jewelry collection with real gold. It’s expensive but once you become an adult and start making more money, you’re able to spend more on items that you can invest in. When I was a broke college kid I would buy $6 tops from Shein or something and the threads would be loose upon opening the package and would fall apart in the washer. It’s cheaper and better for the environment to buy one good quality pair of $95 jeans that’ll last forever than buying a new pair of crappy $25 FashionNova jeans every 6 months. The difference in wearing the nicer clothes knowing they’ll last a long time vs how I felt in my cheap Forever 21 clothes is astonishing",4년 전,638,

@viamustdie,"My problem is that my country has limited clothing. Stores here are so small and the variety of clothing is limited. I have a style that takes a lot of effort to put together, just because there is nothing I can do to find something nice. Oversized t-shirts that are either monochrome or with a logo on the front, mum jeans, regular jeans that I can cuff the ends, nice comfortable but sometimes cute sweaters/hoodies. I have a very Skater Girl-y/Tomboy-ish aesthetic, so that means that I cannot find anything. If I go to the men's section in stores I might find something, but money plays a huge role too. Clothing is so expensive, so I find my self going to stores that have cheap clothes, only to realise that they have nothing I like. They focus on one theme and that's it. There is no variety. Everything is way too girly and weird. My wardrobe consists of 5 t-shirts, 3 hoodies, 3 pairs of jeans, 3 pairs of shorts, 2 jackets, a pair of leggings for exercising and that's it.

@DozyEclipse,Jeans/shoes/bras are my enemy. Swear I will have to go on a full on shopping spree because I dont even know my bra size. I have 2 pairs of high rise jeans (they are decent but not the best for my body ratio -superdry) and tones of jeans I hate. I have one pair of white trainers and I have 2 pairs of black boots (My fav of the 2 has an open sole mouth...rip and the other pair is extremely tight around my foot around the top). I have a high heel boots I like but don't wear too much because I walk almost every where (45 mins to and from college). Also my shoe size can go from a 6 1/2 to a 5 for some reason. My safe bet is with skirt and tights with any top. I need to buy more skirts because I only have 2 but they are a god send. One is a bit small and poor quality and extremely light fabric (blows up way too much which is bad especially living in england) but I wore it a lot ;-;. I do have money from birthdays and other things but I hardly spend. I always look for my parents approval but I'm 17 for christ sake.Telling you... if I asked if I could buy dr martens asked just for my 18th birthday if could I get them they would say no we can find them in a charity shop.

Try the clothes that YOU like. It's not necesary to buy expensive clothes, just buy what looks good on you. 3. If none of this works, try using oversized clothing, so you will not look very skinny.

@adeletaylor2883," @Sneha-de9xu  Hi! i could be considered pretty skinny. The first advice I have for you is to not call yourself ugly, because even if you DO look good in an outfit, you won't think so. This will do nothing for your mental health and your self esteem. I know it harder than it looks, but it's possible. Tell yourself everyday the thing you like about how you look and soon enough the ""flaws"" won't bother you so much. The next thing I would suggest when it comes to clothes is find what you like! Wear the things you like. Quality is better than the quanity of clothing for sure in this regard. Styling choices I personally think help as a skinny person is that I personally enjoy wearing slightly baggy shirts and tucking them in, if you don't like this look don't do it but it will make you look slightly less skinny and put together. If you like clothes with puffed sleeves I would wear them because it can help your shoulders be more broad looking, and in the fall and winter layering always looks good! I personally like long cardigans as well for this step, but you can do whatever suits you",4년 전,5,

Nobody says you have to go for the most expensive or well known brands. But do some research into the quality and sustainability of your clothing, buy one pricy item instead of five cheap ones and save in the long run. If you can’t spend 70$ out of pocket, pay in installments, eg on ASOS where you can find a bunch of high quality brands. It might hurt more at first but the outcome will be amazing.",5년 전,1,

This was a myth created by fans who formed an unhealthy parasocial relationship towards her content. She's always tried to be MORE sustainable not FULLY sustainable. She also still shops and promotes those brands because she realizes her fans (and maybe herself to an extent) cannot afford to constantly purchase pieces in the $100-$300 range. In fact, in this video alone, people are complaining about how expensive everything she's wearing is when most of it is sustainable/small business focused.",5년 전,190,

Like 21? 22? Last time I checked most undergrad students don’t exactly have the money or accessibility to get sustainable fashion for everything. So give her a break.

@christianarowan1921,Have I got some tips for you guys to get clothes cheap and sustainably!  1. Use apps! My favorites are poshmark and mericari. A lot of Youtubers get sponsored by threadup but I found that it’s harder to find things in larger sizes that look cute and it really just takes a longer time so I like poshmark and mericari better.         - Tips for poshmark and mericari         - Look up specific things and use filters to find the best thing.          - Filter from lowest price to highest price and get past all the bundles that are $3. $4 and up is normally just what you’re looking for.          - Don’t be afraid to fix something that’s broken (I got a pair of vans for $5 because they had some black on them and I painted them with white fabric paint and they look brand new.)  2. Even if you think your thrift store doesn’t have cute stuff go there anyway and look around and see what you like and what you don’t. Try on things and see what fits you. Also what you like the best even if it’s not a cute pattern or it’s not a cute color. You can figure out what you like. Like skinny or straight jeans or normal or crop tops. Find brand you like and look it up on poshmark and mericari later and see if you can find any good deals. You might even find some things you like at the thrift store.,5년 전,1,

@viamustdie,"While you keep eye-rolling, I agree with those people. A lot of clothes today that are good quality and look good are hella expensive. And now everyone will say (you too probably) : ""then why don't they just go to the thrift store? It's so eAsY"", yet they don't realise that in many countries thrift stores are either: 1) extinct or 2) impossible to find. Europe isn't like the US.

@siiri8902," @viamustdie  I don't really get this whole complaining about European second hand store options. I live in a small town in Finland yet I love thrifting! It's different if you literally live in the middle of nowhere, but if you have clothing stores near you you'll likely have some kind of second-hand option as well, and thrifting online is possible too. I feel like some people have this idea that when you walk into an American thrift store it'll just all be gorgeous clothing, but thrifting is always gonna be looking through loads of ugly pieces to find something great. The ""we're poor"" argument just doesn't really make sense because thrifted clothing is by far the cheapest stuff you can get.",5년 전,1,

@christianarowan1921,"Also if you are broke the next time you want to get a coffee or get something to eat save up  that money and get clothes like a three dollar coffee each day could add up to a lot of money to spend on clothes it is matters on what you want.   Also for the people out there who are still in school and their parents give the money to go eat out sometimes get the cheapest thing on the menu and water and give them back some of the money and keep a little bit of it and say that up overtime and get clothes.

@siennafreyja5400,This video but for people on a budget: Topshop for none stretch jeans are 100% cotton. ASOS 98% 2% elastaine for stretchy jeans. (£20-£40) For clothing anything that’s 100% cotton from anywhere for long lasting t-shirts and polo necks. 1 statement nice top. For jumpers 100% silk and cashmere at the thrift. For shoes: dr martens are a shout ngl. You can get them for £50 on depop and in sales. Thrifting is your best friend but always check the fabric. For bags look for sturdy materials that aren’t too difficult to open again from anywhere. For bras Calvin Klein. You can buy this half price at tk maxx. My personal recommendation would be Calvin Klein bralettes for someone who needs some support but not loads. I can jump up and down in them and get enough support for it not to hurt. I am 32D/DD.

Buy less, buy smarter folks.

You’re absolutely right that not everyone, in fact most people nowadays, can not afford to drop like $300 on a locally made, sustainably-sourced fabric blah blah blah piece of clothing. However, when I was cleaning out my closet from high school I found 4 coats/jackets that were all from fast fashion brands and all had torn too many times or fallen apart in some way beyond fixing (I kept them bc I’m bad at letting go of stuff lmao) and when I looked up the prices of the coats or similar styles from the same brands it was more than the coat I had purchased from a slow-fashion brand from Toronto that I’ve had for 5 years now with only a button falling off in that time. So yes, I didn’t have the money but had I been smarter and saved a bit more of my paycheque instead of spending it on dumb stuff I could have bought a coat that lasted so much longer than any of the “affordable” coats ever did.

PS: This is probably where your wealthy relative shops, so you don’t think of looking, but check the sale section of Nordstrom, or Nordstrom Rack! You can find some great sales on expensive or mid-priced jeans (Madewell, Kut from the Kloth,  Joe’s, 7 for all mankind, AG,  Frame, Paige, etc), and great quality, attractive bras that are 50% off (Natori, Calvin Klein, Wacoal, Chantelle, even La Perla). You may not find anything on your first pass, but if you browse every few weeks, it seems like the turnover rate is pretty high, so there are always new sale items. They won’t be thrift store prices, but Nordstrom’s has free, anytime returns  (but double check for the Rack, policy varies and some items are final sale), shipping is free and quick, and the apps are easy to navigate.  If you’re into makeup, the Rack has some great deals on regular and discontinued items.  Btw, I have no affiliation w/Nordstrom’s, but I recently discovered the sale section and thought others might find it as interesting to browse as I have.",5년 전,4,

One of my favorite pairs of jeans that I've been wearing for years were originally 70€ (pretty comparable to $70) but they were literally the last size of that model on the sales rack and I got them for 20€!",5년 전,8,
@DiggandDugg," @siiri8902  yes, this! It's important to check the materials and go for a very high denim content with just a bit of elastin so your jeans can last a long time and maintain their shape. Also if there is any elastin it's important not to wash them on very high temperatures as that burns it (its a variant of plastic) which will destroy the overall Jean shape and stretch. Some models of jeans don't need any but skinny jeans will usely need to be at least a bit stretchy. But stuff like jeggings shouldn't even be considered jeans to be fair. They have barely any if at all denim in them, hence why they are cheap. But thrift shops can be a godsend for jeans since they last so long!",5년 전,2,

@vrmyllion7120," @NormallyImKim  I think the thing with essentials is that they're meant to be an investment. Because they're ""essential"", you'll obviously want to have at least some, so why not spend more money on one piece that'll last you for a long time thanks to the good quality vs. a cheaper piece that'll be ruined a lot sooner. Think about the price of the clothing divided by how many times you wear it before you get rid of it. Generally, the more expensive pieces will actually be more worth it because they last so much longer and as long as you wear them a lot, they'll be worth the money you've spent on them.    Of course everyone has different financial situations, but even for those who can't easily afford moderately priced clothing, it'd be good to save up for a piece that lasts longer rather than run through $5 pieces consistently.",5년 전,138,
@lizwoodard7726,"it's not even like that imo.. clothing that's cheap is usually so ""affordable"" because it's made of poor material and it was fashioned poorly. a friend of mine used to say ""we can't afford to buy cheap"" because usually cheaper items don't last nearly as long so the more pricey things tend to be an investment",5년 전,82,
@LifeLostSoul," @milknight5181  Expect she isn't mentioning sustainable brands. Nike is not a sustainable shoe company that intends for their shoes to be repaired and worn for 30 years. Most expensive designer brands are on the fast fashion train and not making their clothing in a way that it's going to last. Those ""brands that we have known forever"" just means they still have good marketing, not that they aren't going to fall apart a year and a half from now.   Tips like buying a pair of 100% cotton jeans and that they might cost a little bit more yes that is a good tip for getting something that lasts longer.

@tjbierle,"I'm coming back 4 months after watching this video to share a PSA: EXPENSIVE JEANS ARE NOTICEABLE! I never cared too much about jeans because they're expensive as heck, but after I got smarter with shopping I'm never going back. I've never bought an expensive pair of jeans for full price but thanks to depop I have 4 pairs of vintage and/or name brand 100% cotton jeans and since then my jean radar has been beeping. I don't know how, but I really notice jeans in an outfit now. Even when browsing on depop I can tell whether or not jeans are good quality or not just from the picture. And that means I notice on the daily with people I meet, too. Obviously it doesn't matter in the long run if people have good jeans on or not, but good jeans do stand out. I've become more confident when I wear jeans because I know they fit well and look good. I really agree with Ashley that a good pair of jeans changes the whole game. But if you don't have the $100 to spend and your thrift store is an abyss of grandpa clothes, definitely try depop, there's so much selection.",6년 전,1천,

You think the pop stars are going to wear the same pieces over and over again? Their career would be over if that's what they did.

@AnjaliBakhru,"​ @jamilgotcher5456  Every day people shouldn't be held to the same standards as pop stars, because often pop stars get sent clothes to wear! Plus, we don't really see what they wear off duty. That pop star level of wardrobe novelty is almost all fabricated. I can understand you getting bored of a unique piece if you wear it over and over, but the comment and video were talking about basics (white tees, jeans, etc). These are meant to be repeated for their simplicity. Also, as others said, if someone finds you boring because of your clothing, you probably don't want to be friends with people who make decisions so superficially.

@matchamini,"Everything mentioned:  Denim jeans — 5% spandex max. The rest is cotton. 100% cotton is also recommended. Skinny jeans can be uncomfortable, go for a straight cut if you prefer more mobility. Ankle length is preferred. Jeans with a raw hem are easy to alter if they are too long.   Denim Shorts — Same material as jeans, buy distressed jeans a bit longer as they will shrink in length as the distressed part moves up. Buy a size up if you want more length.   Black boots — Doc martins are a good choice. If getting heeled boots get a block heel. Square toe is preferred over round toe. Get boots a bit more form fitting around ankle rather than one with a loose ankle.  White sneakers — Solid white is preferred due to versatility, chunky/thicker soled shoes are good.  Nude heels — Pointed toe is preferred, block heels recommended due to walking.  Bras — VICTORIA SECRET SUCKS!! Lace bras work if it’s gonna be seen. Calvin Klein works too.  T-Shirts — Solid white and solid black t-shirts. Try on a ton and pay attention to details. 100% cotton, you can go a size up  White blouse - Details to make it elevated so you can pair it.  Black turtleneck — High versatile, good for layering, body suit is good so you can tuck it.   Sweater — Crew necks are boring, thrifting is good, 100% silk or cashmere  Pattern dress — New little black dress, good fit, get a good zipper, strap dresses work for layering  Denim jacket — Can find one at thrift store,  if not in women’s check mens, plain ones work well  Leather jacket — Larger/ dolman sleeve allow for more arm mobility, check hardware  Black purse — leather works, interesting hardware, easy to open, easy to wear, easy to close",6년 전,5,

@juliagonzalez5199,"hi i know i'm really late to this but! i wanna share some ways you can always try to make money or find affordable clothes. i have seen a few people replying to your comment with the same ideas but they could really help. first with finding affordable clothes: alwayssss look for sales!! whether they're from magazines, online store codes, youtube promo codes or sales in stores... always look for sales. with youtube promo codes you can just search the store you want the code for, maybe throw in the word 'haul' and 'promo code' & the current year, you should be able to find something ;) some affordable clothing websites:  boohoo - cute shoes and accessories for very affordable prices. and actually right now, they have a sale online which is GREAT!! believe it's like 60% off women's clothes which is awesome.  pull & bear - uk brand i believe and deliver to US but great quality clothes and fairly priced.  primark - another uk brand, also deliver to US, they have stores on the east coast. for the online store in the US they don't have as many options but its still very affordable and great quality. i love their bathing suits. romwe/shein - if you are looking for very inexpensive clothes, these websites are great. sometimes the material of the clothes can be a little cheap and necessarily look like the picture but i mean, you get what you pay for haha forever 21 - always a great place to look for basics and occasionally some cute pieces hollister - if you are tall like me, they have great skinny jeans that you can find only online i believe. but! they have the option for them to come in a tall size which i love. they usually have sales going on too.  pacsun - they usually have sales or deals going on. super cute tops and shorts.  urban outfitters - if you are looking for more trendy clothes this store has it all but it can be veryyyy expensive. i recommend going to the sale section or always looking for deals.  & finally you can always thrift!! if you go and don't find anything you love, don't feel discouraged!!! go back another day or try a different thrift store bc they are always getting donations and they have new things everyday so don't lose hope! keep looking. also look through everything! even in different sections than you normally would look. it's worth a shot. you can always alter the clothes you thrifted too! there are so many other great, affordable stores. these are just some off the top of my head. but i can't stress enough how important and underrated sales are! don't ignore the annoying popups for a certain percent off on online stores! use them!! now some ways to make money: babysit - make sure you know the parents and have a mutual trust. that is important do chores around the house - ask if your parents/guardians can compensate and give you a little bit of an allowance in return!  ask neighbors (elderly or young with young children) if you can help with any work around the house and/or yard - even if they don't offer to pay you, showing some neighborly love always makes someone and yourself feel good. start a little dog walking business - good exercise and who doesn't love dogs! sell some of your clothes online finally you can  collect shoes from neighbors and family to donate to angelbins - this is great because they pay you by the pound in return for your shoes. i'm not sure how much they pay so it would be great to look into. but the heavier the better! i'm so sorry this is soooo wordy but i wanted to help the best i can with as much detail as possible.  i hope this helps!!!  xoxo, julia <3",5년 전,2,

@samichait4555,Notes for me:  Jeans - high rise make your torso look short - tight-ish - ankle length so cut it or roll - stiff denim lasts longer - no more than 5% spandex    Denim shorts - size a little up so you can breathe - super short shorts draw attention to your thighs and figure - mid way shorts should fit your legs   Black boots - square toe is 70s - ankle area should hug the ankle so it doesnt take away from outfit - stitching    White sneaker - nike air force 1 - look for good stitching - can be paired with actually anything   Heels - neutral so leg looks longer - dont walk in grass with a thin heel - steve maddens  Bras - victoria secret sucks - calvin klein - elastic can work just as well as underwire - dont wear the wrong size   Black White T shirts - sleeves on arms change look - shoulders drape - pair with blue shorts or jeans   White Blouse - show off colar bone - show a little skin but keep it professional too  Black turtleneck - pair with everything - easy to layer - wear big necklaces over it and earrings   Sweater - no crew necks they are boring - no pilling so try not to wash it too often   Dress - a good fit - high quality zipper - draw attention up - collared dresses bring the attention there  Denim Jacket - try find a plain wash - contrast stitching is cute - over size - be mobile in it - avoid a black leather jacket over black   Leather Jacket - the way the sleeve fits to move easy - length so it keeps your figure - hardware should be neutral   Black purse - hardware should match your shoes - high quality material - keep simply accents   This is just for me,6년 전,0,

@siennafreyja5400,This video but for people on a budget: Topshop for none stretch jeans are 100% cotton. ASOS 98% 2% elastaine for stretchy jeans. (£20-£40) For clothing anything that’s 100% cotton from anywhere for long lasting t-shirts and polo necks. 1 statement nice top. For jumpers 100% silk and cashmere at the thrift. For shoes: dr martens are a shout ngl. You can get them for £50 on depop and in sales. Thrifting is your best friend but always check the fabric. For bags look for sturdy materials that aren’t too difficult to open again from anywhere. For bras Calvin Klein. You can buy this half price at tk maxx. My personal recommendation would be Calvin Klein bralettes for someone who needs some support but not loads. I can jump up and down in them and get enough support for it not to hurt. I am 32D/DD. This was my take away. Here you go x,5년 전,15,

I know a lot of people think it is too much money for one piece but to do this you HAVE to take into consideration we buy so many 10-20$ pieces that never last and we are literally throwing money away by doing so... it is satisfying IN THE MOMENT but in the long term these items just won't last and we will keep forcing ourselves into a cycle of poor quality clothes that constantly need to be replaced",6년 전,0,

@sleephollow66,"A tip for Canadians: I try to thrift practically everything I can, because I'm fortunate enough to live like 10 minutes away from a huge Value Village and like 5 other thrift stores, but I have had an impossible time finding good ""Mom Jeans"" at any thrift store. So I actually bought some from Bluenotes and they are such good, sturdy jeans. I've never had an actual pair of jeans (not jeggings) from Bluenotes tear in the thighs or crotch. A lot of the other clothes aren't always amazing in quality; they're pretty on par with places like Forever 21 but the jeans themselves are, in my experience, always good quality.   **Side note: If you're like me and you worry about buying from ethical retailers, I will say Bluenotes has a 3/5 star ethical rating because the materials used to make the clothes are not always acquired from ethically produced suppliers, but to the best of my knowledge (I could be sorely wrong but I did research them, though it's a little difficult to find information on Canada based retailers), they produce the garments themselves through ethical labor.",6년 전,0,

@Jelloitsme,"Notawhore Just because you can buy tons of things doesn’t mean you should. While I don’t think $82 for a shirt is reasonable, neither is purchasing new shirts which creates so much waste. It isn’t bad to have a couple of shirts, but not very many and probably not the cheap fast fashion ones. This isn’t the most ethical practice, which is part of the reason that one shirt is $82. Sorry to get preachy, but as Ashley does talk about ethical fashion on her channel, I thought I’d add this in.",6년 전,11,

Ive personally gone through trying 7 different bras from the u.k. through trial and error and only one brand fit.

@gittevandevelde2208,"Honestly I hate these 'closet essential' videos because literally nothign is essential if you live in a warm tropical climate clothes as a whole are optional but you're fun so I clicked anyway.  Also, I like jeans but I don't like blue so I'm fucked. I tried dying jeans but because the colours of the dye and original mix the faded parts end up more green/yellow than the non-faded parts which are vaguely bluegreen.  Also, about vintage levi's: I am a size 24 - 25 and YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES. SO.HARD.TO.FIND. and honestly recently I got a 25 one and already needed to take it in and the pockets are already slightly displaced so they can't be bigger than that for me to take them in and them to still look decent... So in the brand I bought them in, 24 it is and it sucks. It also sucks because sometimes I might actually need a 25 in my thighs and butt but still a 24 or even a non-existent 23 in my waist and honestly I've given up on jeans.

Everybody would obviously have expensive, flattering redone jeans or a $60 urban outfitters dress if they could afford them, but that isn't the case.

They also have a removable insole so if they feel a little tight when you get them, whip out the insole and pop them back in when you've worn them a few times. Hope this helps!",6년 전,0,

I may know little to nothing about modern fashioned clothing but I've known since I was 5 that the secret to VS is ill-fitting low size-range bras, specifically for larger chested or breasted women... and I'm almost 36. (I'm sure they work well for some people, and if not, well some of them are pretty, right? I just wish there weren't people who feel the need to wear ill-fitting, painful bras that don't even fit them correctly.)

@Paper_nylon,"I think the main takeaway from most closet essential videos - including this one, is to find a good fit for your body! Even spending lots of money on an item like a pair of jeans is worth it because you know it'll last long. And when it fits you well, you're likely to feel confident in it, want to wear it more often, and be able to pair more outfits with it. That's good value for your buck!   Some more criteria that Ashley mentioned: - Longevity, materials and its quality, COMFORT (for shoes too), the silhouette of the piece that is flattering for YOU, attention to detail (hardware, stitching, etc)   And even functionality of a piece may be important, like how you can easily access your purse, or slip on a pair of shoes, even that body suit she mentioned.    All of these tips aren't meant for you to exactly go out and buy yourself a leather jacket or a frilly top if you aren't into it -- use those criteria's to make your own!

@blueberrymomo4497,"Honestly I'm more picky with my jeans than with what I put on my hair and I'm the type to overanalize ingredients and squat in the same alley trying to decide what to buy for hours.  That being said, I don't trust what they write about fabric content. 100% cotton won't feel the same every time no matter if we're talking about cotton used for jeans or t-shirts.   I like my jeans thick and stuff but no to the extent even hulk wouldn't rip it because they don't sit nicely on my body. Still, they need to have decent amount of strength or else they will look bad after two months. The other type of jeans is thick but very stretchy jean but it's so fuckin rare you could break your legs trying to find one pair. I swear they don't change their shape at all for years and always look like new, even in knee and crotch area. I have no idea what they make them from but this type of fabric is my holy grail. They're magic. I've only menaged to hunt down two pairs of these jeans so far 😖 well, at least it's something c:  And jogging jeans are shitty. They look horrible after first wash and are unflattering and urghhh. So many things were done wrong with them.

@annak5773, @untitled1464  but they do combine this discount with the student discount or birthday discount if you have either of those! That way you can get an extra 15 or 25 percent off.

@yuhaino,"Hey Ashley! I love your videos! You helped me improve my clothing style a lot!  I just wanted to make a request. Us people with Low or High feet arch are struggling really much with finding nice shoes that also fit us. Personally, I have a higher feet arch than average; which causes pain, decreases the amount of exercise that can be done easily, and many more problems. But the issue is, e.g. I always have to wear sports shoes/sneakers, which are very comfortable yes but not that stylish. I tried to do as much research as I can but the ones that are fitting are VERY expensive.  (Around my area/I’m from a foreign country)  I also need to put these or make extra insoles to put inside my shoes. Some shoes don’t support extra insoles. It’s just one giant mess.  I was wondering if you could help us people with these kind of issues? We’d really appreciate it... Thanks in advance!",6년 전,1,
