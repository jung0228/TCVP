@FranciscoRuiz500,"The rough-looking cloud is cavitation caused by the water jet that precedes the bullet. It contains vortices moving so fast that their cores turn to vapor at low pressure, but all the bubbles are on the surface of a cylinder, with liquid water inside. The smooth cloud is supercavitation caused by the bullet pushing water outwardly as it advances, as in a shock wave. The inside is low-pressure water vapor. Creating this bubble takes a lot of energy, which comes from the kinetic energy of the bullet. Eventually, the low pressure inside the bubbles causes the water to return to the center. It bounces back because a very high pressure is created when the water collides with itself in the center. This is what destroys propellers that are run so fast that they produce cavitation.",2년 전,3,

@FranciscoRuiz500,"If the pressure in front of the bullet were greater than behind it, the bullet would stop inside the barrel. It does not, so that means that the pressure in front is smaller than behind. Since the barrel behind the bullet does not burst from that pressure, neither does it from the pressure built-up in front of the bullet. Pressure in the barrel is greatest around the time when the bullet starts moving inside, and in that case it won't make any difference what's in front of the bullet.",2년 전,0,
@piercearora7681, @FranciscoRuiz500  I see,2년 전,0,
@johnmcgovern3806," @FranciscoRuiz500  I thought the barrel would split too, it must be very strong. Firing under water with barrel full of water is different because there is a lot more mass to get moving therefor more time for the powder to burn completely before the bullet and water leave the barrel. Where as above water the space behind the bullet expands quicker while the powder is still burning resulting in lower total pressure. There must be much higher total pressure behind the bullet when fired under water. Older people know about rifles exploding when shooting fish with the barrel in the water. I guess steel composition has improved since then.",2년 전,0,

@Will_Forge,"Hey @SmarterEveryDay, quick question: Which is better, a round tip bullet or a cone under water? Would the increased pressure mean that a rounder tip would fly straighter due to suffering less internal vibrations (like a submarine trying to run quieter), or would a long tip be better all around since a bullet is solid instead of hollow like a submarine? I noticed that in the slowmo guy's video the hollow point went straighter through the water, but they didn't mention how far either of their shots flew like you did, and they never mentioned the caliber of bullet. I also noticed that your AK bullet tumbled much more than theirs did, probably due to its more conical shape and internal vibrations, as well as the length of the round with more mass at the tail end. Once sideways, I imagine it lost a lot of accuracy, and likely a lot of momentum. Given it has higher mass and more powder, it might have still flown just as far or even farther, but I still wonder which of the three flew the farthest and the straightest.  I wonder all of these things because I'm making a Sci-fi that takes place on a planet with higher air pressure, and warfare is involved. I'm curious which bullet would be more effective on an alien world with a soupy atmosphere. That being said, water is still significantly more dense and resistant than the atmosphere of my alien world, so maybe it wouldn't ultimately matter too much. So instead, this is probably more just a curiosity.",3년 전,1,

@rickygoetz540,"Awesome video!  I don't believe the water is cavitating in the barrel, though.  Due to the hydraulic pressure induced by the projectile, the fluid is still in laminar flow much like the inside of an aerosol can.  Once the fluid reaches the end of the barrel (the nozzle), the water column trips into turbulent flow and either vaporizes and/or goes aerosol (a.k.a. cavitates)--Evident by the cloud starting in the flash suppressor and mushroom head coming out of the barrel first.  The Rayleigh-Plesset principle actually starts at the interface of those two pressure condition (hydraulic-to-ambient).  I wish there was an infra-red version of this video, because I would love to see the heat dissipation signature once the propellant gas and residue leave the barrel.  You must have major cahones to pull the trigger on that AKlacker.  I would never risk a barrel burst like that, even under water.",4년 전,0,

@Mass_hole508,2:38 I thought ballistics jell was cool to see. As in the wound cavity and penetration.  This was way better. Seeing the gas expanding and retracting. Even better was the mini explosions or shockwaves was amazing. Then the view from the surface instantly made me realize how much it looks like a depth charge. On a smaller scale obviously. It makes sense though both explosions underwater. Seeing all this makes me respect submariners especially WW1 & WW2. I can't imagine what it would've been like for them.  Anyway awesome work it looks absolutely amazing.  P.S. seeing as i can only give this 1 thumbs up through YouTube heres 2 more.👍👍,4년 전,0,

@hockeyguy820,"I don't think Destin can invoke Bernoulli's principle as simply as he did in this video. It's not correct to say ""faster moving fluids exert less pressure"". The fluid flows you are comparing first have to start out at the same total pressure. A more precise statement of Bernoulli's equation is ""the total pressure of a fluid (static pressure plus dynamic pressure) is constant along a streamline"". These initial conditions for Bernoulli's equation are not satisfied in the case described here. An example of this is blowing a jet of air out of your mouth. This jet of air does not intrinsically have a lower static pressure than the surrounding (still) air because as you blew it out of your mouth you increased its total pressure. The two parcels of air you are trying to compare did not start at the same total pressure.",5년 전,1,

@user-td1zo3tv9p,"Very interesting video and thorough analysis of what is happening during the phases of discharge of the round, but I have a thought or two about the ""flash,"" or ""sonoluminescence"" (sp?) as you describe it, attributing the flash to sunlight reflection.  While that is certainly a possibility, I would posit this concept to run by you for your consideration.  I've seen additional video footage made by others where they were NOT outside in direct sunlight, so the optical appearance of the flash cannot be attributed to sunlight reflection.  This is where my idea factors in. Feel free to give your thoughts as well. MY suggestion is that unburned gunpowder (the dark cloud) that exists the bore of the gun, while inside the ""bubble"" is compressed as the bubble collapses creating an ersatz chamber outside of the gun itself, actually.  As the unburned powder is compressed and consisting of sufficient heat and oxygen molecules to support combustion, the UNBURNED powder is then ignited causing the second flash. Think about it for a moment.  We always (?) see a large fireball upon detonation of the cartridge powder that occurs OUTSIDE the bore. That all is unburned powder still burning outside of the barrel which causes the flash. So those powder particles, still needing to burn off, are given the means to do so inside the expanding then contracting bubble, still hot enough to support ignition, then doing so when the conditions inside the bubble/chamber are just right. And the rebounding bubble as you point out bounces, if you will, through several cycles until the atmospheric conditions equalize. So there you have it. My thoughts on the cause and effects of the underwater ""flash"" that happens as the bubble collapses.  Whatchya think? Hopefully you revisit these posts or get notifications that will suggest to you to go back and read new contributions to your original post. I look forward to reading about your new revelation on the subject, assuming you have some. In the meantime I hope you and yours are all safe and sound during these troubling times.

The same pressure that pushes the bullet forwards is what pushes now the empty shell from the cartridge and the bolt backwards. If the bolt is not locked the bolt would go back way to soon and a lot of the gasses and the energy will simply be lost. The reason we have those gas operated rifles is so we give maximum inertia to the bullet possible but not wait to much because if the bolt is unlocked too late then the gases will escape the barrel after the bullet has come out and there won't be any pressure left to cycle the bolt. That's why the position of the small hole on the barrel that takes small part of the gas pressure to unlock the bolt is so important - too close to the end of the barrel - you risk experiencing a jam, too close to the entrance - the bolt will unlock and the pressure will escape way too soon before the bullet gets is maximum speed.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@cadeperkins,"Also, remember that pressure is very much directional.  It is simply an average force over an area... and the force in a liquid or gas can be directed so that more of the average motion of the particles are in a certain direction and hence the average force exerted is also higher in that direction.  In static equilibrium, pressure is essentially equal in all directions over a small surface area at the same depth.  But while flowing the pressure is generally only lower at the boundaries orthogonal to the flow.  The pressure is actually higher along and in the direction of the flow than against the boundaries of the flow (i.e. tube walls).  If the pressure were also lower in the direction of the flow, it would be lower than the water outside the barrel and so it would not escape the barrel, rather it would be pushed back further inside the barrel by the higher-pressure water outside!  But that's not what happens.  I mention this because like so many other subtle--but often repeated--incomplete ideas in science can spread misconception later on.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@cadeperkins,"At the point of implosion when there is a flash of light (and Destin considers sonar luminescence), notice that the image of the muzzle (and the rest of the frame for that matter) jostles back and forth.  I would guess that about the same time it takes for the first bubble implosion is when the most energetic wave reaches the mirror box.  It would be no coincidence that the bubble oscillation would then be in phase with the waves reaching the mirror.  So Destin is likely correct that it is not sonar luminescence and likely a ""reflection of the sunlight"", but more specifically the change in apparent brightness is due to variation in angle of combined refraction/reflection through the mirror box.  If the camera were moved or the box manually vibrated, one might also see a change in the apparent brightness of the overall image.  The effect is just more pronounced when it occurs in sync with the bubbles.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@ericwilliams2317,"Really interesting, but there's one thing I don't get. Why is it that at the point of firing the chamber doesn't blow up under the extra pressure created by trying to blast a column of water out the barrel as well as a bullet? i.e. when reloading for different weight bullets, you have to take into account the weight of the projectile and match it against the right powder ( light bullets - faster burning powder / heavy bullets - slower burning powder) so when there is a barrel full of water, its like having a ""LOT"" more weight to shove - like a ""MUCH"" heavier bullet.  Also, at the point of ignition a brass case expands into the chamber, effectively gripping the chamber walls and relieves backwards pressure on on the bolt face by not  not moving, or slipping back against it. So how come the bolt face wasn't damaged by the case not being driven back much harder against it. (sorry, I hope these questions made sense?)",6년 전,0,

@ArthurHau,"The spinning of a bullet due to the rifling (which makes the bullet travel faster) has created ripples when it travels through water, just like the case of an electron traveling through space! An electron behaves like wave because of its spinning! Check out the double slit experiment of electrons. If you can shoot two bullets out from two guns (simultaneously), you will be able to create interference pattern just like in the double slit experiment of electrons. I am not a physicist, but I know there is something wrong in the explanation of the behavior of an electron as a wave using quantum physics wave equations! The probability interpretation of the behavior of an electron is WRONG! That's why I am checking out youtube for the analogous phenomenon in water wave.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@TheTDSingh,"Hi. I think it would be wrong to compare cavitation happening here to a shock wave in front of a bullet in air. The flow across a bow shock actually experiences increase in pressure and that is where this analogy would be a bit misleading. For the same reason calling the smooth glass like structure on the left as bow shock would also be debatable. It should be more like an interface of different phases of water.

@fla-bushcraftprepper941,"Your video actually shows what a star ship would look like going to warp speed.  The effect you see in star wars or star trek is more fake. When you see the effect in your video, it would be more like that. Including the bubble forming as the projectile comes out of the end of the barrel. As the star ship, would be a high speed projectile.  The fake part of Hollywood is they do not understand physics. Once the star ship is moving at warp speed, in space, it would keep moving at that speed. No, there would be no way of stopping the ship, without is shredding into a trillion pieces.  In your video, the projectile has water as a resistance, but in space there is no resistance. Shutting down the warp field, would not slow down the ship. Creating an anti-warp field to stop the ship, would crush the ship. So in effect, your video proves Warp Speed is not a viable option, in space travel. It would be more feasible to fold space to move from one location to another. Doing that may cause damage to space though.   What I mean is, folding space could inadvertently sling a planet out of it's orbit. Because folding space and time, would build up energy and when you unfold it, that energy would be released and most likely, something will absorb some of, if not most of the energy, and will react like a slingshot. So one of the planets could sling or even the ship could sling, but there wold be a massive amount of energy released.",7년 전,0,

@DaveKeil,"This video is awesome! Great work.  :D  I skimmed through the thread and didn't see it mentioned, so I thought I would drop a comment.  A lot of people look at bernoulli and lose sight of what it's saying - it really only applies to static systems in a gravity field.  You have either pressure head or potential energy, and if you stab a hole in the tank at the bottom he pressure is converted to kinetic energy.   I'm not sure if you did that in your explanation at the end but I though I would put up how I'm thinking about what's happening and you can decide for yourself.    The instant the shot is fired the front of the bullet will transfer the pressure from behind the bullet and the water bullet system will be pushed out of the barrel as a slug. The pressure in the water in this instant has to increase because it is accelerating and we are putting energy into the system.  As the liquid water hits the end of the barrel it will act to accelerate the body of water around it in a turbulent spray like mess that we see in the video.  The momentum imparted here is enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the atmosphere and a bubble starts to form of near vacuum water vapor behind it.  The bullet is ejected and travels through the liquid water immediately in front of it driven by the gasses from combustion behind it.  it travels through the near vacuum and the gasses from combustion fill the bubble.  The bullet hits the far site of the vacuum and it's momentum is transferred in an organized fashion from the leading edge of the bullet.     As the bullet slows the angle that the momentum extends away from the bullet changes from near perpendicular when the speed of the bullet was near the speed of sound in water to near straight ahead of it as it's speed is much slower than that of the speed of sound in water.  The corkscrew pattern is a consequence of the bullet having spin and not imparting it's momentum to the water uniformly.  As the pressure from the atmosphere slows and reverses the momentum imparted to the water from the bullet, the bubbles stop expanding and start collapsing.  There is very little area to close from the entry hole of the bullet into the second bubble it made, and there are very little gasses in this bubble beyond water vapor.  The first bubble collapses and compresses the combustion gasses which forms a spring the incoming boundary of water bounces off of.  The second bubble collapses to almost nothing because there are no gasses in there, and as you were saying is a sono-luminescence candidate - although I don't think it will because the spin of the bullet will make the boundary helical and have uneven pressures at the boundary which will promote water vapor going back to water liquid.  Love your channel.  Wanted to put this out there as bernoulli was all the rage for a while and it was fashionable to talk in those terms when it was in vogue but it gets applied to a lot of areas where it's a really ineffective way of thinking through the problem (Airplane wings.. looking at you...).  I thought you might be interested in walking through a process around conserving momentum.  Momentum is always conserved.  If energy is also conserved than Bernoulli's equation can be used to yield equivalent results in sometimes more convent metrics. Note, Navier stokes - the equations fluid mechanics is based on - is all based on conservation on momentum.",7년 전,0,

@pisciatto,"Consider doing a slow motion video of steam bubble vapor collapse in subcooled water.      This is a waterhammer phenomena in which steam is blown into subcooled water at a slow rate to allow a steam bubble to form.     As its volume grows in the water, heat gets transferred to the surrounding subcooled water.      Then, in a very fast instant, the bubble collapses, causing the subcooled water to rush in and up the tube until its the end of the steam supply tube causing an amazing bang!    The use of high speed photography would be great to capture this very energetic event.Look it up in the waterhammer literature.   It is typically called ""watercannon.""Thanks.",7년 전,0,

Water is of course vastly different from air/gas because it can not be compressed. (hydraulic vs pneumatic) Essentially you have the mass of the volume of barrel full of water that is accelerated and displaced as the bullet travels through the bore. That water & bullet mass is enormous compared to just the bullet alone.   To me the weapon must be taxed to the hilt as to withstanding the pressure inside.   Isn't that enough pressure to risk damaging the gun?... I'd like to see if somehow the bore could remain sealed so no water enters it, perhaps as simple as tape over the end of the barrel to see the difference in how far the bullet travels.",8년 전,0,

@inrevenant,"there would be some measurable factor regarding the bullet's properties as it speeds away: aerodynamic stability of the bullet. if the bullet is fired from a very stable barrel, i.e. a sniper rifle barrel, you'd suppose that the bullet's rotation is also very stable, but here we have an AK-47.  from the AK-47 here, though; it's very visible in that the bullet's rotation is perturbed by the viscous nature of the water through which it travels; it is perturbed in a way that amplifies rotations than simply spinning: if the bullet were to only spin with an axis parallell to its trajectory, then the bullet supposedly would go some distance further until the water slowed it down - this would be more dangerous to superheroes swimming underwater away from danger.   but because the bullet spins with more axes, than merely the axis parallell to its trajectory, it begins to ""turn"" in a way which deflects the water, by way of its own surface. as such, the bullet dissipates a lot more kinetic energy into the water (compared to traveled distance), and slows down very quickly indeed.  however, realistically, i'm not sure how ""perfect"" of a bullet spin that any current technology would be able to make, so don't get too excited. most mechanical engineering devices (especially those that are mass produced) are quite ""imperfect""; even the more stable sniper barrels.",7년 전,11,
@inrevenant,"well, it's true that i found it hard to put this into words that would not confuse people; and i was very tired at the time of writing; so i simply called it by a term that i thought felt was descriptive of the phenomenon, yet not too inaccurate. first of all, i was thinking of it all from a bullet's own point of view as it travels, with direction of travel being somewhat vaguely defined.  tl;dr: i was trying to describe axial precession while tired, and all bullets do this to some degree. water as a medium for a bullet to travel through, affects motions like these much more than air, and so an imperfect motion like axial precession is heavily amplified vs distance travelled, compared to when bullets travel through air. a more ""stable barrel"", from my vague phrasing, would be able to create a ""more perfect shot/bullet trajectory"", although nothing is physically perfect. thus, a more ""stable barrel"" would be able to fire a round with less axial precession, thus allowing the round to travel further in any medium, though the effect would probably be easier to measure in an experiment like this underwater.  ### the barrel still simplified, the phenomenon i'm attempting to describe comes down to at least 3 factors having to do with the barrel, and from these came the term i called ""stable barrel""; though these factors will affect one another, i think it best to consider them separately at first:  1: the rifling inside a barrel will aid in a bullet's trajectory's stability, making it turn around, spin. through angular momentum conservation, the bullet will remain spinning around until this motion's energy has dissipated (and it will also continue to travel forwards until its forward momentum has dissipated - the sum of these two are constitual terms going into the bullet's kinetic energy) - thus having transferred its kinetic energy to the air which it travels through, transferring kinetic energy to create turbulence and shock waves, as well as heat.  2: the weight of the barrel will give you an idea of how much the fired round's physical interaction has an effect to to even move the barrel itself; the blast from the round will shock the barrel, and the flowing of air, or pressure interactions, or simply the transfer of momentum could cause the barrel to move significantly in more than 1 degree of freedom (as described in classical mechanics) - simply because although explosions happen radial, they are not always perfectly so, and thus such explosions will affect the material they happen in proportionally. in any case, with a barrel, one would want to reduce a material's ability to distribute accumulated energy, so that such an energy outlet only happens in 1 degree of freedom.  in practice this factor means that for a stable shot, you'd want a barrel that is heavy enough compared to the bullet, that the round's explosiove energy goes into moving the barrel backward, and backwards only, thus limiting the degrees of freedom for any disturbance of other resulting motions. (as an addendum here, though, with a rifled barrel, you'll know from Newton's laws that because the bullet ends up with a rotary motion, then the rifle would have to rotate negative to the bullet's rotary direction: technically, yes, the rifle does - but from principles of momentum transfer, and because air is a mediating actor of this motion, the rotary effect on the rifle measurable, though negligible. if you still want to remain technical, though, then the number of degrees of freedom that you want to limit a barrel's energy transfer for, would be 2.)  3: minute imperfections in the material (not quantum or anything, but tiny and small): weight distribution in the alloy; surfaces that are not perfectly straight when considering microscopical scales; or even the rifling on the inside may have a minutely imperfect rotation progression. there will always be some level of imperfections in any fabricated material.  simply put, physics is about making sure that the energy that you put into a system, is neither wasted, nor polluting the result one is trying to achieve. Neil deGrasse Tyson had a much better phrase for how to say that, though, when he did a live show along Wil Wheaton, and interviewd Wheaton about his character in Eureka. point is, that you as a physicist, engineer, even designer or architect; you have to take into account all the ways that the end product might not be as perfect in practice, as all the nice formulas you've used in creation a design would lead you to think.  imperfections in any barrel, even small, will have their effects become visible on larger scales when you fire a round from it - this is in theory proportional to the amount of energy you release with the round, though as a perhaps comical extremal point, in practice this would be limited to the amount energy of a round's explosive force that would be strong enough to  tear a barrel apart; higher energies than that would be completely irrelevant to the experiment.  ### the bullet consider the bullet as an observer from the side, you are observing a bullet being fired. now also taking into account how all these imperfections might interact with the bullet's trajectory only from the barrel_, you should realize that _you are in no way guaranteed that the only kinetic energy constituents of the travelling bullet, come from the explosion's forward momentum transfer, as well as the angular momentum in the spinning direction that was intentionally induced by the rifling on the inside of the barrel: it might have a slight rotary motion along another axis.   the worst possible outcome for the bullet exiting the barrel and interacting with freely flowing air on the outside, would be if it the bullet was too small to begin with, and if its travel on the inside was so perturbed that the bullet had already begun pointing up/downwards or sideways upon the air-interaction at the outside. these conditions are unrealistic, so let's ignore that.  instead, looking at the bullet travelling, a much more relevant effect to take into consideration, is axial precession (there's a wikipedia article if you're curious, and though the article is centered on astronomical objects, the same motion is completely relevant to consider applied on smaller scales). such a rotary motion is usually a result of that the energy transfer from barrel's interaction with the bullet is not limited to 1 (technically, as explained above: 2) degrees of freedom.  but here's my point: if axial precession first begins to happen, then the tip of the bullet going sidewas will (first very slightly) begin to point in another direction than its travelling direction; up/down/sideways, and although this is just a very slight effect to begin with; as the bullet travels on, it passes through more of its medium (interacting with it as a wing on a plane does), and thus it turns more and more for every distance that the bullet travels, until the bullet ends up totally rotating the wrong way, much like the example that i wrote above, but ignored - the key difference having been how far the bullet was able to travel in total.  this is an effect that is completely visible effect in the underwater shots, here.",7년 전,11,
@Bognostrokulum,"Inrevenant, the reason for the perturbation of the bullet's trajectory leading to the rotation in an axis, perpendicular to the initial vector is that in this video they use a 5.45mm AK-47, not 7.62mm. The first one has significantly lower initial energy. The bullet also has its center of mass slightly shifted backwards. When such a bullet enters the body it gains chaotic trajectory, which leads to greater internal damage, but it also has a lot less penetrating power. Should they have used a 7.62mm AK-47, the result would be much different.",7년 전,7,
@inrevenant,"a-ha! i did not notice/pick up on that detail, thank you for pointing out that for me! so basically, if i understand correctly, this particular set up could be said, simply, to have been designed to only be precise ""enough"": precise enough so as to to hit your target;  but by using and amplifying properties of perturbation for combat purposes, the target is almost garuanteed fatal wounds. --- that would seem on par with what i know about the weapons' industry so far :p in practice, how much less of a range does that yield when firing in air, comparing the properties of 5.45mm and 7.62mm?  though, also, if you were to ""guesstimate"": how much further do you reckon that the bullet would have travelled underwater there, if it had been a 7.62mm round instead?",7년 전,0,

Smaller rounds generally dont hit hard enough to actually damage the round enough so it will still go some distance (Mythbusters did this) but not very far. the only exception ive seen  is SPP-1, a soviet designed handgun which basically shoots harpoons as opposed to standard bullet shapes and was meant for below water use.",6년 전,4,
@Kev376," @firstman9273  its the same story buddy, the bullet stops about 5-6 feet later whether fired inside or out of the water, the fact is at the speed the bullet is going, water isn't much of a fluid as a brick wall.  And bullet's are often designed to stop and dissipate their energy into a water like medium, humans are mostly water and all.

@11austinj,"Firstly, it's not an AK-74. The AK-74 shoots a smaller bullet, the  5.45×39mm.   In 1974 the Russians wanted to use a smaller bullet than the 7.62x39mm ammo to compete with the new US M-16 bullet, the 5.56x45mm that created devastating wounds on the North Vietnamese.   A lot of people think the AK-74 is a newer version of the AK-47, it's not it uses a completely different cartridge.   From what I can tell this is an AK-47/AKM variant, albeit a more modern version, probably a US import from the eastern bloc and fitted with a new stock and hand guard to be 922R compliant. It definitely uses a 7.62x39 cartridge.",8년 전,2,

@glennstanfield5855,"Awesome Video!!!  Some of my own observations and theories.  That Barrell really flexes underwater, I think the pressure to the piston, and the piston mechanism contribute to this.  Also, I think the column of water in front of the projectile is actually moving the piston, if not completely it is at least starting the movement early.  If you take the cyclic operation of the AK into consideration, the piston, rod, bolt all only move back a small bit under power from the piston, until the piston passes the holes you talked about letting the gas bubbles out.  That small bit unlocks the bolt.  Once unlocked, the bolt itself is pushed back by blowback of the round (like a standard automatic pistol). In this case, that blowback is much more than normal because of the increased chamber pressure due to the water in the barrel as you already discussed.  Again, this is all just my own theories. I haven't read thru ALL of the comments, so if someone else already brought these up then criticism/credit naturally belongs where due.  Once more - Great Videos!",9년 전,0,

@Adohleas,"Water's density will slow down a bullet quickly making it's travel distance very short. If its shot outside of water and it hits the water, the water has surface tension which also causes a human to break bones if they are falling fast enough into the water.   Also the higher the velocity is for the bullet, it's travel distance in water decreases when shot at the water due to the initial surface tension once it hits the water.  A small handgun's bullet will travel further when shot at water then a sniper due to surface tension, but neither will travel far due to water's density.",8년 전(수정됨),1,

On the other hand, you gain normal velocity to then contact a new matter (water, supposivly tangent to the vector).

Curiously, this effect is far stronger and more devastating in the smaller 5.45x39mm round out of the AK-74 than the older 7.62x39mm round out of an AK-47. This is because the 5.45x39 bullet was designed with a hollow space inside the head of the bullet, causing it to immediately start tumbling upon impact and tearing up everything in its path.

The outer layers, falling behind the core, collapses toward the center of the star, and when the pressure of all that mass falling into a small area, gets high enough, it stops the inertia, and bounces leading to the explosion we see as a Nova.

What I'm curious about though, is the bow shock bubble...so the only reason it exists is, once it leaves the water jet bubble, the bullet is now physically pushing water out of the way. The bullet causes the pressure of the water behind it to drop low enough to cause the water in that area to evaporate and create the gas bubble. If you'd have asked me what causes the bow shock bubble before I watched the video, I would've probably guessed that it was the heat (a rise in temperature rather than a drop in pressure) created by the friction of the bullet moving through water that caused the water to evaporate and cause the bubble...but then I'd be wrong :o) Physics is cool as long as I'm not the one doing the equations.",9년 전,0,

@Mr2ndAmendment,"Technically, it's neither.  The term ""AK-47"" is used in the United States to refer to basically any Kalashnikov variant that fires the 7.62 x 39 cartridge (the original AK-47 cartridge).  The rifle in the video looks like an Arsenal SLR 107-33.  It would be closer to an AKM, which is a ""modernized"" AK47 variant.  ""AK-47"" would correctly refer to a full-auto capable rifle without the modern upgrades which have become standard on the market.  So we could refer to this simply as an ""AK-47"" but in reality it technically would not be an AK-47 because it doesn't fire full-auto and it has upgrades.  The rifle in the video has some AK-74 pattern upgrades, such as the muzzle device and improved gas cylinder.  LONG story short, we can say ""AK-47"" to refer to any Kalashnikov that fires the 7.62 x 39 even though it's not technically correct.  An AK-74 variant fires the 5.45 x 39 round, which came later in response to the NATO 5.56mm round.  A quick and easy way to immediately tell is to look at the magazine.  A more dramatic, curved ""banana"" shape means it fires the 7.62 x 39 which would be an AK-47 variant.  A straighter-profile magazine means it fires the 5.45 x 39, which would be an AK-74 variant.  Sorry for the long explanation but there it is!",9년 전,1,

You can see the bullet start tumbling soon after the bullet exits the gas.

If you ever happen to do this experiment again I and I'm sure others would love to see a camera shot from the inside that ""bubble"". Basically by centering your rifle,  shooting underwater a few times to get an idea of where expansion occurs, and then placing a camera perpendicular to the trajectory of the bullet so that when the bullet passes the camera and creates that expanding bubble you can actually see inside of it with a camera. I don't know if anyone has done that or not. Anyway just a thought. Thanks for the video!",9년 전,0,

@RyuuAMcCF,"That's true. The first time I saw a gun firing underwater was one of the James Bond films, so I knew it can be done. Of course, that was ""make believe"", but this video actually validates that particular scene.  The short range that Bond had to shoot his enemy in that scene would have still made it a lethal hit. OTOH, this films shows that at more than a few yards, the bullet would not have even reached any sort of target.  In space, the range would be greatly extended. On the moon, it would still eventually fall to the surface--a .22 pistol could potentially have a range of several miles. But if someone were to shoot a gun in Earth or Solar orbit--unless that bullet hits the target being aim at at that moment, you'll have to worry for years or centuries later about who or what's going to eventually catch it--and it will be just as potentially lethal then as it was when fired!!",9년 전,0,
