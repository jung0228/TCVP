@greydinimagicman,The Magnus effect is an observable phenomenon that is commonly associated with a spinning object moving through air or another fluid. The path of the spinning object is deflected in a manner that is not present when the object is not spinning. The deflection can be explained by the difference in pressure of the fluid on opposite sides of the spinning object. The Magnus Effect depends on the speed of rotation.,4년 전,1,

@derrickrr5516,"I’m surprised he didn’t mention baseball. Not only do pitchers spin every single throw (except knuckleballs) but every batted ball has spin to it (except knuckleballs). Pitching and/or hitting a knuckleball is relatively uncommon but can be awkward to hit or field.   Anyway, I saw the Cardinals take batting practice back in the late ‘90’s. Mark McGwire was a very big guy, used a big bat and had a powerful downswing. He admittedly tried to hit the bottom third of the baseball to create backspin. The batting practice was a sight to behold. While there were a few other players in MLB who could hit the ball nearly as far, no one had the height and soar like McGwire. The ball would hang high in the air, like it was wanting to stay up there, and carry quite far. I am speaking the truth when I say the next ball he hit would be on its way before the first one even landed. So trying to catch them in the stands felt like juggling. It was very entertaining for everyone trying to catch the souvenirs.   Say what you may about him cheating but I’ve never seen anyone hit a baseball like that before, during or after his time. Maybe they should’ve called him Mark McMagnus instead of Big Mac.",4년 전,2,

@kistosable,"Also Bernoulli's principle does apply too. The ball spinning does affect the speed of the layer of air in touch with it, making it that the air gets speeded up (or less slowed down) than in the other side. Bernoulli's principe explains that the energy of air flow depends on speed, preassure (related with temperature aswell) and potential energy in form of graviational potential energy. In the case of the ball the air flow doesn't change altitude nor mass so that gravitational energy remains constant. But as in one side the air moves faster than the other, the faster side has less preassure than the slower side, which creates a force from the high preassure side to the low preassure side. That is what creates the lift force in airfoils that allows planes to fly.",5년 전,0,

You'll see that both bottles will move towards each other and they'll collide. That is because the air flowing between the bottles in faster than the air on the other side of the bottles, and as energy has to remain constant, the preassure lowers between them creating that force that joins them.",5년 전,0,

@DarkLight00001,"The diagram at 1:18 makes no sense at all because if the air on the right side is not able to resist the ball's spin enough to cause it to spin the other way, then the ball shouldn’t move to the left. The only way the ball should move to the left is 1. if the ball was spinning the other way or 2. if the air on the left travels all the way around the ball parallel with its spin, but that's not what the diagram shows. You see what I mean? EDIT: Oh wait I get it now, I guess the ball has little resistance against the air so that allows it to easily spin along the air on the right and the left air blowing over it pushes it away from the right air, so that makes sense, yeah. It's just that if the ball's spin was fully resisted by the air, then the diagram would make no sense. And even then, the diagram could still be wrong if the air had enough resistance on the ball's spin to overpower the amount of spin you applied to it and thus not allow it to spin.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

@eduardo-xv5do,"i´ll try, but i´m not much fluent in english... coriollis and magnus are both fluid dynamics effect, but the first one is the result of the earth rotation. The high pressure zone atmosferic air flows to the low pressure zones. the resultant force vector (wich is diferent in each hemisphere) creats a deflection for left or right. The intensity of coriollis force is very small; their results only can be observed in huge, massive and fast phenomena, like hurrucanes. Corriolis abservations at sinks and toilet flush are urban legendo (please, forget the youtube videos).   otherwise, the magnus effect is result of the air flow in rotational object. the air flows in diferent velocities over the object. the diferent speeds creates different pressure levels, creating the deflection. there´s no influence of the rotation of earth.",5년 전,0,

@kellamyoshikage286,"No. First, it's nigh impossible to spin fast enough to generate enough lift to counter your body weight. Second, the force scales with velocity due to increased airflow, so you couldn't easily approach 0 speed to pass it and go upwards. Finally, due to the nature of the force which presumably behaves as a cross product, the Magnus effect can't apply in the same direction as you're moving nor in the same direction as the axis of your rotation; it's perpendicular to both. But, if you were flying at absurd velocities sideways then you could generate enough lift to fly with, presumably.",4년 전,1,

Assuming ball to be spinning clockwise from our point of view ( just for explanation) and it is moving towards right. From ball's frame, air is going to the left. Now the air passing through the top of ball is relatively slowed down due to frictional forces, and the air passing throught he bottom is speedened up (easily imaginable). Now due to bernouli's principle, faster air exerts less pressure and slower air exerts higher pressure. Hence pressure at the top is higher than that at the bottom so it moves down. Applying this logic, you get this direction correct as shown in the video.",6년 전(수정됨),3,

@anmolguptaanmol,I have a doubt. I don't know if i am thinking rgt or not (Pls reply)... In the case of the basketball there are two magnus effect operating. one is in vertical direction due to which the ball is drifting in horizontal direction. and second is in horizontal direction which is due to movement of air in horizontal direction and it will cause the drifting in vertical direction and of course gravity is also acting in the vertical direction.... So the person gives the ball a backspin and the ball goes away from person this suggests that the air is moving from down to up i.e from earth to atmosphere(1st q ues. how can air move from down to up i.e from earth to atmosphere). Also the ball slows down a bit when approaching near water that means force due to magnus effect is upwards which suggests that the air is moving towards the dam (i.e in direction from the water body towards the dam). and i guess this is how those airplanes are working .so what if wind speeds are low such that  force due to magnus effect is not strong enough than force due to gravity. Or the wind direction suddenly changes. So the direction cylinder should also be changed otherwise the plane would fall down but with more force than gravitational force itself as the force due to magnus effect will also add with gravity........... i thought about a solution but it will only work if the force due to magnus effect is independent of mass of material(so second question- is it dependent or independent of mass of material.)  WILL BE WAITING FOR YOUR ANSWER.... THANK YOU,7년 전,0,

@crienospmoht,"I never knew the name of the effect that makes a curveball curve. A curveball curves downward, anywhere between 12 to 6, and 2 to 8 depending on the angle of downward spin ( for a righty). I've heard from many folks who know baseball say that physics dictates even if you put a huge amount of upward RPM's on a ball, it's impossible to make it rise. Does anyone know if this is true and why, or why not? When certain pitchers with a lot of velocity, like Doc Gooden for example throw a fastball, it sure looks like it rises from the batter's belt to his numbers. However many other power pitchers like Noah Syndergaard have movement on their fastball, just not upwards.",8년 전,0,

@ChuaShaoCong,"Hey Derek, I have an engineering question that is not related to the video, but I hope you can help:  Why are there so many different types of wings, especially on fighter aircrafts. Shouldn't there be a standard wing whose shape is optimised for a particular task, be it speed, manoeuvrability, efficiency etc? If you look at the YF-23, which is supposed to perform the exact same task as the F-22 Raptor, they both have very different wing designs. Is one really better than the other?   I have been puzzled by this question or a long time and I can't seem to find the answer to my question anywhere. Do you know where I can learn more about wing shapes and how they affect the performance of an aircraft? (Or perhaps could you make a video on wing shapes? :))   Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read through all the comments. I hope you can help answer my burning questions :)  Your videos are educational and informative, not to mention awesome. I have watched every single one of them!

Coanda effect talks about the why a fluid jet stays attached to a curved surface.  The Magnus effect talks about how that effect, effects the direction of a spinning object.  So Coanda would apply for a curved fixed wing (but only on one side), why it gives lift.  Application is a plane wing.  Coanda effect also works on a ball, but wouldn't supply lift as the ball is symmetrical (effects cancel out).  Magnus effect comes in as it talks about the coanda effect and how it can give lift when you add spin to the ball, which now makes the ball non symmetrical in regards to the Coanda effect.",8년 전(수정됨),0,

@aaronwallace4219,"so ive been looking for some software to help me study the magnus effect and design and test new applications of it, but so far i have yet to come across anything close to what im looking for so i figured the next best thing was to simply post my idea in the comments under the video which sparked my interest in the first place and hopefully get some helpful replies, either on which softwares would be helpful, or on the idea itself. After watching this video i was inspired to try to come up with a practical approach to creating another type of magnus powered airplane, so heres the idea i would like tested. Imagine an aircraft shaped like a simple cylinder, now imagine a cone on the front end of the cylinder pointing outward and its widest diameter being slightly larger than the diameter of the cylinder. Now imagine that the surface of the cone is coated in carbon nanotubes of varying lengths arranged in a repeating step pattern of an arbitrarily chosen number of increments and overall pattern repetitions spiraling counter to the direction of rotation from the cones point all the way to its greatest circumference. My hope is that the spiraling nanotubes, while the cone is in rotation will drag the air back across its surface throwing it out away from the sides of the craft tword the back which in theory would create a low enough pressure in front of the cone to propel the craft forward due to the high prussure of the slow or stagnant air at back end of the cylinder, the reason for the stepping pattern of the carbon nanotubes is to ensure that the air just doesnt become trapped inbetween the tubes creating a nearly frictionless bubble of air which would produce no lift. please let me know what you think and what type of software would be helpful in designing and testing such a device, all replies are welcome though im very intrested in dereks take on my idea, thank you",9년 전,0,

It's moving away from the dam, therefore its movement is due to other forces than Magnus effect.  Even the explanation animation is wrong. The ball is spinning clockwise, with air going up (or ball is going down, i.e. falling). The right side of the ball moves against the air, while left side moves with the air. Therefore, on the right side air pressure is lower than on the left side.   Thus the ball should move to the right, and while falling from the dam - towards it, not away from it.

By putting a backspin on the ball, the air speed on the front side of the ball is greater than on the back side of the ball.  This gives greater air pressure on the back side than on the front side, thus effective ""thrust"" or ""lift"", much like an airfoil does.

In the animation, the air on the left side of the ball faces less resistance from friction than the air on the right side of the ball. It therefore moves faster across the ball, and exerts less pressure. Therefore the ball moves to the left as the animation says - just not for the reasons that the animation claims.",6년 전,0,

I wonder, let's say we manage to build something resembling an UFO.... in both looks and practical mechanics. assuming we figure out a means of anti-gravity levitation (not propulsion, just stationary levitation) wouldn't it make sense to equip said vessel with a system of spinning aerodynamic plates? I mean, by regulating spin and counter-spin, it should be possible to direct it left or right. now, with that thought in mind... isn't it curious that said principle has been brought up countless times since the 1950's, when UFOs were the big summer hit? I mean, folk tale or fact, the image of a spinning saucer was common talk back then, and now it turns out there's a viable practical application of that phenomenon? and it took us 50 years to apply that? from a concept researched during the 1600s? just food for thought.",10년 전,0,

@Avalanche962000,"Very cool...this is why tennis players usually use lots of topspin - hit it hard with backspin and the ball sails way long and possibly into the back fence. Topspin brings it down into the court AND causes the ball to take a big bounce forward, making it harder to return. You can smash it, and the topspin still brings it down. Also, pro golfers are really good at producing various spins to shape their shots and control the bounces and rolls when the ball lands - such as the hook shot Bubba Watson hit from the trees to win the 2012 Masters. Baseball pitchers use routinely this to fool batters - really any sport with a ball, and you have these interesting effects. Unless you're Tom Brady, in which slight deflation of a football produces the biggest advantage...lol",10년 전,3,

@Goosstifer,"Has anyone discussed the reasoning behind a lighter ball moving in the opposite direction to what we observe with the basketball? If you kick a soccer ball on the outside edge, it moves in a direction opposite to the side of the ball that was kicked. A lightweight ball, like the one's you get at Walmart, etc., will move in the direction of whichever side was kicked (the exact opposite reaction as the soccer or basketball). Does this have to do with a smaller moment of inertia or something? I've never understood this, but it's something I observed from a young age.

@Milesco,"Yeah, the second time, it appears that the guy gave the ball a forward spin.  I can't be absolutely sure, though, due to the BAD EDITING.   The editor of this clip does the same thing that ALL video editors do, which is NOT to show the relevant part of the clip in its entirety, but instead jump into the action after it has already started.   I don't know why film and video editors always do this, but they always do, and it pisses me off.  This is always bad, but it's especially bad when it obliterates the very thing that it's trying to show.  Indeed, I think this video disproves its own thesis and tends to prove the opposite.  It is the Bernoulli effect caused by the forward rotation of the ball that causes it to go forward, away from the dam.",6년 전,2,

@vitorrj4211," @robymaru03  The times the ball hits the ground cant be the same. As the ball falls while spinning, it gets an increasing horizontal velocity. By Magnus effect, you will have a perpendicular force, wich now has a vertical (and upward) component , due to the horizontal velocity. As you dont have any upward force in the non spinning ball, fall times are different. Plus, final spin speeds are indeed the same on those situations (assuming there was enough time), wich is 0, because the spinning ball has more air flow in one side than the other. More air flow, more friction, wich is proportional to the velocity. So, you have more friction force on the side with higher speed and this will make the ball stop spinning. Thus, increasing the initial spinning speed would make the ball falls further and the time will be longer",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@andyjones7121,"Since I've seen this I've done some research and have seen planes, boats, etc and looked over the equations and calculate lift for different tube diameter, spin, air flow, etc. I haven't found any propeller using tubes instead of airfoils. Do you guys think it's possible? I mean obviously its ""possible"" but there are lots of engineering hurdles to overcome (contrasting gyroscopic forces is the first to come to mind). One interesting thing when doing the numbers is that the diameter of tube is by far the most important factor. A slow moving 4' diameter tube can have more lift than high rpm thinner tubes. I'm not talking about fighter jets here, because large diameter means large drag, but Im thinking more along the lines of 2 big, slow,  tubes lifting up maybe a person in a seat, hoverbike, or similar, trading speed for lift.

Basically, the spin on a ball or other object causes lower air pressure on one part of the ball, while increasing air pressure on the opposite part of the ball.

For example if we coated wings some sort of thin layer with loop based coating and spin it the same speed which wind against airplane so at the top surface of the wing there will be less or approximately no friction by wind and no distribution of air regime but at the bottom surface, friction will be higher but also drag force will be higher too. So total acting force will be higher in bottom to top direction will that make planes more efficient? I kept thinking about it through all day. :)",10년 전,0,

@joestallings6993,"I'll admit, I'm having trouble with the distinction between Magnus and Bernoulli. The sailboat graphic clearly shows air moving faster along the leading edge of the cylinders, slower aft. Low pressure in front, higher pressure aft.  As a kid, I owned a Trac Ball set similar to the jai alai looking racket in your video. It came with heavy plastic balls, as well as much lighter balls made of Styrofoam. If the lighter ball was launched with enough back-spin, the ball would actually loop-the-loop. Inspired by this, I began experimenting with cylinders from ink pens. Finding a smooth, round cylinder with no taper, and about three inches long, the cylinder could be launched by placing it between two heavy books near the far end. While applying pressure to the top book, and sliding it slowly back, the cylinder could be spit out the forward end with enough back-spin to cause it to loop-the-loop as well. It was amazing to see because there was almost no forward momentum. It seemed to hover. That must have been the Magnus effect. I was astonished because the lift created was counterintuitive. The leading edge of the cylinder was rotating up, and yet the cylinder rose against it.  Love your show. It's my favorite in all youtubedom.",10년 전,0,

BUT! when using a soft rubber ball, like a kid's play ball and you kick the ball applying spin, the ball will curve towards the side of the spin, say the spin is clockwise, the ball WILL bend to the left.

@veritasium,The biggest misconception about the Magnus Effect is that it is just a consequence of Bernoulli's principle. It's not. This can be demonstrated by varying the surface roughness of the ball. Smooth balls can actually curve in the opposite direction due to the 'reverse Magnus effect' because flow over one side is laminar while the other is turbulent. This is a great reference on the shortcomings of Bernoulli's principle explanations: http://math.mit.edu/~bush/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Beautiful-Game-2013.pdf,10년 전,484,

It all boils down to differential pressures.  From what I can remember, this was the point where we started using a mathematical ""vortex"" to predict flow effects around arbitrary wing shapes.  It all worked out really nicely on paper, and it's really awesome to see it so distinctly in something as simple as a basketball.

@thunder852za,I have a feeling you are not getting the physics quite right.

@TaldrenDR,"Veritasium It is still the Bernoulli argument that describes the origin of the pressure gradients and thus, ultimately, the force. The circulation simply introduces an asymmetry to the flow that then makes the sum of pressures nonzero. Although these days we mostly ignore Bernoulli for atmosphere interactions since he considered density constant ... which, in honesty, it was in his water experiments. We mostly use Euler which again is just Newton to describe such interactions. All roads lead back to Newton :p",10년 전,9,
@DocWolph,"Taldren Well there is a difference and why it is called ""The Magnus Effect"" and not ""The Magnus Principle"".  Because the Magnus, Venturi, and Coanda Effects among others, individually describe different techniques generate low pressure, as described by Bernoulli's Principle it is absolutely fair and correct to refer to these as ""effects"".  The Bernoulli Principle is simply the generation of low pressure using airflow, but makes ZERO distinction as to how to produce the lower pressure.   Also, because ""Nature abhors a vacuum"", the higher pressure of slower moving air, will try to fill in the lower pressure of faster moving air, to equalize pressures between the two region, generated by the aforementioned effects, creating a pressure force and, based on the direction of that force, trying to get through the object separating the high and low pressure areas, will produce lift, downforce, thrust or vaccum.  *Note: I'm making a rational assumption that 1) you know half of this stuff already,  and 2) if you don't know, you will look it up. I am not looking this up out of a text book, I just already know and it would be helpful if you knew as well or at least knew to and how to look it up .

We typically refer the Rigel star system ans just that, but the inhabitants, assuming, by some exciting cosmic coincidence, they name their star the same thing, would refer to it as the ""Rigellian System"". But we also refer to our own star system it as""The Sol Star System"", if we want to be very formal about it.

Second, I am right. Veritasium doesn't need you to white knight for him ... its just some math nerd banter, not some major disagreement. In fact we both agree, it is just Newton ... I just detailed the path in which it leads back to him.  As for systems ... A ""solar system"" is any single star ""planetary system"". A system with multiple stars and at least one planet is a ""star system"" and planetary system. There is no clean way to describe it as with solar system. A ""galaxy"" is also a star system which really makes the use of star system very confusing, especially in literature. A star without a planetary system or star system is a ""rogue star"".   To add to the confusion ... you can have two more more solar systems that make up a star-system if they are orbiting each other.

@dim296,+Taldren Well this is true but I am not talking about compressibility. I am talking about viscosity. Compressibility is not the only thing that would invalidate Bernoulli's principle as it assumes three things:  The flow must be incompressible (which in this case it is) The rule is applied along a streamline (it is in this case) The flow must be inviscid (It definitely cannot be assumed inviscid here since a boundary layer exists on the surface of the ball (As someone said correctly above)).,9년 전,0,

@dim296,"+Taldren Using Mach speed as the sole criterion to decide whether to use Bernoulli principle or not is dead wrong. Technically speaking you are right there are no truly inviscid flows but there are plenty of situations where viscous effects are small enough so they can be neglected like the flow in a ventouri nozzle. The flow around the ball is just not one of them. As the ball rotates, it ""drags"" the air in the spinning direction. If there was no drag the flow around a rotating ball would be the same as in a non-rotating ball and there would be no lift. This obvious fact is enough to see that Bernoulli in this situation is a big no.  Bernoulli principle is one of the most misused theorems in physics. It is the same mistake people do when they use it to explain the lift around an airfoil and it is wrong for the same reasons.",9년 전,0,
@TaldrenDR,"+dim296 Mach isn't a velocity measurement per say, its a function of Temperature, Reynolds number, and the Adiabatic constant. It tells you far more about the medium in which you are traversing than how fast you are going. As such, yes, in Air at speeds < 0.2M, air can be considered inviscous in terms of the use of Bernoulli's equations.  Bernoulli's Equation is just a form of Newton's second law as expressed by Euler's equation with the limitation of a requiring a constant density something air can be considered at less than Mach 0.2  As for the rotation, the only thing Bernoulli's principle cares about is relative velocities. When the rotation is with the airflow it doesn't create as much a region of low pressure than where the surface directly opposes it.   Integrating that across the entire sphere surface gives you a net force along a vector.",9년 전,0,
@danthewalsh,"Yes, the Bernoulli equation doesn't include viscosity; that's exactly the problem. You're trying to apply Bernoulli in a regime in which it is inapplicable -- to a viscous fluid. As you said yourself, ""Inviscid is a concept that doesn't exist in reality."" In particular, the system we are trying to understand is a ball rotating in a viscous medium, and there is a boundary layer present within which the velocity field is not described by a flow potential (which, by the way, is the starting point of the mathematical analysis in your link, rendering it inapplicable). While it is true that some progress can be made in this way by calculating the force on a rotating ball in an inviscid flow as is done in your link, this doesn't tell the whole story -- as I already pointed out, by judiciously choosing the velocity and rotational speed of the ball, the Magnus force actually points in the opposite direction to the force predicted by Bernoulli's equation (known as the ""reverse Magnus effect"", again, see ""The aerodynamics of the beautiful game"" for an overview of this)! Consequently while using Bernoulli's equation can sometimes give some intuition about forces in flow fields, using Bernoulli alone is insufficient in explaining the Magnus force in the presence of viscosity.  To be clear, I'm not saying Bernoulli's equation is not right; I'm just saying, as dim296 pointed out, it's only applicable when the assumptions of its derivation are satisfied. And this is precisely the problem, you're arguing ""When the rotation is with the airflow it doesn't create as much a region of low pressure than where the surface directly opposes it."" This is the common misinterpretation of Bernoulli's equation that ""faster-moving air has lower pressure"", which is only true along streamlines, or in conditions where the flow has no vorticity -- a condition that is often violated in the presence of viscosity. This kind of incorrect application of Bernoulli's equation is rife among beginning physics students when trying to explain why blowing on the top side of a sheet of paper draws it upward, or explaining why two ping-pong balls are drawn together when blowing in between them.",9년 전,0,
@TaldrenDR,"Daniel Walsh My point of velocity under Mach 0.2 near sea level that it doesn't matter stands. Those are the conditions in which it IS applicable, the same conditions I told dim296 about, and the same conditions in the video.  If you followed what I have been saying this whole time ... it all leads back to Newton's 2nd law.

@dim296,"+Taldren What you said about viscosity always being negligible at Mach numbers lower than 0.2 is fundamentally wrong (and by the way Mach numbers are usually used to judge whether a fluid is compressible or not; viscosity is irrelevant).  6 years ago when I first got in the university, the first thing we were told during the first fluid mechanics module was that we have to be extremely careful when we apply the Bernoulli equation. Daniel is quite right.  Of course there is no true inviscid flow in real life but there are many situations where it can be neglected like the flow in a venturi. The flow around this rotating ball is just not one of them since you have a boundary layer. We can keep arguing forever and I am not going to say the same thing again and again. In the absence of viscosity and boundary layers, lift does not exist. Period. This is why bernoulli should always be derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. A CFD simulation on a rotating ball would show substantially different results if the viscous terms are neglected.  People like to make things complicated but in this case the only reason the ball bends is Newton's third law.  Best Regards.",9년 전,0,
@TaldrenDR,"***** I admit I made some assumptions, but unless it isn't air or some crazy altitude/Temperature, Bernoulli is valid at velocities less than Mach 0.2.  Since the ball is on earth near sea level and he didn't die to some odd atmosphere I am pretty sure what I said stands.  In my aerodynamic labs (16 years ago) we even proved this through example of where it broke down completely and lead to the notion that speeds > Mach 1 were impossible.  Within the known limitations (which is practically normal everyday existence) both kinetic and Bernoulli are fine. Just like in the example in the video.  If this is not the case, then we need to stop using all kinetic models of motion since they do not consider heat loss and relativity.",9년 전,0,

@danthewalsh,+Taldren I'm noticing you've conveniently avoided addressing my observation that using this same argument gives the wrong answer for the regime where the Magnus force is opposite in sign (the reverse Magnus effect).,9년 전,0,
@TaldrenDR,"Daniel Walsh Because of lift.   The boundary layer caused by the rotation interacts with the airflow causing more air to squeeze by the ball on one side. Since there is no compression and mass flow is constant, the velocity increases. This causes a low pressure region that generates the ""lift"" perpendicular to the airflow. This lift force can be explained by Bernoulli's principle since, again there is no compression.  This also accelerates the rotation due to the interaction between the airflow and boundary layer which increases the effect. That is why the ball accelerates in the lift direction.  Any other questions?",9년 전,0,
@danthewalsh,"+Taldren Your last response failed to indicate the direction of the force anywhere in the argument (""perpendicular to the airflow"" could mean either up or down for a ball spinning in a vertical plane). It is this ambiguity in direction that demonstrates the shortcomings of your explanation, as I will review presently. I'm not asking for a lesson in the Magnus force; I already understand it. The point is that if your explanation gives the correct direction of lift in one regime (when the ball generates lift), then it cannot give the correct direction in the other regime where the ball generates negative lift. This is because your argument says that the air moves faster on the receding side of the ball, and by Bernoulli will always generate lift toward this receding side where the air velocity is higher. Contrary to your assertion, however, the direction of the Magnus force actually reverses for certain values of the ratio of Wa/U (W is the angular rotation, a is the radius, U is the airspeed -- this is all covered in the link I sent). Your approach can work in one regime, or it can work in the other regime, not both. Consequently your misguided application of Bernoulli's principle doesn't always give the right answer.",9년 전,0,
@TaldrenDR,Daniel Walsh You are asking me to indicate direction of a 3D sphere in text alone. I had believed you had enough familiarity with the subject matter to understand my description.  There is no such thing as negative LIFT. Lift is the force perpendicular to an airflow in the direction of the force regardless of which direction that force happens to act. Saying negative lift is like saying negative gravity or negative force.  The Lift vector is in the same plane as the rotational axis and perpendicular to the airflow. The Airflow is caused by the object falling due to gravity. The rotation causes a boundary layer tangential to the surface on the same plane as the rotational axis. This boundary layer interacts with the airflow and pulls the higher static pressure air at the bottom of the ball in the direction of the surface rotation. There is a lower static pressure at the top of the ball due to airflow  separation which means the induced boundary layer has less effect in its ability to pull the air stream which results in an unbalanced force and thus the net LIFT in a direction perpendicular to the object.   This lift is due to viscosity of air the air-stream resisting separation which results in the side with more volume of air increasing its velocity to squeeze by the object the same way that it happens on an airfoil. So there is a air velocity difference over each side of the surface which is why Bernoulli can indicate the amount of lift and the direction of travel.,9년 전,0,
@danthewalsh,"+Taldren I get the feeling you aren't reading my responses fully, because you still aren't addressing whether the lift force is up or down. Let's agree on a common physical thought-experiment so we both can speak in a common language. The coordinate system has the x and y-axes in the plane of the ground, and the z-axis points upwards. Suppose now that we have a sphere that starts some height h off the ground with coordinates {0,0,h}, in the presence of no wind. The sphere now begins moving strictly in the +x direction (velocity vector {v,0,0}), with an angular velocity {0,-w,0} (i.e. the ball spins in a vertical plane in a clockwise direction as viewed from the +y direction). The Magnus force will (initially) only have a z-component (I'm assuming you meant ""The Lift vector is in the plane of rotation and perpendicular to the airflow"" above; I think you must have misspoken).  Now, the question that your analysis in general gets wrong is the following: ""Will the lift force be in the positive, or in the negative z direction?""",9년 전,0,
@TaldrenDR,"Daniel Walsh The air flow relative to the ball is in the -x direction. The lift force would be in the -z direction.  The rotation creates a boundary layer that moves with the spheres rotation. This boundary layer interacts with the zone of high static pressure ahead of the sphere (x+r) in the -z direction. This is not canceled out behind the sphere (x-r) because of airflow separation leading to a zone of low pressure. There is just less air to interact with.  The net effect is that more air flows below the sphere than above it. In other words, you have more mass trying to pass through the same relative area which leads to an increase in velocity of the airflow.   Mass flow being constant, this leads to a velocity difference of the air stream on the top and bottom of the sphere in which Bernoulli's equation will show a difference in pressure on the top and bottom halves. The same way it happens with a standard airfoil.  The cool thing is that because more air is moving faster below the sphere than above it, there rotation of the sphere accelerates which also increases the lift force. This is eventually limited by drag, but it is interesting to watch happen.",9년 전,0,
@danthewalsh,"+Taldren We said the ball rotates clockwise as viewed from the +y axis (i.e. looking toward y=0 from positive y, i.e. angular velocity is along -y direction). Based on your description, I'm pretty sure you thought it was rotating the other way; is that what you meant?",9년 전,0,
@TaldrenDR,"Daniel Walsh Clockwise rotation causes a boundary layer that vectors tangential to the rotation. If the sphere is stationary the forces cancel, but once there is an airstream they become unbalanced. This +x movement causes a -x airstream which creates lift in the -z direction due to a airstream velocity difference shepherded by the interaction between the rotation induced boundary layer and the zones of high and low pressure between the front and rear of the sphere.   This difference, as shown by Bernoulli, causes a pressure difference between the upper and lower halves of the sphere which results in the lift force.",9년 전,0,

It is the reverse for some soccer player, stricking their ball jut above the critical speed, then when the speed decreases and reaches the limit, the boundaries layers become laminar but not exactly at the same time. This kind of shot is very unpredictable. If you can understand french, I recommend some video of Clanet Christophe.  Best regard",10년 전,1,

@whatfor5,"So I have one I was wondering if you'd like to puzzle through.   In airsoft guns (a system much like paintball but shooting 6mm solid core balls instead) backspin is applied to the BBs to provide a longer flatter trajectory. (the magnus effect, obviously) The point of curiosity though is in the barrel. You see the backspin is applied at the very beginning of the barrel, the chamber end. There has been much speculation about what the BB actually does going down the barrel prior to its exit.   What actually does happen? Well, surprisingly, experiments show the BB rides on the ceiling. Nobody has explained why this is though, and the results have become so controversial quite a number of physicists who've seen it have flat out denied the results of the experiments.   So the question is why does this behavior occur?  edit  I feel I should make this a little bit more clear: the BB is driven down the barrel by air pressure from behind, and is not a gas-seal with the barrel. Because of this, while in the barrel, the BB could be seen as traveling in the opposite direction relative to the air in certain respects; the BB should hypothetically display ""topspin"" and the magnus effect would drive it downward toward the floor rather than ceiling. This is why our observations that it does not is so surprising.   The experimental methodology used to determine the BB's behavior in the barrel was to coat the bore evenly with scribing fluid, fire a few hundred rounds through it, and then either scope the bore or cut it open. The wear patterns in the scribing fluid show the BB's location. Furthermore, particularly in soft brass barrels, longitudinal scratches in the bore can be observed from where the BB contacts. These are also found on the BB ceiling. They are also fairly long and even, suggesting that the BB truly is riding on the ceiling, rather than oscillating rapidly ""bouncing"" or anything like that.",10년 전,36,

@whatfor5,"iota-09 When the BB is in the barrel, air is moving past it in the opposite direction than when it will be outside the barrel, so its relative spin would be topspin rather than backspin.

If the BB didn't contact the barrel at all, existing tests wouldn't have revealed it as riding on the top.",10년 전,1,
@iota-09,"01XxMafiosoxX10 there's also to be considered the micro-errors happening in a bb, making a perfectly dpherical bb, or with at least an error of less than 0.009 milimiters on at last one point it's extremely hard, so that could also make for different results in a test, same goes for the barrel, it's quite hard to make a perfect ""circle"" with such a small hole on such long pieces of metal(a barrel gets made from something like a 10 meters long piece of metal).",10년 전,0,
@jasonslade6259,Whatfor5 I think its because when you're in the enclosed space inside the barrel moving at high speed you have to consider the air resistance and the effect of the air being compressed against the walls of the barrel.

Well the borosillicate barrel, immersed in a fluid of comparable optical density (so that the barrel's shape doesn't create distortion which would ruin any potential viewing) and a high speed camera of sufficient resolution would all be fairly difficult and expensive to procure.   The problem? In essence, nobody has the money to throw at it, and those who do don't see the profit in it. The result is that it has never been done. And the issue is compounded by the lack of intellectual property protection in the industry, so even if some company did see a reason to do it they probably wouldn't share it and any innovations derived from it would immediately be stolen.   shrug   There is a lot to be frustrated about in the airsoft industry. :P Oh well.",10년 전,1,

@frogsinpants,"Whatfor5 ""If the air were passing the BB from behind, would the magnus effect not drive the BB downward toward the barrel floor?"" If the air velocity in the barrel were uniform except for the influence of the BB, this might be the case. However, the air is also interacting with the barrel, and will not be uniform. There are boundary layers near the barrel surface where the air is moving more slowly. The Magnus effect doesn't really even apply in this situation.   It makes sense to me that this configuration would be dynamically stable. Having the BB pressed to one side provides the largest gap through which the air can escape past it, reducing viscous drag on the air. The direction of the BB's spin is consistent with the drag from the air pushing it forward and the friction with the top of the barrel. Altering the configuration would increase resistance to the motion.",10년 전,0,
@whatfor5,"frogsinpants To be clear, arguing for the magnus effect in the barrel driving the BB to the floor is my rhetorical way of discounting that hypothesis of barrel dynamics, I'm not forwarding it as a legitimate hypothesis.",10년 전,0,
@01XxMafiosoxX10,"Whatfor5 Thing is, that is all reliant on the boundary layer thickness around the BB, and thus the mass of air affected. In wings, the actual flow deviation accounts for only a small part of the lift, insufficient to produce the effects we commonly see (ie, flying), relative to the actual pressure difference between outer and inner surface.   All in all, after all the discussions in ASM and now here, fresh from the biases of the airsoft, I'm still under the impression that we should find a way to calculate the pressure distribution around the BB starting with the assumption (seen in the oft quoted experiment results) that it sticks to the ceiling. If we could get results that indicated that the aforementioned condition was stable, then we'd only need to come up with a reason as to why it gets there in the first place, but for that I've read some interesting theories...  First step would be calculating boundary layer thicknesses around BB and barrel, and also find the domain in which the continuum equations no longer apply, due to microfluid condition (near top of barrel). Then check boundary layer interaction, and compute pressure distribution. From that you might be able to speculate over the stability of this condition.",10년 전,0,
@yawor,Whatfor5 I think the effect inside the barrel is negligible at most. The ball doesn't spin that fast (too powerful hop-up strength makes it fly upwards instead of having a flat trajectory). The amount of time the ball stays in the barrel is really short and the force from the magnus effect wouldn't be strong enough to move the ball in any direction on such a short distance and time period. The pressure difference between front and back of the ball is a few orders of magnitude greater than between above and below it (doesn't matter if the pressure is greater above or below).   I think this is most visible by the difference in using high precision barrels with 6.04 mm or 6.03 mm (or sometimes even smaller) inside diameter in comparison to a stock barrels (at least in cheaper guns). The ball just bounces randomly inside the barrel (the smaller the diameter the less bouncing occurs) and the exact direction of the vector of ball leaving the barrel is affected by this bouncing and affects repeatability of the consecutive shots.,10년 전,0,
@whatfor5,"Marcin Jaworski I have replicated barrel dynamics experiments in high precision barrels 6.03mm ID or less, and have found in all cases for the ""bounce hypothesis"" as it is called, that is the idea that the BB bounces randomly which smaller diameter bores would improve, to be false. In all cases, the BB strives to ride on the ceiling.   This leads to the hypothesis of why a larger bore gap, larger diameter barrel, to a point can increase accuracy: the BB rides on the ceiling, but is imperfect. Imperfections temporarily drive it off the ceiling, and if this results in a contact with a wall or the floor it imparts off-axis spin thus reducing accuracy. Slightly larger bore gaps make these undesirable contacts less frequent.   What is amusing to note about the whole bounce hypothesis is that, as everyone buys tighter and tighter bore barrels, BB manufacturers realize the product performs poorly with such a small gap so the BBs themselves get smaller and smaller. A few years back, BBs were 5.98mm +/-.02mm. Now it is common to find BBs hovering around 5.92mm. Go figure.",10년 전,1,

@whatfor5,"Runecorenation Yes and no? All rifled bullets do technically curve. It is called ""spin drift"" and has to be accounted for in long range shooting. To put more curve on a bullet, you'd need a round bullet with some sort of sidespin (rather than rifling) technology, which would both severely limit your maximum velocity and probably have fairly extreme wear. Its level of curve would also be comparatively small especially as compared to Wanted. It also is not possible to do by waving your arm around like a fool, because mechanics simply don't work like that.   So curve a bullet like wanted? No, not possible.

@bigglessy,Wwald Ha! I was just about to comment on the fact that that's how airsoft BB hop ups work :P,10년 전,9,
@reznov122,bigglessy What is bb hop ups? I don't play airsoft but this sounds interesting,10년 전,3,
@Eriiaa,"nothingtoseehere.jpg BBs are the 6mm ""balls"" that airsoft guns shot The hop-up is a small bucking on the top of the barrel that imparts a back spin (like the basket ball in the video) to the BB. You can adjust the bucking to make the BB go straighter without increasing its speed",10년 전,21,
@bigglessy,"nothingtoseehere.jpg What John Smith said. With no backspin the BB's would simply drop under gravity, by giving them backspin they lift up which counteracts gravity, and makes them 'fly' further.",10년 전,8,
@BIaze,Wwald Ah! I was looking for this! :D,10년 전,1,
@iota-09,"bigglessy well, there are lots of guns that still don't use an hip-up, as many militaries say ""more mechanical parts may give more incentive to weapon failure"" as in, the bonus of the hop up is the same shown here with the basketball, it doesn't completely change trajectory, it just gives it an enormous boost, like, without hop up you get a 25 meters-ish max range, with it, you get over 40 to make an example; also this bringgs the failure i was talkingabout eralier, because with a normal barrel, as long as bothe the bbs and the barrel are ""perfect"", without an hop up the trajectory of the bb will be pretty much the same every time, at least regarding range, with an hop-up though, there are various things to consider, such as softness of the hop's gum which may vary after many shots, as well as the different backspin that may be given by a different insertion of the bb in the barrel.   in any case though, the bb will always fly farther with an hop-up than with-out, so while it may give a little inconsistency, it will always be better to have one.",10년 전,0,
@bigglessy,"iota-09 If you have your airsoft gun set up well with well made parts, your consistence shouldn't be affected.",10년 전,6,
@iota-09,"bigglessy the main 5 things, in this order, are what make up for concistency in precision and range for a gun: bb,barrel bore(lenght changes only end power, and at an obviously constant rate),air group,hop-up and air nozzle.  getting a fine-tuned gun helps, but getting good bbs can make up very well for it. ",10년 전,0,
