@leesheldon2024,Absolutely amazing,6개월 전,0,
@Felafant,"Someone mentioned Jocko on another podcast and it’s about the third time I’ve heard his name. He’s been mentioned by other Navy Seals who were deployed with him. So I knew he had a ‘strong mind’ and I wanted to hear what he had to say. I thought it was interesting to hear him use the word humility. I do hear it when he speaks about his navy seals he led in Ramadi. You definitely need to be a listener and be willing to still be teachable as a leader. I am grateful for his determination, discipline, and will power. It definitely makes for a strong mind. I think what was very surprising to me was when he was asked if he had any weaknesses and he said he couldn’t think of any.  Jocko is such a focused and determined person he doesn’t have a second to lack discipline or have weaknesses. That’s awesome! That’s probably what God was trying to impart to the world in teaching us that “an idle mind is the devil’s playground.”  I enjoyed this podcast and I am grateful that Jocko is still alive to tell his story, inspire others and impart his wisdom. God bless him! 🙏 (I’m a cancer survivor of 4 different cancers plus diabetic complications. Been battling with it for 23 years now off and on. Yeah I have a strong mind and very determined too just lack physical strength due to disabilities. Listening to Jocko was helpful.)",6개월 전,0,

@freightshayker,"Jocko at 1:41:17 ... ""You overcome that fear of death. And now of what is there to be afraid?""   Lord Jesus Himself says ... and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Matthew 10: v28  Means death is not the end. And every person that has ever lived will be in one of two places, Heaven or Fire Lake. No third choice.  Means Lord Jesus will confirm this message to you with a personal experience at some point in your life. Why?  Because one's eternal future is too important to let them make a hasty, uninformed, emotional or drunken decision on that future.  Means up to this point demons and false Christians have only been allowed to deceive you. That's why Lord Jesus says proverbially: Let there be the light of higher understanding.  Lord Jesus above all His other traits including love and patience and forgiveness is His righteousness. Means He will do with everyone what is right.  Means Lord Jesus will not force one to come to faith in Him. Nor will Lord Jesus force someone to continue in faith if they no longer want to continue in faith.  Lord Jesus will help us but He will not continue to do all the struggling for us. That's why we must respond by picking up our cross and following Him. We will spend the rest of our earthly life coming to know the wisdom of long suffering.  As one teacher explains: The only way to learn long suffering is to suffer long. amen.  Take it from someone who wasn't looking for God let alone someone named Lord Jesus of Nazareth when He made His presence known to me.  And that wasn't gonna change. I'd have gone to my grave not looking for God. All the more reason I thank Him everyday. Glory!  Start at the beginning friends.  Go to a man of God who knows the difference between titles baptism and baptism in the title-name-title of Lord Jesus Christ.   Jocko at 1:48:56 ... ""And it's in the complete darkness of the world of the human soul, and you see that there's nothing brighter than somebody who lays down their life for their friends.""   In agreement with Jocko is Lord Jesus Himself Who said: Greater love hath no man than this. That a man lay down His life for His friends. Ye are My friends if ... IF ... If ye do whatsoever I command you. John 15: v13 an v14  Means among other things that you start a lifetime of obedience by going to a man of God who knows the difference between titles baptism and baptism in the title-name-title of Lord Jesus Christ",3년 전(수정됨),0,

I got into watching road rage videos and other stuff with people hurting each other and screaming and yelling at each other and I found it to have an emotionally corrosive effect upon my soul. I stopped watching those videos and I feel better.  We are an animal species. Our bodies are the same as when we were cave people and respond to the video as though it is happening right where we are. This releases cortisol into your system for no valid reason. You have nothing to defend yourself against so the cortisol hurts you instead of helping.

From p.o.w's, to dying as there kids were being born back home to returning physically disabled or physically fine with untold amount of mental scars that shaped how they brought up their children.

Discipline is like inertia, it keeps you on track after you have set yourself a goal, but it might impede your ability to change your goals. It might make you ignore important markers to stop an reconsider.

@dougzembiec9995,"Jocko : You're a military celeb cashing in on other people's misery that the US Invasion caused to innocent Iraqi civilians . I know the NSs weren't involved in Fallujah , but take a wild guess how many women and children were killed because the USMC lead by icons like Douglas Zembiec fired Willie Pete over residential areas. It's called Crimes Against Humanity. Before anyone buys your book can you just tell us (and be honest) , how many innocent civilians have you murdered in your lifetime ? When I say innocent civilian I include any man not dressed in a military uniform who picks up an AK47 because he wants the likes of you to GTF out of his country . How many? The only consulation these people have whose lives have been ruined by the likes of you is to scan the Internet to enjoy looking at single ,double and even triple amputees (so called wounded warriors) hobble along in their miserable lives which they have disguised as heroism and also hopefully landed a fully fitted house to accommodate their disability . It is bizarre that Americans can feel proud to be laid to rest in a grave yard in Arlington amongst their 'brothers and sisters in arms' . Bear in mind many of these soldiers have most of their body parts missing and are virtually unrecognisable as a human being when they are egg lifted off Iraqi soil (no spelling error I meant egg lifted ) and poured into a coffin and then had the star spangled banner thrown over the coffin. These people you call heros. Really ? Were you heros to the North Vietnamese civilians whom you murdered by the hundreds of thousands as the USA fought a war of attrition to murder as many people as possible because any dead Vietnamese was classed as being Vietcong and therefor a point for team America. You and others like you should hang your heads in shame for serving in a NeoNazi organisation called the US military which costs the US taxpayer trillions of dollars and yet produces no lasting results. We should rather spend those trillions on science by helping to improve humanity not murder it. I suppose the US government needs to create jobs for those who are less academically skilled and were probably destained to a life in an automobile workshop until those recruiters came knocking on your door .",9년 전,4,

You mean the Jewish run media that was talking about whether cartoons were offensive or not before the bodies were even buried?  The one that has a hard time pointing out that the Cologne attacks were from Muslims in fear of being Islamaphobic?     If you think that the avoidance collateral damage in War is even remotely possible, than you are clearly too immature to have a serious conversation about this.  Yes, obviously our politicians have done quite immoral things, as well as our military, but our intentions are not even remotely the same as ISIS - to eliminate all freedom for all freethinkers, to eliminate an entire group of people from this Earth, etc.   I will concede that we added much fuel to the fire in Iraq, but if you think it was even REMOTELY a fine place to live beforehand than surely you are beyond mistaken.  Hussein was an abomination of a human who used mustard gas on his own people, would get pleasure of slaughtering his own people at random, his sons would rape women on their wedding day, and I could go on forever. To compare this to the United States is just dishonesty and masochism.  The world does not need us to be a disaster.   I suggest you read more world history if you think we created all of this from scratch.  There is literally text books worth of material that I can talk about here - the Ottoman Empire, Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin, British slavery in Africa, various black slaves in Africa, British and French imperialism - I sincerely don't even know where to begin with this fucking idiocy.  If you think ANY nation is clean and America is somehow vastly more immoral than the rest of the world, then you skipped History class from 3rd grade on.  Like the guy above me said, read someone else other than Chomsky.  He's a great linguist and has a fine understanding of history, but if you read anything less bias you will see the amazing mental gymnastics Chomsky (and you, apparently) go through in order to blame everything on America.",9년 전,0,
@dougzembiec9995,"DarkSideOfLucca So what you saying is that if Iraq invaded the USA in the 1950s to support the black civil rights movement because blacks in the USA were denied many civil liberties ---- and then your dad pick up his M16 and started fighting back that he would be seen as an insurgent and if he died it would be ok because he wasnt fighting from the moral higher ground of supposedly Iraq. Interesting.  Tell me - was killing 1 000 000 North Vietnamese in the Vietnam war also justified.  Was the USA bombing Dresden in Germany in WW2 which killed 22,700–25,000 civilians ok?  Was bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki and killing between 150 000 - 200 000 civilians ok?  Do you even know what Willie Pete even is?  Tell me , why is it that the United States has not yet invaded North Korea because of its human rights violations?
