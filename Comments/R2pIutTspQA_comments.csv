@DivineRedwood,"So true.  I enjoyed seeing people who shouldn't be there gradually fall away, especially the ""moochers/beggars"" and the ""cut & paste'ers"" however the FACT that professors DON'T teach you how to program was probably the one thing that personally irritated me the most.  At the time, I wondered, what the hell am I paying you for if you're not going to teach me?  I had one professor curse me out for not knowing my laptop's stats.  As a physicist turned programmer I didn't take to kindly to being disrespected.  I wasn't some 18 year old kid fresh out of high school.  On the other hand, my anger motivated me to ace his class.

@Invisibility397,HACK CODE CHALLENGE  Make a difference.  A.I. bot that attacks the like button on every single profile that has more than 100 likes and over 50 followers. The A.I. will add 10 million likes within a week to as many posts on as many profiles as it could. Another A. I. To clone and randomize Simps and there  messages. The results will reverse the super inflation of women's God ego validation and then reverse social engineering that is happening in the dating scene and will save marriages as well because women rely on texting so there is no difference between Real men and A.I. bots online. Men perfer to call each other.  So will you accept my challenge so humanity doesn't go the way of the top 20% of American black men's genetics are 80% of black American children's genetic diversity being born. I believe this is based solely on their income. Help save the humanity and the family line genetics. Because this is only the beginning of a very massive issue in 100 years in the future. Cause if you not a millionaire your child will be abortion. Because men are finding out that they are raising children that are not theirs for years    What impact would this have on all social media platforms compared with the real life impact of text and profile information compared with in person body language to real character values.

@Mohmard,"So...  as this person has stopped leading and started spraying a lot of drivvel out into the internet.  I leave a rebuttal to his present state of mind Nov.  2024.  While this channel appears to do a lot of marketing of the computer programming profession and is VERY light on coding tips, tricks, and fundamentals I'd say he's a good cheerleader for the industry .  However, as his income and role at a company has diminished he's slacked off and gone into a sour grapes spiral of dissolutionment.  I believe this is unhealthy.  Human, but not healthy for an entire industry. My Credientals: 2 year ATA degree in electronic engineering, 4 year BS degree in Accounting.  And about 15 years combined paid experience .  So that's who I am.  Here's what I think:  Probably about 50% of the conclusions he draws are correct.  I can honestly attest to the boom and bust of tech jobs in the us.  That being said, what will help revitalize the companies, and create a modicum of job security  is as follows .  1.  When your not paid to work, spend time socializing and protesting in and for the place you live.  It sounds silly, but often management will estimate how hard they can push employees by the surrounding city vibe.  Short of unionizing, this is how semi-rational environments are created and sustained.  Remember, if your neighbor, and cohort doesn't know how each are being treated, managers will push people harder simply because there is no social pushback.  Think of it as a feedback loop.  Or part of an Asymmetrical information pool.  Businesses and managers have tons of knowledge and information us workers don't.  When we don't talk, they capitalize .  2.  He very well be accurate in the sentiment that large parts of the industry have reached saturation.  'Cesar wept, as there was no more land to conqure'.  But, in the tech game, the market of customers is literally always expanding or contracting.  If you have a secondary skillset, consider applying it.  If you don't have one, foster one.  Mix it in with some hobbies.  In the paid work world, jobs are created and destroyed for the glory of Rome(or wherever you live).  The people are ment to walk in and out of them according to the needs and wants of everyone surrounding you.  Seriously, this is true regardless of what country you live in, or the style of governance its under.  If somebody tells you to work for free by threat of physical harm, run, fight them and get away.  Cause their 'money' in that situation ain't worth a thing.  Literally worthless.  In conclusion: industries and companies grow and shrink.  It is cyclical inpart, because we and the planet we live on is also going through cycles.  Rather than victimizing ourselves, it's often healthier to refuse to not grow.  Even when the path changes radically for a while.  And when you get tired of working for Bosses, and we all will.  Maybe consider, just how to be the Boss of your own business.  It's literally easy to begin.  And a lifetimes pain in the bottom to complete!  Happy Trails, - O.G.",10개월 전,1,

@ioannischristou2362,"Dude, where did you go to college? During my Electrical Engineering degree studies, I was taught (not self-studied, actually taught by some full professors, who at times were pretty old) the following programming languages (in that order): FORTRAN (1st semester, introduction to computer science), Z80 assembler (2nd semester, introduction to computer organization), Pascal (4th semester, Data Structures), LISP (5th semester, Programming Languages), COBOL (6th semester, File Organizations and Systems Analysis), C (7th semester, Operating Systems), SQL (7th semester, Relational Databases), OCCAM (8th semester, Computer Systems Lab), PROLOG (8th semester, Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligence), and LOTOS (9th semester, Specification Languages for Formal Protocol Description) (in Greece, and in Europe in general, Technical Universities are 5-year programs). 5 years of study, 10 different (some times very exotic) languages! If you think why wasn't I taught Python and Java, it's because by the time I graduated, these languages didn't exist yet 🙂.  In the US, things are pretty similar: In UW-Madison (where I did my graduate studies), the freshmen CS majors had to take a mandatory course ""Introduction to Computer Science"" that basically taught them the C programming language. And so on... While I find your videos very intelligent and funny, I completely disagree with you on being an auto-didact for Computer Science: in the same way I don't think it would be good advice to study mathematics on your own and then proclaim yourself to be a mathematician, it's not good advice to study CS on your own. Better go to the best school that will accept you (and that you can afford), even if this is just the community college next door, than trying to learn some very complex concepts on your own, or through YouTube videos.",2년 전,0,

@grzgrz6,"The first tip (ability to focus) is called ""deep work"" and there's the book with the same name. But you can easily search it up on youtube.  In summary, you sit and focus only only only on the thing you're supposed to be working on with 0 distractions. According to studies, distractions offput your full focus (the zone/flow state) by 5-20 minutes. So unless your house is on fire, checking email or reading that text someone send you is a big no-no.  You're supposed to sit and focus for 90 minutes max and then take a big break( 10-20 minutes is enough). But not for social media etc, but for a light exercise or talking with someone. Don't go for 90 minutes at first though start with 30 mins and if you feel fine after these 30 minutes, keep going. You're supposed to do only 3-4h of deep deep work per day. But it's like 3-10x results anyway. Any kind of focus and mindfulness exercise daily helps too.",3년 전,2,

My schooling was way back when on 386's, and 486's, (C++, Pascal, COBOL, and BASIC), and we didn't have multi-threaded computers back then, all the configurations we have today, with Dante's Inferno of toolchain hell, framework hell, ide/text editor hell, installation hell, help hell, etc...  and so many contradictions on the internet that say single-thread programming is better for this or that, then multi-threaded programming is good for this, but bad for that...  ...can I actually damage, my cpu, or gpu by using while loops without framerate capping?  One thing I discovered though, is there's nothing ""standard"" about C/C++ anymore, considering there's 20+ standards now for you to choose from.  I spend more time in frustration trying to get things to work, wondering what's been removed, and what's replaced what.

The results will reverse the super inflation of women's God ego validation and then reverse social engineering that is happening in the dating scene and will save marriages as well because women rely on texting so there is no difference between Real men and A.I. bots online. Men perfer to call each other.  So will you accept my challenge so humanity doesn't go the way of the top 20% of American black men's genetics are 80% of black American children's genetic diversity being born. I believe this is based solely on their income. Help save the humanity and the family line genetics. Because this is only the beginning of a very massive issue in 100 years in the future. Cause if you not a millionaire your child will be abortion. Because men are finding out that they are raising children that are not theirs for years    What impact would this have on all social media platforms compared with the real life impact of text and profile information compared with in person body language to real character values.

What you need to learn computer science is a good teacher willing to actually teach you computer science.  Not some snob that wants to make life hard for people regardless of their intent to want to be in that field.  If you have an enrollment of 100 per class, you shouldn't end up with 20 people passing with 80% grades and above, with the rest failing or dropping the class.  What a waste of time and space.

Nobody told me that and I was very confused why I learned everything else much better. Even in the math class it's not about the time spent but more on the ability to be focused a short time and repetition. I think because of the adhd that the focus on one thing won't be a problem for me but what's interesting is that I really forced that habit. A few years ago, I sometimes read a hole day. I was unable to recognize that my family was talking to me because of the focus. Seems that I have learn this again.  Thank you so much for this video.

I am building a simple form or writing a function and figuring out how I can apply it in different ways. come up with ideas for a small component and then try to build one using the lesson your trying to learn.",4년 전,0,

@noahmcdaniel4920,"Bro.... I opened my phone to youtube, and this thought popped in my head as I was doing it, kind of like as I was prompted to think about what I want to watch, and my mind said “how to learn”. I sort of laughed I don’t know why I just thought it was funny because I’m stoned and that was the first thing that came to me in my stream of conscious. I scrolled down not even 2 full scrolls, and there’s your video that I’d apparently watched almost to completion before, and I thought hey that’s kind of funny it’s sort of titled like the thought that popped in my head, maybe this is a sign, because like I’m kind of at a crossroads in my life and need to find a profession, and for a number of reasons this would work really well for me. And I’m also sort of a synchronicity enthusiast. So I thought I’d at least click and see what you were in the middle of talking about. It started at the end when you were talking about Android trending, and I thought this guy sounds like a straight shooter, I’ll start it over and watch the whole thing. Then you said the only skill you need to have to learn to code is the ability to sit at your computer for a long time and I actually laughed at out and thought this is perfect for me. Then a few moments later you say, “this is really about learning how to learn” and at that moment my jaw dropped and I started writing this comment. ‘Tis a sign.",4년 전,0,

Im still not really specialized, and this course will give me different knowledge than what I have from the game dev education. Is generalist programmer a bad thing? Should I specialize in some programming area (even though it might NOT be for game dev)? Im asking because I dont really have time to struggle anymore, I really need a job.

@rufaloice,I'm sorry but it does not sound like you have really any real life experience in software engineering and coding.  The overall picture is missing.  There are so many aspects to this and you need various skillsets and experiences to constitute a good project team and it varies over the lifecycle of the project and the maturity of the solution that you are seeking and/or working on.  Just being able to sit for hours in front of the computer is a social stigma and not an efficient reality.  The coding monkey is not a thing and if it is the company really needs to rethink and reinvent itself.   Of course being able to focus on the task at hand is crucial but often you need to stand up from the computer and let your mind wander so you can empower the left side of the brain and the subconscious mind to come up with fresh ideas and approaches. For example coders with ADHD can be invaluable if you allow them to flourish and they can come up with solutions and ides that a focused mind would never find.  But who am I?  An outdated tech lead. I'm 60 years old and I've been coding since 1972 and I've seen it all (twice).,4년 전(수정됨),5,

@willahelmpowers4835,"I moved a lot when young, got into coding around age 10 through late 20's and would spend near every day for years building software for myself 10-15 hours a day. It felt GREAT to have breakthroughs by relaxing and totally focusing on solutions to the coding problems from multiple angles.  Unfortunately some HD crashes and backup failings wiped several years and 10k hours of work, as well as working at a factory that was 7 days in a row only 48 hours off, rotating shifts. After 30 nightmare years at that factory and now early 50's, I have the time to get back into it. I still don't like going out or really spending time around people, I'd like to either develop tools to allow me to make enough reselling online to work from home that way, or maybe create some things that I could charge a small number of people a monthly subscription to also make income or maybe building websites freelance type work.  I can't really see going and working for some tech company and on some team. I want to get back into writing code and learning new languages for my own pleasure and use. If I could make enough without working for anybody, I'd rather do that. I just need enough income to free time up and remove financial concerns to be able to get back into learning and creating, rather than having to rot away trying to make money and no time to enjoy life or do anything I want to learn, build or do.",4년 전,28,

I was married 27 years; tried to please my now ex but never seemed to make enough money, promote enough, do enough; my mom announced that she had cancer, on hearing the news my dad had a stroke went into a comma, he recovered; mom then dies of cancer; 6 mos. later my dad dies of a broken heart. They were in their late 70s and had known each other since 8th grade. 6 mid later I had a heart attack and triple bypass 8 days later my ex said ‘I can do better on my own’ and filed for divorce and went on a cruise. Took over half my salary and will get half my retirement. DO NOT GET MARRIED !!!  If 50% of parachutes would not work would you go sky diving?! You are doing well.  All you guys - hang in there.

I settled it in my mind that I will consume this book page by page until I reach the end. Also, I made sure not to go the next page until I understood the current page 100%. When I reached the end of the book, I was REALLY comfortable with this programming language. Additionally, it gave me the necessary basic understanding of programming which allowed me to learn from internet tutoriais and pdfs actually effectively. I didn’t need to fully read another full book to learn a different language from then on. Just that initial book propelled me to a state where I was perfectly comfortable with programming itself so from then on I could learn from little bits here and there and be able to connect the dots.

That is such helpful info because now i have some context and can begin to teach myself.  I believe i can do it. Ive always been self taught in anything i do really, i taught myself how to play guitar and stuff like that, im sure i can teach myself to code. Plus i spend most of my life in front of my computer. lol Any recommendations on good resources @TechLead? Ive heard that Python is maybe the best language to start out with because they simplify a lot of things??  edit: nvm you kinda answered my question lol  But as a sidenote, i used to be an engineering maintenance tech which just meant that i did troubleshooting and repair on CNC machines/ lathes and Fanuc robots and stuff like that.  A lot of mechanic work.  And i have a feeling that coding may be similar in a way that not everything is perfect and you will be dealing with a lot of nonperfect situations and messy work and every workplace will have its own quirks and stuf. Its not a one size fits all kind of thing and every engineer had a different level of experience and things they specialized in.  from the end of your video it seems that the two are both alike in this way.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Every time I tried to step into programming because a certain language or platform appealed to me, when I went to ask questions as I learned I'd always get hit back with, oh you are behind the times, REAL programmers are doing this other XYZ over here.

Yes, I'm a loner, I have back pain... but I also have many computer skills, from coding, to photo retouching/manipulating, music producing, modeling/animating 3D, video editing, and some motion graphics. And I have built all of my machines (hackintoshes)... so yeah, I'm competent in many areas.   I'm also in the third year of my CS studies, and I agree completely with what you say. You have to put more of your own self-study to learn programming. What I see as an advantage of taking my bachelor is that you go over so many different things, that even if not ""learning"" it all, if you happen to come to a situation where you might need something, you'll be able to recall what it is you need, and then you can go google, or getting a book on just that specific thing.  And although you can become pretty efficient without a degree, especially nowadays with the vast amount of information available to everyone, is that you might not even know what to look for sometimes. And that could be a big problem. (although you could always explain your problems on a forum, and get some pinpoints of someone which may have study or encountered the same issue before, and then pray for that it is actually what you meant... so you can go and delve into it). It could take just more time and more frustration, but eventually you could also get there.",4년 전,0,

It takes more than sitting on the computer and focus, and I understand that it worked for you, but that doesn't mean that's the way to learn, it's just your personality and the way you do things, you said it yourself, you like being at home, not going out, which is fine, but staying at home does not make a programmer. The way I see it is that coding, programming, or solving problems related to software development is also a people problem, you might need an opinion, or contribution from someone, and to do that, you need to able to communicate a problem, and that means you have to step outside ""the zone"" and be able to discuss or engage into a conversation.   Sometimes, inspiration comes from the place you least expected, and sometimes that is not a computer screen. I do agree that in order to learn how to code, well, you have to code, and that involves sitting in front of a computer, possible some hours per day. Having said that, by no means that indicates that events in life must be stopped, but, if that's your personality, go for it, but don't feel that you have to sacrifice a trip to the mall because that would make you a bad programmer.",4년 전,1,

Our values are Ints and not strings so lets fix this.  x = ConvertToInt32(x);  How do we get the input for this from user? Console.WriteLine(""X: "" ); Console.Readline();   Now that we have our two varibles how do we add them?  sum = x + y;  Now how do we relay the answer to the users question?  Console.WriteLine() = sum; Console.ReadLine();  Cool our code works! Can we simplify? Yes! //name new program public additionProgram() { //set variables int x; int y;  //get user to update variables x = Console.WriteLine(""X: ""); y = Console.WriteLine(""Y: "");  //combine users variables Int sum = x + y;  //tell user thier total Console.ReadLine() = sum; }//end program  congrats you have learned the bare bones of learning to properly code with C# or any other programming language. You can look up most code syntax with google, stackoverflow, or documentation no one knows all the syntax just need to ask the right question. If you get an error or a bug its usually implementation such as order of what your trying to do or told it to do something worng.   Computers are dumb as rocks and need to be hand held through each step. If you skip steps such as not declairing a variable or telling it to do something like did you take out the trash but you never asked it in the first place its going to get confused.   All you really need to know is what are the variables, syntax functions/methods are just shortcuts for what you want the variables to do, and classes are just the shopping list you need your rock to go fill from the store.",5년 전,0,

@ddevulders,"Coding is one of those weird professions where 90% of the professionals got into it by themselves because of some weird intrinsic motivation to take step after step after step to feed a hunger for information and curiousity. Then it becomes a major value in the market and hundreds of thousands of people throw themselves into ""LEARN PYTHON IN 3 DAYS AND BECOME AN ENGINEER OVERNIGHT"" schemes because there is significant money to be made in the field (political figures calling programmers the 21st century rockstars).  But it's so cool to see that the majority of these gold seekers fail miserably because programming and coding have an immense learning curve that you can't bluf (your code either runs/compiles or it doesn't) and I am really happy about that.",5년 전(수정됨),118,

@Ravenex2,"There is an intrinsic barrier of entry to programming, the main ones I see are:  1) Having to sit in front of PC for long time, a lot of people like to move around and some people just don't have the attention span for it.  2) A lot of people don't enjoy programming, so they don't make it to the big stage doing it.  3) If it means going for a CS/CE degree, a lot of people will quit or switch out to other fields because the math and physics required is tough and some people either don't like either or the math required for the degrees.  I loved everything about my degree program, designing interfaces, and building applications. I started tinkering with websites and code in high school (while I gamed a lot too). I've always been fascinated with logic, creativity, puzzles, technology, music, and animation. I grew fond of math and physics in my degree program and learned to love the art of problem solving. That and communication are the two greatest skills you can obtain in my opinion anywhere.",4년 전,4,

I agree with you that in reality no one creates has-tables data-structures from the scratch etc. It's already developed well-known and just being used.  Or writing sorting algorithms from the scratch. If all the languages already have all the libraries and modules with most common stuff or basement. But what is the reason for FAANG companies to demand that kind of knowledge by heart during white-board interview/coding?  Or I am mixing up the stuff? :) Please correct me if I am wrong.

@___xyz___,"5:06 This is really valuable to hear. I started programming a little in elementary school, but got out of practice because of competitive video gaming. My diehard Linux system engineer dad suggested I learned Python. I was convinced that focusing on math and science was more important than immediately learning to code, because that was harder, and besides, I thought, I'm proficient with computers and would probably learn to program from a professional teacher sooner or later. Fast forward 10 years: Now I'm in university studying physics, and the programming rabbit hole turned out to be a lot deeper than I thought. I'm almost failing my classes because I've just taken on a different personality and lifestyle from when I was a kid, and can't concentrate in front of a computer for long enough to complete my assignments, and no one really seems to know what is going on.

@zenshade2000,"Landing that first job advice (after you've developed some actual programming ability): get your foot into the door of a startup/small tech company by any means necessary.  Meaning, take a low-level or intern position if that's all they can offer, even if it's doing completely menial tasks.  Because trust me, once you get in the door, you are going to play multiple roles and learn very fast, as long as you're willing to take on any role that's needed.  There are always more roles to play/hats to wear than bodies.  Let it be known that you have some programming experience.  Solve small problems for tech leads, freeing them to concentrate on the bigger problems.  You will eventually gain their trust, and they will by necessity/desperation start throwing bigger problems at you.  Solve those.  Win.  You are now a Tech Lead and very marketable.",5년 전,0,

@oneoneoneman,"I tried Python learning from scratch, tried hard for cca. 4 months. Saw a lot of progress initially, got a grasp on basic stuff. Learned through tutorials and books. Then I hit the plateau, didn't see the usability and purpose in the whole stuff, couldn't push through it myself as I couldn't understand more complex concepts like oop - and even if I could I still wouldn't know what to do with it. I had no interest in writing useless scripts or some childish code puzzles. Sitting a long time alone wouldn't solve the thing, one needs gudance, proper answers and a broader picture as syntax is worthless if you don't know how to approach the problem at first. Maybe I'll revisit the whole thing somewhen once more, but I still haven't found the answers to the questions I seek.",5년 전,4,

@davidkeys4284, @John-vn6hk  going to be 36 in July but I'm still working on projects at work and for pleasure. The pay is low but that's because I signed  myself into a different role that doesn't even require that I do programming(I'm a data center technician). I like to be a jack of all trades in the I.T. world and so I had originally started with being a hardware technician and worked my way up. I am actually more confident in my skill(as a programmer) because I'm quite creative and have been proven to help my team at the data center with my programs. I've learned that confidence is key. Without confidence l always doomed myself into thinking I would never be as good as I am today. I know now the best is yet to come for me in the world of programming.,4년 전,4,

@fazalcheema9706,"The part about college degrees not teaching you programming isn't entirely inaccurate. I don't know how computer science programmes work in the US, but in the UK, any decent computer science degree will have comprehensive courses in object-oriented programming. Most will teach Java throughout the first and second year alongside the typical data structures and algorithms type courses. In the first year, they will teach basic syntax, object-oriented features and exception handling, and in the second year they move on to more advanced topics like network programming with sockets and using GUI frameworks. Alongside Java, they may also have shorter courses on other languages, such as functional languages or systems programming in C/C++, and modern courses will also teach basic web front-end development using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Once you know a language like Java, it's not hard to transfer your knowledge to learning other languages like C# or Swift, so they give you a pretty good foundation.",5년 전,0,

So my advice would be if you are sitting for long periods of time stand up move around a little and then sit back down. We are creatures of habit and we need to move at times.,5년 전,0,

But yes I agree with you, more hours at a computer are better to get in the mindset for programming, since the electronic fields literally will absorb a person, which is bad in the long-term. If someone has seen the film Terminator, in a sense a person who spends most of their hours at a computer become more like a computer and think like a computer rather than a human being, hence their personality begins to turn cybernetic and androidlike causing strife amongst social life and relations.",5년 전,0,
@richardgrant2834,"When i was 12 i use to get bullied pretty bad so i would lock myself away with my computer and play games. I started creating hacks because i wanted to be ""cool"".

Thats when i decided to start white hat hacking, exploiting email hackers and selling exposed credit cards back to the card issuing banks.  I remember the first Credit Card i found on a hackers log file... I logged into the users account and saw only $1300, i immediately started relating with this person who was living from pay check to paycheck.

Coding takes alot of discipline and brain work to think in a way your brain and mind was never used to think before.   80% of coding is training your observation skills ,deductive skills, memory skills, appreciate simplicity, detail, shapes, ability to master the fundamentals so well you can take any event around you and break it down into cs terms. The fundamentals feels like a toolbox and you are a blacksmith.   The 20% is what people get excited about and thing they can code. That is getting familiar with a progamming language.

@CabrioDriving,"Best and simple  tip : Cut away distractors and time wasters. Go under desk, disconnect LAN cable from PC, physically, switch your phone to quiet mode, put it away 5 meters away from you. Only then you can start learning anything. It is an OFFLINE PC then. Old times. If you are connected to the Internet, your effort and enthusiasm will be wasted. You need to cut yourself away from ""quick checks"" of fav web sites, instagram, emails and other time wasters. Internet will still be there when you return to it during evening. Nothing will be missed. I  have made something else even. I created a second Windows partition, which has no Internet set in Windows. LAN card disabled. If I switch to that partition I never connect to the Internet to check anything.  I know then If I really, really and really need to start Internet I have to reboot to load ""online deskop"" Windows partition, with bookmarks and passwords stored, which is a no no. Too much effort.  With your OFFLINE PC Windows, you read PDFs you downloaded previously or video courses. All offline, on your disk. It is like going back to old times when you had dial-up Internet and were disconnected for most of the time. FOCUS is the most important thing, elimination of distractors. Cheers :)",5년 전(수정됨),0,

And would you say there are any other qualities that would be beneficial? When it comes to introversion/extroversion I've heard a lot of conflicting opinions on whether you actually need to be good with people to do well ""winning friends and influencing people"" and all that jazz, whereas I've spoken to some people who say it's just a case of minding your own business 9-5 and f**k off home kind of workplace.",5년 전,0,

I enjoyed seeing people who shouldn't be there gradually fall away, especially the ""moochers/beggars"" and the ""cut & paste'ers"" however the FACT that professors DON'T teach you how to program was probably the one thing that personally irritated me the most.  At the time, I wondered, what the hell am I paying you for if you're not going to teach me?  I had one professor curse me out for not knowing my laptop's stats.  As a physicist turned programmer I didn't take to kindly to being disrespected.  I wasn't some 18 year old kid fresh out of high school.  On the other hand, my anger motivated me to ace his class.

@Invisibility397,HACK CODE CHALLENGE  Make a difference.  A.I. bot that attacks the like button on every single profile that has more than 100 likes and over 50 followers. The A.I. will add 10 million likes within a week to as many posts on as many profiles as it could. Another A. I. To clone and randomize Simps and there  messages. The results will reverse the super inflation of women's God ego validation and then reverse social engineering that is happening in the dating scene and will save marriages as well because women rely on texting so there is no difference between Real men and A.I. bots online. Men perfer to call each other.  So will you accept my challenge so humanity doesn't go the way of the top 20% of American black men's genetics are 80% of black American children's genetic diversity being born. I believe this is based solely on their income. Help save the humanity and the family line genetics. Because this is only the beginning of a very massive issue in 100 years in the future. Cause if you not a millionaire your child will be abortion. Because men are finding out that they are raising children that are not theirs for years    What impact would this have on all social media platforms compared with the real life impact of text and profile information compared with in person body language to real character values.

@rayhanalam3101,"So true, I went to uni thinking I would be taught programming, my degree was computer and network technology heavily based on networking and programming. I was in for a shock they only taught us fundamentals and gave us assignments to create programs etc in Java, I spent hours everyday (6, 7 sometimes over 12 at home by myself) youtube, java book, stack overflow etc, and came out with first class honours. In my final year I created a project 'remote control home automation using IoT' this project I started 3 months early (in summer break) and included languages of (C, pyhton, java, HTML, PHP and sql. I programmed everything from scratch. The project was to control my house heating, water, lighting, cameras and other appliances of the house automatically and remotely via a an Android app or a website. So to program sensors i boguht of eBay (motion sensor, temp sensor, humidity sensor etc..etc I used language C (where all my conditions were outlined i.e. if temp if room falls below 18 degrees and motion in house is being detected etc turn heating on etc and many more , then to send this data across to an a program that filters the data and further logs it to an sql database I used python, then to have this system monitored remotely on a phone I created a java app which not only displayed real time data, but also gave information about electricity consumption and also have the manual remote control, i.e. trun light on button, turn heating off etc, turn kettle on, .... Then the website I created was just the alternative to the phone application. But yes this project took my 8 months and I spent good 12 hours a day some days and many weeks not going out just doing this day everyday and at the end of the project I scored a First (just like all my other projects). Once uni was over I went on holiday the same day my last exam finished, then the day I got back I started applying for jobs, as a technical analyst (not programmer ) and two weeks later after 2 interviews at my first job invite I got the place and negotiated my salsry and here I am still here. So you must be thinking why didn't I go for a programmers job? Well even though I spent many hours learning programming etc, I must have spent 10 times that much time learning networking and cloud etc. I am a globally Cisco certified network engineer (I mentioned in my third year summer I spent alot time on programming doing my final year project. Well in second year  summer I spent for two months constant everyday from 10 hours to 12 hours a day becoming a Cisco certified network engineer the course was so big (that I actually think it was more then my three years of uni work) but I spent 12 hours a day for 2 and half months and it was so bad that even in my dreams no lie I would be thinking about networking etc. Anyway I sat the exam and failed. Which I could not believe as I knew it all like the back of my hand, so I re booked the esrliest exam date and did zero revision till that exam as I had done so much revision that I could literally see my notes book in my mind anyway I sat the exam and passed. Came into third year of uni knowing absolute everything to a point that lecturers would ask me to explain, fix, troubleshoot things in the network labs we had. But yes people think and be jelous of other people's end results yet have no idea about the struggle they went through . What I did for months people would not be able to continue after the third day it was system overload of learning new things  and doing revision daily of everything u have learnt from previous day's. But yes since you don't have the time contraint as I had (I had 2 months only before uni was starting again) you can take it much more easier but most important most most important if you take anything from this is learn how to be SELF MOTIVATED.. don't be like ohh this isn't for me I am not self motivated, well learn how to be it then!  so now u think I am a nerd well let me tell you my other life. I have been doing taekwondo for 12 years I was in the great Britain team representing England for a full year (currently a blackbelt 2nd Dan). So point being whatever you do in life don't touch and go master it become the best or better then you were yesterday then go. But yes it's only been around 9 months since I graduated I am aiming to start my own thing as this work cycle system is system that doesn't let you be independent and honestly I am sick of it..",5년 전(수정됨),0,
