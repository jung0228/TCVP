However, it will most certainly be the south corean system, that will stay because of the fundamental flaws of extreme economic systems. What i hope for is that kim jong un has to surrender because of economic inability, since that would be de most peacefull solution.

In this totalitarian communist state, Christians are forced to hide their faith completely from government authorities, neighbors and often, even their own spouses and children. Due to ever-present surveillance, many pray with eyes open, and gathering for praise or fellowship is practically impossible. Worship of the ruling Kim family is mandated for all citizens, and those who don’t comply (including Christians) are arrested, imprisoned, tortured or killed. Entire Christian families are imprisoned in hard labor camps, where unknown numbers die each year from torture, beatings, overexertion and starvation. Those who attempt to flee to South Korea through China risk execution or life imprisonment, and those who stay behind often fare no better.",7년 전,0,

@WizardOfOss,"Having visited the country three times, I can say you did a great job on keeping the video pretty factual, without all the political rhetoric you see in about 99% of the videos about the country. Don't get me wrong, there is an awful lot wrong with North Korea (of which I've seen just the tip of the iceberg with my own eyes, they just can't hide the reality), but the country is more than just politics. It almost makes you forget people actually live there, and just like us try to live their lives as good and happy as possible. Even in those harsh circumstances.   I also had a chat once with Alejandro Cao de Benos in a bar in Pyongyang, he has to be one of the most disturbing people I've ever met. It's one thing to be fascinated by the country and have friendly relationships with some of its people. It's a whole different thing to be outright supportive of the regime, and actively promote it to the outside world. I just can't understand how someone from a western country, with all the freedom and information we have here, can see the North Korean political system as superior to whatever other system. While talking to him he seemed like a highly intelligent guy, but with a rather screwed worldview.  Looking forward to your video of the other half of Korea!

It's the best way to deter any American invasion. Their monuments and infrastructure is impressive, especially considering how thoroughly everything was destroyed during the war. Their economic issues with their lack of industrialization and food shortages is also understandable, as the country has been placed under brutal sanctions by the rest of the world for decades.  I do feel that some form of censorship can be sometimes necessary but the DPRK takes it way too far in my opinion.  The DPRK is one of the most unfortunate countries to look at in my opinion. it's overemphasis on the cult of personality and the centralization of power of the Kim regime made the country loose sight of the socialist principles it was founded on.",1년 전,3,

@KatieDawson3636,"As it appears that the stalemate is likely to simply continue for the next several decades, I hope that a bit of both sides can happen. While its true that the DPRK has taken on a terribly dictatorial version of communim, South Korea has also taken on a particularly dystopian and draconian version of capitalism. The DPRK is honestly kinda right in its criticism. I hope that the people of the DPRK are able to grow past their monarchical system to a more honestly people-centered/democratic version of communism, and South Korea can become less reliant on the western world and less focused on rampant capitalistic expansion, materialstic profitering, and elitist monopolistic corporatism. South Koreans need to disentangle themselves from their over-emphasis on productivity which leads to excessive burnout and health issues. Both systems are likely to experience massive changes from the inside before either dares to fire upon the other. If things actually progress in a positive direction for both, they might actually end up more similar in the future.

@AlphaCastor,"남한 사람이 알려주는 북한의 지리  북한의 면적은 약 12만 km² 이고 인구는 약 2500만명입니다.  북한의 최대 도시는 약 300만명이 사는 평양입니다. 그 다음으로 함흥과 청진에 각각 약 6~70만명이 살고 있습니다. 그 외의 작은 도시들: 남포는 평양의 항구를 담당하는 도시입니다. 개성은 옛날 한국을 다스리던 왕조 국가인 고려의 수도였고 남한과 가깝습니다. 원산은 바다가 있는 관광 도시로 유명합니다. 신의주는 중국과 접해 있습니다. 강계와 혜산은 고지대에 있기 때문에 매우 춥습니다. 강계에는 옛날부터 예쁜 여자가 많은 것으로 유명한데, 가볼 수가 없어서 잘 모르겠습니다. 라선은 러시아와 접한 도시입니다. 그 외에도 해주, 사리원, 단천, 김책, 만포, 희천, 순천(남한에도 같은 이름의 도시가 있습니다), 안주(같은 발음의 단어로 잘못 번역될 수도 있습니다. 이 도시의 이름은 Anju입니다.) 등의 도시가 있습니다.  북한에서 가장 높은 산이자 남북한에서 모두 신성하게 여기는 백두산은 활화산이고, 정상에 칼데라 호수인 천지(하늘의 연못이라는 뜻)가 있습니다. 과거 백두산 일대의 큰 화산 폭발로 만들어진 개마고원은 북한에서 가장 추운 곳입니다. 한국 전쟁 당시 개마고원의 장진 호수에서 일어난 전투는 중국과 미국 군대의 수많은 병력을 얼어죽게 했습니다. 금강산은 한국에서 가장 아름다운 산입니다. 남한에서는 북한과 관계가 약간 좋아지면 항상 금강산 관광 얘기가 나오고, '그리운 금강산' 이라는 노래가 있을 정도입니다. 구월산은 9월의 산이라는 뜻으로, 가을 단풍이 아름답습니다. 이외에도 북한의 유명한 산으로는 묘향산, 칠보산, 수양산 등이 있습니다.  북한의 강은 압록강, 두만강, 대동강(평양을 관통합니다), 청천강, 예성강, 성천강, 임진강(남한으로 흘러갑니다) 등이 있습니다.  북한의 주요 길은 크게 2개인데, 하나는 중국에서 신의주, 평양, 개성을 거쳐 남한으로 이어집니다.(물론 어떤 자동차나 기차도 남한으로 가지 못합니다) 다른 하나는 러시아에서부터 동쪽 해안을 따라 청진, 함흥, 원산을 거쳐 남한으로 이어지는 길이 있습니다.(물론 남한으로 갈 수 없습니다.) 북한은 세로로 산맥이 관통하고 있어서 동서를 이어주는 길은 매우 빈약합니다.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

To the extent North Korea begins treating its people better, the sanctions drop to that extent. If North Korea later regresses to a degree, the sanctions rise to that degree -- in lockstep. As things stand now, China may feel that it benefits in some small-ish, intangible way from North Korea's oppression of its people. The west can readily change China's calculus.

@younggamer7218, @melanchorly7618  For one there is still china which would want korea to be a buffer so anyone in power is still going to be loyal to them. Secondly south korea for what it matter wouldn't be here without us aid. They really helped the economy grow and this was done to prove that capitalism can triumph over communism. Which it did and now their idealogical battle is over so there is no incentive to fund it than to keep it as an ally against china. It's economy is also still very underdeveloped and pathetic. It would still have a lot of baggage from it's time as a totalitarian state so it is going to have a hard time recuperating. Also because of cultural differences it is unlikely reunification is going to solve most of these problems.  However it can recover. It however won't be able to become one of the 'best in the world' without help.,3년 전,0,

So much disinformation is spread about the DPRK and amplified by wealthy capitalist countries that the truth is hard to find, and with how secretive they are it’s hard to confirm much. I can only hope that the imperialist powers will give them a break from sanctions and work with them in good faith someday.

@dyawr," @spqr950  😄 Key word is ""reported"". By whom do you think it is reported? Specialists are doubting the vericity of these reports.  What defectors, who have ties inside the country, and specialists say, is that the famine in NK is possibly returning to levels similar to the '90s — when millions of people literally died of starvation.  That's because, since the Covid pandemic the regime has cut imports from China & the lockdowns were so stringent that ppl couldn't go outside to procure food anymore. (which they don't have just available in stores, anyway)  All the embassies have closed down over there — one of the last Consulate to leave were the Russian delegates, who existed the country months ago (on a literal train pulley), bc they said the situation was unlivable anymore: you couldn't find basic foods like oil, salt, sugar, etc. — not to mention medicine, soap, batteries, and so on. And they were living in Pyongyang..  《 ""Over the past year, many foreign diplomats have left the country and Western embassies have closed.  Most travellers have gone overland and crossed the border into China, although there was one flight in March last year to Vladivostok carrying diplomats from Germany, Russia, France, Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Mongolia and Egypt.""  — BBC News, Feb 2021  》  《 ""Russia’s diplomatic mission recently complained about acute shortages of essential goods such as medicine, problems getting healthcare and pandemic restrictions that it said were unprecedented in their severity.""  — Reuters, Apr 2021   》   《 “It is possible to understand those leaving the [North] Korean capital. Hardly everyone can stand the unprecedented total restrictions [on individuals], the sharp deficit of essential goods, including medicines, the lack of any possibility to resolve health problems,” members of staff at the Russian embassy wrote.  Analysts say the measures have allowed the government to increase its control over daily life to levels similar to the famine years of the 1990s. While little information has leaked out of the country, there have been hints of food shortages and a deepening crisis. Six North Korean border guards defected to China last week after describing “hunger and fatigue”. While defections occur regularly, it is unusual for such a large group to cross the border at once.""  — The Guardian, Apr 2021    》   Most or virtually all the money those foreign businesses are making anyway,  are not going to the ""owners"" at all — but to the regime.",3년 전,0,

@dyawr," @spqr950  ""Turkmenistan is one of only a handful of countries, including North Korea, which says it has no coronavirus cases. But reports suggest it is experiencing its third and possibly strongest wave of Covid-19.  Sayahat Kurbanov was suffocating. He gasped for air as if he were running a marathon, the pain in his chest unbearable. He had all the symptoms of coronavirus.  The problem was he was in Turkmenistan, where patients like him officially do not exist.  When he called an ambulance last month the doctor told him he had pneumonia and should go to hospital urgently. Mr Kurbanov (not his real name) knew that the country's doctors referred to Covid cases as pneumonia.

What people are suggesting in this thread is to somehow identify all the borrowed words in every language and then somehow get people to stop using them, which is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. For Spanish, you would essentially have to put all Spanish speakers back in school (whether they like it or not) to teach them alternative Spanish words to use instead of borrowed ones. You would have to translate all of Spanish literature into Spanish with no borrowed words. You would have to correct and/or punish people for using borrowed words. Words they've used all their lives and probably don't even know are borrowed. All so that your sick little perverted mind can rest at night knowing that Spanish is ""pure"" now and that all those dirty Spanish speakers are put in place.

If timezones are applyed correctly to each country, 12 o’clock should be the time when the sunlight perpendiculary meets the surface area your country is on. To put it easier, at 12 PM the sun should be directly above your head.  For political & historical reasons, South Korea(seoul) follows Japan(tokyo)’s timezone. But as you can see on the map, seoul is further west to tokyo. Because of that, the sun doesn’t meet the land perpendiculary at 12 in seoul. It actually does at 12:30PM.

And you clearly know nothing at all about their government either. Kim Jung Un is the general secretary of the Worker’s Party of Korea, but he isn’t the president.

So people who were distributed food, regularly had to start selling stuff to survive (the black market which is technically illegal). And in the process of that many people starved.   2. There are some ethnic minorities such as the Jaeil Gyopo who are most commonly known as Koreans in Japan. They face a lot of discrimination Japan and South Korea, which resulted in some Jaeil Gyopo people to move to North Korea, brainwashed with propaganda from North Korea. But it is believed that majority of them were sent to concentration camps or living a life in North Korea that many people believe that aren't the best. Also, some of them are kidnapped.

@etienne979,"Having traveled to North Korea many times, here goes a few corrections: - Bridge to Vladivostock can be crossed by citizen of pretty much any countries. - There are way more than 3 official land border crossing point with China!!! - Chongjin airport is #2 in importance, then goes in #3 the one next to Mt Paekdu (both of them have semi-regular internal flights). Plans to improve the importance of Wonsan are in the North Korean strategy in the near future, but it's so close to Pyongyang that people prefer doing the 4 hours roadtrip. Hamhung and Sinuiju airport comes last, there are no regular flight with those (even though Hamhung is #2 city, it's not far enough to make sence compared to the train ride). - Coca-Cola is readily available in Pyongyang, but locals just don't care. - Tourists can go pretty much in any province of the country.... Talking about provinces (and special economic zones), why don't you mention them in a geography video? - There's another pipeline with China going stright north from Chongjin. - Yes almost all of local landmarks building are in Pyongyang, that's why most tourists goes there, but a major one you forgot is the West sea barrage, quite an interesting one by itself!! - Yes traditionnal food is weel respected in North Korea, you can go to one of international North-Korean restaurant to try some since you can't travel there (Beijing, Ulaanbator, etc...)  but international cuisine restaurant are easily available in Pyongyang (pizza, sushi, coffeshop, hamburgers...).

Even though the People’s Republic was founded by Lyuh Woon-hyeong who was a centralist, many high ranking officials were brought in from the Left, and there were almost no sayings for individuals like Kim-gu or Syngman Rhee and the Nationalist Korean Provisional Government.

It can be said that the closeness between Indonesia and North Korea that began in the 60s until now is very good.  One sign of the closeness of the two countries is the gift of Indonesian Founding Father Ir Soekarno in the form of a type of hirbrida orchid plant that did not yet have a name for the first North Korean leader Kim Il Sung during his visit to Indonesia in the 1960s.  And the orchid flower is named Kimilsungia.  As a sign of friendship and closeness between the two countries.  The flower has become a national flower in North Korea and every year a kimilsungia flower festival has been held since 1998.,6년 전,2,

Traditionally their language were written with Hanja (Chinese characters) along with Hangul like how Japanese writes. Even till today, there are still a fairly large proportion of Chinese loan words in Korean spoken by both sides, though this might be less in the North as they sort of purified their language and Kim Il Sung (grandfather of the rocket boy and the constitutional President of the regime even by now) immediately wiped out Hanja since the DPRK was established – the South only had their Hanja usage declined in the recent decades.

They just want to remain independent.,6년 전,1,
@thomasdemay9805,"@One you are just USA hater.  North Korea launched unprovoked invasion of South Korea.   USA, as a protector of South Korea had every right then to attack North Korea.  North Korea was bombed hard but that is part of war.  North Korea also did massive destruction as well.  South Korea is today a 1st World Nation a thriving nation.  North Korea is what it is.  Had the USA not bombed North Korea then today all the free people in the South would be living under a communist tyranny.  USA had taken nearly all of North Korea and then the Chinese sent millions of soldiers in resulting in current status.  Had China not sacrificed hundreds of thousands of people to slaughter in human wave attacks all of North Korea would have the same development as South.  USA is the Bad Guy?  Nope.  North Korea is the bad guy.  China is the bad guy.  Bitching about a damn getting blown up in a conflict the size of the Korea War is retarded.  North Korea is lucky, or unlucky depending on how you look at it, that USA didn't use Nukes.

@GGWP-gm5cq," @ninadjoshi4200  My father went there few times for business purposes. My family lived in a city called Dandong which borders North Korea via Yalu River, u can see the others side on basically anywhere. When the nightfall and the Chinese side turn on all the neo-light then proceed to glow like nothing has happened, the NK side fall into utter darkness. The last summer when I went back to my hometown (Im an international student), my father wants to bring me with him on his next trip which I refused cause that experience itself will likely have a permenant mark on visa that would fk around with me in the future (like imagine apply for a visa to study in western country and the dude see a big ass NK visa and travel history). Now according to my dear father  the place is not that bad if you can ignored the bland and tasteless food they offer, but again my father doesn't know anything about technology so I would imagined that side has a pretty ass experience. NK ppl on the other hand, is a bit tricky. There are a lot a lot of them working legally in my hometown (mostly as waitress). They sometimes pissed me off since many of them don't understand Chinese and cannot speak the language properly. But most of Chinese female don't tend to stick around as a waitress they have a big turnover rate, which resulted as bigger restaurant kind of have to hire NK instead. NK male on the other hand, is far more rare (like literally), and I haven't seen any except few official (again I saw them in resteraunt). These workers are very industrious and they try really really hard (but they are also stubborn and act like robot sometimes), but at the same time it is required that they have to write diary everyday, based on what they have seen/learned. So in some ways, they function as kind of semi-civilian level spies (which confused me a lot, who de fk wanna heard the gossip passed down between waitresses).   And a funny ass thing the older people in my hometown would say to scare kid is ""do _ (inset whatever thing) or Imma send u to NK and feed u with potatoes for the rest of your life.""",6년 전,25,

For tourists they stage it in for example amusement parks because otherwise they would be empty and so on. I really wouldn't recommend you to only make your opinion out of the country based on its capital for those reasons and apart from that, only the most loyal to the regime and rich live in there.

In reality, you cannot find anyone who doesn't believe in anything, even things they can't even prove with 100% certainty. Just try turning on your lights just taking for granted that everything that makes it possible to turn on the lights is 100% certain to lead to that conclusion, or try driving a car with 100% certainty that you won't get into an accident or that you will get some parking space; the fact is, you do not run on 100% certainty, and the fact that you disbelieve in Mickey Mouse in some form or another, you will form all sorts of beliefs about other things because disbelief is absence of belief rather than anything substantial in itself. Your skepticism is a parasite that feeds off something rather than nothing.",6년 전,0,
@nobodylikesyoutomioka-san7429,Kim Taehyung: cringe overload,6년 전,0,
@impact0r," @ioannispolemarkhos7364   This is what happens, when you respond to somebody you did not understand. ➊. Where did I wrote or even suggested, that ""If you don't believe Mickey Mouse is real, it means you're bound to disbelieve in everything""? Read my post again. It was you who was suggesting in the first post that if someone does not believe in one god, then he is likely to believe in another. This is obviously not true - as I wrote sarcastically in my last response: the fact that I no longer believe Mickey Mouse is a real person does not mean I am more likely to believe any other cartoon character is. Same goes for bronze age fairy tales for grown up people - gods. The fact I grew out of believing in Christian/Muslim/Jewish god Jahwe (because I recognised there is no good reason to thing it's true, and plenty that it isn't) makes me LESS, not MORE likely (as you suggested) to believe in other gods. The same way as getting rid of cancer doesn't make me more susceptible to HIV.   ➋. Of course, Sherlock, everybody's vision of reality consists ONLY of beliefs. Belief = state of being convinced something is true. For example, I believe I am writing a response to you. Also, here's a thing you missed, Sherlock - there is nothing we can believe with  100% certainty.   ➌. You either do not understand what ""scepticism"" is, or you are much, much less smart than you think you are. Scepticism = following the idea of believing as many true things and as few false things as possible. To achieve this, it is necessary to accept ONLY those beliefs which have good reason to think they are true (i.e. valid + sufficient evidence). Anyone who does not use scepticism in his life, is a person who doesn't care whether he/she believes in true or false things (in other words - an idiot).   You probably confuse scepticism with cynicism, which is a totally different thing. And yes, there were a movement of sceptics in ancient Greece (as you probably know since you seem to be a Greek), but this was not the same thing as modern scepticism.

In addition, the Korean Empire officially made the time zone UTC+8:30 in the early Twentieth Century.  Later, in 1912 the Governor-General of Korea changed the timezone to Japan Standard Time (UTC+9:00).

In the early Chinese traditional myths, there is a clear definition of the location and orientation of the East China Sea, which is the territory of the ""Dragon King of the East China Sea"", the God in charge of rainwater, The Chinese people's definition of the East China Sea has been established and unshakable.",3년 전,0,

@franbalcal,"i was in north korea about 7 weeks ago, I can corroborate to the vast majority of this but for some tiny things. 1)It is actually very easy to travel to the DPRK, you have to arrange it via a tour group and there are a few of those around. I even  used the same company Otto Warmbier used and it was very good, would highly recommend Young Pioneers (I am not getting paid for this btw). Hardly anyone gets rejected from getting a DPRK tourist visa (it is not even stuck in your passport, the only clue that Ihave been there is  the stamp from the chinese border city). Only South Koreans are refused, so americans can in theory go but the US government has sanctions against it and many of these tour operators don't take americans. i only made the decision to go about 10 days before actually going so the paperwork is fast too. 2) Most people in pyongyang had smartphones, the brand is called ""pyongyang"" you see them playing candy crush and solitaire in the metro, etc 3) the government approved haircuts is not a thing, i asked and they looked at me like I was crazy, 4) My 5 400 won leftover can attest that foreigners can use the DPRK currency but you are not allowed to leave the country with it, i had to smuggle mine out. 5) I had the neng myon, It was indeed good but to my surprise most of their carbonated drinks were amazing! but they came in this super thing flimsy plastic bottles which would spill when you try to twist open the lead.",7년 전,6,

(China also tried to conquer some USSR land by ridiculous blitzkriegs from time to time which resulted in thousands Chinese soldiers and several dozens of Russian soldiers dead. When USSR collapsed Russia with it collapsing army was sorta forced to hand those lands which China desired to China, which is one another reason why people hate Elcin.)",7년 전,0,

And the armistice agreement was done in 1953. DPRK would never have survived without the Chinese intervention.

@VRSVLVS,"Well, it seems that you have fallen prey to the misconception that the principles of ""democracy"" and ""communism"" are mutually exclusive. This is no surprise of course, since regimes of the 20th century such as the USSR and the PRC that at least nominally proclaimed themselves to be inspired by ""communist"" ideology were some of the most undemocratic and repressive regimes ever seen.  However, if one takes the effort to read actual communist literature by folks like Marx, Lenin, Luxemburg and others you'll discover that the whole idea of communism is based around the unrelenting pursuit of democracy. The whole point of wanting to overthrow capitalism is the fact that communists see capitalism, with it's hierarchical relationship between capitalist boss and worker, as profoundly and inherently undemocratic. What communists seek to achieve is the democratic control over the means of production, in order to build a society and economy that produces for, and serves the needs of all human beings, in place of a society in which the majority toil for the benefit of a privileged few.  The great irony of the 20th century is of course that a movement that set out to liberate humankind from the yoke of oppressive hierarchical structures, and conquer universal democratic control over society and the economy, became associated with the very opposite of what it set out to achieve. Namely authoritarian state control over all aspects of life.",7년 전,27,

Being Cuban myself (born and raised there), y'all wouldn't believe some of the Alternative Facts I've heard about my country, things that never happened or that are not a thing, and that the government couldn't possibly have possibly hidden from the people if they had or if they were.

Due to ever-present surveillance, many pray with eyes open, and gathering for praise or fellowship is practically impossible. Worship of the ruling Kim family is mandated for all citizens, and those who don’t comply (including Christians) are arrested, imprisoned, tortured or killed. Entire Christian families are imprisoned in hard labor camps, where unknown numbers die each year from torture, beatings, overexertion and starvation. Those who attempt to flee to South Korea through China risk execution or life imprisonment, and those who stay behind often fare no better.",7년 전,0,

Meanwhile, NK has some of the worst living conditions in the world, thanks to their laws.  It's so bad that both China and Russia are like ""yeah... we don't really want to keep footing the bill for every mistake you make"".  It makes sense that NK wants the wealth of SK to push whatever their agenda is, but it is so ridiculously unrealistic that SK would ever allow that, and the North should know that.",7년 전,0,

@Dorgpoop,"Here's slightly more detailed explanation of the Korean war. North Korea attacked South Korea with the indirect (no proper troop assistance) of chairman Mao of China and General Secretary Stalin of the USSR, and the UN declared this as unjust. The South Koreans had bad moral with the unpopular nationalist leader Syngman Rhee, and as US troops had just been removed from the peninsula after WW2, the North Koreans pushed deep into the South. Soon the south Koreans and western coalition forces were confined to a tiny corner in the South of Korea. But then US general McArthur lead a massively successful naval invasion behind enemy lines, and pretty soon the west had control of the south again. Then McArthur was a bit of an idiot and went beyond his UN mandate when he pushed NK past the 38th parralel and continued to invade the North even after he'd expelled them from the south. As western coalition forces pushed the north Koreans back they approached the Yalu river border with China in the North. Mao was terrified that McArthur might continue over the border into China and overthrown his communist PRC regime, especially as he was threatening to use nuclear weapons against China. As a result he sent unofficial ""volenteers"" to assist NK. After a few years a stalemate was reached roughly around the original 38th parallel border, so they just gave up, kept Korea split, and there's been relative peace ever since.",7년 전,0,

Like you said, the civilians in NK don't have it easy, but they're less likely to be a problem for the state if they believe their leader to be a supreme being. It's all about propaganda, and it is a very well studied and established political phenomenon. Narcissism is a psychiatric disorder.   And, Although it would be nice for NK to collapse, this would cause much problems. Why do you think China keeps helping the NK regime? Because they don't want millions of NK refugees pouring through the border, causing violence and other major problems.   Just imagine the diseases, the political nightmare, and the damages the brainwashed NKs would cause if their state was to fail. The better thing would be a German reunification 2.0 in the Korean peninsula. But NK is 1000x less developed than East Germany was, and 1000x more brainwashed, and this doesn't include the geopolitical nightmare the Korean peninsula is in. China and Russia are not likely to be thrilled to see Nato and American troops at their eastern borders. Honestly, this is a very shitty situation.",7년 전,3,

@ddlc_monika,"Hi, small comment about Japan once again since I think there's not gonna be a lot of open geograpeeps from there (since they kinda hate speaking english): Zainichi koreans actually refers to ALL koreans as a people group, and frankly they are usually looked down upon - yes, even south koreans.  I think northerners will be referred to like that as well, but Zainichi in general usually refers to Koreans.  Actually, just the word itself only means ""currently situated in japan"", it's written 在日 which means ""be"" and ""sun"", sun referring to 日本 - japan in this case. So one could guess they mean foreigners in general, but it's actually mostly koreans who are referred to as zainichi. Normal foreigners are 外国人 gaikokujin - ""other country people"", or short ""gaijin"", which usually has a bad connotation and for some reason a dumb, loud and rude stereotype attached to it.

Outside of Pyongyang the living conditions are unimaginable... the struggle of escaping the country's dictatorship is pure horror. Everyone should be truly educated about what North Korean people have to go through - I feel like everyone makes fun of Kim and all of that but not many come to realize that 25 million people are being treated  terrifyingly! Just watch some interviews or documentaries about North Korean Defectors and you'll understand what I mean... We should all know about this and it needs to change drastically!,7년 전,0,

@Dorgpoop,"Yeah but American General McArthur was a bit of an idiot and went beyond his UN mandate when he pushed NK past the 38th parralel and continued to invade the North even after he'd expelled them from the south. As western coalition forces pushed the north Koreans back they approached the Yalu river border with China in the North. Mao was terrified that McArthur might continue over the border into China and overthrown his communist PRC regime, especially as he was threatening to use nuclear weapons against China. As a result he sent unofficial ""volenteers"" to assist NK. After a few years a stalemate was reached roughly around the original 38th parallel border, so they just gave up, kept Korea split, and there's been relative peace ever since.",7년 전,14,

Then China invades North Korea because the war is going badly for their allies, not because the USA was invading China, and the idea that a Chinese intervention could stop the USA from using nuclear weapons makes no sense, neither China nor the USSR had the capability to retaliate.

So to say, North Korea is the only leftover fascist state in the world, an eminent prove where they worship their leader to quasi-religious figure with govt propaganda all over the country (reminds me the other fascist state in Europe 🧐) and only to disguise it with socialism bcos Sovyet supported them during the cold war era.

However, it will most certainly be the south corean system, that will stay because of the fundamental flaws of extreme economic systems.

Due to ever-present surveillance, many pray with eyes open, and gathering for praise or fellowship is practically impossible. Worship of the ruling Kim family is mandated for all citizens, and those who don’t comply (including Christians) are arrested, imprisoned, tortured or killed. Entire Christian families are imprisoned in hard labor camps, where unknown numbers die each year from torture, beatings, overexertion and starvation.

@WizardOfOss,"Having visited the country three times, I can say you did a great job on keeping the video pretty factual, without all the political rhetoric you see in about 99% of the videos about the country. Don't get me wrong, there is an awful lot wrong with North Korea (of which I've seen just the tip of the iceberg with my own eyes, they just can't hide the reality), but the country is more than just politics. It almost makes you forget people actually live there, and just like us try to live their lives as good and happy as possible. Even in those harsh circumstances.   I also had a chat once with Alejandro Cao de Benos in a bar in Pyongyang, he has to be one of the most disturbing people I've ever met. It's one thing to be fascinated by the country and have friendly relationships with some of its people. It's a whole different thing to be outright supportive of the regime, and actively promote it to the outside world. I just can't understand how someone from a western country, with all the freedom and information we have here, can see the North Korean political system as superior to whatever other system. While talking to him he seemed like a highly intelligent guy, but with a rather screwed worldview.  Looking forward to your video of the other half of Korea! Which I also visited 3 times by the way, so you can't blame me for picking sides ;-)",7년 전,2,
