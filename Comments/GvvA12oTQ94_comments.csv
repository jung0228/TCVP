If you want, just a minute before draining pasta you can cook it inside the pan with the sauce for his last minute. 2) Pasta and coconut milk is blasphemy. It's not sauce, it's not new cuisine. Is like eating an hot dog with cockroach meat, not using ketchup but human blood vith viruses and instead of drinking a beer you drink directly from the toilet of a stadium just after some kind of match. It's a joke on internet and if you like it then probably you never eaten properly or you are simply joking in front of the cam. 3) If you want to follow some recipe about pasta on internet and youtube, just search on the italian channels and unsubscribe from that channel where they told you to make that joke, that freak of nature you call food. 4) Never do that again!

What makes these vehicles so expensive? Is the Chiron really worth $3 million? Is this Earthroamer worth $700k. You definitely get more out of this.

These Laws include do not lie, do not steal, don’t put others gods before Him (Exodus 20)  Have you ever broken any of these Laws? Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you ever lusted after someone? If we really went over God’s Laws in the Bible, every single one of them, it can really expose how much of a sinner we truly are and because we have all committed these acts our punishment is Hell because God’s standard is perfection.   Our good works cannot get us into Heaven. That’s like you steal a soda from the store but you tell the judge, “hey judge I give to the orphanage, I do community service.” The judge will not care about what you did. You stole something that was not yours so therefore the Judge is going to find you guilty. God is the same way.  But, this Judge is a loving Judge who does not want to sentence you for your crimes. He sent His Son Jesus Christ to come and take the punishment for your sins and if you Repent of your sins and accept jesus Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior then you will be saved from the sentence. Jesus loves you and is not willing that any should perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16) God bless",3년 전,0,

@Starganderfish,"This is confusing. Aside from being grossly overpriced (nothing here is worth the price, at least 4-500k overpriced) who exactly is this targeted at? Anyone wealthy enough to afford this is probably not interested in travelling around in a small camper-van, no matter how luxurious. Millionaires don’t want a tiny truck or to stay on a caravan park. Wealthy folks with disposable wealth are more likely to buy a luxury bus sized camper-truck or a nice yacht. They’ll sell some but not many. I bet if they sold these for $100k instead of $650k they’d sell a LOT more. Biggest issue though is how complicated it is and how much can go wrong. I can almost guarantee that stuff would start breaking within a year and maintenance and repair would be insanely expensive.  Finally though… $650k and the freaking toilet cartridge leaks? Even if it’s only water inside it at the time, for that price you should be able to swing that around your head without spilling a drop.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@strangelyfamiliar1729," @itsJayden461  A 'Hook'! And u, my dear, are the fish. When fishing amongst many other fishermen/fisherwomen, in a relatively narrow stretch of water, and you hook a fish you say loudly ""Fish On!"" so that everyone takes their lines out of the water or keeps an eye on which way the fish is running, as a means of courtesy, so that everyone doesn't get tangled and the person with the 'fish on' doesnt lose the fish. My initial reply in this thread, being 'nobody lives that long', was just dry sarcasm and plainly not meant to be serious. You, having replied to it in a serious manner as though I actually meant what I said, could be thought of as having 'took the bait' (and thus my reply 'fish on!').

@emilyrobinson6080,"I feel like this has a lot of features that look great on paper. But to me, it seems like a lot of money for a plug and play system in a capacity where you really dont want something plug and play. Someone buying this and taking it out overlanding through wilderness thinking the price makes it infallible or drastically underestimating the amount of skill and knowledge is needed for certain trails etc is in for a really rough awakening when they realize one of those prefabricated systems crapped out or they have no idea how to use it.   I dont mind overbuilt things, I tend to overbuild myself. But I feel like if youre going to be taking a rig through areas where your only way out is through, you should know every single inch of that machine, how it works, where everything is in relation to other items, and how to pull it out, bang on it and administer a field repair if necessary. This strikes me as a land titanic: so many overbuilt systems the possibility of something going horribly wrong is theoretically reduced but if and when it does it will be all the more terrible. Not to mention for the better part of a million bucks taking that thing anywhere off pavement seems like a worse financial move than buying an expensive renaissance painting and using it as a dart board. This thing strikes me as the sort of thing some millionaire influencer might park at Coachella to make people think theyre more into the outdoors than they actually are, or something someone who wants the tiny house or van life on paved or level roads but is terrified of having something go wrong might get if they dont mind spending what it would cost for an actual house in many areas.

@240devil1," @snakeplissken1754  It is. There’s not much luxury about this. It isn’t ground breaking or lucrative. The only thing you got right about this is that it’s for the rich. And that’s fine. Go with what you can afford. But it isn’t that luxurious and it is most certainly a niche of a niche. The truck itself is way too too heavy to take on many true off road trails. It’s way too tall and would get mangled on small trails in the woods. It’s too heavy to go off-roading in much sand honestly. Like they are trying so hard to sell you this that you can get from a converted van for under $7k lol. I converted my half ton Ford with a topper into a roamer with a swing out tail gate instead of a flip up and I was able to have an awning, outdoor kitchen, storage, outdoor toilet and solar shower and I could run it through almost any mud hole I wanted to without worrying about getting stuck or tipping over. Again…this is fine if you are super rich and wanting everyone to know you have money…but it is still greatly overpriced. You can buy a Ford F550 bus with under 100k miles  and convert it into a more stable mobile house for under $70k lol.",3년 전,6,

@brettbarrett2533,"I hope EarthRoamer is no longer feeling hesitant about letting you two demo that unit for 24 hours. I completely understand the liability and risk from EarthRoamers' point of view. It certainly is not a simple consideration. No matter how many followers you have, you're just a stranger from the internet still, and with how valuable these units are... It's easy to understand why it would be tough getting a company to allow an individual, couple, or group to take it and create a proper Demo of what the unit offers. I find both viewings/ demos as informative and useful. That from someone such as Phillip who has built EarthRoamer and knows every in and out as well as someones first-time impressions and attempting to properly discover and utilize all those features.  Great job and this was my 3rd or 4th time seeing a video on these Earth Roamers.  I live close to Boulder and have seen one of these in person and they are nothing short of breathtaking. Not for everyone but certainly anyone could enjoy themselves with one of these... Only need to sell the home to get one, haha.",3년 전,1,

@Meoww-tivation,"I had a dream one time, there were these marble lights in Gods hand. There were different levels of brightness. The more dim ones showed first. They were glowing but not bright enough to light anything around them. Then Gods voice came into my mind and said “these lights bring me joy” then he shuffled the lights in his hands until the brighter ones shown. The brighter lights were bright enough to light the darkness around them. Then Gods voice came again and said “but these ones give me strength.” The marbles represent people. And the light is the love and obedience to God they emanate. I believe that the parable in my dream represented the strength we give to God when we strive to share the light with others! We can do this by praying for others! Serving others, sharing the gospel and the doctrine with others, and sharing our testimonies of God and Jesus! We actually give him strength? Well, not directly but I directly through serving others we serve our God. It says so in the Bible:)",3년 전,0,

No silly gimmick stuff to suck one in...it's onvious that their engineers consulted with their target market and built on this.  The quality of materials wraps everything in beautiful - not trendy - design that will hold to timeless well.  Simply blown away.

At the end of the day tho, most everything is just shiny stuff that has nothing to do with our real value and the value of those we hold dear.    Life is the ultimate genius of design and craftsmanship. Shiny things come / go and are replaceable. But who we are and who we care for cannot be built ever again no matter the effort, assets or assembly line and at any price.

@nsbchannel1,"Good job making the video and showing the vehicle, bad design for the vehicle. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if it's raining or snowing, and if you're parked on mud, sand, snow, etc., you have to get out of the cab and make the walk to the camper in the rain through the mud just to stop and sleep for the night. Or vice versa if you have to move the vehicle to a new location in the middle of the night in a rain or snow storm. Every time you need something, get out, make the walk to the camper, walk back to the cab...wet clothes, wet rain gear, mud, snow, leaves, pine needles. The bed(s) need to be knee to waist level and make it so one person doesn't have to crawl over the other person then mountain climb to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Having to climb back up to the bed, now you're wide awake. I'd buy one with two smaller beds, than one large one up high with little headroom. I see wasted space as well, for the sake of being fancy. The toilet/black water tank is just poor design and not big enough. For $700,000 you need something really special regarding layout & design. It's only special regarding fit, finish, and technology. I think the designers started out with the best of intentions, but along the way, made too many compromises, and lost sight of what this vehicle should be.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@dhranch4627,"Id have to disagree however many years ago might have made a similar statement.   First, we have the rig being an F550. Most of these are destined to work and come appropriately stripped with a 80k price. To have one built with all the interior options of the more common F350 plus exterior bling like mounding and doorbhandles that aren't from the Amish Package, and I'll guess the cab and chassis came in at close to 125 or 130.  Next... Carbon Fiber. Not much needs to be said on that front but this beast is made FROM it. Not accented, not highlighted with or essences of it. It's MADE of it. Imma guess 100k in carbon fiber just for the shell.  Next up we have the biggest toteboard of 'Let's Get Small'. Price per square inch on a motor home gets exponentially larger the smaller one goes. Eventually there is a balance point but it's a rule that makes sense after one gets over the initial shock. Going Small yet keeping the expected functionality costs more with tighter spaces for behind the scenes plumbing / wiring etc as well as for the fixed cost of the thing itself. Poor example but what comes immediately to mind is extend-Range or performance of an electric vehicle requires either more batteries or better performing batteries that fit in the same space available for the standard ones yet offer more capacity. Going smaller yet expecting same or bigger will cost ya no matter how its sliced. Toss in another 100k or this and the other etc's plus labor which is not piece work but craftsmanship level crew.   Then throw in all the touches like plate and silverware slots that keep the rig quiet while driving (huge, trust me on that or try listening to glasses clink and crap rattles for 300 miles on the way to the camp. )  Every where one looks, this rig is filled with this type of unexpected design and thought that oh just so happens to be wrapped in higher-end finishes and or materials. Check another 100k here.  Lastly, wheels, leveling, power plant. God knows how many stage paint, bumper boxes etc and it's bespoke without actually being bespoke. But I bet they welcome call outs. Either way...pop another 100k to the bill for this and installs and integration with everything else. Oh and make sure it all can survive extreme swings in Temps, being shaken and bumped as well being potentially invaded by mud, critters and moisture that is magically repelled for years.  So far, I'm up to 425k but very likely have missed a good number of items so I'll use a standard overrun factor of 30% to account for it bringing my final estimate to basically 600k.  Dealer ask is around 700k. They ain't getting rich at that point which is why earlier I remarked in another comment of expecting 900k. Or more.  This is a bargain.",3년 전(수정됨),5,

Want something cheap you can get a used travel trailer for 20k, park at a busy campsite and be fine. Want to extreme boondock and trust you will be safe?  Call my guys at Earthroamer",3년 전,3,
@mikevan4497," @Behindthejab  thanks ! your reply is convincing.i would love something similar ,but geared more for urban living. tanks smaller because fill ups would be easier. less solar , and so on. the only thing I would request is maybe more security and maybe some bullet proofing. thanks for the reply",3년 전,2,

I think it’s more about long term boondocking which is hard to pull off especially with my amazing 8 cu ft refrigerator I sell them in there and all the luxury.   Want to go to a KOA then you don’t need this, you can get a really loaded travel trailer for 50k and plug it in next to a ton of other people. Want to unplug and not see a human for a week out in the middle of some amazing nature?  This would be your vehicle",3년 전,2,

@Behindthejab," @mikevan4497  sounds like you would need to do some kind of custom job.  If you want to boondock, and don't mind a small space there are TONS of custom van guys out there.  I woudl go with a 4x4 sprinter van, work with Avani at Briter Products in South Bend, IN to get your solar/lithium ion battery set up to make sure you keep power  24/7 as you never know where you might need to make camp.    While bullet proof glass sounds great for security, I would focus more on making sure you have extra storate for food, water and gas and the ability to purify water.

@MrAkaacer," @cl1cka  Is it overpriced? I think the engineering and build costs would be pretty high. An apartment's value in large part, is based upon location, which is kind of silly.

Yea having a bed you cant even sit up in is a straight up deal breaker for me plus the thing is brand new and theres a stench when you lift the toilet lid? Just no.  Heres what you do as a normal person. take $500k of that money and invest it 5 rental homes, use $200k to build the ultimate overlanding rig yourself, and keep $50k in the bank for a rainy day while living off the profits of your rentals. Then once you get older and get tired of living like a vagrant, having to hide from people just to park and sleep you can sell those rentals for probably a million dollars or more at that point.

@CJZ964,"This thing is awesome, the price point is way out of whack considering it’s a pick up truck. All the money went towards the carbon fibre which is cool but not for everyone since it’s gonna be a pig on diesel either way which at that price tag shouldn’t be a concern to begin with, nobody cares about the cool/hot factor at that price point either, a webasto for the cold nights will do and open windows do the cooling also those gadgets spell high repair bills. when you can drop that kind of money on a camper I guess repairs ain’t a concern until they fail mid trip. It’s cool but not worth the price tag. Keep your van and upgrade it as needed. The 2 extra feet of headroom and vacuum out of the floor is not worth it.  Not trying to bash the company that made it but there’s no way someone higher up looked at this and went “yep, this is a great idea”. There’s a reason why you were the only one in the “group” that was driving one of these. Either way happy camping!",3년 전,0,

@MountainManKm," @cbxxb4841  I have been driving tractor trailers since I was 13, I have hauled some serious weight. I know the physics behind towing, the truck's weight capacity, how you want the weight distributed either in, on, or behind the truck on a trailer, where the weight is put on the trailer. I know truck campers too, I have owned a few of them! You did not really debate any of my points other than its heavy duty. I own 8 different trucks, one is a F550  some are pickups, some are Kensworths and some are Peterbuilts. I was born and raised in CO, trucking on the windy roads and up and down the passes, in the winter takes some thought. Whoever engineered that and didn't make it a DRW,  I can promise you does not have much experience with trucking. If it weighs that much to require a F550, then it needs a DRW, you would be foolish not to have that feature, especially in the mountains! All of my trucks are DRWs, but my F150...obviously. Thanks for the reply",3년 전,0,
@cbxxb4841," @MountainManKm  Gotta disagree Kaden, I also grew up in Colorado, now live in Montana.  Spent 40 years in the ranching business and lots of time off constructed roads.  Traction on duelies is not at all good in 4wd situations or for off roading.  Yes, for towing and down the highway for stability and the like they are great, but in my opinion, not good off road.  Earthroamers are not primarily towing vehicles.  You are certainly welcome to disagree.   I also owned a semi (with a cattle pot) and drove in into some pretty gnarley places.  Plus I own an earthroamer now (an '05).      Let's both agree that 700K is pretty rough, (got mine used), but people will pay that, so I can understand that is how they have it priced.  I think they only make less than 30 of these a year, so the demand is there.",3년 전,0,

Look at all those electronics and electrical appliances, custom cabinetry and finishing.  A shitload of man-hours goes into hand-building this truck+camper a few at a time over weeks or months, not a factory churning out 50/day.  That costs $.  Sure, I'm sure that Earthroamer gets a pretty big profit for each one they sell, but definitely not ""scam"" sorts of money.

@TomFYouTube," @BarChrome  Really!? What a asinine question! You must work for them to justify $400k or more profit per unit?  I call that greed!  Yes price can be dictated by what the market will bear but that doesn't make it right or ethical. No my friend, I have principles and if I could afford 10 of them I wouldn't buy a single one from them because I can't stand greed! There are cheaper alternatives and I could always have someone build one for me at less than 1/2 the cost or build it myself at less than 1/3 the cost. Don't get me started on how overpriced the HD is.",3년 전,14,

@TomFYouTube," @BarChrome  this is NOT about what I can or can not afford! It's about excessive greed of a company! As much as I want a similar vehicle for off road camping, I would NEVER give into this level of greed no matter how much money I have. I would NOT run my company this way. A decent profit ($100k) is one thing excessive profit ($400k) and greed are another. Without going into details I know how much most of these components including composite materials, and cabinet work cost. I also know labor hours involved in the design and manufacturing of the ""composite house shell"" and the cabinet work. It's alwa 's been a dream to manufacture a quality off road class c that more people can afford. I'd rather build 200units a year at $200k and make $20k per unit than 20units and make $400k per unit.

@glowingsme7943," @Swissk31300BO  For me, I tend to see it’s a city vs more rural issue.  So many cities have essentially made it illegal to own a weapon and if you do, you can’t use it for defense… You have to retreat.. like even if you are on the 2nd floor and have to jump out of a window, you must take that option of jumping out, breaking your neck, and retreating, before you are allowed to use a weapon for defending your person.    So, I’d say the propaganda has worked for people who haven’t had the ability for generations to even reasonably own a weapon or carry it on their person.  They just don’t know.  However, we are seeing a lot of states enact constitutional carry laws.  And other states also include “stand your ground” laws.  Take the current case occurring in WI.  There was no reason anyone had to run away.  They could stand and defend their own person.  Which is why it shouldn’t be a case at trial.  I think as the world has gotten insane… People have naturally decided to use their rights given by forefathers and really learn and be responsible for their own person.  Can’t always rely of Daddy Govt.  and this has NO political persuasion.    Those who don’t know and protest just don’t know.  It’s time to offer to teach people and explain how it all works.  One day on a range for most normal protestors without a clue, and they get it. And they are hooked into learning and eventually owning.  Propaganda does work on many people.

The truck itself would set you back at most $100k leaving you with $100k to spend on the interior. Outside the engineering aspect I doubt they're spending much more than $150k to build not counting their man hours which is probably a few hundred hours per unit. Let's call it a 1000 man hours with 5 guys making $30 an hour that's an additional $150k. So $300k would easily leave them with $50k-$75k in profit.,3년 전,15,
@cmdrquillon9398,"​ @PatrickCavanaugh0420  I think your maths may be a little off.  100k + 100k (probably closer to 150k for the truck but oh well) = 200k. We haven't even considered man hours or shipping yet. We'll call shipping about ~25k for all the parts, as they will not all be made in the same place, plus they need to source wood for the interior etc. You can add another 175k to that 200k then, as I'll go with your 150k for man hours.  100k + 100k + 25k + 150k = 375k. Materials alone will probably cost well more than 100k, so that guess is probably very incorrect. Don't forget, most of the shell of the camper section is carbon fibre. That material is prohibitively expensive. There's a reason that aeroplanes they make out of it sell for a third of a billion each. 787-10 List Price: $338.4m They are probably still charging more than is reasonable, but they won't be doing a 300% markup I wouldn't imagine.",3년 전,22,

@gregorytimmons4777, @PatrickCavanaugh0420  It's not just you mate. Having just bought a used sail boat 5 months ago and thinking what 3/4 of a mill. could get me in a boat it's no contest. Also considering the horrible quality of most R.V.'s and that they basically rip you off for a good chunk of what you paid for vs. what you get and this is not even factoring in the rather automatic fate of old R.V.'s. I'm sure that for this money i could buy my wet dream sail boat and have enough left over for a new wake boat or at least a couple of new PWC's.,3년 전,3,

@cmdrquillon9398," @PatrickCavanaugh0420  As I said, the 100k on materials is likely a massive lowball. The true price is likely at least 200k on materials. They are still overcharging I think, but not by as much as you say maybe.",3년 전,4,

@dhranch4627,"Respectfully, most of y'all are so wrong its almost painful to read. Here's why:  First, we have the rig being an F550. Most of these are destined to work and come appropriately stripped with a 80k price. To have one built with all the interior options of the more common F350 plus exterior bling like mouldings and doorbhandles that aren't from the Amish Package, and I'll guess the cab and chassis came in at close to 125 or 130.  Next... Carbon Fiber. Not much needs to be said on that front but this beast is made FROM it. Not accented, not highlighted with or essences of it. It's MADE of it. Imma guess 100k in carbon fiber just for the shell.  Next up we have the biggest toteboard of 'Let's Get Small'. Price per square inch on a motor home gets exponentially larger the smaller one goes. Eventually there is a balance point but it's a rule that makes sense after one gets over the initial shock. Going Small yet keeping the expected functionality costs more with tighter spaces for behind the scenes plumbing / wiring etc as well as for the fixed cost of the thing itself. Poor example but what comes immediately to mind is extend-Range or performance of an electric vehicle requires either more batteries or better performing batteries that fit in the same space available for the standard ones yet offer more capacity. Going smaller yet expecting same or bigger will cost ya no matter how its sliced. Toss in another 100k or this and the other etc's plus labor which is not piece work but craftsmanship level crew.   Then throw in all the touches like plate and silverware slots that keep the rig quiet while driving (huge, trust me on that or try listening to glasses clink and crap rattles for 300 miles on the way to the camp. )  Every where one looks, this rig is filled with this type of unexpected design and thought that oh just so happens to be wrapped in higher-end finishes and or materials. Check another 100k here.  Lastly, wheels, leveling, power plant. God knows how many stage paint, bumper boxes etc and it's bespoke without actually being bespoke. But I bet they welcome call outs. Either way...pop another 100k to the bill for this and installs and integration with everything else. Oh and make sure it all can survive extreme swings in Temps, being shaken and bumped as well being potentially invaded by mud, critters and moisture that is magically repelled for years.  So far, I'm up to 425k but very likely have missed a good number of items so I'll use a standard overrun factor of 30% to account for it bringing my final estimate to basically 600k.  Dealer ask is around 700k. They ain't getting rich at that point which is why earlier I remarked in another comment of expecting 900k. Or more.  This is a bargain.",3년 전,0,

I acknowledge to You that I am a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins and the life that I have lived; I need your forgiveness. I believe that your only begotten Son Jesus Christ shed His precious blood on the cross at Calvary and died for my sins, and I am now willing to turn from my sin. You said in the bible that if we confess the Lord our God and believe in our hearts that God raised Jesus from the dead, we shall be saved. Right now I confess Jesus as my Lord.

Most if not all van life DIY’s live on tight budgets, unless of course they come from a well to do background, have established businesses, or some source of income revenue. Yes they get to travel and basically live on a home with wheels but realistically speaking it’s not that simple to do. However, anything is possible for a dreamer if you have a dream live it, life is worth taking risks and most people live in fear and are afraid to leave their own perceived confort surroundings. One of the worst feelings in the world is to reach the end of your rope, look back and have regrets as to why you didn’t do or accomplished certain things in life.  Life is extremely fragile and yes SHORT! We take our lives for granted and we finally open our eyes is too late to look back. One of the biggest downfall of mankind, male or female is to look back in time and wonder “what if” please don’t be that person, take risk, travel, enjoy the beauty that earth has to give you, and if you fail at least you can say, “I tried and gave it my all”  fear, doubt, insecurities, lack of self esteem are dream killers.",4년 전,0,

It's under-rated but believe me, it's spectacular everywhere. Also, recently we traveled to Yukon, very much the other end of Canada and it's out-of the world.

@Puddycat58,"Me realizing if I’d saved about half my pay since 2008 til now, I’d have about $350k in the bank. But my dumbass spent it all on designer clothes, shoes, high end makeup, hundreds of bottles of very expensive perfumes and hair and nails. Beautiful blonde hair costs a small fortune to maintain. And I spent a fortune on my 3 Rottweilers. The pic of me on left was taken before I went full on blonde. I have noticed that i got way too much attention as a blonde babe. I hate attention. I’m kinda shy. So yeah I’m an idiot. I have a hubby who paid for mortgage, bills and everything and i got to keep all the money i made at my job. Which paid very well. I became an over-spender. Now in 2023 I have my own 3 bedroom house and two of the rooms, attic and garage are full of my stuff. Im about to open up my own online store to sell off 90% of my stuff. Being that I have never even worn any of the 145 pairs of designer jeans and shoes, clothes. I am hoping to at least recover half of my money. And I have lots of gold and silver jewelry, about $50,000 worth. If i can get half of what I paid, I’ll be happy. A few items are very rare, and some perfumes are discontinued and highly sought after, those I am selling for 2-3 times what I paid. Only coz that’s the going price. So yeah . I’m an idiot. When I think I could have put the $350k in the bank and live off the interest. Let’s see 3% interest on $350k is $10,500 a year. That’s  about $900 a month in free cash. Yeah I’m an idiot. If I can recover $175,000 or more, I am NOT making the same mistakes. Every penny is being invested. I’m hoping for a 6-10% return. In the most secure way. Banks don’t pay shit. I remember decades ago when banks would pay 6% interest on savings. Now it’s less than 1%.",2년 전,0,

Two suggestions for Earthroamer, Nate shouldn't have to download a spirit level app to check if the vehicle has been adjusted to be totally level.  This type of vehicle with the functionality it has should have a built-in spirit level device in the driver's cabin.  I suspect it may already have it only Nate was unaware it it.  Second suggestion,  some how make the solar panels lift upwards and outwards, so standing vertically, forming a privacy screen for people who want to sunbath on the roof.

Sponsorship just does not cover the obscene expense of all these elitest you tubers. Do u think people are stupid? I saw u 2 in Jasper Canada with Robert Murat at your side in 2015.

@Sparkplugs_and_Sawdust," @carcriticexplained172  I can sorta see what you mean....but you need to realize the trim level of the truck, it's a lariat I believe, the suspension system costs around 15-20k, the camper part being all carbon fiber also isn't cheap seeing as that sh*t is expensive....the wheel/tire set up is pricey, in my opinion they could have just gone with some offroad wheels say from Method wheels and would be just as well off and also just use regular R/T or M/T tires and you can go normal cruising speeds on the freeway.... I think if you were motivated enough you could build one just as good for cheaper...my opinion 😉",4년 전,2,

And  got threatened with guns, for going door to door for lgbtq rights in Utah. This kind of purity test crap is what’s pushing people away from the more progressive wing of the left.

Sincere congratulations and thanks for all the activism and campaigning you say you do, but that doesn't make you immune to unwitting and unintentional stereotyping.

I saw my neighbour drink it once, and bam, 10 years later, he died. His wife died 94 years after she first came into contact with it, I guess he might have given her some of it to drink as well. It's a silent killer!!! 😪 You should really read up on it. It will shock you if you do!!! Btw, I still don't understand why you want baby goats to die though. Sure, they may not know right from wrong yet, but neither do anti vaxxers. Atleast baby goats don't put the lives of other people at risk because they are scared of an injection.

I don't usually comment on things, but the biggest misconception(I don't know how it came to be), is that people who don't have the vaccine put other people's lives at risk. Please explain to me how this makes any sense at all? The vaccine protects the person who took the vaccine from a disease, not those around them. It has been clearly stated time and time again that the vaccine does NOT prevent you from getting the disease(but rather reduces risk of dying/severe symptoms), neither does it stop you from spreading it to others. So I ask again, how does it make sense that taking the vaccine reduces your transmissability?",3년 전,1,
