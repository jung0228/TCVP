With that said since I also get a dopamine release from playing games as it is something I enjoy I have implemented the casino effect into how I play games.

@KrishnaKantSharma1618,"As summarized by an ai: ### The Ultimate Guide to Dopamine: How to Master Motivation, Drive & Focus  Dopamine is one of the most discussed molecules in modern wellness, often misunderstood as simply the chemical of pleasure or a ""dopamine hit"" we get from rewards. The reality is far more nuanced. Dopamine is the fundamental driver of our motivation, desire, and craving—the force that propels you to pursue goals, from getting a cup of coffee to earning a degree.  Understanding how to manage your dopamine system is critical for sustaining long-term energy, focus, and satisfaction. This guide breaks down the science of dopamine and provides actionable tools to harness its power for a more motivated and fulfilling life.  #### The Core Principle: Baseline vs. Peaks  If you remember nothing else, remember this: your dopamine system operates on two levels.  1.  *Tonic (Baseline) Dopamine:* This is the steady, low-level amount of dopamine that is always circulating in your brain. It dictates your general mood, energy, and motivation on a day-to-day basis. 2.  *Phasic (Peak) Dopamine:* These are the large, rapid spikes of dopamine released in response to rewarding or exciting activities and substances.  Crucially, these two levels are interconnected. *After you experience a high peak in dopamine, your baseline level temporarily drops below its original point.* The higher the peak, the deeper the subsequent crash. This is the biological basis of the ""pleasure-pain balance."" That feeling of wanting more, or feeling a little down after a big win or an indulgent experience, is the result of your baseline dopamine falling.  Chasing constant high-dopamine peaks—whether from food, social media, drugs, or even work achievements—steadily erodes your baseline. Over time, you require more stimulation to feel pleasure, and the things that once brought you joy feel less rewarding. Addiction is the extreme form of this cycle: a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure.  #### What Really Increases Dopamine? A Comparative Look  Different activities cause different levels of dopamine increase over your baseline. Here are some measured examples:  *   *Chocolate:* 1.5x increase above baseline *   *Sex:* 2x increase *   *Exercise (if enjoyed):* 2x increase *   *Nicotine (smoked):* 2.5x increase *   *Cocaine:* 2.5x increase *   *Amphetamine:* 10x increase  It's important to note that your subjective experience matters. If you assign positive meaning to an activity, like learning to enjoy the effort of exercise, you can increase the dopamine it provides.  #### Strategies for Healthy Dopamine Management  The goal is not to eliminate dopamine peaks but to manage them intelligently to protect your baseline and sustain motivation.  *1. Stop Layering Your Dopamine Sources*  It's common to ""stack"" multiple sources of dopamine to maximize pleasure—listening to your favorite music while having a pre-workout drink before a gym session you enjoy. While effective in the short term, this practice teaches your brain that it needs all those conditions to feel motivated.  *Tool:* To maintain enjoyment in an activity, intentionally engage in it without the extra dopamine layers sometimes. For example, work out without music occasionally. This prevents your brain from becoming dependent on a specific cocktail of rewards and keeps your motivation robust.  *2. Reward the Effort, Not the Outcome*  A classic experiment showed that children who were rewarded for drawing—an activity they already enjoyed—stopped drawing once the reward was removed. When you reward yourself only for the final achievement (the grade, the finish line, the paycheck), you teach your brain that the effort itself is purely a cost. This makes the process more difficult and undermines intrinsic motivation.  *Tool:* Learn to generate dopamine from the effort itself. During a difficult task, consciously acknowledge the friction and tell yourself, ""This is hard, and I'm doing it by choice. This effort is the reward."" This is the essence of a ""growth mindset."" By finding pleasure in the struggle, you make the process itself rewarding and build a resilient, self-sustaining motivation system.  *3. Embrace Intermittent Reinforcement*  The most powerful motivator is an unpredictable reward schedule. It’s the mechanism that makes gambling and social media so addictive. You never know when the reward will come, so you keep trying.  *Tool:* Apply this to your own life. Don't always reward yourself for a given activity. For example, before a workout, flip a coin. Heads, you listen to music; tails, you don't. This randomness prevents your dopamine circuits from expecting and depending on a consistent reward, which keeps your motivation high over the long term.  *4. Use Cold Exposure for a Sustained Rise*  One of the most powerful, non-pharmacological ways to influence dopamine is through deliberate cold exposure. A study in the European Journal of Physiology found that immersing the body in cold water (e.g., 60°F / 14°C) caused a *250% increase in baseline dopamine.*  Unlike the sharp rise and fall from other stimulants, this increase was sustained, taking up to three hours to return to normal. This explains the lasting feeling of elevated mood, calm, and alertness that many people report after an ice bath or cold shower.  #### Supplements and Compounds that Influence Dopamine  While behavioral tools are paramount, certain compounds can directly affect the dopamine pathway. Use them with a clear understanding of their effects.  *For Boosting Dopamine:*  *   *L-Tyrosine:* An amino acid precursor to dopamine. Taken in doses of 500-1000 mg, it can increase focus and motivation for a short period (30-60 minutes), but may lead to a subsequent crash. Best used sparingly. *   *Macuna Pruriens:* A bean that naturally contains L-DOPA, the direct precursor to dopamine. It causes a very powerful and rapid increase in dopamine, but also a significant crash. Due to its potency, it should be approached with extreme caution. *   *Caffeine:* While its direct effect on dopamine is modest, regular caffeine intake has been shown to upregulate dopamine receptors, making your brain more sensitive to the dopamine you already have. Yerba Maté, in particular, may have neuroprotective properties for dopamine neurons.  *Compounds to Be Cautious With:*  *   *Melatonin:* Supplementing with melatonin has been shown to decrease dopamine levels. It’s best to avoid it unless treating jet lag. *   *High-Potency Stimulants (e.g., Adderall, Cocaine):* These drugs cause such massive dopamine peaks that they can be neurotoxic over time and have been shown to limit the brain's ability to learn and change (neuroplasticity).  #### The Social Side of Dopamine  Finally, don't underestimate the power of social connection. Research shows that oxytocin—the ""bonding"" hormone—directly stimulates the brain's dopamine pathways. Pursuing and engaging in healthy, meaningful relationships is a natural and essential way to keep your dopamine system active and healthy.  By understanding that dopamine is a currency to be managed, not just a pleasure to be chased, you can take control of your motivation, focus, and overall well-being. The key is to protect your baseline, find reward in effort, and use peaks strategically to fuel a life of sustained drive and satisfaction.",2개월 전,0,

@SherifatSuliemon-lw6ls,"Thank you for this life changing video.  Here are my thoughts.  1. How do you think the mind's constant pursuit of dopamine can lead to a sense of dissatisfaction or unhappiness, even when we're achieving our goals or acquiring things we think will bring us pleasure?  Because dopamine has a peak and baseline. The peak is what we experience when we just start something new, and the baseline is how we feel when the peak declines and we are so used to that thing..reason for wanting more and more, and unsatisfaction regardless of our wealth.  2. How do you think the mind's tendency to constantly seek dopamine can impact our relationships and interactions with others?  Well, yes it does impact. At the beginning of our relationship we explore new things together, giving each of us a sense of love and unity..but over time, those little things we do to boost love wears off and we are faced with the truth of who we are in our being.  3. How can we cultivate a more mindful and authentic approach to relationships, one that's less dependent on dopamine peaks and more focused on genuine connection and understanding?  Simply by accepting what is for what is, rather than seeking something differently.. all of which would be impossible to do from the mind, it is the mind that wants to grasp, understand and all, so the moment we learn to be with this thoughts without reacting to it, it becomes easy. The point is not that we won't do things with our partners, the point is that, we won't depend on this for our growth, reward for increase in love and many more.  4. How can we balance the need for mindfulness and non-attachment with the natural human desire for intimacy, connection, and shared experiences with our partner?  It's the mind that wants to understand, which it can never do. There is no balance rather, simply just learn how to be with your minds.  5. How do you think this understanding can impact our daily lives, beyond just relationships, in areas like work, creativity, and overall well-being?  Therein lies what we all seek..peace. pure being, no suffering.  (This is a summary of the video, I asked AI to ask me questions and gave answers to it, hopefully it helps someone out there)",6개월 전,1,

@godsword003,"- Your experience of life and levels of motivation and drive depends on how much dopamine you had relative to your recent experience. How much dopamine you experience from something depends on your baseline level of dopamine when you arrive there and your preivous dopamine peaks. thats why when you repeatedly do something you enjoy your threshold for enjoyment goes up and up and up - if you think or journal about aspects of a task/item that you enjoy or appreciate you can evoke dopamine from doing that task. Caution against saying things like I hate working but i love the reward i get afterward. Rewards given afterward actually make the situation worse. they wont make you like working more but actually undermine the dopamine release that would otherwise occur for that activity. - layering together multiple things, substances, activities that lead to big increases in dopamine can lead to pretty servere issues with motivation an energy with dopamine even a few days later. if you do it too often your level of motivation and drive will take a serious hit. - after a big peak in dopamine example: celebrating winning a marathon, the peak is folllow by a drop below baseline. and the drop is relative to how high the peak was. that is why when we do something over and over again that we like to do it feels less and less exciting. - theres a pleasure pain balance of dopamine spikes. the pain is felt as wanting more dopamine from it. - there is a limited amount of dopamine made in your brain. when you take something that has a massive spike in dopamine afterward your baseline drops because there isnt any dopamine left to keep your brain going.  59:50 then when you take it again to get the spike again your baseline keeps lowering and lowering. this is addiction. - to replenish the dopaminerigic pool in your brain avoid activites that evoke dopamine to bring your brain back to baseline - intermitten scheduling of dopamine is the key - try not to celebrate a win too hard unless you are willing to experience the drop in dopamine after - dont layer in sources of dopamine before doing a task. - if you want to maintian motivation for school, exercise, or pursuits of duration of any kind the key thing is to make sure the peak of dopamine if it is very high doesnt occurr too often and if something does occur often you vary how much dopamine you experience each time. - randomize dopamine so that it is intermittent before you do a task. a tool to do this is to flip a coin. - chronically spiking your dopamine to increase motivation will eventually work against you and decrease your motivation and drive - cold water can increase dopamine 2.5x above baseline but does not create a crash after. it rather tapers slowly back to baseline - working hard for sake of a reward that comes afterward can make hardwork much more challenging and make us less likely to lean into hard work.  1:39:00 - if you only get dopamine from rewards at the end of something because of the way dopamine relates to time it will make the task feel harder and longer - if you get a peak in dopamine from a reward its going to lower your baseline and the cognitive interpretation is you didnt really do the activity because you enjoyed it you did it for the reward - dont layer in sources of dopamine to start a task. instead subjectively attatch the feeling of friction and effort to an internally generated rewards system. because the mesolimbic reward system has pieces in the forebrain you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part. repeat this over and over again - in the moments of most friction you tell yourself “this is very painful and because it is very painful it will invoke dopamine later, but in this moment I am doing it by choice and because I love doing it” even if your lying to yourself in context of a truth which you want it to feel pleasureful. - things that can prevent getting dopamine from effort  are spiking dopamine prior to or after engagement in effort. so dont do this. - because of dopamines connection to the forebrain telling yourself something is good for you, will actually reinforce this at a chemical level - you dont want dopmaine too high or too low its all about staying in a dynamic range - dopamine establishes value not just based on the current moment but what you experience in days and years before - l-tyrosine, PEA, and Huperzine, Alpha GPC - Non perscription dopamine spikers - your previous levels of dopamine are influencing your dopamine right now and your current levels and where you take them next will influence your dopamine levels in days and weeks to come",7개월 전,0,

@duncandrake1676,"*Top Ten Take home points:*  1. Dopamine has two pathways from which it’s released. One deals with motivation and the other with movement. It can be released in small bits through neuron to neuron communication or in bulk (volumetric)  2. Doing anything that invokes a dopamine response will inevitably cause a decrease in dopamine BELOW baseline. How big that fall is has everything to do with how big the high was. The purpose of this fall is to get us to seek that behavior AGAIN which was very evolutionarily advantageous in caveman days  3. Dopamine is dynamic. How you perceive things in the present is greatly affected by your actions in the past and how you act in the present will determine how you feel in the future  4. Overtime, constant dopamine highs will deplete the readily available reserves of dopamine. If you “spend” all your dopamine on something that “costs” a lot like porn, you’ll only have so much left to “spend” on other activities like studying. All dopamine is released from the same pool the same way the dollar pays for milk and napkins. Constant highs will cause a slow, but steady decrease in dopamine baseline until eventually it affects day to day life  5. Dopamine is as awesome as it is scary. Ideally, we’d never spike dopamine for any reason to maintain a high baseline, but that would be a boring as fuck life. To leverage dopamine, you should do things you like on an intermittent reward schedule. The goal is to get the awesome dopamine high for pleasure and motivation on an inconsistent basis to stop baseline levels from decreasing. Basically, to keep doing the things you want to enjoy for a long time to come, you have to have some awesome days and some okay days. It may hurt your progress in the short term, but it will greatly benefit it in the long run  6. Seeking solely the reward from an activity is actually sabotaging your progress. When your brain SHOULD be learning to associate dopamine release with the difficult activity, the reward steals the thunder and the dopamine release for that whole process is skewed toward the reward. This makes doing the activity itself MORE difficult over time despite getting the reward  7. To enjoy difficult activities, you have to activate your inner Goggins and learn to LOVE exerting effort. Lean INTO the friction and tell yourself “I love this” even when it gets hard. Eventually, you really will start to love it and then you can take that mindset learned from one activity, like diet or exercise or studying, and apply it to EVERY aspect of your life.  8. Avoid “stacking” multiple sources of dopamine. This will create a greater high and thus a higher barrier of entry and inevitable fall. To learn to love the activity for the effort you have to put in and NOT the reward, don’t spike dopamine before or after the activity. Basically, make that shit the most interesting thing you do for that block of time  9. While dopamine has many primitive elements, it’s still highly subjective. How we perceive things and whether we think things are “good” or “bad” can alter how much dopamine we get from them. This means that we aren’t chained by our drives and have the power to take control of our dopamine  10. There are many substances and compounds that directly (and indirectly) alter levels of dopamine. Generally-unless for medical reasons-these should be used strategically and sparingly. Perhaps one of the most notable drugs, caffeine, actually increases dopamine receptor upregulation. It doesn’t add more fuel to the car, it’s more like putting it in sports mode",8개월 전,0,

@Gollybone,"Dear Andrew,  Thank you for your insight and discussions on dopamine and biology. If you find the time, I'd appreciate your educated opinion on a related topic, as you appear to be familiar with matters of medically-induced blunting of emotion and diminishing of libido.  Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) and other cognitive impact sustained years following discontinuation of prescribed antidepressants has been found highly disruptive to the experience of dopamine, leaving one feeling emotionally flat during highs and lows, sexual desire completely diminished, sexual arousal difficult to achieve, and sexual sensation almost completely reduced; passion for life, thusly, minimal.   There are increasing reports of those treated with SSRIs experiencing such persistent disconnection, from taking as little as one pill. The pharmaceutical industry is, characteristically, skirting responsibility, but the harm to wellbeing remains, as life unable to engage with feeling and satisfaction can be a distressing and helplessly miserable experience.  Would you consider this a reversible process, and how would you approach restoring pharmaceutically disrupted pathways to the reward centre?  If you see this, I'd be grateful for your insight.",10개월 전(수정됨),0,

I've done an enormous amount of research for someone not in the field, but who suffers from that. Dopamine antagonist meds are used to counter a macroprolactinoma's effects and reduce the many problems associated with it.  But there are certainly many different problems that affect the brain, motivation, sex drive, etc. and they do not always go away even after a diagnosis and treatment.

@loribell6453,"Per Huberman Lab protocols, I have made cold showers a frequent part of my morning routine. This morning in particular I had a breakthrough as I had the very cold water beating down on my shoulders. I asked myself: What if I SMILE while I'm experiencing this discomfort in order to signal to my body that this is an ""enjoyable experience""? Will that increase my dopamine response? Though I was probably grimacing more at first, as the shower progressed my smile became more relaxed and natural. I really wish I could have tested my blood afterwards to see what my dopamine levels were, but from how I currently feel as I type this, a couple hours later, I would say I'm feeling ""happier"" than I normally do after a cold shower. Now I wonder two things: 1) Is there any research into how ""smiling through the pain"" can change one's dopamine response, and 2) Is the reverse true? For instance, if I intentionally frown when I'm consuming a piece of candy, will it reduce my dopamine response and assist with my resisting the candy the next time I reach for it?🤔",11개월 전,0,

@hiteshreesharma2822,"### Summary Dopamine drives motivation, pleasure, and well-being; understanding its mechanisms helps optimize focus and satisfaction while avoiding addiction.  ### Highlights - 🧠 Dopamine is crucial for motivation and pleasure. - 📉 High dopamine peaks can lead to a lower baseline afterward. - ❄ Cold water exposure can significantly boost dopamine levels. - 🍫 Certain foods and activities can raise dopamine but may lead to addiction. - 📱 Excessive digital engagement can decrease overall dopamine satisfaction. - 🎯 Intermittent rewards are better for maintaining motivation. - 📚 Understanding dopamine can improve mental well-being and focus.  ### Key Insights - 🧬 **Dopamine's Role**: Dopamine is not just about pleasure; it regulates motivation and craving, influencing how we pursue goals and experiences. Its presence affects our drive to engage in activities.  - 📉 **Peaks and Baselines**: After a peak in dopamine (from rewarding activities), the baseline level drops, potentially leading to feelings of dissatisfaction or lack of motivation. This cycle highlights the importance of managing dopamine levels for sustained well-being.  - ❄ **Cold Water Therapy**: Exposure to cold water has been shown to increase dopamine significantly, enhancing mood and focus for extended periods. This method serves as a natural way to boost motivation without reliance on substances. - 🍔 **Food and Dopamine**: While certain foods elevate dopamine levels, frequent indulgence can lead to decreased pleasure from those foods over time, demonstrating the risks of habitual dopamine spikes. - 📱 **Digital Distraction**: Overuse of smartphones and social media can diminish our ability to derive satisfaction from real-life experiences, leading to lower baseline dopamine levels and potential feelings of emptiness. - 🎲 **Intermittent Rewards**: Engaging in activities with unpredictable rewards can maintain higher motivation levels compared to consistent rewards, as this unpredictability keeps the brain engaged and responsive. - 👩‍⚕ **Mental Health Awareness**: Understanding the mechanisms of dopamine can aid in recognizing patterns of behavior that lead to decreased motivation or mental health issues, emphasizing the need for balance in dopamine-inducing activities.",11개월 전,0,

Intermittant Reinforcement Schedule for Dopamine. 4. Removing multiple sources of dopamine release from activity you want to enjoy or focus. 5. Cold Water therapy increases dopamine 2.5 times above baseline. 6. This is very painful & because it's painful it will evoke an increase in dopamine later, it will increase my baseline in dopamine. 7. Don't spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort, and don't spike dopamine after engaging in effort, learn to spike dopamine from the effort itself. 8. Hearing something that reinforces Or validates someones prior belief can release dopamine, Dopamine pathway is vulnerable to subjective interpretation. 9.

@scientificbhaiya9336,"How to manage the society while you’re working on yourself ? Because we tend to cut out from others while we are deep into ourselves figuring out how to make things better and in that way we usually start behaving weirdly sometimes, over judging our own actions and sometimes our actions reflect back to us in a negative way, and then we start to feel average again and it’s like our energy drains out giving us demotivation.  Society, the environment around us, social media has so much influence on our life’s .  How can we manage it while still progressing in our lives ?

I train boxing, running, body weight exercises, swimming, every day… I DO cold shower every morning. I DO drink good coffee a couple of times a day. I DO drink Yerba mate.   So my question, my main dopamine release comes from sex, exercise and cold exposure. Now I’m questioning if my baseline is dropping because of my routine? I’ve been sustaining this for 20 years although I drank alcohol for most of it. Should my baseline be stable or should I be reducing those bundles, for example, train without music from time to time..?

Thing is, once he does go out (usually under pressure from friends or family), he has a good time, but motivating him to go anywhere is very difficult. I suspect he might have the inattentive form of ADHD as well which compounds matters. He has never touched drugs in his life but he acts like a chronic stoner. He has no other interests.

Wasn’t long before my low sad mood changed( not depression that’s different)I became interested in my efforts. Forcing positivity doesn’t always work but accepting the blue mood is nothing if you let it be, just that. PS also felt clear headed and calm. Maybe I’m addicted to distractions.

Always chasing girls night clubing. Worked 60hrs to 70hrs a week and studied at  Night school. Worked out all the time etc, And very happy. Anyways after those events I never really recovered. I can go bungy jumping or skydiving or ride a roller coaster. I just don't get excited everyone around me I'd laughing and enjoying the moment.  I just don't. I can't feel the experience. It kinda makes me push some things to the limit cause I don't have the same fear. Thinks I was scared of before kept me in a straight line. I used to race a GTR Skyline. I was never afraid or excited. But I'd push things to the limit just trying to get some buzz. It was nothing for me to drive a car on two wheels down the street.

@sfwssdd,"I am 48 in August. I often hear people say it sucks getting old, but maybe I just have not experienced that. When they mention the affliction being experienced and relate it to age, I remember having similar instances when I was younger. There are also younger people that have bad backs, knees, wrists, etc., ergo I do not think that can be age alone. I know we can not take care of ourselves and/or experience extreme conditions - boxing or a car wreck for example - and have lasting affects. Placebo is also very real. Our minds are amazing, and through them we create our life scenario. We can heal ourself or begin the process of cellular decay. Things will always happen, the good the bad and the ugly, we cannot change that, though we can help influence it by our decisions haha..  What we can change is how we deal with the things that happen, perspective  and perception are key. Some people get bitter, some choose to get better. Is the glass half empty or is it half full.. or is it the perfect two fingers of whiskey *winks. Life is a grand adventure! Every adventure is full of hardships, it is inherent. Who wants to read or watch a hero that has a cake life. If you love steak and eat it every day, does the love grow or diminish - such is it for our endurance of hardships. There is so many amazing questions, so many things to learn about. I can't get enough. I have taught myself guitar, crochet, sewing (women and men in the past that had these skills were math geniuses), replaced a cv joint on my vehicle myself, discovered undocumented behavior in wolf spiders, fish for big catfish from spillways and pull them up myself with a drop net... and so much more. I think what people are missing is happiness which does not come from outside of ones self. New jobs, moving to new places, new friends, new cars and toys ... are band-aids and short lived. We have families and it is easy to give ourselves away.. to our jobs, to our children, spouses, brothers and sisters - leaving us exhausted and ready to veg to lame theatrical bs on a flickering box, or scroll through 90% crap content for 10% we might like .. .might being the operative word. Tis time to feed your soul .... nosce te ipsum. Have several hobbies that you do by yourself and occasionally with others - I fish, play with my see damn far machine (telescope), read, research, game, play guitar, sew things from my imagination ..... only boring people get bored. If you have several things to fuel your fire, then you never run out no matter how much your job or other drama in your life try to take from you. It could also be because I never grew out of the ""but whyyy"" stage and am excited to have knowledge at my fingertips verses only an encyclopedia ha!  Think about what you respect in others - become it, think about what you always thought about doing - do it. This short little stent we have here, we the universe getting to know ourself, is over and done all too quickly. Make the most of it while you have it - live hard, love fully, and laugh at it all because it is all smoke and mirrors. ;)",1년 전,1,

@adoheath9313,"Very well structured video, I’ve watched plenty of videos regarding dopamine. And this was very helpful on understanding how it works and the best way to put it, there’s been a war on our attention spans way before most of us were born and I just find it interesting how we’re living in a time where it’s very prominent, everything is loud nowadays and we barely have any room for no distractions, im 20 now and I remember 2020 was when I really started feeling the affects of being over stimulated by social media, food etc. and I really didn’t understand it at the time of what was happening to my brain and my shortening attention span. It felt like I was in the sicken place and couldn’t see my surroundings properly or even concentrate. I find myself having a hard time doing the things I need to do to be successful in life and i really think this video and how he worded everything helped me understand what I need to do. I also find myself addicted to masturbation that’s been a struggle for almost 8 years of my life now that I find the root of my disability to put in the work i really need to do in my life to become something more. I’m so thankful I stumbled across the video doing research on how to achieve better motivation and disciple as well live in the present more.

@nicoleholmes6485,At around 50 minutes into the video I have a question what’s the difference between a dopamine release for something you think about that you love and makes you happy just thinking about it and either something you have like an inadament object or something your going to have or do as in being in a car on the way to six flags amusement park and also being either a kid (female) before hormones blast in you to a teenager who has more of a childlike being and then a young adult who still is childlike and not a disorder but just who you are and just thinking about where your going your not there yet but the thought of it makes the huge increase of dopamine and then get there and that dopamine is increased ten fold what’s the difference between the thought of it and not even on the way but deciding to go also being able to and not trying to make the plan but the initial decision and that dopamine pop then bring on the way the excitement and the level heightened and getting there and it’s at the highest the dopamine can be for you who amusement parks are one of your favorite things and when you leave your not just sad your devestated esp since it’s seasonal either way what’s the difference between an object or place in comparison to a food,1년 전,0,

@Snekrz.14,"00:00:00 - 01:00:00 This podcast discusses the science behind dopamine and how it can be used to improve motivation, focus, and satisfaction. Dr. Andrew Huberman dispels common myths about the molecule and shares tips on how to leverage it for sustained energy and motivation.  01:00:00 - 02:00:00 The dopamine system is responsible for motivation, focus, and satisfaction. However, when people pursue activities that lead to huge increases in dopamine, the dopamine baseline drops afterwards, leading to addiction and depression. It is important to understand the relationship between the peaks and baseline of the dopamine system in order to make good choices that will maintain a healthy dopamine level.  02:00:00 - 02:15:00 In this podcast, Dr. Huberman discusses how dopamine affects motivation, focus, and satisfaction. He also discusses the importance of using high-quality supplements to adjust dopamine levels. Finally, he provides links to his lab's website and social media accounts.",1년 전,0,
@Firopense,"COPIED FROM ANOTHER USER SIMPLY TO KEEP PINNED FOR MYSELF  Practical summary:   1. Dopamine management - Abstain from or limit highly desirable activities for up to a month so the dopamine levels are replenished and the baseline dopamine release returns to normal 	- Peaks of dopamine decrease our baseline dopamine, required to general motivation and satisfaction with life. - Go for intermittent, random releases of dopamine 	- Don't bundle pleasurable activities with things you want to do (gym and music) 	- Flip a coin and choose how much pleasure bundling you'll do to the next activity 	- Otherwise the activity alone becomes less pleasurable  2. Direct practices - Cold water exposure - 2.5x increase and sustained for hours afterwards - Peaks 	- Chocolate - 1.5x 	- Sex - 2x (act and pursuit of it) 	- Nicotine - 2.5x 	- Cocaine - 2.5x 	- Amphetamine - 10x 	- Exercise - 2x (up to 2x, the more you enjoy it subjectively) - Coffee combined with another activity (coffee makes the dopamine release more effective) - Connection with other people  3. Mental strategies - Subjectivity, perception and belief 	- Hearing something that validates our belief about an activity, makes it more pleasurable 	- Journaling, thinking positively about something you remember or you're experiencing now releases dopamine - Learn to spike dopamine from effort 	- Don't spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort 	- Don't spike dopamine after engaging in effort 	- Learn to spike dopamine from effort itself.",1년 전,0,

@chattanoah,"Do a social media/dopamine fast per Dr. Huberman's recommendation, then reevaluate. If you want to try getting off the addies then discuss/research a tapering plan with the prescribing physician. Your body may be ""used"" to Adderall but you will still experience benefits from resetting; so you don't necessarily need to stop taking it right now. Take time during this experience to think about areas in your life that may benefit from more structure. You might consider watching some videos on habits/techniques that benefit people with ADHD. It's misdiagnosed often but I would venture to say it's more likely that your doctor got it right than wrong.   That's a moot point though, as your main goal in this shouldn't be to validate a diagnosis, but rather to better your life and well-being. You will eventually gain clarity on your diagnosis, and whether it was,  or wasn't, accurate all this time, you will have developed structure and better living habits that ALL individuals need, and it sounds like you are lacking that right now. It's easier than you think though! This channel, howtoADHD, and Joshua Becker have all been very helpful YouTube channel in my journey.  I've been working on all of these things for the past few years as we realize I may have had ADHD my whole life but was never diagnosed. So now being almost 30 you can imagine the perspective and habit changes I've had to implement. But it's a very rewarding and healing process and I know you'll be glad you did.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@Helloworld77521,"- Dopamine is a Neuromdulator - Dopamine is resposible for Motivation, Drive, Craving, Time Perception - Dopamine has two major circuits: 1) MesoCorticoLimbic Pathway affecting motivation, drive and craving and this the part which get disrupted in addictions. 2) NigroStriatal Pathways affecting movement. - Dopamine has two ways of work: 1) Local 2) Volumetric - Dopamine is secreted in two ways: 1) Tonic. 2) Phasic. - Dopamine works by a slow process using the GPCRs. - After a peak of Dopamine, Dopamine baseline DROPS and the drop is related to the peak because of Dopamine deplation ex: postpartum depression. - Dopamine is co-released with Glutamate which is an excitatory neurotransmitter. - Dopamine stimulated the Sympathetic system. - How much Dopamine you experience from something depends on the basleline level of Dopamine then and on the previous Dopamine peaks that's why when you are repeatdly engaged in an event that is enjoyable to you, you threshold for enjoyment goes up and up. - some things affecting Dopamine: 1) Chocolate: increases baseline 1.5 2)  Sex (pursue and action): doubles the baseline 3) Nicotine: increases Dopamine 2.5 times above the baseline and it is very short-lived. 4) Cocaine: 2.5 times 5) Amphetamine: 10 times 6) Exercise: 2 times if you like it and minimal or no increase according to your love of exercising. 7) Cold Shower: 2.5 times (slowly increasing taking around 3hr to reach the baseline without crashing).  8) Caffiene: up regulates Dopamine receptors. - Addiction is progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. - A lot of ADHD are misdiagnosed because of the depletion of Dopamine that happens after engaging in actions increasing it. - Intermittent scheudle of releasing Dopamine is the key used by casinos, elusive partners and social media. - Don't allow yourself experiencing the huge peak of Dopamine unless you want to crash and wait until it becomes normal. - Remove multiple sources of Dopamine release from activities you want to enjoy. - ""The Growth Mindset"": learning to access the rewards from effort and doing and overtime you can evoke a Dopamine release from this friction. - Dopamine marks time, so when you put a prize after finishing a certain job, you in fact make the job more difficult and you make it harder for you to do that job again as you will need a bigger prize. - In the moments of most friction tell yourself: "" This very painful and because it is painful, it will evoke an increase in Dopamine later, increasing my Dopamine baseline, and I am doing this by choice and I am doing it because I am loving it. - Do not spike Dopamine before doing an effort. - Do not spike Dopamine after doing an effort. - Learn to spike Dopamine from effort itself. - Our perception of Dopamine is hightened when the Dopamine receptors have not seen much Dopamine lately. - Viewing bright lights between 10pm : 4 am reduces Dopamine levels for several days. - Serotonin can be increased by social interactions increasing Dopamine.",1년 전,0,

This happens since the voltage source is current limited (dopamine production / rate of restore is limited).",1년 전,1,

@yanyuisam,"The Role of Dopamine Dopamine acts as the universal currency for exploration and pursuit, driving all mammal species, including early humans, to seek resources essential for survival and reproduction. The subjective experience of dopamine levels can significantly affect motivation:  When your dopamine level drop,you may not neccessarily feel depressed.However,  (Too)Low dopamine levels lead to a lack of motivation.  High levels result in heightened motivation.  Moderate levels can vary in effect depending on recent dopamine fluctuations.  Dopamine Mechanisms Neural Pathways of Dopamine: There are two primary dopamine pathways:  The mesocorticolimbic pathway, associated with reward and motivation.  The nigrostriatal pathway, linked to motor control.  Dopamine signals through G-protein coupled receptors, a slower method of transmission compared to the fast ionotropic transmission used by other neurotransmitters.  Dopamine Peaks and Baselines: Dopamine usually maintains a baseline level, but pursuing experiences that induce high dopamine peaks can lower this baseline over time. After peaks, dopamine levels might drop below the baseline temporarily, influencing one’s mood. Frequent peaks can disrupt this balance, underscoring the importance of optimizing the ratio between peaks and baselines for sustained satisfaction and drive.  Reward Prediction Error and Dopamine:  Reward prediction error is closely associated with dopamine, a key neurotransmitter involved in predicting and responding to rewards. This concept is crucial for understanding why certain behaviors become habitual or addictive. Reward prediction error occurs when there is a difference between expected and actual rewards, influencing dopamine release. This mechanism plays a vital role in learning and decision-making processes:  If a reward is expected and received as anticipated, dopamine reinforces the behavior, making it more likely to occur again.  If an unexpected reward is received, the increase in dopamine is even greater, which significantly reinforces the behavior.  Conversely, if an expected reward is not received, dopamine levels drop, which can demotivate the behavior in the future.    Practical Application Dopamine and Effort: Activities that increase dopamine levels can vary significantly:  Eating chocolate increases dopamine by 1.5 times but is short-lived.  Smoking and nicotine can double dopamine levels, though temporarily.  Exercise, hard work, and learning can increase dopamine uniquely, depending on the individual.  Repeated engagement in pleasurable activities can raise the pleasure threshold and lower baseline dopamine levels, akin to addiction. This understanding is crucial for effective dopamine management.  Methods to Boost Dopamine Levels Cold Water Exposure: This is a natural,harmless method to boost your dopamine level.Exposure to cold water (around 15°C) can significantly and sustainably increase dopamine levels, enhancing well-being and mental clarity.  Reducing High-Dopamine Activities: Temporarily abstaining or limiting highly rewarding activities can help restore normal dopamine baseline levels.  Intermittent Fasting: A healthy approach that has been practiced by different cultures,literatures for hundreds of years. This deprivation can strengthen dopamine pathways, enhancing dopamine perception. The specific intervals can vary; some may fast for 12 hours, while Huberman tends to simply skip a meal.  Reducing Light Exposure Before Bed: According to Dr. Samer Hattar's research, exposure to light from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. can reduce dopamine secretion in the following days.  Social Interaction: A 2017 study in the Journal of Science demonstrated that intimate relationships—romantic, parental, or friendships—can stimulate the release of oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area, an important dopamine pathway, even without physical contact  Embrace the Process, Not the Reward：In terms of practical application, the key is to focus on engaging in activities without the explicit expectation of rewards. Frequent cold water exposure, for example, can be beneficial, especially if conducted early in the day, but the novelty and impact on dopamine release might decrease over time as you become adapted. Such activities should be approached with a mindset of embracing the process itself, allowing any unexpected rewards to naturally enhance the motivation.  This approach helps in maintaining a healthy dopamine system by encouraging activities that are rewarding in themselves without the need for external validation. Unexpected rewards, when they occur, will provide a stronger and more meaningful boost to dopamine, reinforcing the behavior in a more sustainable manner.  By focusing on the activity itself and minimizing the emphasis on rewards, we encourage a stronger, intrinsic motivation and a more resilient approach to discipline and hard work. This methodology fosters a better relationship with our activities and our dopamine system, tuning it for long-term satisfaction and success.      Conclusion Understanding dopamine's roles and mechanisms allows for better management of our behaviors and emotions, aiming for a healthier, more satisfied life. By moderating dopamine activities and focusing on natural ways to maintain dopamine levels, individuals can achieve long-term benefits in motivation, focus, and satisfaction.",1년 전,0,

@augdog6152,"Here looking for some info if anyone can help me. I’m wondering about changes in brain chemistry as it relates to your dopamine system, drug use like cannabis, and anxiety. I smoked cannabis for 10 years of my life. Starting at 17, every day, quite literally. I had a few unpleasant experiences while stoned, but always because I took too high of a dose, or was in the wrong setting. A few years ago I had a flare up of acute anxiety and panic attacks. Despite years of stress relief and anti-anxiety benefits from cannabis, it now seemed to amplify my  anxiety response, resulting in more frequent panic attacks. I limited my cannabis consumption and replaced most of that use with CBD cannabis, which still likely contained some THC but in low amounts. My general anxiety seemed to subside for the most part, and after awhile I started using cannabis again regularly, daily, and in increasingly stronger doses. After about a year my anxiety was at an all time high. This was mid-Covid, barely leaving the house, I was using a lot of high THC cannabis, despite having extreme anxiety. This anxious response somewhat subsided and emerged over the next few years. Fast forward to the summer of 2023 and I decided to stop using cannabis completely and I feel 90% less anxious and paranoid in general. I do struggle with these things while completely sober, but it’s no mystery that cannabis has had a large effect on these symptoms. I’ve been wondering lately how my dopamine system and/or brain chemistry changed so dramatically that my experience with cannabis was polar opposite from what it had been for years of my life. I can’t find much info on this specific topic but I’d like to learn more about it. I figured a Huberman  video would be a decent place to get some info",1년 전,0,

@masia6255,"You should be careful about normalizing fasting and not eating. I get that for some people it might be fun but let's not normalize it. Some people can get eating disorders while doing that. In fact human should eat rather small portions but frequently instead of eating rarely and not eating at all. Hunger is an indicator of a basic need not being satisfied. Some people start feel very bad, unhappy, angry and unproductive when they are hungry even if it's a 30 minutes or 1 hour delay - it's just a sign that we feel our body well. I was eating two times a day for a certain period of time and i got chronical gastritis - and now you normalize that without taking care of potential consequences. Regarding the fasting rituals in some cultures, it's also better to study that better because not all of them have good consequences.

Also how you describe stimulation of the anterior singulate cortex as feeling a storm coming but wanting to go through it is like Peter being called to walk on water in the storm on the boat! How you speak about deliberately going into pain to bring about reward bc body will see saw pain with pleasure is about dying to flesh and being resurrected - anyways thought this was all super fascinating! Thanks so much for all your research - I’ve had huge breakthroughs in my life because of what you’ve brought to light - TY!",1년 전,0,

@RandomLA123,that explains why Vyvanse gave me euphoria the first day and on my 7th day i barely feel it does anything whatsoever. it's only logical to conclude from the video (even when Andrew will not say it to avoid going to war with psychiatrists) that ADHD medications taken daily is a horrible approach to long term motivation and drive. also im worried about the irreversible dopaminergic neuron death. makes me wonder if I've damaged those by ingesting alcohol in my teen years. it's such a scary thought to think that just growing up around tv's and videogames could permanently damage you for life. might be the sole reason the Amish kick everyone's ass in happiness.,1년 전,1,

@ttvvonify1844,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  10:01 🧠 Dopamine is not just responsible for pleasure; it plays a crucial role in motivation, drive, and craving, influencing mood and willingness to pursue goals. 13:20 ⚙️ Dopamine, a neuromodulator, coordinates neural circuits, impacting energy levels, mindset, and the perception of time. 16:40 💔 Two main dopamine pathways: Mesocorticolimbic for motivation and craving, and nigrostriatal for movement. Both pathways play distinct roles in brain function. 18:36 🔄 Dopamine release can be local or broad, influencing synaptic communication between neurons. Understanding synapses is crucial to grasping dopamine's impact. 19:35 🧠 Dopamine has local and volumetric release, influencing neural circuits at both local and broad scales. 20:31 ⚖️ Increasing dopamine levels through drugs or supplements can impact sustained release, affecting the peak-to-baseline ratio. 21:27 🎢 Merely increasing dopamine levels may lead to short-lived motivation; optimizing peak-to-baseline ratio is crucial for sustained pleasure. 22:26 🕰️ Dopamine works through G protein-coupled receptors, resulting in slower effects, influencing neural communication and even gene expression. 25:21 🌐 Dopamine co-releases glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, stimulating neurons and enhancing alertness. 26:17 💼 Dopamine is a universal currency in mammals, driving motivation, desire, and the pursuit of external goals. 28:17 🔄 Dopamine's impact on pleasure and motivation depends on the baseline level, recent experiences, and previous dopamine peaks. 29:16 📉 Repeated engagement in enjoyable activities increases the threshold for enjoyment, requiring more dopamine for the same pleasure. 30:41 💊 Anecdotes illustrate the profound impact of extremely low dopamine levels, emphasizing its role in movement, mood, and motivation. 37:32 🧬 Baseline dopamine levels vary among individuals, influenced by genetics and close connections with other neurotransmitters like epinephrine. 40:29 🍫 Chocolate increases dopamine by 1.5 times above baseline but is transient. 42:02 🍆 Sex, both pursuit and act, doubles dopamine levels above baseline. 43:06 🚬 Nicotine from smoking increases dopamine 2.5 times above baseline, short-lived. 43:38 🏋️ Exercise impact on dopamine varies with subjective enjoyment, ranging from no increase to doubling. 45:31 📚 Journaling or practicing appreciation for activities can increase dopamine release. 46:59 ☕ Caffeine increases dopamine modestly, but regular ingestion enhances dopamine receptors' upregulation. 49:24 ⚖️ Layering multiple substances or activities for dopamine peaks can lead to severe motivation and energy issues. 51:49 🔄 Dopamine system evolved for seeking resources; baseline and peaks relate to foraging behavior. 54:46 📉 After any dopamine peak, baseline drops below pre-activity levels, explaining postpartum mood drops. 56:16 🎢 Constantly pursuing behaviors for dopamine peaks can lead to a diminished sense of joy, akin to addiction. 57:11 📖 ""Dopamine Nation"" and ""Molecule of More"" discuss pleasure-pain balance and dopamine schedules for maintaining motivation. 01:01:15 🚫 Overindulgence in activities that evoke dopamine can lead to a progressive narrowing of sources of pleasure, impacting various aspects of life. 01:02:13 🔄 Balancing work, exercise, and social activities is important, but excessive dopamine spikes from various sources can lead to a drop in baseline, causing burnout. 01:03:11 📉 Frequent and intense dopamine spikes, even from seemingly balanced activities, may contribute to a gradual decline in baseline dopamine levels. 01:04:07 🔄 Understanding the relationship between dopamine peaks and baseline is crucial for making informed choices to maintain a healthy dopamine level in the long run. 01:05:36 🔄 Experiencing a drop in dopamine baseline due to addictive behaviors requires limiting interactions with those behaviors to allow the dopamine system to replenish itself. 01:08:29 🍫 Engaging in dopamine-evoking activities like eating, exercising, and socializing can be beneficial if done with intermittent release, avoiding constant high levels. 01:09:31 🔄 Adopting intermittent reward schedules, similar to those used by casinos, can help maintain motivation and pleasure in various activities over time. 01:11:32 🚫 Layering multiple dopamine-releasing elements in activities, like music during workouts, may increase conditions required for pleasure, potentially leading to reduced motivation. 01:15:28 📱 Continuous engagement with smartphones during activities can lead to a constant layering of dopamine, potentially contributing to disruptions in baseline dopamine levels and reduced motivation. 01:21:30 🚫 Stimulants before pleasurable activities may undermine long-term motivation and drive. 01:22:29 ☕ Caffeine, especially from yerba mate, can enhance dopamine receptors and show potential neuroprotective effects for dopaminergic neurons. 01:25:32 ⚠️ Caffeine can increase the toxicity of MDMA (ecstasy) receptors, indicating potential dangers in certain contexts. 01:26:27 🧠 Amphetamine and cocaine may limit neuroplasticity, hindering the brain's ability to learn and adapt. 01:28:25 🚨 Caution against regular spiking of dopamine, as seen with ADHD drugs, to avoid potential negative effects on neuroplasticity. 01:29:25 ❄️ Cold exposure, like cold water immersion, can stimulate dopamine release, potentially raising baseline levels for improved focus and calmness. 01:33:19 🚿 Regular cold water exposure may provide sustained increases in dopamine without the need for pharmacology. 01:38:27 🏆 Rewards for hard work, especially extrinsic rewards, can reduce intrinsic enjoyment of the activity, affecting long-term motivation. 01:42:23 🧠 Cultivating a growth mindset involves associating effort and challenge with pleasure, leading to dopamine release. 01:43:20 🚫 Focusing only on end goals undermines the process, making activities less enjoyable and efficient. 01:44:17 🔄 Attach pleasure to effort itself, not external rewards, to build a reflexive enjoyment of challenging tasks. 01:45:40 📚 In moments of intense friction, acknowledge the pain but choose to engage in the activity by emphasizing love for it. 01:46:38 🏃‍♂️ Emphasizes turning effort into the reward, referencing examples like David Goggins, recognizing the historical value of effort. 01:47:35 🚫 Avoid spiking dopamine before and after effort; learn to derive dopamine directly from the effort itself. 01:50:53 🧘‍♂️ Fasting not only enhances the rewarding properties of food but also creates dopamine release from deprivation and effort. 01:51:51 🧠 Knowledge and beliefs can reinforce dopamine release, shaping behavior and making fasting more rewarding. 01:55:13 🍔 Dopamine is a universal currency, influencing the perception of pleasure and making highly palatable foods less appealing. 01:56:40 🎞️ Intense and frequent pornography consumption can negatively impact real-world romantic interactions due to dopamine dysregulation. 01:57:38 💊 Medications like Wellbutrin, which increase dopamine, can be helpful for depression but may have side effects. 02:00:36 🌿 Supplements like Macuna Pruriens and L-tyrosine can increase dopamine levels, but users may experience crashes in dopamine after usage. 02:02:31 ⚖️ The balance of dopamine levels is crucial, and supplements like L-tyrosine can stimulate dopamine production within 30-45 minutes after ingestion. 02:03:02 🧠 L-tyrosine ingestion increases dopamine in the blood and brain, with effects lasting about 30 minutes, showing specificity compared to tryptophan which increases serotonin. 02:04:01 ⚠️ If you aim to increase dopamine without prescription drugs, substances like Macuna Pruriens and L-tyrosine may help, but not suitable for individuals with certain conditions. Expect elevated states followed by crashes. 02:05:01 🚫 Be cautious with melatonin as it may reduce baseline dopamine levels. Bright lights between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. can also decrease dopamine for several days. 02:07:29 🍫 Phenethylamine (PEA) found in chocolate increases synaptic dopamine levels. Taking PEA, along with Alpha-GPC, leads to a transient dopamine increase for about 30-45 minutes. 02:08:55 🌿 Huperzine A, a nootropic, increases dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus by interacting with the cholinergic system, potentially gaining popularity as a dopamine-boosting compound. 02:11:18 💑 Oxytocin from social connections, even without skin contact, triggers dopamine release, emphasizing the importance of engaging in and pursuing quality, healthy social interactions. 02:13:45 🌐 Various factors like Maca root and the gut microbiome can indirectly influence dopamine. Cold water exposure induces sustained dopamine increases. Understanding these mechanisms empowers you to modulate and control your dopamine levels.  Made with HARPA AI",1년 전,1,

The Chinese principle of TAO, balance , is key here. But more importantly, I love this concept of being mindful of your smaller, more frequent dopamine indulgences.

@sagarpatel265,"Summary of this podcast :)  The podcast is about dopamine and how it drives our motivation, focus, and satisfaction. The speaker, Andrew Huberman, is a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford University.  Huberman begins by dispelling common myths about dopamine, such as the idea that it is only released in response to pleasure or reward. He explains that dopamine is actually a much more complex molecule that plays a role in many different brain functions, including motivation, learning, and memory.  One of the most important things to understand about dopamine is that it is not a static level in the brain. Our dopamine levels can fluctuate throughout the day and night, and they can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as our diet, exercise, sleep, and stress levels.  Huberman also discusses the concept of dopamine schedules, which refers to the way that our brains anticipate and respond to rewards. When we expect a reward, our dopamine levels go up. But if the reward is not as big as we expected, or if it is delayed, our dopamine levels can actually go down. This can lead to feelings of disappointment and frustration.  Huberman provides a number of tips for how to manage our dopamine levels in a healthy way. These include:  * Getting regular exercise * Eating a healthy diet * Getting enough sleep * Managing stress * Avoiding drugs and alcohol * Practicing gratitude  By following these tips, we can help to keep our dopamine levels in balance and avoid the negative consequences of dopamine addiction.  I hope this summary is helpful!",1년 전,1,
@raj66kas,"Thank you for the insight, I'm having difficulty in performing basic daily activity, I do believe that I've been undiagnosed for the last 57 year.  I'm in 1 Hour 13 minutes into the presentation and I just  have to ask ""why is it that I can brush my teeth on a daily basis automatically, yet I can't take my daily medication regularly or follow a routine?"" I was able to do this before. What determines routines over dopamine hits? How do we convert to a routine without dopamine hits? It seems that our baseline is contributing to our failures. How do we convert hits to regularity? I know that this is a loaded question, but I have a few cousins that were alcoholics, and I am thinking that most alcoholics are dealing with this issue? I know that I'm capable, but I'm most days just un-motivated to do basic activities. I'm not ADDHD but replicate some of the symptoms. Thanks for the insight. I'm right now drinking JD, i can't stop eating junk food and repeating sections of this video multiple times to get the jest.

@iSpy-Apothecary,"This information is beyond valuable for so many people. I have so many questions. Also this is me blindly asking- but if cold water therapy works (unsure how it works exactly) but does that mean being out in cold winter climate also creates the same levels of dopamine? I can’t imagine it would bc I live somewhere so cold and we are all depressed here 😅 I’ve been medicated for ADHD for 11 years and now really regretting this form of tx bc I have massive burn out in my 30’s- what seems like beyond repairable burn out. I’m lethargic and viewed as lazy by my partner but I just have zero energy to live most days. My dr wants me to see a sleep specialist bc I sleep too much and he thinks I may have narcolepsy? I always just say it’s my busy schedule with kids, my classes, and work- but he thinks it goes beyond that. I sleep so soundly, so it couldn’t be that I’m not getting quality sleep. I keep thinking now maybe it’s the Adderall long term burn out 😩",1년 전,1,

@hypcro,"0:21: 🧠 This podcast episode discusses the role of dopamine in motivation, satisfaction, and addiction. 10:12: 🧠 Dopamine plays a key role in our brain and body, with peaks in dopamine influencing our overall levels and mood. 20:39: 🧠 Increasing dopamine levels through drugs or supplements may make it harder to sustain dopamine release over time and achieve satisfying peaks relative to the baseline. 30:34: 💡 The video discusses the biology of dopamine and its impact on our experience, with anecdotes about a tragic outbreak of Parkinsonian symptoms and the creation of a drug called MPPP. 41:35: 🧠 Certain activities and substances can significantly increase dopamine levels in the brain. 52:08: 🍇 Dopamine drives the foraging process and the search for rewards. 1:01:25: 😔 Excessive dopamine release from certain activities can lead to loss of interest in other areas of life, potentially leading to severe depression and even suicide. 1:12:40: 💪 Maintaining motivation for various activities requires managing dopamine peaks and varying dopamine experiences. 1:22:32: ☕ Ingesting caffeine, particularly from yerba mate, can increase dopamine receptors and have neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons. 1:33:52: ❄️ Cold water exposure can release stress hormones like cortisol, but they eventually subside. 1:45:14: ! The beauty of the mesolimbic reward pathway is that it includes the forebrain, allowing us to find rewards in effort and make it reflexive for all types of effort. 1:56:46: ! The intensity of pornography can negatively impact real-world romantic and sexual interactions due to the release of dopamine. 2:07:13: 💊 The speaker discusses the use of PEA (phenethylamine) as a focus and work aid, typically taking 500 milligrams of PEA and 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC.

@AlanPhan128,"TLDR: The video discusses the significant role of dopamine in motivation, satisfaction, and addiction, and explores various methods and substances that can influence dopamine levels, emphasizing the importance of balance to maintain focus and avoid overstimulation.  1. 00:00 🧠 The video explores the role of dopamine in motivation, satisfaction, and addiction, its influence on mood and drive, the benefits of cold water exposure and personalized nutrition, and the impact of dopamine on neural circuits, while also discussing tools to leverage dopamine for sustained energy and motivation. 	1.1 The video discusses the role of dopamine in motivation, desire, satisfaction, and addiction, dispelling common myths, explaining its biological and psychological aspects, and providing tools to leverage dopamine for sustained energy and motivation. 	1.2 Exposure to cold water can significantly increase dopamine levels, leading to an alert yet calm state of mind, beneficial for various activities except sleep, and this effect can be sustained even after exiting the cold water. 	1.3 The podcast discusses the benefits of InsideTracker, a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes blood and DNA data for health optimization, Headspace, a meditation app that aids in maintaining a consistent meditation practice, and announces a free educational event on neuroplasticity and efficient learning methods hosted by Logitech. 	1.4 Dopamine, a neuromodulator, maintains a baseline level in the body that influences mood and motivation, and experiences of intense pleasure or desire cause temporary peaks in dopamine, which subsequently lower the baseline level, impacting our drive, excitement, and willingness to pursue things. 	1.5 Neuromodulators like dopamine, unlike neurotransmitters, influence the communication of many neurons, modulating neural circuits, affecting energy levels, mindset, motivation, drive, craving, time perception, and movement, and its depletion can lead to diseases like Parkinson's or Lewy bodies dementia, causing shaky movements, speech challenges, drops in motivation and mood, but when properly treated, can recover some movement fluidity and improve mood and motivation. 	1.6 The video explains the two main neural pathways in the brain involving dopamine, one for movement and one for motivation and craving, and how dopamine can be released locally or broadly, affecting our neural circuits and influencing our motivation and satisfaction levels.  2. 22:32 🧠 Dopamine, a key molecule for movement, mood, and motivation, impacts our experiences and behaviors, can be increased by various activities and substances, and plays a crucial role in thinking and planning through the mesocorticolimbic pathway. 	2.1 Neurons communicate primarily through fast electrical synapses and slower G protein-coupled receptors, with dopamine operating through the latter, impacting movement, motivation, and even gene expression, while also co-releasing the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. 	2.2 Dopamine, a molecule in the brain and body, stimulates alertness and desire to pursue external goals, acting as a universal currency in tracking pleasure and success, with low levels leading to lethargy and high levels to motivation, and the experience of life and motivation depends on the relative amount of dopamine compared to recent experiences. 	2.3 In the 80s, a tragic incident occurred where young opioid addicts mistakenly consumed a drug called MPTP instead of MPPP, leading to irreversible Parkinsonian symptoms due to the destruction of their dopaminergic neurons, highlighting the extreme effects of depleted dopamine levels. 	2.4 Dopamine, a crucial molecule for movement, mood, and motivation, can be leveraged through certain activities and ingestions to maintain a healthy baseline and achieve peaks, which enriches life, and it works closely with epinephrin, a driver of energy, to shape our experiences and behaviors. 	2.5 Dopamine levels, which influence motivation and happiness, can be increased by various activities and substances such as chocolate, sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine, and exercise, with the amount and duration of increase varying based on the activity or substance and individual enjoyment or preference. 	2.6 The mesocorticolimbic pathway, specifically the cortical part or prefrontal cortex, plays a crucial role in thinking, planning, providing rational explanations, and assigning subjective experiences.  3. 44:39 🧠 Deep engagement in activities can boost dopamine for motivation and focus, but balance is key to avoid addiction and maintain satisfaction. 	3.1 The speaker expresses a preference for Pilot V5 pens due to their writing quality and feel. 	3.2 Engaging deeply with an activity or object can increase dopamine release, but false self-reassurances or post-activity rewards can undermine this, while substances like caffeine can upregulate dopamine receptors, enhancing the effects of dopamine. 	3.3 Caffeine and other stimulants increase dopamine levels, which can enhance motivation and focus, but overuse can lead to motivation and energy issues, as dopamine, a driver for seeking and forging, is crucial for survival and reproduction, and maintaining a balance between its baseline level and peaks is essential. 	3.4 Dopamine drives the motivation to seek necessities and rewards, but after achieving these rewards, dopamine levels decrease below the initial level to stimulate further seeking behavior, a process that has existed for thousands of years across various species. 	3.5 Dopamine levels drop below baseline after achieving a goal or experiencing pleasure, which can lead to a decrease in motivation and satisfaction, but maintaining a healthy dopamine baseline can help sustain motivation and prevent addiction. 	3.6 Dopamine, a neurotransmitter responsible for pleasure and pain, can lead to addiction when activities or substances cause large increases in dopamine levels, followed by a depletion or drop in baseline levels, but understanding this relationship can help individuals make better choices to maintain or increase their dopamine baseline while still experiencing peaks of motivation and pleasure.  4",1년 전,1,

@Dan-oi4kt,"Brain dopamine receptor density correlates with social status  Date: February 7, 2010 Source: Elsevier  The researchers looked at social status and social support in normal healthy volunteers who were scanned using positron emission tomography (PET), a technology that allowed them to image dopamine type 2 receptors in the brain.  This data suggests that people who achieve greater social status are more likely to be able to experience life as rewarding and stimulating because they have more targets for dopamine to act upon within the striatum.  Dr. Martinez explains their findings: ""We showed that low levels of dopamine receptors were associated with low social status and that high levels of dopamine receptors were associated with higher social status. The same type of association was seen with the volunteer's reports of social support they experience from their friends, family, or significant other.""  Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry commented, ""These data shed interesting light into the drive to achieve social status, a basic social process. It would make sense that people who had higher levels of D2 receptors, i.e., were more highly motivated and engaged by social situations, would be high achievers and would have higher levels of social support.""",1년 전(수정됨),0,

The current data suggest that vulnerable individuals with low D2/D3 receptors may be vulnerable to lower social status and social supports, and these social factors have previously been suggested as contributors to the risk for alcohol and substance use.

@zdravkobelinski4627,"I want to watch it but its 2 hours lol, also i watched another video where it stated that dopamine was the bad guy and we should focus on serotonine instead, as dopamine was responsible for addictions, hence bad things, while serotonin was responsible for happiness, but this video says dopamine is responsible for motivation focus and satisfaction, it is confusing.  I would love some summary because two hours of alot of new information i might need to watch it a few times instead to get actual insight on the video.   I lack motivation myself often, but i am not addicted to anything, i dont understand it, I used to dring alcohol like beers and sometimes vodka or else, but i stopped it, i prob had 1 beer in the last two months, I dont use my phone as much anymore and keep it turned off most of the time. I dont smoke and dont do drugs, I only need a solution how to stay motivated on studying and not have this i study for month and then leave it for some time, because inside me i feel a bit of regret, for the time i spent before for studying. It is like i have invested something and threw it away now.   I know motivation comes from within and there is chemistry responsible in the brain for these activities to keep going and thats why i browse videos for them, but this video has huge and contradictory info.  I just want to know - do more of this and less of this and will be better. I dont even use my playstation anymore so to say, i like reading books, but what i want is to be able to want something in the long term and my motivation not to expire after a month or two. I know this will make me happy but am not sure why my motivation dies overtime   edited: i scrolled forward and i agree stress is huge element in motivation to change, i mean the two occasions i actively looked to change and do something new was when i thought i might get released from work which caused stress in me which caused me to look for alternatives, but the motivation part at 1:40 min, I study at home web development hence coding, and i try to do at least one hour per day even though i often have full days off on my disposal, and no i dont look for reward, i want to have new job in the future where i can be more free and work from wherever i want, but because of the lack of motivation and the comfort that i have job now hence i dont have stress or anything doesnt help, i mean i dont want to be web developer that much than just to be more free myself. I want internally to be able t o study for 8 hours or even 4 will be great everyday but i dont want it that much because it simply dont matter that much for me. There are not things i want to buy with money I dont want to be rich, I want comfort more and in the moment i have it - I sacrifice 2 days at work for 5 days comfort. But still, there has to be way to turn around my studying into motivating one regardless, and studying should also give dopamine and happiness, otherwise why i give up everything from phone scrolling through alcohol and my playstation, for what? You can argue that these are bad habits, but i gave them away and im not happy anyway, the magic does not work regardless that you change",1년 전(수정됨),0,

I'm actually training in preparation for doing an Iron Man, and when you were talking about the effort being the reward and how powerful it is to access I found myself nodding in agreement.   Many people ask me how I able to put myself through all this training when the reward is an even more grueling challenge with the actual Iron Man event. The fact is that I love the challenge, the effort is the reward. I dont do this training just so I can eat whatever I want or relax in the evening. It is its own reward.

@eenix0,"Wanted to add to the part around 1:07:00ish, where he gets into misdiagnosed ADHD - I think this probably goes without saying, but this is hugely beneficial for true ADHD folk as well. I was only recently diagnosed, but the diagnosis absolutely tracks with my life experiences. However...prior to the events that led to my depression and PTSD and the ADHD diagnosis, I was very, very functional without medication. I have two degrees and had a mostly successful career until recent events. And one of the things I've really struggled with in my otherwise quite great healthcare, is this idea that I should be on meds forever. I really don't think I should. But when I say that, my psychiatrist expressed concerns that I have a stigma against meds...when I really don't think that's the case. I don't feel negatively about medication, and it's helped me a LOT in the last year, but I've routinely felt unheard that I really was very content with my life before the events that set me off, and my personal goal is to get back to that baseline. I'm finally leaving my job this month and plan to take a break to just hike, be outdoors, touch grass, play with my dogs, detox from screens and from nonstop information and stimuli, and I really truly believe that's what I need right now.

There are also rat studies that have shown reduced serum prolactin levels and increased dopamine levels in the hypothalamus area of the brain, so theoretically would this supplement boost dopamine enough to deplete it below baseline levels after daily use at recommended dose of 60mg of a 50:1 leaf extract 1-3 times/day? 2 - In regards to exogenous melatonin supplementation reducing baseline levels of dopamine would that also apply to natural production of melatonin from red light wavelengths from the sun and red light therapy?",1년 전(수정됨),1,

In terms of dopamine and dopamine peak, exercise (positive thing) is similar to some toxic substances (2x baseline), and positive impact of exercise is related to some other consequences not related to dopamine (in compare with toxic substances).  So, exercise is something which can also be 'negative' in terms of dopamine because we receive peak, and because of this, we need to be careful with combining exercise with some other dopamine-increasing acitivity (reward)   Did I understand well that exercise in terms of dopamine is similar to some toxic substances/acitivity, or there is something else which I missed?",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@imalex0749,"1. Cold Water therapy effects on dopamine, adrenaline and nor adrenalin 2. Dopamine can be released in 2 ways: Local release and volumetric release 3. How pleasurable or satisfying you feel doesn't depend on peak level of dopamine. It depends upon difference in baseline level and peak level of dopamine. How you feel depends upon your previous level of Dopamine as compared to present level. Many drugs just increase both baseline level and peak level instead of increasing the difference between them. A big Dopamine release makes it more challenging to achieve higher dopamine release the next time. There should not be High level nor low level of Dpamine for long.  4.Just Increasing dopamine level will make us excited but that excitement will be for very less period of time 5. Chocolate increases Dipamine 1.5 times but it goes away in few seconds. Desire of sex or act of sex increases dopamine 2 times 6. Nicotene(smoked) increases dopamine 2.5 times above base line (Very short lived) 7. Amphetamine, Cocaine, Nicotine, Sex increases dopamine in everybody that takes them. Exercise, Hard Work and Studying increasea dopamine but it is subjective 8. After achieving something, Dopamine increases but after some time it falls down. It falls down even below the baseline. The extent it drops below the baseline is directly proportional to how high the peak was. After achieving something, if you feel preety happy, the dopamine will not fall that much but if you feel extremely happy, your dopamine will fall extremely after a day or two. (Eg:- Postpartum Depression). Anyway, we return to the baseline after some time.  9. If we continue to engage in something exciting  regularly, after sometime it will be less exciting to us. 10. Some people release dopamine at higher level after a certain activity which deplete the releasable pool of dopamine. So, after sometime, dopamine falls below base level and it leads to a low feeling. Some people do the dopamine spiking activity again and again to bring back dopamine up to experience pleasure again since they are feeling low. But as we know, they have depleted the stock of releasable dopamine. The baseline begins to lower again and again. This is called ADDICTION and Addicted people don't feel pleasure at all.  11. Addiction is the progressive narrowing of things that bring you pleasure. If I am addicted to video games. I will feel happy in only playing it. I will not feel happy in exercise, study, social activity and my life will be ruined. After a some time, my system will stop releasing dopamine even after playing video games and nothing is left for me which can increase my dopamine. This is the start of depression. Spiking dopamine again and again is the main cause of decline in The baseline level. 12. If you experience a win whether it is school, sports or relationship; be highly careful about allowing yourself to experience a huge peak of Dopamine.  13. You kind of like exercise and to do exercise you increase dopamine by drinking energy drink and listen music to do exercise then you are increasing the number of conditions required to achieve the high level of dopamine by doing exercise. Don't use stimulants everytime you study or everytime you workout or anything in which you want to enjoy the process. Taking these stimulants (Music, energy drinks, Motivational reels) before the task will reduce the level of enjoyment and undermine the ability to stay motivated. The best way is to get excitement and motivation from the task itself whether it is Study or Workout. So. ENJOY THE PROCESS only. 14. Some Healthy ways to increase Dopamine so that the base level is maintained:: Cold water Therapy which increases Adrenalin and nor-adrenalin rapidly while dopamine shows gradual increase to 2.5 times above baseline and comes back to normal in 3 hours (Here there is a sustained increase instead of Rise and Crash) 15. If you work hard for the end result then the process will become very challenging. 1:39:02 is an amazing example. When someone gives reward or we reward ourself then we tend to associate our pleasure with reward rather than the work itself and if the reward is stopped, we lose interest in the process of the work. But again, Take a special care of not spiking dopamine just prior or even after to the effort. Learn to raise Dopamine from effort itself. 16. Example of Porn: Those who are indulged in it find it difficult to seek enjoyment in the productive process. Watching porn and Masturbation increase dopamine level⬆️ and then fall down very quickly⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️ below base line . Now to raise dopamine level much higher is difficult to feel pleasure again.",1년 전(수정됨),648,

After a some time, my system will stop releasing dopamine even after playing video games and nothing is left for me which can increase my dopamine. This is the start of depression. Spiking dopamine again and again is the main cause of decline in The baseline level.  12. If you experience a win whether it is school, sports or relationship; be highly careful about allowing yourself to experience a huge peak of Dopamine.   13. You kind of like exercise and to do exercise you increase dopamine by drinking energy drink and listen music to do exercise then you are increasing the number of conditions required to achieve the high level of dopamine by doing exercise. Don't use stimulants every time you study or every time you workout or anything in which you want to enjoy the process. Taking these stimulants (Music, energy drinks, Motivational reels) before the task will reduce the level of enjoyment and undermine the ability to stay motivated. The best way is to get excitement and motivation from the task itself whether it is Study or Workout. So. ENJOY THE PROCESS only.  14. Some Healthy ways to increase Dopamine so that the base level is maintained:: Cold water Therapy which increases Adrenalin and nor-adrenalin rapidly while dopamine shows gradual increase to 2.5 times above baseline and comes back to normal in 3 hours (Here there is a sustained increase instead of Rise and Crash)  15. If you work hard for the end result then the process will become very challenging. 1:39:02 is an amazing example. When someone gives reward or we reward ourself then we tend to associate our pleasure with reward rather than the work itself and if the reward is stopped, we lose interest in the process of the work. But again, Take a special care of not spiking dopamine just prior or even after to the effort. Learn to raise Dopamine from effort itself.  16. Example of Porn: Those who are indulged in it find it difficult to seek enjoyment in the productive process. Watching porn and Masturbation increase dopamine level and then fall down very quickly below base line . Now to raise dopamine level much higher is difficult to feel pleasure again.",1년 전,3,

@pawankumar-no4bx,"This podcast discusses dopamine, its role in motivation, desire, and craving, as well as its relation to satisfaction and addiction. 01:25 🌱 Dopamine levels can be influenced by various factors, including food, drugs, caffeine, and plant-based compounds, leading to changes in baseline dopamine and how much we experience from satisfying events. 03:23 🥶 Exposure to cold water can lead to significant increases in dopamine, resulting in improved well-being, cognition, and clarity of mind. 05:16 🏞 This podcast is dedicated to providing science-based information about dopamine and other related topics to the general public. 10:01 🧪 Dopamine is not just responsible for pleasure but also plays a crucial role in motivation, drive, craving, and time perception. 11:29 🧠 Dopamine's effects are mediated through two main neural pathways: the mesocorticolimbic pathway (for motivation and reward) and the nigrostriatal pathway (for movement). 18:36 🧪 Dopamine can be released locally at synapses between neurons or volumetrically, influencing how our neural circuits work on both a local and broad scale. 21:00 📈 Simply increasing dopamine levels through drugs or supplements may not lead to sustained motivation and pleasure; optimizing the peak-to-baseline ratio is essential for lasting satisfaction. 22:26 🧠 Dopamine works through G protein-coupled receptors, taking longer to affect the brain compared to fast electrical synapses. 23:53 🚀 Dopamine has two pathways for communication: one for movement and one for motivation/craving. It can also have slow and long-lasting effects, even impacting gene expression. 25:21 💡 Dopamine stimulates action and makes neurons more active, increasing alertness and desire to pursue external goals. 26:48 😴 Low dopamine results in lethargy and lack of motivation, while high dopamine leads to excitement, motivation, and drive. 29:44 🔬 Understanding dopamine's schedules and kinetics allows for effective use of dopamine-enhancing tools for optimal motivation and drive. 35:35 💔 A tragic outbreak of symptoms caused by MPTP showed the devastating effects of severely depleted dopamine levels. 36:00 😢 An anecdote about experiencing low dopamine levels due to Thorazine illustrates the profound impact of dopamine on mood and motivation. 40:29 🍫 Chocolate, sex, nicotine, cocaine, and amphetamine increase dopamine levels transiently, with different degrees of intensity. 44:08 🏋‍♂ The enjoyment of exercise plays a significant role in the dopamine increase it induces. Practicing appreciation or positive thinking about an activity can boost dopamine response. 46:30 🧠 Dopamine is increased by various activities and substances, including chocolate, sex, nicotine, cocaine, and amphetamine. 46:59 ☕ Caffeine increases dopamine receptor density, enhancing the effects of dopamine. 48:28 ⚠ Layering multiple dopamine-increasing activities can lead to severe issues with motivation and energy later on. 49:53 📉 Dopamine experiences peaks and baseline levels, with excessive peaks leading to substantial baseline drops. 56:16 💡 Maintaining a healthy dopamine baseline while experiencing intermittent dopamine peaks is essential for sustained motivation and pleasure. 01:06:37 🚫 For those experiencing dopamine depletion due to excessive engagement with dopamine-evoking behaviors or substances, limiting interactions and pursuing a dopamine fast may help replenish the dopamine system. 01:09:01 🎰 Intermittent reward schedules, like those used in casinos and engaging activities, keep people motivated and pursuing. Expecting high dopamine release every time can lead to dissatisfaction. 01:10:01 🚫 Avoid experiencing huge peaks in dopamine too often to maintain motivation. Intermittent reinforcement schedules with varying dopamine levels are more beneficial for long-term enjoyment of activities. 01:15:00 ☎ Limit smartphone usage during enjoyable activities to prevent dopamine overstimulation and maintain motivation. 01:17:02 🔄 Consistently spiking dopamine through substances like amphetamine, cocaine, or caffeine can hinder neuroplasticity and long-term learning. 01:22:29 ☕ Caffeine in moderation, especially from sources like yerba mate, can increase dopamine receptors and may have neuroprotective effects on dopamine neurons. 01:29:25 🌡 Cold exposure, such as cold showers or ice baths, can increase dopamine levels and promote feelings of wellbeing. Caution should be exercised to avoid extreme temperatures. 01:32:49 🥶 Cold water exposure triggers a sustained rise in dopamine levels, comparable to cocaine, leading to positive mental and physical effects. 01:34:13 🧘‍♂ Different approaches to remaining in cold water: relaxing, energizing, or distracting; all can trigger dopamine release. 01:37:29 🥶 Cold water exposure can raise dopamine baseline levels, leading to heightened calm and focus after the experience. 01:41:55 🏆 Focusing solely on external rewards for hard work can undermine dopamine's role in effort and decrease pleasure in the activity itself. 01:45:11 🍽 Intermittent fasting can help shift dopamine from food reward to effort reward, making activities more enjoyable and motivating. 01:52:47 🧠 The forebrain's rational thought can shape dopamine circuits, reinforcing the reward properties of activities that are beneficial and important to us. 01:53:46 🍬 Prior experiences of high dopamine release can diminish the pleasure from less rewarding activities. Reducing intake of highly palatable foods can reset dopamine responses. 01:55:42 🧠 Intense pornography can negatively impact real-world romantic and sexual interactions due to dopamine's influence on the brain. 01:57:10 💊 Prescription drug Welbutrin (bupropion) increases dopamine and norepinephrine, providing an alternative treatment for depression. 01:59:07 🌿 Macuna Pruriens, a supplement containing l-DOPA, increases dopamine transiently and intensely but can lead to a crash afterward. 02:02:02 💊 L-tyrosine, an amino acid precursor to l-DOPA, can be used to enhance focus and motivation when taken in appropriate doses. 02:08:26 🍫 Chocolate and PEA (phenethylamine) found in some foods can transiently increase synaptic dopamine levels. 02:08:55 🧠 Huperzine A, a nootropic compound, stimulates dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. 02:11:18 🤝 Oxytocin released during social connections stimulates the dopamine pathway, emphasizing the importance of healthy social interactions. 02:14:15 💡 Understanding and controlling dopamine levels can lead to improved overall well-being and mental performance.",2년 전,1,

You explain concepts in a very clear and interesting way, also using recent studies from prestigious medical journals to present facts and ideas in non-biased ways, allowing us to utilize this information to improve our lives.  Part of depression is not feeling any joy or motivation for anything (even for things that we once found enjoyable), because it's not engaging as it was before, and there's a lack of meaning or purpose behind it. Especially for high achieving people, always accomplishing at their highest level, and there's always that underlying question of ""what's next?"".  Part of it is needing extremely high levels of a certain substance/drug/activity in order to feel joy and excitement, and if we can't feel that ""high"" anymore, then what's the point of wasting our time and energy searching for these highs that never last and these lows that only continue to worsen.   Everyone experiences depression differently, some might feel persistent sadness and guilt, while others will feel baseline neutral to everything (even if its something considered pleasurable, like sex/alcohol/drugs/eating your favorite food, etc).

@589139chhotu,Practise generating feeling of extreme enthusiasm and excitement (aka release dopamine)  whenever  (1)friction arises in mind and  (2) you overcome the friction  and start the task.   Over a period of time your mind will link and relate friction with excitement making it easier for you to overcome friction and feel excited to do the tough tasks.  Second lesson is to keep overall dopamine baseline level  constant. Don't indulge too much in frivolous activities that give you a dopamine spike.  Dopamine spikes exhaust and deplete dopamine production because at a time there is only so much  dopamine your body can produce.  Hence you will not get dopamine high for other necessary activities as dopamine production capacity is exhausted and depleted in body.  You feel demotivated to do important  tasks as your body is now not able to produce more dopamine for you to get started.    Formula of success: Don't waste dopamine in mindless entertainment but keep it reserved for linking friction and stress with excitement and enthusiasm. If you can make this a habbit all stressful tasks will then start appearing exciting,2년 전(수정됨),2,

@DihelsonMendonca,"I had a burned out in 2019 and I still didn't recovered completely. I Went into depression. I run a local news channel at the time, and was too excited about it. For almost 10 years I enjoyed making interviews, reports, presenting the news, but almost nobody was interested. The channel never grew up much, although I worked for 10 or 14 hours a day. One day I was completely exhausted, and I stayed exhausted for weeks. When I went a little better, I noticed that I didn't want to work on news or editing videos anymore. After that, I had no more pleasure in my life, and all things I once loved and enjoyed, I do not like anymore. I happened to stay all day on the bed, depressed, no motivated to do anything. I tried all kinds of antidepressants, and none helped. But one day I took a quarter of a pill of Ritalin 10 mg, and on half an hour, I felt that weight over me went away completely. I was normal, not elated, but not sad anymore. I noticed that there's an ideal dosage which keeps away the depression, but don't trigger hyperexcitability. Of course, I agreed with my doctor, and we developed a schedule for using Ritalin to treat depression. It's a very low dose, and not to be used every day. There are other medicines used for ADHD that improves depression, foods, exercise, caffeine, good sleep, not engaging in high peaks of dopamine. I would like to know a way to upregulate the dopamine receptors, so, my dopamine baseline would be ideal without any medicines. The good news is that I didn't get addicted to Ritalin, and get really better from my depression. I get more focus, motivation, and I began to reorganize my life. I feel the bad days are going to the past. Thanks God. 🎉🎉❤❤❤",2년 전,0,

@SN23031978,"Thank you Dr. Huberman for such an enlightening podcast.  I came across it today and finished in one sitting.  Here are my key takeaways for anyone interested:  Dopamine is a powerful neuromodulator, which means that it controls and coordinates different neural circuits at the same time. It is not just responsible for pleasure, but also motivation and drive. In evolutionary biology terms, it is the driver for us to seek things out that make us feel good, such as food, mates, money, and fame.   1.	Immersing oneself in cold water results in sustained release of dopamine.  2.	Baseline dopamine is the amount of dopamine circulating in the body all the time, that determines how you generally feel.  3.	The intensity or pleasure that one experiences at the height of dopamine depends upon how high that peak is relative to the baseline.  If there is a local release of dopamine along with volumetric release, the difference between the peak experienced and the baseline will be smaller.   This happens in case of volumetric release (dumping) of dopamine when you take a drug/substance.  Also, while you will feel very motivated for all things, that motivation will be very short lived.  There are thus two spatial scales for dopamine, one is volumetrically and the other synaptically.  4.	When you repeatedly engage in something that is pleasurable, such as sex, eating chocolate etc., your threshold for enjoying that thing goes up.  This is because how much you enjoy a thing depends upon the dopamine level released afterwards compared to the dopamine level before it.  5.	There are two pathways for dopamine to communicate.  One for movement and one for motivation/pleasure/desire.  6.	Dopamine and epinephrine aka adrenaline (released from adrenaline glands present on top of kidneys) are close family members and ‘hang out’ together.  There is a biochemical pathway for conversion of dopamine to adrenaline.  But adrenaline is more about the energy, whereas dopamine is about the feelings that this energy generates.  7.	There are certain activities and things that increase dopamine level, such as  -	Chocolate – increase it 1.5x -	Sex or pursuit thereof  – increases it 2 to 2.5x (varies for different acts involved) -	Amphetamine – increases it 10x -	Nicotine – increases it 2.5 times, but is very short lived.  -	Exercise – can increase it to 2x times, however it depends upon subjective experience of a particular exercise.  People who do not enjoy exercise or dislike it may not experience any increase in dopamine afterwards. Same goes with hard work, studying hard, working through a challenge at the job or in a relationship.  How much dopamine is released depends upon how much you like the process itself, and not the reward of it.    8.	Layering together multiple things that lead to big increases in dopamine, can actually create severe issues with energy and motivation right after those experiences.  9.	When you experience a peak dopamine level after an activity, it will drop to baseline after sometime, and it may drop to even lower than the baseline, because of depletion of readily releasable pool of dopamine.  This is what happens in postpartum depression, when women feel depressed after a certain time of giving birth.  10.	When people get addicted to something, a time comes when they don’t drive any pleasure at all from these as they stop getting dopamine release from that activity and then fall into serious depression.  11.	The key is to not expect or chase high levels of dopamine, but to go for intermittent releases of dopamine. 12.	Working hard for sake of a reward that comes afterward can make us less likely to feel motivated to do that task. There has to be an ‘intrinsic’ reinforcement rather than ‘extrinsic’ reinforcement. In case of the later, we tend to associate less pleasure with the actual activity itself than we associate with the reward.   One should learn to spike dopamine with the effort itself. 13.	The activity should itself be a reward and one should learn to enjoy the process.  Your perception of time gets altered by release of dopamine during an activity.  The time flows slowly as you are more present when doing that activity.  14.	There are activities that we can do which will help us in having this sustained release of dopamine that is beneficial for us: —	Cold exposure in the form of immersion in cold water.  Try to relax yourself through slow breathing if you feel uncomfortable. But if you do it too often, say everyday and become too comfortable with it, it will no longer release dopamine.  —	Learning to enjoy the activity, such as exercise, writing a book etc., —	Intermittent fasting.  We enjoy food more when we are really hungry because the dopamine receptors had not seen dopamine for some time, however a time comes when one starts enjoying the state of fasting, as there are rewarding properties in the state of deprivation too.  —	Nonprescription supplements like L-Tyrosine which is a precursor to dopamine.  Their effect is however short lived, and one may come crashing down once the releasable pool of dopamine depletes.  They may be taken once or twice a week, but Dr. Hubarman does not recommend their use.  —	Phenylethylamine (PEA) with Alpha CPG —	Making social connections  Thank you again for the wonderful work you are doing.",2년 전,0,

@rgcamsf,"Dr. HHuberman, thankyou for this presentation.  The  documentary movie, ""My Octopus Teacher"", involved the depressed filmmaker who swam in cold water without a wetsuit.  By the end of the film, the depressed person's mood lifted.  He initially connected with the Octopus.  Then he began swimming with his son.  Then he began collaborating with other fil m makers.  Then he became committed to habitat preservation.  The behavioral activation combined with dopamine release seemed to be helpful here.  In addition connection and purpose counteract the existential emptiness associated with depression.  Thank God coffee plays a helpful role!!!",2년 전,0,

@Madjest,"This's just a personal note of mine as someone who's trying to adress my own sense of burnout so there's gonna be a bias of focus here a bit. Also warning but swear words incoming:  Dopamine can be turnt into norepinephrine, which turns into epinephrine(adrenaline)  Dopamine works in base lines and peaks, and the state you are feeling is based on the discrepancy between the two.  A higher discrepancy leads to less reinforcement/pleasure so to say.  The mezo-cortical limbic system determines the amount of dopamine multiplier based on the subjective perception of enjoyment of said person.  Basically this enables us to be able to have a growth mindset, this lets us attach effort to enjoyment, as opposed to attaching goals to enjoyment which makes it possible for one to experience burnout.  Because burnout is the discrepancy between effort and reward.  Also due to how dopamine works, if you have a goal oriented mindset, that means dopamine is released AFTER the goal is achieved.  So your starting line already lacks the fucking hormone that makes your body fucking move, then that can lead to associating that experience as having less dopamine rewards circling that back to your mezo cortical limbic system. Making you have to spike your dopamine even more with more fucking music more coffee more sex and so on",2년 전,0,

@pioternietz496,"HE AND SHE ( HEALTHY FAMILY )  It seems like you're looking for information about promotions related to supplements and a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time data or current promotions. However, I can provide you with some general information about supplements and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  Supplements are products that are taken in addition to the regular diet to provide additional nutrients that may be lacking in one's diet. They can include vitamins, minerals, herbal extracts, and other substances. Before starting any supplement regimen, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional, as individual needs vary and excessive intake of certain nutrients can have negative effects.  Maintaining a healthy lifestyle involves a combination of factors, including:  1. *Balanced Diet:* Eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.  2. *Regular Exercise:* Engage in regular physical activity to improve cardiovascular health, maintain a healthy weight, and enhance overall well-being.  3. *Adequate Sleep:* Get enough quality sleep to support physical and mental health. Adults typically need 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  4. *Stress Management:* Practice stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to manage stress levels.  5. *Hydration:* Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.  6. *Avoid Harmful Habits:* Limit or avoid smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and other harmful behaviors.  7. *Regular Check-ups:* Schedule regular medical check-ups to monitor your health and catch any potential issues early.  8. *Social Connections:* Maintain a strong support network of friends and family, as social connections can positively impact mental health.  As for promotions related to supplements and healthy lifestyle products, you might want to check online health stores, pharmacies, or local health and wellness centers for any ongoing deals or offers. Keep in mind that the effectiveness and safety of supplements can vary, so it's important to research products and consult a healthcare professional before making any purchases.

@bo-h8075,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🧠 Introduction to dopamine's role in motivation, desire, craving, and satisfaction. 00:58 🧪 Dispelling myths about dopamine, discussing its biology and psychology. 01:25 🌿 How various factors like food, drugs, caffeine, impact dopamine levels. 02:24 ❄️ Cold water exposure increases dopamine and its impact on well-being. 03:51 🎯 Techniques to increase dopamine levels for improved mindset and energy. 11:29 🧠 Understanding the mesocorticolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways of dopamine. 16:40 🎢 Distinction between local synaptic release and volumetric release of dopamine. 20:01 💥 Relationship between peak dopamine levels, baseline levels, and pleasure/excitement. 22:26 🧠 Dopamine communicates through G protein-coupled receptors, leading to slower effects and cascades of impacts. 24:51 🔄 Dopamine can operate at different spatial scales and has slow or long-lasting effects, even affecting gene expression. 25:21 ⚖️ Dopamine co-releases glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, contributing to movement and motivation. 26:17 🌟 Dopamine stimulates sympathetic arousal, increasing alertness and readiness to pursue external goals. 27:47 🎢 Dopamine is a currency for tracking pleasure, success, motivation, and the subjective quality of life. 29:16 📊 Dopamine experiences depend on baseline levels, previous peaks, and recent experiences, challenging the idea of simple ""dopamine hits."" 32:40 💔 Extreme dopamine depletion, as seen with MPTP poisoning, leads to paralysis and loss of motivation and drive. 34:08 🌫️ Low dopamine levels can result in sadness and depression, while raising dopamine can alleviate such states. 40:00 🎢 Different activities and substances affect dopamine levels: chocolate (1.5x), sex (2x), nicotine (2.5x), cocaine (2.5x), amphetamine (10x), and exercise (varies by enjoyment). 45:31 🤝 Engaging with activities and finding aspects to appreciate can enhance dopamine release, but lying to oneself won't work. 46:30 🧠 Dopamine varies in response to different activities and substances; chocolate, sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine cause significant increases. 47:59 ☕ Caffeine moderately increases dopamine; regular caffeine intake upregulates dopamine receptors, enhancing its effects. 48:54 🏋️‍♂️ Combining substances and activities for dopamine highs can lead to motivation and energy issues shortly after. 49:24 🚀 Pursuing constant high dopamine levels isn't the best approach; layering dopamine-evoking activities can lead to problems. 50:20 🧭 Dopamine drives seeking behavior for survival; seeking resources, pleasure, and avoiding pain. 51:49 🔍 Evolutionary perspective: Dopamine system evolved to promote foraging, seeking, and survival-related activities. 53:16 💥 After achieving a peak in dopamine (e.g., finishing a task), baseline dopamine drops below previous levels, causing post-reward depression. 55:16 🎢 Continuously pursuing dopamine peaks can lead to progressive narrowing of pleasure sources, resembling addiction. 56:44 💡 Understanding dopamine dynamics helps make informed choices to maintain a healthy baseline while enjoying peak experiences. 01:04:07 🕹️ Limiting interactions with dopamine-evoking behaviors or substances can replenish dopamine levels and improve well-being. 01:09:01 🎰 Intermittent reward schedules are central to maintaining motivation in various activities, like gambling, relationships, and engaging with the internet and social media. 01:09:31 🧠 Evolutionarily, intermittent schedules relate to the variability of rewards when searching for resources, creating strong motivation when expectations align with rewards like dopamine. 01:10:31 🕰️ Adopting intermittent reinforcement schedules can enhance motivation in activities like exercise, relationships, and learning by varying the levels and frequency of dopamine release. 01:11:32 🎵 Avoid layering multiple dopamine-enhancing activities to prevent desensitization to dopamine release and maintain pleasureful experiencesover time. 01:15:00 📱 Smartphones, often multitasking devices, can inadvertently lead to overstimulation of dopamine pathways, contributing to lowered baseline levels of motivation and satisfaction. 01:17:31 💪 Engaging in activities without artificially spiking dopamine can help maintain baseline levels and prevent desensitization to rewards, leading to more sustainable motivation. 01:19:32 ☕ Caffeine intake, especially from sources like yerba mate, can increase dopamine receptors' efficacy and density, potentially aiding motivation and focus. 01:21:58 ⚠️ Frequent use of stimulants like amphetamine, cocaine, or energy drinks can negatively impact neuroplasticity and long-term motivation, diminishing the benefits of activities. 01:29:25 🌡️ Cold exposure through activities like cold showers or ice baths can increase dopamine and norepinephrine release, contributing to improved mood and motivation. 01:32:49 🧊 Cold water exposure leads to significant increases in adrenaline and noradrenaline, as well as a sustained rise in dopamine levels, comparable to cocaine, providing positive mental and physical effects. 01:34:13 ❄️ Cold water exposure triggers norepinephrine release and dopamine elevation, leading to increased baseline dopamine levels, resulting in feelings of calm and focus for an extended period after exposure. 01:37:01 🌊 Regular cold water exposure can be done daily, with greater benefits in the morning, offering a cost-effective method to elevate dopamine levels without the use of drugs. 01:38:59 🏆 Relying solely on external rewards for tasks can reduce the intrinsic pleasure of the activity, as dopamine perception is tied to time. Cultivating a growth mindset and finding pleasure in effort can lead to better performance. 01:41:26 🍔 Restricting dopamine spikes before and after engaging in effort helps create internal rewards from the process itself, improving the experience and fostering a healthier relationship with tasks. 01:45:40 🍽️ Intermittent fasting can be seen as a practice to evoke dopamine release from deprivation and effort, enabling a shift in perception and appreciation of challenging activities. 01:48:32 🧠 Using knowledge and interpretation can shape and strengthen the dopamine reward circuitry, making challenging endeavors more rewarding and increasing their value over time. 01:51:22 🍬 Experiencing highly palatable foods can alter dopamine perception, making less processed and bland foods less enjoyable. Avoiding excessive dopamine spikes can help restore appreciation for simpler foods. 01:55:42 🧠 Dopamine affects real-world romantic and sexual interactions, with intense activities like pornography potentially negatively influencing them due to dopamine's impact on the brain's reward system. 01:57:10 💊 The prescription drug Wellbutrin (bupropion) can increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels and is used as an alternative treatment for depression, with potential benefits for motivation and craving. However, it can also lead to increased anxiety. 01:59:07 🌿 Macuna Pruriens is a supplement containing l-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine, and can lead to transient and intense dopamine increases. It has shown potential effects on Parkinson's disease symptoms and other aspects of reproduction. 02:02:02 💡 L-Tyrosine, an amino acid precursor to l-DOPA, can stimulate dopamine release, promoting focus and motivation within 30-45 minutes after ingestion. 02:07:29 🍫 Phenethylamine (PEA) found in chocolate and compounds like Huperzine A can also stimulate dopamine release and focus, but their use should be carefully considered based on individual health and needs. 02:10:20 ❤️ Oxytocin, a hormone associated with social bonding, stimulates the dopamine pathway, emphasizing the importance of healthy social interactions for dopamine regulation. 02:13:45 🎯 Understanding the control and influence of previous, current, and future dopamine levels can empower individuals to modulate their dopamine system for better focus, motivation, and overall well-being.

@ambition112,"0:13: 🧠 This episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast discusses dopamine, including its role in motivation, satisfaction, and addiction, as well as how behaviors and substances can affect dopamine levels. 11:58: 🧠 Dopamine is a neuromodulator that influences motivation, drive, and craving. It has two main neural circuits: one for movement and one for reward and motivation. Dopamine can be released locally or in a volumetric manner, and its duration of action is unique. 22:50: 💡 Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that influences electrical activity in neurons and has two pathways for communication: one for movement and one for motivation and craving. 35:12: 🧠 Dopamine plays a crucial role in our perception of life, motivation, and mood, and understanding how to leverage it can enhance our well-being. 47:52: 🧠 Dopamine plays a crucial role in motivation and seeking rewards, but excessive dopamine peaks followed by drops in baseline levels can lead to issues with motivation and energy. 59:08: 🧠 The pleasure-pain balance and addiction are influenced by the release and depletion of dopamine in the brain. 1:11:19: 🧠 Understanding the relationship between dopamine and pleasure is crucial for maintaining motivation and enjoyment in activities. 1:32:42: 🌊 Cold water exposure can increase dopamine levels and provide mental and physical benefits. 1:35:22: 🧊 Cold water exposure can trigger a release of dopamine, leading to a heightened level of calm and focus. 1:47:02: 🧠 Dopamine plays a crucial role in motivation and reward, and its release can be influenced by various factors such as effort, fasting, and subjective interpretation. 1:59:29: 🧠 Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with motivation, pleasure, and reward. Various substances and behaviors can affect dopamine levels. 2:11:49: 🧠 Social connections and engaging in healthy social interactions can stimulate dopamine pathways and increase oxytocin release.

@alexdc6402,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🧠 Dopamina es clave para motivación, deseo, satisfacción y adicción. 01:25 🍔 Alimentos, drogas, café y más pueden cambiar niveles de dopamina. 02:24 ❄️ Exposición al agua fría aumenta significativamente los niveles de dopamina. 04:47 💡 Herramientas para aumentar y regular niveles de dopamina. 11:58 🧠 Hay dos vías principales de dopamina: mesocorticolímbica y nigroestriatal. 13:58 🔌 Dopamina afecta neuronas a nivel local y con liberación volumétrica. 20:31 ⚖️ Aumentar dopamina puede afectar la duración y sostenibilidad de la motivación. 22:26 🧠 La dopamina trabaja a través de receptores acoplados a proteínas G, diferenciándose de otros químicos cerebrales. 23:23 ⏳ La dopamina actúa mediante receptores GPCR, lo que provoca efectos más lentos pero con múltiples cascadas de impacto. 24:51 🏃‍♂️ La dopamina opera en dos vías: movimiento y motivación, con efectos lentos o duraderos, e incluso puede influir en la expresión génica. 25:50 🎉 La dopamina estimula la actividad neuronal, generando alerta y deseo de perseguir objetivos externos. 26:48 😴 Los bajos niveles de dopamina causan falta de motivación, mientras que niveles altos generan excitación y deseo de acción. 28:17 🍫 Los ""golpes de dopamina"" no consideran el contexto: la cantidad de dopamina previa afecta cómo se percibe una experiencia. 29:44 🔄 La repetición de actividades placenteras aumenta el umbral de disfrute, al aumentar la dopamina requerida para sentir placer. 37:00 🧬 La genética y la experiencia previa influyen en el nivel basal de dopamina, que interactúa con la excitación producida por la epinefrina. 42:33 🏃‍♂️ El ejercicio incrementa la dopamina hasta dos veces el nivel basal, pero su impacto varía según el placer subjetivo que se sienta al hacerlo. 46:30 🏋️‍♂️ Ejercicio, estudio, trabajo duro y enfrentar desafíos liberan dopamina de manera subjetiva. 46:59 ☕ La cafeína aumenta la dopamina, pero menos que otras sustancias como chocolate, sexo, nicotina o cocaína. 47:30 🧪 El consumo regular de cafeína aumenta la densidad de receptores de dopamina, mejorando la experiencia de la dopamina. 48:28 🍹 Combinar sustancias o actividades que aumentan la dopamina puede causar problemas con la motivación y energía. 48:54 🏃‍♀️ La búsqueda de picos extremos de dopamina no es la mejor estrategia para motivación y energía sostenibles. 49:24 ☕ Consumir ocasionalmente sustancias para aumentar la dopamina está bien, pero el abuso disminuye la capacidad y motivación. 50:20 🔍 La dopamina impulsa la búsqueda de recursos esenciales como alimento, agua, refugio y conexiones sociales. 50:51 🔀 Dopamina es moneda universal de búsqueda y anhelo, motivando a buscar placeres y evitar malestares. 51:19 🏞️ Las respuestas de dopamina basadas en picos y niveles basales tienen raíces evolutivas en la supervivencia. 52:48 🏞️ El efecto postparto de dopamina ocurre tras un pico, disminuyendo el ánimo y motivación temporalmente. 53:16 💥 La intensidad del descenso de dopamina tras un pico está relacionada con la altura del pico. 53:46 🎉 Actividades emocionantes pueden volverse menos emocionantes al repetirlas debido a la caída de la línea base de dopamina. 54:14 📉 La caída de la línea base de dopamina se relaciona con la depresión posparto y la pérdida de interés en actividades. 54:46 🔄 La caída de la línea base está relacionada con la adicción, donde la búsqueda de recompensas perpetúa la disminución. 55:16 📉 La disminución de la línea base afecta incluso a personas sin adicciones, impactando la motivación y el placer. 55:46 🌊 La interacción de varias actividades que aumentan la dopamina causa una disminución más rápida de la línea base. 56:16 🚀 Mantener un equilibrio entre picos y línea base de dopamina es esencial para mantener la motivación y el bienestar. 56:44 📖 ""Dopamine Nation"" y ""Molecule of More"" son libros que abordan la relación entre picos y línea base de dopamina. 57:11 🤝 La relación entre placer y dolor está influenciada por la dopamina, con un equilibrio dinámico en juego. 57:40 ⚖️ Consumir algo que aumenta la dopamina lleva a una caída posterior, generando el deseo de más. 58:10 📦 El nivel de dopamina listo para liberar afecta el equilibrio entre placer y dolor en el comportamiento. 58:42 🎰 La gestión del placer y el dolor en la relación con la dopamina es esencial para la motivación. 59:13 📣 Depleción del nivel de dopamina disponible después de la liberación causa caída en el ánimo y motivación. 59:45 🌀 La caída en el nivel de dopamina influye en el comportamiento y puede llevar a la adicción. 01:00:17 ⚡ Mantener un equilibrio entre picos y línea base de dopamina es clave para evitar la adicción y la depresión. 01:00:46 🚫 Las adicciones y las caídas en la línea base de dopamina se asocian con la búsqueda excesiva de picos intensos. 01:01:15 💡 Abstenerse o reducir interacciones con actividades que aumentan la dopamina es crucial para recuperar la línea base. 01:02:13 🔄 La recuperación del nivel de dopamina se logra al evitar la estimulación excesiva de la liberación de dopamina. 01:03:11 🔄 Lograr un equilibrio entre picos y línea base de dopamina requiere liberaciones intermitentes de dopamina. 01:03:39 💼 Mantener picos de dopamina sin disminuir la línea base implica no buscar altos niveles de dopamina en cada actividad. 01:09:31 ⚖️ Intermittent reward schedules in relationships, internet, and social media keep motivation high. 01:10:01 🔮 Dopamine reward prediction error drives motivation; it's key for learning and motivation. 01:10:31 🎰 Casino gambling uses intermittent schedules to maintain motivation despite average losses. 01:11:01 🏋️‍♀️ Experiencing huge dopamine peaks in activities can lead to subsequent crashes. 01:11:32 🎶 Layering multiple dopamine-enhancing activities can reduce pleasure over time. 01:12:31 📵 Removing dopamine-enhancing elements occasionally can increase long-term motivation. 01:13:03 💡 Understanding dopamine peaks and baselines empowers implementation of intermittent schedules. 01:13:32 🔀 Flipping a coin to decide whether to use dopamine-enhancing elements balances engagement. 01:14:31 📱 Using smartphones during activities layers in dopamine, potentially reducing long-term pleasure. 01:16:32 🌡️ Cold exposure, such as cold showers, can increase dopamine levels. 01:19:03 🔆 Balanced dopamine peaks and baselines enhance motivation and pleasure. 01:21:01 🚫 Using stimulants (Adderall, Ritalin, etc.) with dopamine activities can undermine long-term motivation. 01:22:59 ☕️ Caffeine (in moderation) can positively impact dopamine receptors and levels. 01:25:58 🤝 Caffeine can increase MDMA toxicity due to shared dopamine pathway effects. 01:29:25 🌊 Cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths, increases dopamine and norepinephrine. 01:30:54 💡 Understanding the benefits and risks of dopamine-rich activities allows for informed engagement. 01:32:49 😲 Exponerse al agua fría causa aumentos inmediatos y grandes de adrenalina y noradrenalina, así como un aumento sostenido en los niveles de dopamina que puede ser hasta 2.5 veces más alto que el nivel base. 01:33:46 🌊 La exposición prolongada al agua fría puede resultar en un aumento prolongado de los niveles de dopamina, lo que podría explicar los efectos mentales y físicos positivos reportados después de este tipo de exposición. 01:34:41 🧘‍♂️ Dos enfoques para enfrentar el frío incómodo son relajarse o aumentar el nivel de activación autónoma interna; ambos pueden resultar en liberación de dopamina. 01:35:37 ❗ Exponerse a agua fría puede elevar la línea de base de la dopamina y mejorar la calma y el enfoque durante un período prolongado después de salir del agua. 01:37:58 🎯 Centrarse solo en la recompensa al final del esfuerzo puede disminuir la percepción de placer durante la actividad en sí; cultivar una mentalidad de crecimiento que encuentre recompensa en el esfuerzo puede mejorar la motivación y el rendimiento. 01:46:38 🍽️ Practicar el ayuno intermitente puede ejercitar la liberación de dopamina relacionada con el esfuerzo y la privación en lugar de la recompensa alimentaria, mejorando así la relación con la gratificación y el placer en el esfuerzo. 01:53:16 🍔 La exposición constante a alimentos altamente sabrosos puede disminuir la satisfacción con alimentos más naturales y menos procesados, lo que sugiere la importancia de mantener un equilibrio en los niveles de dopamina. 01:56:11 🧠 La liberación de dopamina en actividades como la pornografía dificulta alcanzar niveles similares en interacciones posteriores. 01:57:10 🏥 Algunos medicamentos como el bupropión aumentan dopamina y norepinefrina para tratar la depresión sin los efectos secundarios de los inhibidores de la recaptación de serotonina. 01:58:36 💊 Suplementos como la Macuna Pruriens y L-tirosina pueden aumentar temporalmente los niveles de dopamina, pero también llevan a una disminución en el estado de ánimo después. 02:02:31 🍫 La fenetilamina (PEA) en alimentos como el chocolate y compuestos como huperzina A pueden aumentar la liberación de dopamina. 02:07:29 💡 La conexión social y la liberación de oxitocina estimulan directamente la vía dopaminérgica, promoviendo interacciones sociales saludables. 02:12:15 🌟 Controlar los niveles de dopamina es posible mediante herramientas conductuales, farmacológicas y sociales, lo que permite regular el bienestar y la motivación.

How does this affect your personal dopamine levels?",2년 전,0,
@weihyac,"Personal Further Notes (In Progress): 1. The ""experience"" of high dopamine (high motivation, drive or satisfaction) is based on current serum levels relative to recent or baseline serum levels - from low to high feels good, from high to low does not. This effect is shown with acute and prolonged changes in perception of healthy foods, after consumption of hyperpalatable food - your brain neurochemically adjusts to make the healthy food taste less good. It's also shown with pornography use - actual sex, like healthy food, ""tastes less good""; dopamine is linked hugely to sex drive. 2. Feelings of depression or a general low after a high dopamine activity is inherent to large dopamine spikes, and due to an 'overexpenditure' in synaptic release of synthesised and available dopamine. This is why spiking constantly can leave you unmotivated and feeling like shit. 3. Regardless of diversity of dopamine-stimulating activities throughout the week, repeated spiking of serum dopamine results in a lower baseline level. 4. Consistently layering dopamine stimuli eg. music + gym increases the number of conditions required to reattain this dopamine level, decreasing baseline and creating a reliance on the added layers. Anything you enjoy, wish to continue to enjoy, or wish to enjoy more, should not be layered with things like music EVERY time - it will be hard for the first week or so as you overcome your circuitry. This includes stimulants for study - save stimulants for use alongside short term things you don't want to enjoy. 5. Get yourself hooked on things you want to do more eg. gym, by intermittently varying associated dopamine spikes via layering variability and workout type variability etc. - leverage the psychology behind casino/social media addiction. This variability should not be scheduled - flip a coin to make it random. 6. When we receive a reward after an activity, you begin to enjoy the activity less - the cognitive understanding is that you didn't do it for intrinsic enjoyment; you did it for extrinsic reward. Part of this is postponing typical dopamine increases from during the activity to instead occur at its completion only. Moving through friction and hard work without reward creates wiring to enjoy the process itself. Push through effort*, and *effort in all areas of life becomes a powerful dopamine source. Tell yourself you WANT to do it every time you do it. 5. Fasting invokes greater dopamine spikes when you eat due to the deprivation. 6. Confirmation of existing beliefs spikes dopamine - browsing for relatable posts that validate your experiences or opinions can thus be addictive. 7. Social connection via oxytonin pathways evokes dopamine increase - connected to common crash after social events",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@RichardKoops-q3h,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🧠 This podcast discusses dopamine, its role in motivation, desire, and craving, as well as its relation to satisfaction and addiction. 01:25 🌱 Dopamine levels can be influenced by various factors, including food, drugs, caffeine, and plant-based compounds, leading to changes in baseline dopamine and how much we experience from satisfying events. 03:23 🥶 Exposure to cold water can lead to significant increases in dopamine, resulting in improved well-being, cognition, and clarity of mind. 05:16 🏞️ This podcast is dedicated to providing science-based information about dopamine and other related topics to the general public. 10:01 🧪 Dopamine is not just responsible for pleasure but also plays a crucial role in motivation, drive, craving, and time perception. 11:29 🧠 Dopamine's effects are mediated through two main neural pathways: the mesocorticolimbic pathway (for motivation and reward) and the nigrostriatal pathway (for movement). 18:36 🧪 Dopamine can be released locally at synapses between neurons or volumetrically, influencing how our neural circuits work on both a local and broad scale. 21:00 📈 Simply increasing dopamine levels through drugs or supplements may not lead to sustained motivation and pleasure; optimizing the peak-to-baseline ratio is essential for lasting satisfaction. 22:26 🧠 Dopamine works through G protein-coupled receptors, taking longer to affect the brain compared to fast electrical synapses. 23:53 🚀 Dopamine has two pathways for communication: one for movement and one for motivation/craving. It can also have slow and long-lasting effects, even impacting gene expression. 25:21 💡 Dopamine stimulates action and makes neurons more active, increasing alertness and desire to pursue external goals. 26:48 😴 Low dopamine results in lethargy and lack of motivation, while high dopamine leads to excitement, motivation, and drive. 29:44 🔬 Understanding dopamine's schedules and kinetics allows for effective use of dopamine-enhancing tools for optimal motivation and drive. 35:35 💔 A tragic outbreak of symptoms caused by MPTP showed the devastating effects of severely depleted dopamine levels. 36:00 😢 An anecdote about experiencing low dopamine levels due to Thorazine illustrates the profound impact of dopamine on mood and motivation. 40:29 🍫 Chocolate, sex, nicotine, cocaine, and amphetamine increase dopamine levels transiently, with different degrees of intensity. 44:08 🏋️‍♂️ The enjoyment of exercise plays a significant role in the dopamine increase it induces. Practicing appreciation or positive thinking about an activity can boost dopamine response. 46:30 🧠 Dopamine is increased by various activities and substances, including chocolate, sex, nicotine, cocaine, and amphetamine. 46:59 ☕ Caffeine increases dopamine receptor density, enhancing the effects of dopamine. 48:28 ⚠️ Layering multiple dopamine-increasing activities can lead to severe issues with motivation and energy later on. 49:53 📉 Dopamine experiences peaks and baseline levels, with excessive peaks leading to substantial baseline drops. 56:16 💡 Maintaining a healthy dopamine baseline while experiencing intermittent dopamine peaks is essential for sustained motivation and pleasure. 01:06:37 🚫 For those experiencing dopamine depletion due to excessive engagement with dopamine-evoking behaviors or substances, limiting interactions and pursuing a dopamine fast may help replenish the dopamine system. 01:09:01 🎰 Intermittent reward schedules, like those used in casinos and engaging activities, keep people motivated and pursuing. Expecting high dopamine release every time can lead to dissatisfaction. 01:10:01 🚫 Avoid experiencing huge peaks in dopamine too often to maintain motivation. Intermittent reinforcement schedules with varying dopamine levels are more beneficial for long-term enjoyment of activities. 01:15:00 ☎️ Limit smartphone usage during enjoyable activities to prevent dopamine overstimulation and maintain motivation. 01:17:02 🔄 Consistently spiking dopamine through substances like amphetamine, cocaine, or caffeine can hinder neuroplasticity and long-term learning. 01:22:29 ☕ Caffeine in moderation, especially from sources like yerba mate, can increase dopamine receptors and may have neuroprotective effects on dopamine neurons. 01:29:25 🌡️ Cold exposure, such as cold showers or ice baths, can increase dopamine levels and promote feelings of wellbeing. Caution should be exercised to avoid extreme temperatures. 01:32:49 🥶 Cold water exposure triggers a sustained rise in dopamine levels, comparable to cocaine, leading to positive mental and physical effects. 01:34:13 🧘‍♂️ Different approaches to remaining in cold water: relaxing, energizing, or distracting; all can trigger dopamine release. 01:37:29 🥶 Cold water exposure can raise dopamine baseline levels, leading to heightened calm and focus after the experience. 01:41:55 🏆 Focusing solely on external rewards for hard work can undermine dopamine's role in effort and decrease pleasure in the activity itself. 01:45:11 🍽️ Intermittent fasting can help shift dopamine from food reward to effort reward, making activities more enjoyable and motivating. 01:52:47 🧠 The forebrain's rational thought can shape dopamine circuits, reinforcing the reward properties of activities that are beneficial and important to us. 01:53:46 🍬 Prior experiences of high dopamine release can diminish the pleasure from less rewarding activities. Reducing intake of highly palatable foods can reset dopamine responses. 01:55:42 🧠 Intense pornography can negatively impact real-world romantic and sexual interactions due to dopamine's influence on the brain. 01:57:10 💊 Prescription drug Welbutrin (bupropion) increases dopamine and norepinephrine, providing an alternative treatment for depression. 01:59:07 🌿 Macuna Pruriens, a supplement containing l-DOPA, increases dopamine transiently and intensely but can lead to a crash afterward. 02:02:02 💊 L-tyrosine, an amino acid precursor to l-DOPA, can be used to enhance focus and motivation when taken in appropriate doses. 02:08:26 🍫 Chocolate and PEA (phenethylamine) found in some foods can transiently increase synaptic dopamine levels. 02:08:55 🧠 Huperzine A, a nootropic compound, stimulates dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. 02:11:18 🤝 Oxytocin released during social connections stimulates the dopamine pathway, emphasizing the importance of healthy social interactions. 02:14:15 💡 Understanding and controlling dopamine levels can lead to improved overall well-being and mental performance.

@slicksalmon6948,"I am 73-years-old and take physician-prescribed Ritalin for geriatric ADHD.  In this case, it's not a hyper-activity disorder; it's a hypo-activity disorder.  Absent the medication my brain is dead.  No amount of staring at the morning sun or exercise or taking cold showers cures it.  After watching this video, I tried to stop the medication just to see what would happen, and I sank back into dark mental nothingness.  In terms of restoring cognition, Ritalin is an absolute wonder drug.  It gets a bad rap in my opinion.  I can confirm the cyclic nature of the treatment.  A half pill lasts 4 hours.  I rest for 2 hours and then take the other half, giving me another 4 hours.  Then I'm done for the day.  In each case, I can feel it wear off.

@VictoriaLehr,"What stood out to me,  and what I had no clue was dopamine being a connector for Parkinsons and Louis Body Dementia, and the statement ""being treated properly"".  My dad, who turned 80 recently, has Parkinsons and Loius Body Dementia,  and worse yet,  he lives in the shit state of Florida,  where the ""medical care"" is laughable, poor, and careless. And I can tell you,  he has NOT been treated properly.  He is tired all the time, no energy to do anything,  and it takes months between doctors appointments for them to see him, and BARELY do anything. The ""medical"" groups in Fl are sickening. Florida is literally a place for the elderly to go to pass, because the medical field there sure as hell doesn't care or try hard enough to keep people living. It's just more sick corruption of that ""cuntry"" making people pay for insurance,  instead of having Universal Healthcare like most other countries, and it clearly WORKS,  but the states don't want to do that because they want to just steal as much money as they can, making people pay for something that they still have to pay for treatments for what ""insurance doesn't cover"",  and most people STILL can't even afford other treatments.  So in turn, people die. As if it's a punishment for not having enough money to give to the evil, greedy, corrupt government.",2년 전,0,

@noelmorf7619,"Dopamine Regulation         Minimize indulgence in highly pleasurable activities for a period (around a month) to restore normal dopamine levels and reset your baseline dopamine release, essential for motivation and life satisfaction.         Opt for sporadic and unpredictable dopamine releases.             Avoid associating rewarding activities (like listening to music) with tasks you need to accomplish (like gym workouts).             Use random decision-making tools, such as flipping a coin, to decide when to combine enjoyable activities with your tasks. This can help keep the original activity pleasurable.      Specific Activities and Substances         Cold water exposure - Boosts dopamine levels by 2.5 times, and this elevated level can be maintained for hours.         Peak inducers:             Chocolate - Raises dopamine levels by 1.5 times.             Sex - Doubles dopamine levels both during the act and in its pursuit.             Nicotine - 2.5 times dopamine increase.             Cocaine - Also 2.5 times dopamine increase.             Amphetamine - Causes a whopping 10 times dopamine increase.             Exercise - Can double dopamine levels, especially if you subjectively enjoy the exercise.         Coffee, especially when combined with another activity, can make the dopamine release more efficient.         Socializing with others can also stimulate dopamine release.      Psychological Approaches         Perception and Belief:             Information that supports our beliefs about an activity can enhance its pleasure.             Positive thinking and journaling about past or present experiences can stimulate dopamine release.         Learning to Associate Dopamine Release with Effort:             Avoid stimulating dopamine release before and after performing tasks.             Try to condition yourself to derive dopamine release from the effort itself.",2년 전,0,

@Mo-cd3gz,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🧠 This podcast discusses dopamine, its role in motivation, desire, and satisfaction, and dispels common myths about the molecule. 02:24 🌊 Cold water exposure can lead to significant increases in dopamine, which can improve well-being, cognition, and clarity of mind. 09:05 🏫 Rethink Education event will focus on the biology of learning and applications of neuroplasticity in teaching and learning. 13:20 🔗 Dopamine affects two main neural pathways: mesocorticolimbic for motivation and nigrostriatal for movement. 18:06 🧪 Dopamine can be released locally or volumetrically, influencing the baseline to peak ratio, impacting satisfaction and motivation duration. 22:26 🧠 Dopamine works through G protein-coupled receptors, leading to slower effects and multiple cascades of impact, even on gene expression and cell behavior. 26:48 💯 Dopamine is a universal currency in all mammals, especially in humans, for driving motivation, desire, and pursuit of goals. 28:17 📈 Dopamine levels relative to recent experiences dictate motivation and drive. Higher dopamine leads to more motivation, while lower dopamine results in lethargy and lack of drive. 34:37 🌊 Experiencing extremely low dopamine levels can cause profound depression, while increasing dopamine can lead to excitement and motivation. 36:31 🎢 Dopamine and adrenaline (epinephrine) are closely related and work together to make us seek out certain things and increase our energy levels. 41:00 🍫 Chocolate increases dopamine levels 1.5 times above baseline, sex doubles it, nicotine raises it 2.5 times, cocaine raises it 2.5 times, and amphetamine boosts it 10 times. 43:38 🏃 Exercise increases dopamine levels depending on subjective enjoyment. Activities that are more enjoyable lead to a greater dopamine boost. 45:31 🗒️ Engaging with and appreciating an activity can increase dopamine release. Journaling about it or finding aspects to enjoy may enhance the rewarding properties of the activity. 46:30 🧠 Dopamine release varies based on activities and substances, with caffeine having a modest effect compared to others. 47:59 ☕ Regular caffeine intake increases dopamine receptor upregulation, enhancing dopamine effects. 48:28 🚀 Combining substances or behaviors that increase dopamine can create bigger dopamine increases, but excessive dopamine peaks can lead to motivation and energy issues. 49:24 📉 Constantly seeking huge dopamine peaks can lead to severe drops in baseline dopamine, affecting motivation and pleasure. 50:51 🌟 Dopamine is the universal currency for seeking resources and pleasure, but maintaining a balanced dopamine baseline is crucial for sustained motivation. 53:16 🎢 Pursuing activities that lead to large dopamine peaks can result in severe post-activity drops in baseline dopamine, reducing overall pleasure. 55:16 🎭 Engaging in multiple activities that evoke dopamine peaks can lead to a subtle but significant drop in dopamine baseline over time, affecting motivation and interest. 56:44 🔁 Balancing intermittent dopamine release is key to maintaining motivation and pleasure without depleting the dopamine system. 01:06:07 🎮 Taking breaks or reducing engagement with dopamine-evoking activities can help replenish dopamine levels and improve overall well-being. 01:09:01 🎰 Intermittent reward schedules are central to keeping motivation high and avoiding dopamine depletion, as seen in gambling and relationship pursuits. 01:09:31 🧠 Dopamine's role in motivation: Dopamine plays a significant role in motivation, driving us to pursue activities we expect will lead to rewards. It is associated with pleasure and is released when we achieve positive outcomes. 01:10:31 ⏰ Intermittent schedule for dopamine release: Engaging in activities with intermittent dopamine release, where rewards are not predictable, helps maintain motivation and pleasure over time. Avoid excessive peaks in dopamine to sustain enjoyment in these activities. 01:15:28 📱 Digital technology's impact on dopamine: Constantly engaging with smartphones and multitasking can lead to dopamine overstimulation, reducing motivation and pleasure in other activities. Limiting dopamine spikes during activities can enhance long-term enjoyment. 01:20:00 ☕ Yerba mate as a dopamine enhancer: Yerba mate, a caffeine-containing beverage, may be beneficial for dopamine receptors and has potential neuroprotective properties for dopaminergic neurons. 01:21:30 ❌ Avoid excessive dopamine spikes: Frequent use of stimulants like amphetamines, cocaine, and non-prescription ADHD drugs can hinder neuroplasticity, negatively impacting motivation and learning. 01:29:25 🌡️ Cold exposure and dopamine: Cold water exposure, such as cold showers or ice baths, can increase dopamine levels and promote feelings of well-being, though it should be done cautiously to avoid cold water shock. 01:33:19 🧊 Cold water exposure can lead to sustained and significant increases in dopamine levels, comparable to the effects of cocaine. This can explain the positive mental and physical effects reported by individuals after cold water exposure. 01:34:41 🔀 Different approaches to enduring cold discomfort (e.g., relaxation, slow breathing, energization, distraction) do not affect dopamine release; the release persists even after leaving cold water. 01:36:05 💧 Regular cold water exposure can lead to long-lasting increases in dopamine, resulting in heightened levels of calm and focus. 01:37:58 🎗️ Focus on attaching dopamine release to the effort and strain of an activity, rather than just the reward at the end, tofoster growth mindset and make the activity more rewarding. 01:44:17 🍴 Intermittent fasting can be rewarding by attaching dopamine release to the deprivation and effort of fasting, not just the reward of eating. Knowledge and beliefs can shape dopamine responses. 01:49:01 🥓 Eating highly palatable foods can diminish the pleasure derived from less processed, whole foods due to shifts in dopamine responses. 01:56:40 📵 Intense pornography consumption can negatively impact real-world romantic interactions due to the way dopamine responses influence subsequent experiences. 01:57:10 🧠 Prescription drug Welbutrin (bupropion) increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels, providing relief for depression and helping people quit smoking, but it may cause anxiety and appetite changes. 01:58:36 🌱 Non-prescription compounds like Macuna Pruriens (contains l-DOPA) and L-tyrosine can increase dopamine levels, but they may lead to intense transient increases followed by crashes. 02:05:01 ⚠️ Melatonin can decrease dopamine levels, so avoid excessive use if you want to maintain healthy dopamine levels. 02:07:29 💊 Phenethylamine (PEA), Alpha-GPC, and huperzine A are substances that can stimulate dopamine release, but caution should be exercised, and expert advice sought before using them. 02:10:20](https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU?t=2h10m20s) 👫 Engaging in quality social interactions triggers oxytocin release, which in turn stimulates dopamine pathways, emphasizing the importance of healthy social connections.

@hollybigelow5337,"I have been diagnosed with Tics, which is essentially the little brother of Tourette’s. I was also diagnosed with OCD and ADHD. The person who diagnosed me told me it is not uncommon for these three to be diagnosed together and also that it is extremely likely I have at least one relative with at least one of these conditions as well.  Anyway, I have learned that Tics are associated with low dopamine. So is ADHD. And OCD is often associated with unusual swings in dopamine. I personally suspect I also have undiagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder. Back when I was diagnosed, it was believed that you couldn’t have both ASD and ADHD, so they didn’t even check, but it is now known not only that you can have both, but there is even a lot of overlap between the conditions. From what I am learning, ASD is associated with low folate, and folate is needed to create dopamine, so low folate can easily contribute to low dopamine. That’s the neurochemical side. I am still experimenting with finding the right solution, but I am discovering that ensuring my diet has enough folate and magnesium is important. I started using Mucuna Puriens Extract to help with my dopamine, and it helped, but it was too much and caused a ton of intense migraines. I now have been prescribed Modafinil for my sleep problems, which is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and that seems to help more, but good luck finding a doctor that will prescribe it. I do worry long term that I may get used to it and it won’t work, and it still isn’t an automatic cure all, but it does help.  However, specifically for Tourette’s/Tics, another great thing to try is TRE (Trauma Release Exercises). Basically, sometimes why a person experiences something like Tourette’s is because the body has a bunch of stored up trauma, and the Tourette’s is just some of that trauma spilling over. TRE is a great natural way to let it heal it. Or if you prefer, you can also release it through cupping, massage, acupuncture, hypnosis, etc. The quality of practitioners in all of these fields varies greatly, so I recommend trying multiple people to see if they give you any relief. All of these probably partly operate on the dopamine principles presented here.  I know that isn’t a perfect cure, but hopefully that gives you at least one new tool to try.",2년 전,0,
@storeyholcomb7148," @hollybigelow5337  oh I'm not looking to remedy it. Mine is very manageable. I am very fortunate in that my tics are quite specific. They kind of involve my whole upper body, so if I'm doing anything, it kind of prevents the triggers. I feel the urges, but can wait until later in the day when I'm ready to release. When I'm extremely stressed or excited they are harder to control but I don't have a problem with them.   I don't have any comorbidities with it either, so again I've been quite fortunate in that as well. I've also heard that CBT is a great way to treat tics and a lot of other traditional therapeutic techniques can be utilized for Tourettes.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@divinelife5744,"Thanks that is so informative I am Eternally grateful for all the amazing information. I am so Grateful to now know who to manage my Dopamine levels better. What a Beautiful way of life to help us keep te balance.  I started learning more about Dopamine when I learned more about blue lotus.  Blue Lotus contains two major alkaloids within it, Aporphine and Apomorphine. Both compounds are known to have powerful effects on Dopamine receptor sites found within the limbic system of the brain. Working together, these two alkaloids have powerful modulating effects of the dopaminergic system which can often times become damaged due to prolonged use of substances and stimulants such as Opium, Alcohol, Cocaine, Nicotine, and, Amphetamines.  The Alkaloids found within Blue Lotus have been shown to stimulate dopamine production within the dopaminergic system helping to restore normal dopamine levels. At the same time, Aporphine and Apomorphine work as dopamine receptor antagonists and agonists, binding with dopamine receptors to modulate their expression and then influence neurons to increase the amount of dopamine receptor sites found at the synapse so that the body can receive and interact with its own endogenous dopamine supply. This means that the brain will now be more sensitive and aware of its internal production and release of dopamine, gently influencing the individual to seek external stimulants less and less. The alkaloid effect of Blue Lotus lasts in the body for roughly 90 minutes. These alkaloids are excreted via the urinary system leaving the brain cleansed and replenished so that the individual has reduced their desire for external stimulants. The body can now produce its own dopamine more easily, reward itself, modulate mood, behavior, and cravings for addictive substances.",2년 전,0,
@franciscomsosa,"If your threshold for enjoyment goes up as a result of engagement with activities you enjoy, does that also mean then that valuing effort over outcome (around 1:39:52) will reach a threshold of enjoyment?

Sometimes you have more motivation, so ride that dopamine wave. Sometimes your threshold is up, so don't push yourself as much. You can use supplements for ""riding"" the motivation wave, but when the enjoyment is done, don't push yourself further, the ""crash"" must ensue for the enjoyment to be restored.

Perform every action with your heart fixed on the Supreme Lord. Renounce attachment to the fruits. Be even-tempered in success and failure: for it is this evenness of temper that is meant by yoga.

Still, there are not many who would even care to do something like this, many professors and researchers couldn’t care more about peer acknowledgement and such. Public education is not seen as valuable for your own academic career, it’s for the elite.   Then there are these people who truly care and do it well. Because most researchers wouldn’t be able to present this good and with examples, etc. it would be boring.

We re getting our advice from drug addicts, essentially the advice we get is from junkies. All the researchers that study caffeine are addicts as well. Reality is that caffeine depletes your reserve energy, it trashes you out over time. And like every drug many people can´t control the use, they overuse it, like myself. And high dose caffeine use is certainly not healthy, it leads to all kinds of bad other behaviours. You get nervous, tired, anxious, eat a lot of junkfood and have a big crash afterwards. Basicly you feel like shit because you have 0,5g till 1g of caffeine per day. And you can´t control it longterm, because it is an addictive drug. And many people cant control there use of addictive drugs. So just quit the nonsense and get control over your life by becoming a non user of caffeine.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Confusing.  How much does sex increase dopamine? My best guess is that it is 100 % above baseline meaning sex doubles dopamine levels, and it is merely a difference in the usage of English that perplexes me.",2년 전,0,

@PombaAbusada,"Focus on the progress/activity itself. What do I like about exercise/studying/working, not the end goal!  Indulging in pleasurable activities will raise dopamine but then, it will cause a drop that goes below the baseline and it takes a while for it to go back to the normal baseline  Intermittent schedules of dopamine release:  . in order to keep baseline, when Indulging in pleasurable activities don't always search the highest pleasure. Sometimes no pleasure, sometimes a bit of pleasure and sometimes a little more (extremely high levels of dopamine will always cause the decrease in baseline that will take some time to recover)  . If activity is very pleasurable, make sure it doesn't happen often . If an activity happens often, make sure to implement intermittent schedules of dopamine  Don't reward yourself for a hard task, yet just appreciate the journey and the effort. The reward increases dopamine further, which makes the effort feel less pleasurable in comparison, and will deter you from pursuing those good activities in the future",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@StuartLoria,"Journaling, coffee, exercise and chocolate sound doable and easy. Not using music to workout is out of the question, that is the kind of thing that makes you stop. Extreme cold water shows great promise but sounds dangerous unless guided. The last part about rationing dopamine is confusing but I take it that the key is not to saturate it, to be effective you have to gauge it yourself, too much rationing and you are back to inaction, too little and you may develop a increasing dependency. With consistency, hard activities will become pleasant, if you convince yourself that you are making progress, due to the slow and constant release of dopamine while performing the action. Doctors talk remind me of Penelope, they weave and unweave ideas, but I appreciate the free content Dr. Huberman.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@RumstedRanger,"Personal notes:  Do not pleasure stack ex;  - workout + music and/or phone  - Substances + socializing or engaging in editing activities - You can use techniques like flipping a coin to decide if you mix pleasures or not. Avoid mixing automatically multiple times. This causes dopamine loss  Avoid having an automatic dopamine schedule ex;  - Gaming, substances, exiting activities, etc at the same time each day can cause lower dopamine and less enjoyment for activity  - Practice delayed gratification by refusing to reward yourself right after a task. Instant reward is counterproductive long term  - Overtime with delayed gratification your brain will release dopamine during a higher effort task. This then makes you enjoy the task more  -To better achieve this, when you find yourself in a high friction task like studying for example, tell yourself “I am doing this by choice and I love doing it.” -Do not spike dopamine prior, or after a task. Learn to receive it from the effort.   -Intermittent fasting potentially can be a great way to gradually increase dopamine, create a better headspace for hard work, and is a very healthy habit overall biologically.  -Pornography and sex reacts with dopamine the same as a savory food and really savory food. This means that regular pornography use has the potential to cause one to become less exited at the idea of sex, and favor more exiting pornography. If abused, this obviously can effect one’s love life, and sexual health.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

One thing is that it messes with your Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors. Which interferes with rest and digest functions. The other is that it plays a role in this D2 receptor. Which is why I experience a variability in Dopamine the next day. I was also diagnosed ADD back before it was ADHD, and that hasn’t changed.   Subjectively, it seems to help with managing myself. Espescially if I have caffeine, which sort turns me into a ball of living anxiety normally. And makes me have to piss every 15 minutes.",2년 전,0,

@sheenaantonios7445,"Hey Huberman ! I have a question about dopamine levels. I've been using your tactics for attempting to improve my dopamine management and my general happiness and concentration. I have ADHD and suffer from depression (unmedicated) so my behavioural habits are very important to my daily well-being. Learning from your podcasts I have started:  - Skipping caffeine until 90minutes after waking (for me this means AFTER my morning workout now) - Workout AM (weight training: cardio 2:1) - Sauna 15 minutes 3-4 mornings a week. - Cold shower 30 seconds after sauna and heat up naturally - intermittent fast until lunch other than black coffee (usually 16:8 fasting:feeding) - High protein diet   I notice major improvements when i stick to this routine. However, last week I was sick and I found I immediately fell into some pretty low lows when I was unable to stick to my routine (particularly: no gym, no sauna, no cold shower). My question is: was this related to me having my spiking my dopamine too much with these habits? That then when I wasn't able to participate in these activities i fell into a deficiency? I was surprised how quickly I felt shitty when I lost these habits. For reference I have always been active but only been participating in this more strict routine for 1year.",2년 전,0,

Please, go on, and perhaps do another one just like this one, so comprehensive, but about serotonin.  Please explain how the brain replenished serotonin in contrast to dopamine, and if there is any mutually inclusive pharmacokinetics / interactions (or time-dependent variables), that would cause one to be the limiting factor (or the catalyzer) for the replenishment of the other.   Great stuff.  Make a series out of these.   1:08:51",2년 전,0,

But since you said they are available I thought I would check into it. I absolutely want to slam Walgreens over this. But maybe you can talk about these supplements and get a sponsorship from Walgreens or another provider of supplements for dopamine. I won’t give you all any money, but, I will make suggestions. I hope you have a very nice litter of children. I’m putting it like that because that’s pretty much what it sounded like to me. Absolutely some women have a large number of children, but, even natural childbirth is going to wear down their bodies. Imagine if a caesarean is necessary even just twice. A shorter woman would be better as I understand childbirth’s labor goes easier for them. It makes sense to me. Don’t be mad.",2년 전,0,

@cindybishop405,"Dr. Huberman, first I want to say how much I enjoy your podcasts, even though I don't understand or retain very much, I can watch the pod several times until some of it sinks in, and that is what I have to do at the age of 63, but am really glad I have that option!        Second, I have ordered my magnesium pills, (or what ever the are called) and am trying to fidget more in an effort to lose weight, stay fit and remain active, a few things I gathered from watching, I have been wondering which pod would be most helpful pod for me at this age?        But mostly, I am interested in a comment on one of your pods about an experiment done in late 1950's or 1960's, which would not be allowed to be done now. I have looked for more information on that experiment,  it was about the button the participants pushed,  and the button they chose the most was agitation?  Agitation over joy, or love or anything.  That seriously interests me, because sometimes when I get up in the morning, I have a really irritated attitude, and I wonder if I am choosing that because of this very thing, because I like to feel irritated, and it is a choice I am making subconsciously.  Just being aware, or even wondering about that as a choice I am making, causes me to snap out of it, and adjust my attitude and encourages me to find the things to be grateful for, or to choose a more congenial mental state, even if I have to fake it at first.  I guess I am curious if that could be related to that same line of choosing, because being agitated feels better?  Why would it?  I might have got it all wrong, so straighten me out if I did please.  A pod on being mindful about how we can choose how we feel and how we can consciously make a specific choice, and the science behind why that could work, so as to make our lives better, could that really be a thing and something worth visiting in a podcast?  Maybe you already did address this, let me know which one to watch if you did.  Thanks and excuse my hideous grammar.",2년 전,1,

@creativecraving,"I'm grateful that you chose to share this information with the public. Thank you! I've learned a lot of bits and pieces from this discussion. Unfortunately, I found it very hard to follow. With a better narrative structure, I (a software engineer) could learn more.  By contrast, your presentation on your interview with Jordan Peterson was very coherent and digestible. It had a plot line, even though it veered chaotically from one  topic to another --- and often without your control.  Maybe you could interview yourself: start with an interesting question and try to 1) give a succinct and complete answer and 2) ask an interesting follow up question on behalf of the audience, then 3) repeat.  Once you exhaust one question, ""call back"" to a previous discussion and ask a different question about it.  Pretend your audience is slightly smarter than you, but lack knowledge about the topic at hand. How would you communicate?  That could force you to break down the topic into smaller bites, and also give the audience a sense of progression. (I can't help wonder about dopaminergic releases here.)  Depth-first is much easier to follow than breadth first. It's like the difference between watching five episodes of TV in series vs watching 5 at the same time. Cover each topic in an order, and call back to previously discussed topics as needed.  Those were my best guesses as to how to fix it. Next, here's what I think the problem is, and if you agree it's a problem, maybe you'll have an even better solution.  As is, I found it hard to follow, and not because I don't love technical details. First, it felt like you spent 5-10 minutes giving a summary.That wastes time, since a summery isn't designed to communicate information; it only communicates intent. We have decided your intent (and ours) within 30 seconds or so of the video starting.  In fact, the entire discussion so far (first half of the video) is a survey of different ideas rather than being focused on one idea at a time. It has a very slow sense of progress towards no obvious, singular goal while jumping around between unconnected ideas.  I can't connect the dots as quickly as you change topics, and by the time you return to a topic,  we've discussed several other topics, so I don't remember anything about it and I'm unable to synthesize the facts presented into a coherent whole (to get the gist) or to follow a chain of reasoning about the few facts I managed to remember. Again, that's more tolerable in written or classroom communication.",2년 전(수정됨),1,

@lynnjacinto-bq2mz,"Mr. Huberman, I feel I need to speak out.  I find my kids and myself have been victimized in the drop of the baseline in dopamine.  What I mean is prior to this comment I was expressing how my dopamine levels increases with the success of raising my kids and having the communication level as effective and encouraging them to pursue there levels of education.  They are very excited and I assume nervous.  Who isn't Covid had us all scared out of our minds.  I just read a chapter in ""Carvaggio"" by Andrew Graham Dixon - funny.  Not to deter from our dopamine levels but there is chapter that brought me back to Covid.  What I love about it is the way he uses different words that expressed the time this author wants the readers to be in.  So I get it.  I find my dopamine levels have stagnant or no increase because I worry about my kids a lot.  I find there tool box may not have the suffice tools to survive in small and big events.  How do you express that to someone who took on a responsibility and may have cost  her life?  Can you imagine?  Can you?  So what I am saying is I love listening to you when you have knowledge that I can pass to my kids so I don't sound completely uneducated, however have the door open for more education.  My daughter is a PAL recipient and I feel all kids should have that kind of support, but not to build PTSD, but to be the wise brain and have them situated in a safe environment because as adults we know the ratio of something is going to happen is high.  As law enforcement they know that, they stay inside too.  So how does my dopamine level fit in the example of what I am going through.  I've notice a low level and find that I have been sleeping a lot more then usual and I eat unhealthy.  Can there be a fix for it?  Or do I go home and fixate a reality because I was not fully the cause but am looking for ultimate solution.  What I mean is what if it caused a life?  What if it caused a broken spirit?  Worst what if it caused nothing and I made everyone else trip out?  I like that one if I had to choose.  So, I last commented about the pipe store.  In result I stood in front of the last pipe store and asked the associate ""Is it true that this is the last pipe store they are going to open?""  I felt so much gratification in doing that.  Only because its like candy land.  Like wft.  Pardon me.  After I felt low because down the street is another pipe store closed early and the chances of the gun store next store door may have gotten robbed.  A lot going on.  Where am I in the equation?  This information hasn't even been public.  So I don't know the real answer, but that is how my brain is especially with my background.  So through life experience and through life terms I ask is it wrong to have simple rules like ""no one under 35, no women and no older people.""  I prefer to be arrested but for as long as I've known that is the way its always been.  So please comment if I am in the wrong.  I know I have to go home, but I am afraid they may angry because of here say.  My name is Lynn Marie Jacinto a US Marine vet, a single mom, an ex meth user - programmed, educated and still learning the cause and effects, graduated and continues to strive with love, peace and harmony -  a convicted felon - paid restitution, did my time and volunteered as a Cal Fire Wildland Fire Fighter and above all else loves God.

Heard things about cocaine and coffee but there has been a huge increase in the amount of people smoking marijuana (myself included) and I am almost certain that it has very debilitating effects down the line if not moderated. This is especially paired with the fact that marijuana is not considered to be necessarily ""bad"" by the general public.  I can't stress this enough...marijuana and dopamine surges WILL lead to you being (possibly deeply) unhappy if they are not moderated. This is so crucial. Please use weed with caution.",2년 전,0,

@jreinanutshell,"Hello Andrew. First I wanna thank you for this podcast. YOU ARE THE MAN!!! You probably cannot fathom the importance of your work here and level of gratitud that me, and probably many people, have for basically opening an online Biology class 🙏🏾. I have a small question though (even though you manage to dive deep into the subject, my questioning brain always find a back door), I just finished this video and I’m already starting to be aware of the dopamine hits regarding external factors (just got a package I’ve been looking very much forward to and immediately felt the surge). So my question is: does it have any effect when I “tease” my dopamine level? In the sense of, I left the package in the living room and went to walk the dog instead of opening it instantly (I’m even writing this before opening it, since the question came up to my mind), and I’m feeling the excitement build up and up. Is this a good thing or should I just “open the gates” and let the dopamine flow instantly? Seems to me that if I tease it and elevate it, the crash might be worse then, right? Sorry those were 3 questions.  Thanks again for everything ❤ keep it up please 🙏🏾",2년 전,0,

I've learned so much.Thank you! --- A question about the evolutionary aspect of our brain having developed the capacity for that dynamic range of high/low dopamine: Prof. Huberman says that, let's say, 500 yrs ago, dopamine helped us be motivated to leave the cave and go hunt/forage. After getting the deer there's probably a high in dopamine levels. And if I understand him correctly, he states that then the falling below baseline of dopamine is necessary as one cannot stay on that high.....and the deer (or whatever ) has to be brought back to the cave....Wouldn't dopamine have to stay high to motivate us to bring that deer across miles of forest? I feel that I am misunderstanding/or missing something here, and I'd be glad for some clarification.",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@nasherbuenafe253,That’s why one must be aware not to develop dependency. Generate equanimity rather than avoid or crave an experience. Then you become master of your mind of your dopamine will be leveled out and even if you experience a high and a low your subconcious knows it’s not permanent and you have equnimity then you won’t experience much crazy excitement and crazy low. You are just balance,2년 전,0,

@FR_567,"Abstain from dopamine releasing activities for a month to bring your dopamine levels back to normal.  Instead of telling yourself that you're doing this task for a reward later (studying now for the result later), shift your mindset to the effort/task you're doing right now is the reward itself. E.g. even if you don't like studying, sit down & force urself to study and tell urself that u enjoy studying and ur putting in this effort out of choice as it is rewarding.  Eventually you will get dopamine release from studying itself and not the reward (the grade) that comes later. So the effort/process becomes rewarding rather than the end goal/result.  Dont mix dopamine releasing activities with tasks you wish to do. E.g. listening to music while working out. Listening to music spikes ur dopamine. Hence your dopamine levels get affected by it.  If u have a big dopamine release prior to a task, it makes that task more difficult as ur mind wants the same level or more dopamine release again.. e.g. u had fast food that u rlly enjoyed and now its time to study..u wont feel like studying as there wont be the drive to do so bcz of the dopamine released prior from eating (bcz studying is not as pleasurable/releases less dopamine). Hence avoid indulging in dopamine releasing activities before an important task  Take cold showers. It increases dopamine 2.5× in a sustained manner meaning your dopamine levels don't come crashing down instantly after the activity is done. It is a positive way to increase dopamine with short and long term benefits.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

I am living with Narcolepsy with cataplexy and am trying to optimize my life but struggle due to my excessive daytime sleepiness and inability to get a restful nights sleep despite a pristine sleep routine. Every episode on health mentions the importance of sleep, which quite honestly makes me feel that my health is doomed regardless of what I do..   Any thoughts on having a podcast episode on Narcolepsy?? Debunking the mainstream media’s portrayal (although Mr Bean IS objectively funny) and possibly getting into non medication based treatment?

I had 0 motivation or will to do something else than scrolling on my phone/playing games.  So i ""cut"" every social media/tiktok (from 5h/day to 30min/day), and i completely cut gaming, i'm trying to get back to my sport routine, i'm meditating, reading books, working for school. I started to feel motivated on the first days of my dopa detox and everything was going well.  But now for like 4 days i'm felling anxious/depressed and i can't sleep at night, i have troubles to fall asleep and i wake up every hour. I don't know if it has something to do with my dopamine detox. Because apparently when you cut high dopamine activities your baseline dopamine goes up so i'm not supposed to feel like this right?

Tonic Phases: Baseline Level Phasic Phases: Peaks  Dopamine is a Neuromodulator ( Neurotransmitters are involved in dialogues between neurons, whereas Neuromodulators are involved in influencing the coordination of many neural circuits ). So dopamine is directly responsible for activity and inactivity of a bunch of neural circuits.   Dopamine is directly responsible for Pleasure, Motivation, Drive, Craving and Time Perception. Dopamine is important for movement. For context, people with Parkinson's have some part of their brains with depletion and death of dopamine neurons.

For example, I pushed my run, workout and cold plunge to limits and which kept me wired for the whole day, 12 hours, but then crashed hard the following day. Does this make sense? I rested for an additional day and trying to rehydrate. What would have happened on dopamine levels in this case?",2년 전,0,

@n7u6ero3,"Andrew Huberman  ______________________ Controlling your dopamine for motivation, focus & satisfaction.   What is dopamine   There’s no such thing as dopamine hits. There’s a baseline of dopamine. Meaning amount of dopamine circulating in your brain and body.  Dopamine is important for how you feel. Good mood, motivation, drive, excitement, pleasure, focus etc.  When you experience or crave something very pleasurable, desirable, excitable, your dopamine peaks, and when you stop doing that, your dopamine drops below baseline and you’re in bad mood  Dopamine drops below baseline symmetrically to how much it peaked because there is not a lot of dopamine around, since it was used when it peaked  These peaks influence how much dopamine will be circulating afterwards.  In neuroscience literature there are two types of dopamine release, tonic and phasic. Tonic: the low level baseline that’s always there being released and circulating  Phasic: peaks that ride above the baseline  You’ll feel extreme, unimaginable sadness if you get dopamine receptors removed or blocked. like Andrew once got them blocked when he got thorazine shot.   Why dopamine is important   Our level of dopamine is the primary determinant of how motivated and excited we are, also our drive, craving and time perception.  Dopamine is important for movement.  Dopamine is important for moving us towards our goals and how much we remember enjoying our past experiences. It’s primarily determinant of our quality of life and happiness.  Dopamine is super important molecule in our body. It makes life worth living   Facts about dopamine   Dopamine has close friends in nervous system. Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the main driver of energy. We can’t do ANYTHING without it.   Adrenaline is made from dopamine.  Chocolate increases dopamine baseline level 1.5 times. Pursuit and act of s*x - 2x Nicotine - 2.5x Cocaine - 2.5x Amphetamine - 10x ^the are very short lived, these dopamine peaks last for few minutes or seconds. Then your dopamine level will drop below baseline and you’ll feel sad. If you like exercise, it will increase dopamine by 2x. If you don’t, it’ll little bit or not at all  If you like doing something, even talking about pen you love, it’ll increase your dopamine.  Lying to yourself about you loving doing something won’t work.   Why do we have dopamine?   Dopamine is universal currency of forging and seeking. Meaning seeking things that will provide sustenance and pleasure in the short term (food, water) and will extend our species in the long term   Once our ancestors hunted animal, they’d get dopamine peak. However after it dropped, they’d go out and hunt again. This is the way our nature is set up for human survival.  Having high level of dopamine baseline is what drove evolution of our species    Don’ts about dopamine   Don’t combine pleasurable things with unenjoyable activities. e.g. Gym + music or coffee. That way you are making it harder to enjoy gym  Be careful to how much and how often you get peaked dopamine so that you don’t get addicted.  Don’t use stimulants for doing activities (for example motivational videos/energy drink for studying or workout) each time you do, you will need more and more of that stimulant to do that activity in the future.  Caffeine can boost dopamine. We don’t have enough studies, but it can be dangerous as well.  Avoid all sorts of drugs, stay natural   How to increase dopamine   The real key to increasing dopamine baseline without dropping afterwards is not chasing or expecting it  If you want to maintain motivation for school, exercise, relationship, the key is not experience dopamine peaks regularly (quit those bad activities)  Understand that your ability to experience motivation and pleasure for what comes next is dictated by how much motivation and pleasure and dopamine you experienced prior  Dopamine controls our time perception. If you do something for sake of reward, your brain won’t release dopamine during the process.  Adapt a growth mindset: your goal must be not results/reward, but the process, effort, striving itself. Tell yourself, this effort is great, pleasureful, even if it’s painful.  Never tell yourself “I’m gonna push myself today” because your brain will focus on end goal.  The longer you deprive yourself from something, the better it feels (more dopamine will be released)    Increasing dopamine with intermittent fasting   One of the great ways to increase dopamine is by intermittent fasting.    One of the reasons it works is because we are aware and keep reminding ourselves that “oh I’ve been fasting for 12 hours I’ll have high dopamine”  Telling yourself that certain behavior is good for you will increase dopamine.  Study showed that hearing something that reinforces one’s prior behavior, can evoke dopamine and the word for release.   Being exposed to cold to increase dopamine   One of the super effective ways to increase dopamine baseline is taking cold showers, popularized by Wim Hof.  Research: 3 humans were exposed to warm, moderate and cold water. Person who took cold water increased his adrenaline, and dopamine by 250% above baseline and it was sustained for 3 hours. People use this “cold water therapy” for Metabolism, fat loss, well being, To improve cognition, and clarity of mind  Don’t force it to not to get hypothermia. It’s also better to take it in the morning or afternoon, not before sleep.  When getting exposed to cold water, once it gets comfortable, you no longer release dopamine.",2년 전,1,

@stochas_ic,"For my own reference- 10:15 Tonic & Phasic dopamine. Tonic = baseline dopamine that's always circulating in your brain. Phasic = peaks of dopamine from reward. 12:09 Difference b/w someone with endless drive & someone who has given up and has no drive = Tonic dopamine. 12:42 Dopamine is a Neuro-modulator not a Neuro-transmitter. Neuro-modulators affect the system as a whole Vs. Neuro-transmitters affect local neurons. 13:18 Dopamine controls the probability that certain neural-circuits will be active and other circuits will be inactive. 13:30 Controls our levels of Energy, mindset, drive, craving, mood & motivation, Time-perception. 13:59 Time perception. Importance of accessing/controlling dopamine at different time-scales to sustain your drive/effort. 14:29 Dopamine & movement. Parkinsons - depletion/death of dopamine neurons in certain areas of brain that causes shaky movement, challenges in initiating movement & speech, depression. 17:45 Two main circuits/pathways for dopamine in brain - Movement and (Reward, reinforcement, motivation). 20:23 Drugs & supplements that increase dopamine will make it harder for you to sustain dopamine release over the long term. 18:14 Local Vs. Broad release of dopamine. (Synaptic Vs. Volumetric release. Tonic Vs. Phasic.) 20:52 Level of satisfaction from a behavior depends upon the ""difference"" of baseline and peak. It depends on the height of the peak relative to the baseline. 24:33 Two pathways- Movement Vs. (Reward, reinforcement, motivation). Two spatial scales of release in brain - Synaptic Vs. Volumetric. Temporal scales of release - Slow Vs. Very long-term effects to the point at which it can even control gene expression. 25:07 Dopamine is excitatory because of Glutamate. It's addictive. Tells the brain, ""this feels good, I want more"". Whereas inhibitory neuro-transmitters (Serotonin) aren't addictive. They tell the brain, ""this feels good, I've had enough."" 25:37 Dopamine stimulates action because  37:35 Dopamine is the parent of Adrenaline.  39:17 Dopamine is about pleasure. Adrenaline is about energy. Adrenaline alone causes anxiety, fear etc. Add dopamine to the mix and you get pleasureful attentiveness. 41:32 Chocolate - 1.5x dopamine increase above baseline. Short-lasting (only few minutes.) 41:57 Sex(pursuit & act itself) - 2.0x dopamine increase. 42:37 Smoked Nicotine - 2.5x above baseline. Short-lasting(few minutes.) 43:08 Cocaine - 2.5x above baseline. 43:16 Amphetamine - 10x above baseline. 43:30 Exercise - 2x above baseline. 44:01 Assigning self-made subjective meaning to an activity to increase dopamine derived from it.  45:20 Self-deluding through Journaling or repetition about aspects you enjoy about the activity. ********************************************* How ? = 1:50:51 49:13 Layering/Stacking dopaminergic activities simultaneously is not good for you in the long term. 50:02 Leveraging Tonic & Phasic dopamine. 1:01:15 Addiction is the progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. All other activities will seem dull to the detriment of your executive function.  1:01:44 After a while even the addictive activity will stop engaging you. It's like a lowering sine wave after each cycle. The baseline keeps getting lower & lower. Ultimately leads to severe depression. 1:03:21 Burnout = progressive lowering of dopamine baseline through repeatedly engaging in stimulating activities without letting the system reset. Once a certain threshold is crossed, you slip into depression. 1:05:45 How to let the system reset = dopamine fast. (Not engaging in these dopaminergic activities) 1:08:45 Key to sustained drive/effort = intermittent release of dopamine. 1:12:35 Key (technical) = Frequency & Variability of peaks. Unpredictability. 1:21:30 Stacking dopamine only on hard days. To remain consistent. Cold Showers/submersion. 1:44:00 Not layering dopamine but to subjectively start to attach (internally generated)dopamine to the feeling of friction/effort.************************************* 1:44:40 The Mesolimbic reward pathway of dopamine includes also the forebrain(prefrontal cortex). So you can really subjectively delude yourself through thinking, that the effort part is the good part. (Reminded of Kobe Bryant's ""Those times speech"") 1:47:06 ""The ability to access pleasure from effort"" - most powerful aspect of dopaminergic pathways. How ? = 1:50:51 1:47:31 Don't spike dopamine before of after the activity/process. Learn to spike dopamine from the activity/effort itself. How ? = 1:50:51 1:52:05 Using already existing knowledge in your brain to self-delude yourself into loving the activity. 1:53:17 Hearing/reading something that reinforces someone's prior beliefs also releases dopamine. ************************** This is why reading books is addictive. 2:10:12 Oxytocin/social bonding/validation directly stimulate the dopamine pathways.

I have heard of other situations where that can be a bad thing. For instance, pitocin, the synthetic version of oxytocin, also has the effect of creating more oxytocin receptors in the uterus. This actually makes it harder for a woman to go into labor naturally after previously having an induction, because her body will not produce enough of her own oxytocin to fill all those extra receptors and trip the cascade of hormones necessary for labor. I wonder if having more domapine receptors requires us to pursue higher dopamine activities in order to fill the extra receptors and feel the effect, leading to lower mood on a regular basis if one is not a natural thrill seeker. I know that when I gave up coffee my baseline dopamine improved drastically, after a few months.",2년 전,0,
@alianak9,"I find the section on ""Tuning Your Dopamine for Ongoing Motivation"" mind-blowing and something that could be revolutionary in my line of work. I am a dog trainer and work specifically with working breeds such as German Shepherds & Malinois. Currently our industry relies heavily on the reward based system and our dogs are essentially being ""bribed"" with either a toy, food or sleeve (in the case of protection work) to get them to work for us, ie. they are working so they can get their toy and not because they find the work intrinsically rewarding.  But if I can find a way to make the dog enjoy the work  because the work in and of itself IS the reward, this can change EVERYTHING and literally revolutionize dog training...or rather evolutionize it. 🙂Not only will we not need rewards, but also, we won't need as much compulsion/force because the dog already enjoys his job.

@laurawells1711," @abhishek-jf6zl  hey. I don’t mind sharing at all.  Basically someone at my job tricked me into doing fentanyl (shocker, I’m from America) by offering me a less addictive drug that was laced with the hard stuff and then they slowly gave me small amounts of this laced substance until I became properly addicted. It only took 2 weeks. I tried to stop after I got sick for the first time and I confronted her. she tried to act like she had told me there was fentanyl in what I was doing which was a bold faced lie bevause I would never have knowingly agreed to doing something that was stronger than heroin, something I have also never done. She clearly was either a sociopath or was so deep in her own addiction that she saw no  harm in what she had done. Either way I tried to stop and finally realized that I couldn’t and kind of gave into the addiction. It was adding some positives to my life at first and I was having few adverse effects so I deluded myself into thinking I could manage my consumption. Which is stupid because the words “fentanyl” and “manage” can only be spoken in the same sentence by a drug addict. So yeah I basically went from drinking a few times a week and indulging in some party drugs on ocasional nights out but never to excess to having a full blown fentanyl addiction at the age of 25. I never thought it would happen to me, but now looking back I’m not surprised that it did. The drug market in the United States has been saturated with fentanyl as of a few years ago. Almost 100% of the worlds fentanyl supply is smuggled into the US for consumption. This poison is literally in everything. In the US there has historically been a somewhat permissive culture of drug experimentation with young adults in their 20s. I’m from Southern California and casual drug use among young people is seen as a phase many of us go through until we settle down and take on more responsibility. Up until fentanyl flooded the drug supply here people used to believe that as long as they didn’t touch heroin, meth, or crack that they could make it thru this phase in their life relatively unharmed. But I think the youth of our generation no longer have that luxury. There are simply too many addictive pharmaceutical drugs out there now that can kill you, and most traditional party drugs are laced with fentanyl. It’s so bad in the US that every person I know under 30 has Narcan on them when they go out or stored in their own house. We are not living in our parents generation anymore that’s for sure.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

And when we do something that gives us an incredible  high atm, we drop to or below baseline for the individual no? Not only that, with the idea of saying dopamine is a currency, one can say you want to use this currency correctly to keep that motivation of individual high or at least rase their baseline. So I take it doing things going to the gym, reading a book,  practicing a new skill, will increase your overall baseline the more of a habit you create with such thing.

@Heck-ed6sr,"----- Summary ------  Dopamine introduction: ⇒ Dopamine is a chemical/molecule in the body released by certain neurons. It is the molecule responsible for movement, mood         and motivation. Having more of it makes you feel better/more pleasurable. It is a universal currency, different activities use the       same dopamine system for reward. ⇒ Dopamine is also linked to energy as it is a close relative of adrenaline, peaks in dopamine also leads to peaks in adrenaline       since adrenaline can be manufactured from dopamine. The release of adrenaline release wakes up neural circuits of the brain       and body and give us readiness. Adrenaline alone can be fear/mental paralysis/trauma, but dopamine colours the experience       and when paired with adrenaline, becomes excitement. ⇒ Dopamine stimulates action in general because the neurons that release dopamine co-release glutamate, which is an excitatory       neurotransmitter that makes neurons electrically active. This increases the level of alertness/readiness and desire to pursue       things outside the confines of the body. ⇒ Dopamine has 2 pathways to communicate - 1 for movement, the other for motivation and craving. ⇒ Dopamine can be released globally (volumetric release - increase dopamine baseline) or locally (synaptic release - result in       dopamine peaks) from vesicles that contain dopamine.  What are dopamine peaks and baseline? ⇒ Baseline - The dopamine baseline is the amount of dopamine released and circulating in your entire body all the time/by default.       It is like the steady/prolonged level of dopamine in the body.       → A small drop in baseline dopamine levels may not be noticeable, but when it falls below a certain threshold, a drop in            motivation or drive can be felt.      → Everyone has a certain baseline level of dopamine, some of this is genetic. People with higher dopamine baselines are more             excited and motivated in general, while people with lower dopamine baselines are more lethargic in general. ⇒ Peaks - Dopamine peaks are the temporal increases in dopamine levels when you do something you enjoy. Peaks in dopamine       usually fall back to slightly lower than baseline and decrease baseline dopamine after the peak. The bigger the peak the greater       the fall. This causes you to feel down after experiencing something very enjoyable.      → How enjoyable something feels is related to how high the dopamine peak is above the baseline and also how high the peak is            compared to recent peaks.      → When dopamine peaks are too high/frequent, it depletes the readily releasable pool of dopamine (vesicles do not have            dopamine to release) and causes the dopamine baseline to be lowered.  Practical Uses: ⇒ Increase dopamine released from a particular activity/prevent decrease of dopamine released from a particular activity:       1. Practice journaling or appreciation of the activity. Encouraging oneself to think positively about an activity has a profound            impact on its rewarding properties. Knowledge of the benefits of what you are doing and focusing on it also helps with            releasing dopamine from the activity. Vice-versa.            (This is possible because of the mesolymbic pathway of dopamine that involves the pre-frontal cortex)           For example, try to attach the feeling of friction and effort to an internally generated reward system. Tell yourself the effort part            is the good part. Tell yourself this is very painful, and because it's painful, it will increase dopamine later, but in that moment,            you are doing it by choice and because you love it.      2. Take caffeine prior to performing the activity. Caffeine alone (an exception to dopamine layering) upregulates dopamine            receptors and allows you to experience the effects of dopamine more.            Coffee/Tea/Yerba Mate is recommended, Yerba Mate has the additional benefit of protecting dopaminergic neurons.      3. Avoid layering activities that release dopamine. This increases the number of conditions required for the activity to be            pleasurable and causes the activity to feel less pleasurable alone. For example, stop using the phone to browse social media            during other activities like working out.      4. Do not spike dopamine prior to, or after the activity by trying to incentivize the activity using a reward, try to get dopamine            released from the activity itself instead. When given a reward, less pleasure will be associated with the activity itself. Without            the reward, over time, dopamine can be released during the activity itself just by forcibly engaging in it. Dopamine released            during the activity will also make the activity itself more efficient due to how dopamine affects time perception and energy. ⇒ Maintain healthy levels of baseline dopamine:      5. Avoid having too large/too frequent dopamine peaks to avoid depleting the readily releasable pool of dopamine and causing            dopamine baseline to fall. Intermittent release of dopamine is key. Ensure large dopamine peaks do not occur too frequently            or frequent dopamine peaks are not too large.      6. Engage in cold water therapy, this increases baseline by up to 2.5x for a few hours before it reduces back to baseline.      7. To recover to dopamine baseline setpoint, avoid dopaminergic activities. The dopamine system will replenish itself naturally.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

I feel curious about the link here - and am noticing that when these highs appear I can actually choose to not amplify them, and instead to cultivate my para-sympathetic nervous system and calm myself down. I absolutely love the highs but am starting to recognise that my chronic health condition could well be created by my system seeking balance.   I would love to hear any insights around this - including how dopamine relates with the nervous system, whether dopamine 's seeking of balance could use illness as a way to achieve this and as below how spiritual experiences relate with dopamine levels and their impact on our baseline levels.

Well, because if you just stayed there, you would never continue to forage for more."" As I understand, the mouse have no motivation to move if no dopamine in the brain.

@user239den,"The amount of insight in this video is unbelievable. After watching I immediately started recognizing the described patterns in my life.  Just a few days ago I picked up my new car, drove it around and enjoyed all the amazing features it has (my previous car was almost 10 years old). Same day later, I went for my daily walk, which I normally enjoy, but this time all kinds of negative thoughts started creeping in, which I just couldn’t get rid of.   I came home, tried to do some work (I love my job), but still couldn’t really focus on anything. Then, equipped with the knowledge from this video, I knew 100% what was going on!  So I started doing what I normally really hate doing - cleaning my apartment. It’s always hard for me to start, but once I do, seeing incremental progress and how it becomes cleaner step by step does make me hooked to some degree, so I guess I’m lucky that in this case I can be genuinely focused on the process and not just on final result.  So once I did some cleaning and was getting ready to go to bed, I suddenly realized all the negative thoughts were gone like magic! My life is normal again despite some stress I’m going through these days. That night I got a good night sleep, which I initially thought was impossible.  Now cleaning my apartment has a totally different meaning and I actually do it more often. And I also know precisely when I might need to do it. I’m also ready and know when to expect negative thoughts to start attacking me.  I don’t know how long this feeling will last, but so far this video has been an amazing discovery, and spending 2 hours to watch was so worth it!",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@roobookaroo,"By some remarkable coincidence, the value of an intermittent reward schedule is the very subject of one of Shakespeare’s sonnets, No. 52.  So am I as the rich, whose blessed key Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure, The which he will not every hour survey, For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare, Since, seldom coming, in the long year set, Like stones of worth they thinly placed are, Or captain jewels in the carcanet.  So is the time that keeps you as my chest, Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, To make some special instant special blest, By new unfolding his imprison’d pride.      Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,     Being had, to triumph, being lack’d, to hope.  Here is one interpretation of this famous Sonnet 52:  I’m like a rich man with a key to his locked-up treasure, who refrains from opening it up and looking at his riches all the time – it’s better to open the treasure chest only rarely, because then the pleasure of gazing upon his riches is heightened. [The fine lines 3 & 4 are key, at the core of the ""Intermittent Reward Schedule"" concept.] Or it’s like feast days which are rare and scattered throughout the annual calendar, like rare gems, or precious jewels set in a necklace (or carcanet).  [Then the poet switches to the highs resulting from his occasional meetings with the young man he loves.] The time when we are apart is like that treasure chest, or like a wardrobe which houses a fine robe; knowing it’s there but being unable to touch it all the time makes those special times when you can touch it even more special. [Lines 11 & 12 repeat the principle of Controlling the Peaks of Pleasure by limiting them to irregular or special times.] You are truly blessed [Fair Youth], because when someone possesses you they feel they have triumphed, and when someone lacks your presence, they live in hope and anticipation of being with you again.

@markusdonato9455,"Loved the video but amphetamine was talked about inherently negatively. There are studies claiming low doses of amphetamine can raise BDNF and cause synaptic growth in the Ventral Tegmental Area. Amphetamine is so powerful and mind altering, it opens a door of perception, this isn’t scientific but I believe once being at such a high state of cognition and perception even once can be beneficial.",2년 전,0,
@timemanagementcoach1256,"It doesnt make sense to me why increasing the supply of something that may or may not be converted into dopamine can be bad, but I think I have some ideas. One is the body may naturally regulate a homeostasis and so if your body has more tyrosine than it needs and cant get rid of it it may produce spikes in dopamine accidentally through overly large supply and then it may also tell the body not to produce as much in the future;. I think this is called dopamine down regulation but it may have something to do with the receptors being filled and saying ""no more"" and there being no more room for additional dopamine until the receptors are cleared. If they are filled all at the same time perhaps this could cause issues.  It seems to me there has to be a way to engineer both higher levels of motivations without crashes or a managble cyclicality of both sides of supply of dopamine through tyrosine and the potency of dopamine through cycling on and off of both supply (tyrosine) and demand (dopamine release asking for more dopamine). It's a bit more complicated as receptors are also involved and need time to clear (metabolism determines how fast) and there are other variables. But cycling between Tyrosine and Tyrosine fast (during that period consuming Tryptophan and seratonin) and from cycling on and off dopamine releases with the right timing and in the right order seems to be something worth experimenting with.  Tyrosine and Tryptophan I believe compete for the same resources to synthesize into either Seratonin or Dopamine or else they compete for the same receptors so there is some opposite mechanism and healthy balance between the two that has to be maintained. Dopamine is the drive, Seratonin is the comfort. You don't want to be too comfortable all of the time but you don't want to be too driven without enjoying the process and too dependent upon the ups and downs of the addictive nature of dopamine. Too much seratonin can make you comfortable, content and happy when you maybe shouldn't be, which makes life good but may prevent you from having the necessary drive to create something better. But any goal seeking or system requires you to occasionally enjoy the journey otherwise what is the point.",2년 전,0,

@Avarice35,I applied this to my life coupled with BJ Fogg's PMAT method of developing habits effectively.  And can I just say.... Its kind of life changing. Its like combining science and enhancing nature's given talent of the human brain.  Since I was 28 ( Im 32 now) Ive had traumatic brain injury so I deep dived into youtube ted talks and google research to find out more about my brain.   Learned more about it and put it into practice.   Found out I welcome easy to remember tasks using the PMAT method of BJ Fogg and then found this dopamine rewards discussion. Practiced it for a month and oh boy.... Its been a breeze.   I never knew how smart my physiology is before I applied these   Thank you for sharing....

I can't tell you how bad I felt at that moment. my conscience took over my fear of sobriety without help from medication. I felt like such an a-hole! then it occurred to me how the substance that's legal happened to be just as deadly if not worse than heroin. can you believe it? it was definitely an eye-opener for me. thank you again for the kind words! all of you are an inspiration to my sobriety!

@taekhwanoh4268,"1. After the dopamine spike, it tends to drop below the baseline. 2. Dopamine can be produced locally and globally. 3. 2 paths for dopamine 4. Synapse is space between neurons and neurons send signals to synapse to activate neurons 5. Appreciating the process of something can increase the level of dopamine when you are doing that action (I love programming, I love building stuff) 6. Dopamine is currency for seeking and foraging 7. Higher the spike, greater drop of dopamine 8. Why do we have a huge drop in dopamine? Because our dopamine in the pool runs out 9. Intermittent schedule (you can't predict) 10. Don't combine things to get dopamine (e.g. listening to music during workout), and only get dopamine from the thing you are pursuing. Reduce multiple sources of dopamine release on things you enjoy (no smartphone during work out for me now) 11. Caffeine can increase the performance of dopamine receptors, so it can be helpful if you intake them correctly 12. Release dopamine during the effort, not before or afterward.

@edwhite7475,"Ive got some work to do now. looks like discipline is a big part of this...i have always exercised a modicum of discipline in my life, and it has served me well, as i watched my friends go overboard with drinking, drugs, sex...etc. As a musician it is what i term an 'occupational hazard'. I have no formal education beyond HS, and a love for reading, and learning information i can use, and im a 'positive' person, with a lot of natural energy...'hyper' since childhood, maybe ADHD but undiagnosed. I 'self medicated' for 35 years w marijuana, and i loved cocaine, and now coffee. I understand after watching this why i was drawn to the drugs. At 62, with some muscular issues, and after missing the gym for, idk, 40+ years, walking my dogs, at a brisk pace, mind you, combined with my personal activities , heavy physical labor, repair and maintenence of an old ranch property i just bought, rebuilding and restoration of vehicles, amplifiers, etc. Thats about the extent of excercise im gonna do. Ive been intermitent fasting for years, and ive all but eliminated carbs from my diet. I didnt hear him talk about weed or sugar, but i may have drifted off. 2 listens at least for me im thinking. Ive got lots left to accomplish in my life, the pandemic, and my recent move, and a fraudulent lawsuit affected my mental health over the last couple years, and i kinda drifted into a desperate sort of, eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die attitude, and im pulling out of that now, thank God. Im stubborn too, so i CAN do this. I have to, and i am. No more cocaine, i even quit coffee. I rarely drink, a shot of whiskey, a couple times a year now. Never smoked tobacco, and ill take a bong hit before bed every so often. Never played video games. So is playing music bad for me? And listening? And if i drink a cup of coffee randomly, midday, or when im recording something,or writing;  is that ok? As opposed to 4 cups EVERY MORNING first thing? I know moderation is the key, and ive experienced the 'burn out' factor more than once...hundreds of times, actually...over the last 40 years.

And distancing yourself from the rumblings of the mind is one of the goals of spirituality. Apart from knowing that the physical part of our life is just a reflection of a deeper non physical self.  We release dopamine when we enjoy an activity. Why we enjoy just that activity and not something else? Why cant we enjoy every activity like the ones we usually enjoy? Why do children enjoy every activity? These questions cannot be answered with physical experiments. I am sure Andrew, at some point in his life, will turn to spirituality for answers.   It is also stated in the Bhagwad Gita - Do your work with dedication, focus, love and selflessness and do not attach yourself to the result.

If we dont want the crash afterwards why would we ever take the drugs that raises dopamine like huperzine A or L-Tyrosine. And would taking them even twice a week not cause a lower baseline of dopamine overall and therefore we would require more of these drugs to get the same effect over time? these drugs could be classified the exact same as pornography or candy etc.  Also if we are able to spike dopamine from effort, wouldnt it lead to a crash afterwards? and if we always get dopamine during effort, would we require more and more effort each time to get the same level of pleasure from it?  Lets say i do work and do effort for many hours a day and get a release of dopamine during my work, this release of dopamine would eventually lower my baseline for each day since i do it every single day and would cause me to get to super low dopamine baseline.",2년 전,4,

Don't know how or when i began reading but i was reading adult books by age 3..so..grade school was a Huge incredibly long snooze..that said, my Fave professions are Science & Medicine..& Technology, in that order. Settled for a degree in Computer Science because my father had his first Big heart attack the summer before i was to go to Columbia to become a Doctor, specializing in DNA research. In the blink of an eye Family Responsibility kept me from realizing that dream. If i had not stepped up he would have had more due to the stress alone & i could not ignore that fact. Bottom line, i have always had an innate comprehension of how the body & the mind work, as if i could see inside the body & locate the trouble instinctively..often the root cause was bad diet, or, over indulgence, personal physical abuse, & toxic environments..Then i would recommend changes corresponding..& with Accuracy. Many lives were & still are saved by simple changes & others were remarkably prolonged despite adverse conditions & situations.  One thing i have been saying all my life, Do Not ignore the mind..Treat the mind With the body...rings True today more than ever, since mainstream medicine has disconnected from common sense & simply relies on Big Pharma for panacea, the 'Holy Grail miracle pill'. i studied the area/s anyway, in my free time, so..i understand a thing or two about the science, just minus the Degree. So much so, that fellow scientists choose to consult with me, while knowing i lack the paper. Since i did not get to the Med classes..i know there will be things, loose strings & not easily discovered answers, that you will clear up & explain in this video. Halfway through your video now & i have heard a TON of Common Sense explaining tricky little dupes we do to ourselves..my instincts have been serving me well..lol..i have made Huge Effort to not get too high on Happy, so as not to crash & burn later on.. i wonder..can't help it. my thoughts keep coming back to the Locked In syndrome....could these patients not be taught to create New neural pathways?..or..does it affect the whole brain as one...i'm guessing this must be the case. & i am Grateful you were conscious enough to Stop that Thorazine! & tell them what you Needed...worse than LiS, it would have killed you. Reminds me of when my ulcer perforated, one night at the end of a particularly difficult work shift..i drove to the hospital with blood trickling out of the corners of my mouth..within seconds the ER Dr on call was literally running around shaking her hands, freaking out..she had no idea what to do..so i asked for vitamin K shots...like your call, it did the trick. i'm still here too.

@kokyu,"Thanks for this amazing content:washhands:. Question. Does meditation and ""inner work"" tap into a different reward pathway? Or the same pathways from a different trigger point (internal and therefore sustainable)? Rather than decreasing rewards, there seems to be an ever increasing reward as time passes and the practice develops (even if the time practicing is constant). Much of what you are explaining demonstrates the wisdom of sages and mystics through the ages. The Gita specifies not to be attached to the fruits of the action, but essentially to be focussed on performing the action to as high quality as you are able. Whoever wrote the Gita is almost saying in our modern terminology ""Don't artificially spike your dopamine bro, let it come from performing the activity itself""😆.",2년 전,2,

The ancients have searched and tried to compile best practices. From the stoics to the epicureans. From the Buddhists to the Lokayatins. They have approached it thru meditation, introspection, observation but often have had their perspectives marred by superstition and their lack of access to the empirical data you have just presented us.   Far from just being a medical podcast, you are now in the best position in my opinion to create a new synthesis. Using our biology to explain the human condition and to prescribe the protocols for eudaimonia.   It is what humanity needs and I’m so happy to be alive today that I can witness this advancement.   Thank you for all you do and have done and I sincerely hope that you will pursue the elucidation of eudaimonia and disseminate it to one and all.

But make sure to buy the Chimarrão Version, that is the Traditional brazilian one. Sometimes its not write Chimarrão on it but if have ""Erva Mate"" on it and is a Brazillian Market/website will be the right one.  The preparation is a little different too , you kind of have to balance the erb on one side of the cup and the water on the other side (Its a different straw too but i dont think it makes any difference) . But very easy to do lots of Chimarrão Tutorials here on Youtube. If you wanna enjoy at its fullest i would recoment a Traditional South Brazilian ""Cuia"" Made from all kids of materias, its basicly a small vase/cup you use to drink it, it changes the flavor too.

@thenakedsuperhero1926,"Dopamine down regulation in reference to a short bout of phasic firing from one instance is so miniscule that your average person cannot notice it. And things that are encoded in our genetics for every day life/survival such as eating(proper foods), cleaning, etc, the tiniest down regulation that occurs rebounds within hours. It's not until you abuse the action potential by repeating things too often that the down regulation repeats before the brain has the ability to get back to a homeostatic baseline. Even then, things the body is designed for don't create complete tolerance, otherwise orgasms would lead to absolutely no feeling when abused. The dopamine system is fairly robust when it comes to down/up regulation compared to the other NT systems. This is in part why it takes quite a while to build full tolerance to things like adderall, or other drugs, or sugar/junk food binging, tv show binging, etc.",2년 전,0,

@SuperCanonshooter,The “baseline” is the key. Focus on doing things that are proven to raise your baseline. Set you mind on the discipline it takes to do the discipline itself. For example.. The reward of eating broccoli isn’t that you trick yourself into enjoying broccoli.. but that you know eating broccoli is difficult and not enjoyable but you are rewarded by the discipline you’re practicing by eating the broccoli.  This works for every single aspect of life. The discipline of setting your alarm.. The discipline of not tap the snooze button but immediately getting up. The discipline of then doing every single thing after that regardless of if it’s enjoyable and specially if it’s difficult! Making your bed.. Reading scripture.. Praying.. Exercise.. Nutrition.. Work.. Relationship.. Rest.. Therapy.. Serving Community.. Sleep. All these become disciplines instead of “choices based on pleasure”. Then your baseline will be higher which only helps you be even more disciplined. HOWEVER.. Life has a way of throwing us off balance and setting us back. So also be fully prepared to be disciplined through “trials and temptations”.. Like very real troubles that may force you to drastically adjust you daily routine of disciplines. Like an injury or emergency surgery or the loss of a loved one.. or even something simple like a flat tire. These very real stresses come with temptations to “seek pleasure” and cause us to fall back into practicing pleasures that spiral us down. So stay focused on the disciplines through the trials and traumas and you’ll keep your baseline of dopamine and the other pleasure hormones high and the stress response hormones stay low!,2년 전,1,

@tabithabasye2440,"I was diagnosed with ADHD at 38, I could feel Adderall work about 15 minutes into it.  10mg put me to sleep, 20 put me to sleep, 30 had almost a narcoleptic effect.  40mg extended release twice a day seemed perfect.  However I hate taking meds and in my view for most things they should be more like a bandage than a permanent fixture.  So at nearly 42 I am at 30mg once a day.  My thinking, which subjectively seems to be accurate with my body is by giving my body what levels of dopamine I needed and then slowly reducing this amount I allowed my brain to realize I needed a higher level and to start producing it on its own.  So far so good.  I hope to be off of Adderall completely in 24 months and this information I feel will help me achieve this goal faster.    I also skip days.  However when I was sick once I didn’t take the Adderall for about 3 days, by then I was crying, only able to stop for 3 minutes at a time and I was suicidal.  30 minutes after taking a dosage I was no longer crying or suicidal.  So I decided then to move slowly with getting off the medication.    Now knowing methamphetamines are neuro toxic I want off Dextroamphetamine more quickly!  Thanks for this information!",2년 전,0,

But what about the feedback and complementary molecules that are also synthesized by the brain to balance this out?",2년 전,0,

Great information for youngsters (and not only), who think such a lifestyle could be good long-term. I was surprised that cold water can increase dopamine with a good rate, for ~3hours after it. I love the idea about making our dopamine levels realtively stable, by making high peeks more rarely, reducing several simultaneous factors or acitivities, which all increase the dopamine. I wondered how I managed to work 6 months on goals of mine, and then for another 6 months I couldn't do it. Now I have a better explanation. I am glad I never incorporated the reward aspect, and rather focused on enjoyng the process of applying a new improvement or habit in my life, no matter that at first it would feel unpleasant.",2년 전,0,

If you eliminate sex, social media scrolling, warm blankets, sugary foods, video games etc. to build up that 'pool' of dopamine, and then using the archery practice as the release for that dopamine, will that reduce the 'pain' of having to practice and create a highly motivated individual?  Archery has that intermittent reward of sometimes you hit, sometimes you miss. Or will the sole pursuit of that activity effectively manufacture an addiction where the life experience shrinks to just archery?

@allanjonathan1349,"Sir, I took a quick search on Google to see how Dopamine turns into Adrenaline  And a big word I found there was Hydroxylation, process mediated by catalyst and heat when Carbon - Hydrogen bonds and converted into Carbon-Hydroxyl bonds   Does it make sense to you that when there is a big influx of dopamine in the human system, in order to facilitate and utilize that surge to transmute into neurological fuel of adrenaline, a simple fluttering of breath through the nose to mildly mimic hyperventilation,  though within a comfortable rate, could be utilized to manage and balance dopamine to adrenaline ratio levels. Could consciously mimicking controlled hyperventilation facilitate the hydroxylation process which then lead to being able to produce adrenaline at will?

In endurance training, specifically by Dr Stephen seiler (the 80/20), we are trying to manage a balnace between the low intensity and high intensity workouts. Each probably contribute to the levels of dopamine, as a function of mental and physical satisfaction. The low intensity workouts, are what's called ""Zone 2"", working out under the lactate threshold. While it's not an easy task to maintain a low aerobic pace/power/heart rate, I wonder what are the dopamine relationship, specifically to the heart rate level.   Does higher dopamine peaks relative to the base level cause the heart to beat faster? If so, does balancing the pre-work out and during-workout dopamine level can assist in maintaining a lower heart rate?   Thank you!  Eilon",2년 전,0,

@kyaHiKarSakteH,"A summary of this podcast:  1)What actually is dopamine?  It's the driver to seek things. It is the only currency to seek motivation, desire and cravings. It has everything to do with our mindset and how we approach things.  2)How dopamine works in our body?  So there's a common myth associated with it called as the dopamine hit which is not completely true. Dopamine has a baseline level and a peak level and the balance between these two levels determines the  satisfaction and motivation we get.  3)Satisfaction  The relative height of the peak level with respect to the baseline level is directly proportional to the satisfaction we get after achieving something or doing something. The past dopamine level affects our present dopamine.  4)Motivation   It is the internal energy to seek things. How motivated we are depends on our present dopamine level relative to our past dopamine level. Motivation should arrive from the process itself not the end goal or reward.  5)Affects of supplements  Supplements taken for dopamine of any kind do help us to reach the peak for sometime but if taken too often then it lowers and lowers our baseline level which is unhealthy for us in the longer run and that is why we start feeling unsatisfied  6)Subjective nature of dopamine  Dopamine is highly subjective. Many people find difficulties in enjoying the process as it's ofc not so pleasurable but if we stick to it even if we don't want to time and again, then dopamine starts getting generated from this process itself  7) Instant pleasures Instant pleasures of any kind are not even useful in the shorter run forget about the longer run as when we seek those pleasures then the peak level is achieved and then it abruptly drops below the baseline level after which we even loose the basic motivation  8) Addiction  When the baseline dopamine level keeps getting lower and lower and when it drops below a minimum healthy level then, this condition is referred to as addiction. And this is when the real problem starts as now the person doesn't feel the pleasure or joy anymore.  9) What's the solution   ★If you seek too high dopamine from something, then don't seek it too often ★In order to get dopamine from something don't use any stimulants as they kind of wear and tear your mind for seeking dopamine form that activity again without any stimulants.  10)Some helpful practices   🔹Cold water exposure: highly recommend as it provides long lasting and stable dopamine level balance  🔹 Better sleep 🔹 Spiking dopamine from effort itself 🔹Any subjective activity that you like. And a lot more that can't be described in comments.",2년 전,0,

I've quit long enough to start feeling better and the 'good mood' sends me on a walk to the convenience store to get a coffee...just today, I tell myself.

I’ve found that speaking to people (especially through English class) comes from “the heart.” I’ve found that when people say this, they don’t realize it, but they are saying to rather speak from calmness and resort your attention away from the constant nervous and hyperactive brain. So when he mentions that a mixture between alertness and calmness is the perfect baseline mixture for a perfect baseline level of dopamine, it’s ultimately referring to the distinguish between both I mentioned above.

@akshaykhanna9802,"Disagree on caffeine. All the rest is precious information. 	Coffee studies seem incomplete and missing out something fundamental. Take it from someone who is struggling with borderline depression, I do not take coffee in general. If i take it for a few days, just 2 cups a day, the first day when i dont take it afterwards, I am pushed into depression. It’s horrible. I lie down like a zombie with no energy to do anything. There is no cognitive capacity. The experience is nothing like anything I had prior to taking coffee. 	This experience is shared by another friend. If you suffer from very low energy levels from time to time and decide to consume coffee to increase cognitive capacity, you can’t stop doing it and you will have to progressively increase it to feel the same effects. It is essentially a recreational drug in small amount that doesn’t irreversibly damage your brain. But it is seems to be far from helping it.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@julianmor9191,"Dr. Huberman, im really struggling to understand the dip in dopamine after the spike.  Im trying to understand how we dont always feel low after we enjoy something. Obviously a big transient spike is followed by a drop below baseline, but for everyday things we enjoy are we simply able to enjoy them because we havent had any recent  crazy spikes so the little bumps are enough to have an effect? Also how do other neurotransmitters affect how we feel after things like exercise or sex- do I not later feel low after a long run because I am used to long runs?Or is it because of other neurotransmitters? Or is it simply a lack of awareness?   You may have touched on this, but I am struggling to understand how we don’t seem to always feel low after we feel motivated and happy from small dopamine spikes.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@Copeewe,"I live in central Chile, and the temperature of the Pacific Ocean in Valparaiso can range between 63.9 F mid summer to 55 degrees F in winter.  When I was a child I would go to school, come home for lunch, my dad would pick me up from the bus and take me swimming in the olympic sized pool next to the ocean to practice swimming, then I would eat lunch and go back to school.  Lunch was 2 hours long.  I recall being very comfortable in that water temperature, though it was always a shock getting into the pool.  With my cousins over the weekends we would play in the pool for an hour.  I loved it.  My dad was an athelete, and he swam in the Ocean every day until he got ALS in his 80s. It's a matter of geting used to it and feeling safe about getting into the cold.  Now I have additional insight into why that was the best part of my childhood.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

The interesting phenomena here being that if you force yourself to eat it again, despite your reluctance, that you actually still realize how much you enjoy it.

I think this Podcast is filled with quite useless information. Even though you are a very smart guy, this is just a bunch of things around Dopamine, which besides doing cold showers and avoiding Dopamine depletion doesnt really provide too much usefull Information. In fact i would argue that some things are not even true. I dont believe at All, that you can just throw All Dopamine realising Information together like you do. I think the subjective perception and experience  are very important in the way that they influence us and decide Our future behavior. Also, i dont think this Black and White thinking about Dopamine Release and following decrease is true for All things. Im a little bit dissapointed in this Podcast.

I am referring to any kind of cognitive efforts, reading and writing in particular, -- I don't have something measurable in front of me while reading where I can say: ""I am happy that I achieved this"" or ""I am happy that I completed this.""  -- these tasks don't seem to have a linear progress, no measurable milestones.  Lifting weights on the other hand... I understand how lifting something heavy can be a reward in itself. But writing? Sometimes in a writing session (academic writing) all I do is deleting or editing a few sentences.

@jonathanbecker8935,"My baseline sucks.  But I'm glad my friend sent me this video to watch. I didn't think I could hang on much longer.  But this video gives me hope that I can start exercising again and actually feel improvement in mood.  I've neglected physical exercise for a really long time, so it's gonna be a challenge to get myself back to where I need to be.  I took an anti-anxiety drug, Klonopin, for twenty three years.  It took me four years to taper off of it because there withdrawals last so long.  This month is my ninth year off of the benzodiazepine, and I'm STILL having brutal anxiety at times that interferes with my life.  I've finally learned that benzos taken long term can cause brain injury.  The medical community is in denial about how this class of drugs causes profound long term neurological damage, mostly because so many doctors are STILL incorrectly prescribing these drugs for longer than six to eight weeks, thus causing long term dependence and subsequent neurological harm in new people every day.  Many physicians don't even realize the disasters they're creating when they get their patients hooked on Klonopin, Xanax, or Ativan.  And they're rarely around ten or twenty years later when the patient is suicidal and not understanding that their drug is causing their symptoms.  Klonopin has given me gut problems which act up with stress.  I must have really low levels of dopamine because I feel wiped out and unmotivated most of the time.  Completing small tasks takes huge amounts of effort.  I was a smoker for many years, so I used vape to eliminate the tar I was breathing in and taper off of the nicotine.  It's so easy to feel anxiety and use huge amounts of nicotine as a coping mechanism.  I'm realizing how much that nicotine probably spikes my dopamine in a really unhealthy way.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@DiegoTobarraG,"Hi Andrew, thanks for the great podcast full of useful info.  One question regarding triggering dopamine prior to another activity.  Does it mstter what triggers the dopamine prior to the activity? For instance, imagine that I drink a sugared coke before having lunch. As I understand from the podcast, this will eventually make me enjoy LESS the lunch since I'm constantly triggering dopamine through ingesting sugar prior to having my delicious lunch.  Will this effect of enjoying less an activity be different if I would cycle the dopamine trigger before the activity? For example, on Mondays I watch TV before lunch, on Tuesdays I listen to music before lunch... and so on.  Sorry for the long question, but I find this interesting and I was hoping you might know some study on this matter.  Thanks again! Diego",3년 전(수정됨),0,

One question: If my body needs L-Tyrosine (and Vitamin B6 and Iron and some other essential micronutrients) as ""raw material"" to build Dopamin, I would expect it to be a good idea to supplement those raw materials in order to re-fill the stock/depot of Dopamin. I am a bit surprised that the intake of L-Tyrosine directly leads to a Dopamine release. So is there a way to re-fill the depots, having enough Dopamine ready for the next peak, without directly causing a release? Or did I miss something crucial?",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@jameschiassondesrosiers1988,"Hi Andrew! I had a question for you and would feel very lucky and blessed that you answer it. I use to take Vyvanse for my ADHD maybe 4 years ago. Recently, I have done some other stimulants (cocaine) purely recreationally and I realised how much my brain on stimulants just seems to work normally as compared to when it is not on any stimulants. Now I know that cocaine and say Vyvanse are not the same at all, but I know they do act on the same receptors or on similar ones at the very least. Basically I called my doctor and asked her if I could get back on that medication ( which I had stopped from fear of it altering my personality forever ) since I am going back to school and focus is a big challenge for me. She then prescribed me with a low dose. Only thing is I have kind of been doin some of the coke I had left while starting Vyvanse, like the morning before my first dose of vyvanse I did some cocaine and I did the rest two days ago after the Vyvanse had completely worn off ( 12ham ). After that I stopped the Vyvanse and coke completely in order to regulate my dopamine receptors but is two day enough to do so?  My question is basically, as obvious as the answer can seem, did the cocaine affect my Vyvanse consumption, will it make it less powerful than it would have is I did not do any? Or is there no cross-tolerance whatsoever so? It is to note that I also took 1 to 3 coffee everyday eversince the first Vyvanse dose",3년 전,0,

@abdireflects,"*What did i learn from this podcast:*  - cold showers are essential to my day, it can increase dopamine by 2.5 times (equivalent to that of cocaine ) but instead of having it crash down it maintains after! - Dopamine is a finite but renewable source, this means that if you were to have a big spike in dopamine it comes crashing down but it would go below your baseline, this will make you feel worse - If there are activities you want to continue doing, avoid stacking dopamine spiking activities together like pre workout, music, texting and working out if you wanna continue working out, the same principle will apply to studying etc… - if there is an activity you find difficult like studying, don’t spike dopamine before and after the activity, instead make yourself derive dopamine from the activity (studying itself). Especially when there is a great resistance to the activity, tell yourself that despite the activity being hard and difficult you are doing it BECAUSE you enjoy it! - “Don’t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort, and don’t spike dopamine after engaging in effort. Learn to spike dopamine from effort itself.” - Andrew Huberman  1:47:31 - Working only for the sake of a reward that will come afterwards can make it more challenging and us less likely to do it in the future because of the way dopamine affects time perception and only being released at the reward. This relates to growth mindset, pleasure from the process, from conquering the effort (deliberate effort exposure).",3년 전,6,

I love the advice to not always layer dopamine stimulating activities and will put that to use. I think i do it to some degree because i do so many different things on a daily basis.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Dopamine System can be Controlled up to significant levels.                                       1.

@7575tavin,"Practical summary:   1. Dopamine management - Abstain from or limit highly desirable activities for up to a month so the dopamine levels are replenished and the baseline dopamine release returns to normal 	- Peaks of dopamine decrease our baseline dopamine, required to general motivation and satisfaction with life. - Go for intermittent, random releases of dopamine 	- Don't bundle pleasurable activities with things you want to do (gym and music) 	- Flip a coin and choose how much pleasure bundling you'll do to the next activity 	- Otherwise the activity alone becomes less pleasurable  2. Direct practices - Cold water exposure - 2.5x increase and sustained for hours afterwards - Peaks 	- Chocolate - 1.5x 	- Sex - 2x (act and pursuit of it) 	- Nicotine - 2.5x 	- Cocaine - 2.5x 	- Amphetamine - 10x 	- Exercise - 2x (up to 2x, the more you enjoy it subjectively) - Coffee combined with another activity (coffee makes the dopamine release more effective) - Connection with other people  3. Mental strategies - Subjectivity, perception and belief 	- Hearing something that validates our belief about an activity, makes it more pleasurable 	- Journaling, thinking positively about something you remember or you're experiencing now releases dopamine - Learn to spike dopamine from effort 	- Don't spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort 	- Don't spike dopamine after engaging in effort 	- Learn to spike dopamine from effort itself.",3년 전,7.4천,

@MuhanMado,"Dr. Huberman, the odds of you seeing this are slim to none, since this video is almost a year old now, but thank you for this. For the last several months, I've done exactly what you spoke about - engaging in constant excessive dopamine inducing pleasantries (smoking weed, video games, being glued to my phone, etc.) and I've never felt more depressed and unmotivated in my life, despite my external circumstances being privileged and comfortable. I even began to think I had undiagnosed ADHD, but after this video I'm certain I just have a very depleted pool of baseline dopamine. I'm on day 2 of my detox, no marijuana, videogames only after work and not late at night, minimal phone screen time, and it's like you said - very difficult, but I intend to stick to it because I need to regain control of my life. The way you convey scientific information and then follow up with real world examples and applications is nothing short of eloquent, and I'm sincerely grateful for your knowledge and insight.

@supercharging,"Otavio; While your summary is accurate, the good Professor's content is minimally accurate.  Not one, rather, several of his conclusions are based on wholly inadequate controls.  One phat example is using gamers' experience. Shallow achievement is a world apart from licit profit. Winning a video game has no relation to meritable achievement delivering longer-lasting or broader benefits. -- Have clicked on ""free-click charity"" buttons every day for about 7,000 days, and still feel SUCH a thrill at the action every day. Every click saves a life!  Never a decrease in baseline dopamine.  Long list of other examples.  I admire Prof. Huberman enormously, and he speaks with charm and authority. That doesn't elevate his accuracy level.  Your note-taking and your skills at summary are nearly exquisite. What huge potential you show. Best of energy to the best of your efforts.",3년 전,84,
@zholnerchuk," @yac7571  as far as I remember the thing about cold water exposure is that it increases the baseline and has a long lasting effect. So it’s not like an immediate spike and consecutive plummeting but more of a gradual thing improving your mood and being. You might also want to keep in mind that cold water exposure has other benefits that improve your overall well-being and it can’t be compared with most dopamine spiking activities. Furthermore, cold water increases your adrenaline baseline first and it’s directly related to your dopamine levels but I forgot the exact mechanism :D",3년 전,147,

@mittortz," @yac7571  Someone else answered about the (purported) difference with cold water exposure, but with regards to something like exercise: what he was saying is that you want to avoid extraordinarily large dopamine peaks that will undermine your ability to benefit from normal dopamine peaks, which you get from something like exercise (if you enjoy exercise). It is good to experience the normal dynamic variance of dopamine levels because that is what the system has evolved to do to benefit us. But regularly using or indulging abnormal/unnatural/external sources of dopamine spiking will mess with your perception of other normal things in the short term and degrade your baseline and overall life satisfaction in the long term. He also didn't say to totally abstain from chocolate either - just be aware of how it affects your dopamine and enjoy it accordingly.",2년 전(수정됨),8,

But as Huberman says, you need to teach yourself to find pleasure from the effort, even if it may mean lying to yourself a little. Your mind and brain is more malleable than we think, that is what I took from this episode. We just need to understand the rules. So in the beginning you may need to use something pleasurable to motivate the hard task, but overtime you will need to taper it down to be less dependent on it as you develop the habit.

In today's world, you are probably thinking my parents were numbskulls, but that was one of the ADHD protocols in those days and an 8 year old boy certainly does not know any better.  Many 'ADHD' (this is a bogus diagnosis, of course)  kids were also put on  'uppers' in those days such as Dexedrine. Fortunately, I came off Thorazine and my parents were able to get some grip on reality.   I have had no long term effects, but I do have a long term memory of trusting the medical profession.

@ChristopherStLouis-tc5qn,Just listening to this is motivating. haha. My dopamine is so messed up.  I have ADD and engage in recreation dopaminergic drugs from time to time. Hence the dopamine drain is hell for me even after taking my ADD meds for days responsibly.  Cold water treatment is amazing.  I usually focus on the prize or reward. Thanks for the new mindset. MDMA and amphetamines are analogs of PEA and were synthetically designed by tweaking the PEA molecule. PEA is your endogenous amphetamine. Hence they are called phenylethylamines. Phenylethylamines don't have a receptor but they have many effects on many different receptors and monoamine transporters. Reversing dopamine and serotonin reuptake transporters to release more instead of reuptake. Also have many effects on the receptors themselves in many different ways.  PEA is rapidly metabolised rapidly and barely measurable but amphetamines and MDMA and other analogs have way longer half lives. Comment for souces.,3년 전,0,

@Eddie-Spaghetti,Well this can surely be linked to being rich or having a lot of money. If people with money are spend spend spend and doing pleasurable activity after pleasurable activity on the outside looking in one can be mistaken for thinking that lucky rich person perhaps even being  jealous of the person. The reality is that they are probably spiking their dopamine too much and becoming miserable. Better to have money so stress etc can be easier managed by not having to stress over money or paying bills etc but at the same time not really endulging yourself with the money. Therefore the conclusion is you don’t need to be rich you probably just need enough to not stress about money and then keep your baseline dopamine as high as possible with much fewer dopamine hits which would mean not spending the money that you have.

However, because of the way that dopamine relates to our perception of time, working hard at something for sake of a reward that comes afterward, can make the hard work much more challenging and make us much less likely to lean into hard work in the future.  1:41:43 My colleague at Stanford, Carol Dweck, as many of you know, has come up with this incredible theory and principle, and actually goes beyond theory and principle called   ""Growth Mindset"", which is this striving to be better to be in this mindset of I'm not there yet, but striving itself is the end goal.  And that of course delivers you to tremendous performance. It's been observed over and over and over again, that people that have growth mindset, kids that have growth mindset end up performing very well because they're focused on the effort itself.  And all of us can cultivate growth mindset. The neural mechanism of cultivating growth mindset involves learning to access the rewards from effort and doing. And that's hard to do because you have to engage this prefrontal component of the mesolimbic circuit. You have to tell yourself, okay, this effort is great, this effort is pleasureful.  Even though you might actually be in a state of physical pain from the exercise, or I can recall this from college, just feeling like I wanted to get up from my desk, but forcing myself to study, forcing myself and forcing myself.   What you find over time is that you can start to associate a dopamine release.  You can evoke dopamine release from the friction and the challenge that you happen to be in. You completely eliminate the ability to generate those circuits and the rewarding process of being able to reward friction while in effort, if you are focused only on the goal that comes at the end. Because of the way that dopamine marks time.  So if you say, oh, I'm going to do this very hard thing, and I'm going to push and push and push and push for that end goal that comes later.  Not only do you enjoy the process of what you're doing less, you actually make it more painful while you're engaging in it.  You make yourself less efficient at it, because if you were able to access dopamine while in effort, dopamine has all these incredible properties of increasing the amount of energy in our body, and in our mind, our ability to focus by way of dopamines conversion into epinephrin. But also you're undermining your ability to lean back into that activity the next time.  The next time you need twice as much coffee and three times as much loud music, and four times as much energy drink and the social connection just to get out the door in order to do the run or to study. So what's more beneficial in fact can serve as a tremendous amplifier on all endeavors that you engage in. Especially hard endeavors is to A, not start layering in other sources of dopamine in order to get to the starting line, not layering in other sources of dopamine in order to be able to continue, but rather to subjectively start to attach the feeling of friction and effort to an internally generated reward system. And this is not meant to be vague, this is a system that exists in your mind, that exists in the minds of humans for hundreds of thousands of years, by which you're not just pursuing the things that are innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth, water when you're thirsty. But the beauty of this mesolimbic reward pathway that I talked about earlier is that, it includes the forebrain. So you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part.  I know it's painful, I know this doesn't feel good, but I'm focused on this. I'm going to start to access the reward. You will find the rewards, meaning the dopamine release inside of effort if you repeat this over and over again. And what's beautiful about it is that, it starts to become reflexive for all types of effort. When we focus only on the trophy, only on the grade, only on the win as the reward, you undermine that entire process. So how do you do this? You do this in those moments of the most intense friction. You tell yourself this is very painful and because it's painful, it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later, meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine, but you also have to tell yourself that in that moment you are doing it by choice and you're doing it because you love it. And I know that sounds like lying to yourself, and in some ways it is lying to yourself, but it's lying to yourself in the context of a truth which is that you want it to feel better. You want it to feel even pleasureful. Now, this is very far and away different from thinking about the reward that comes at the end, the hot fudge sundae for after you cross the finish line and you can replace hot fudge sundae with whatever reward happens to be appealing to you. We revere people who are capable of doing what I'm describing. 1:46:22  1:45:25 How to attach pleasure to effort: ""In those moments of the most instense friction you tell yourself this is very painful and because it's painful, it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later, meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine, but you also have to tell yourself that in that moment you are doing it by choice and you're doing it because you love it.""  1:47:31 “Don’t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort, and don’t spike dopamine after engaging in effort.

@iche9373,"Practical summary:   1. Dopamine management - Abstain from or limit highly desirable activities for up to a month so the dopamine levels are replenished and the baseline dopamine release returns to normal 	- Peaks of dopamine decrease our baseline dopamine, required to general motivation and satisfaction with life. - Go for intermittent, random releases of dopamine 	- Don't bundle pleasurable activities with things you want to do (gym and music) 	- Flip a coin and choose how much pleasure bundling you'll do to the next activity 	- Otherwise the activity alone becomes less pleasurable  2. Direct practices - Cold water exposure - 2.5x increase and sustained for hours afterwards - Peaks 	- Chocolate - 1.5x 	- Sex - 2x (act and pursuit of it) 	- Nicotine - 2.5x 	- Cocaine - 2.5x 	- Amphetamine - 10x 	- Exercise - 2x (up to 2x, the more you enjoy it subjectively) - Coffee combined with another activity (coffee makes the dopamine release more effective) - Connection with other people  3. Mental strategies - Subjectivity, perception and belief 	- Hearing something that validates our belief about an activity, makes it more pleasurable 	- Journaling, thinking positively about something you remember or you're experiencing now releases dopamine - Learn to spike dopamine from effort 	- Don't spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort 	- Don't spike dopamine after engaging in effort 	- Learn to spike dopamine from effort itself.",2년 전,0,

@hajrakhalid3171," @healthy_3083  Hey. I am really sorry but i am not sure about that. But i feel like it will because when you refrain from doing activities which release too much dopamine you automatically are drawn to things which release dopamine at a lower consistent level over a long period of time like reading, exercising , working on relationships or setting short term and long term goals ( Yes you will start doing these things because of boredom and over some time  will also start enjoying these things). So it is good at molecular level for dopamine circuits. As well as the activities mentioned above themselves are very good for enhancing cognitive function for a number of other reasons.",3년 전,1,

@hectorwearden202,"Main takeaways from me were:  1. Use your dopamine wisely. One way people use up all their dopamine is by layering dopamine activities e.g. watching football, drinking beer while scrolling instagram. There's a cost to this because you're going to create a massive peak which will take away from your baseline dopamine levels which means it's going to be harder to be motivated later on in the week.  2. Your rational brain can categorise things as rewarding/non-rewarding. This categorisation cascades down to your dopamine system. By valuing an activity for itself and practising gratitude for it, in the future it becomes internally rewarding. For example, if you rationally feel running is rewarding, it will become rewarding via dopamine.   3. Tie dopamine to the activity itself. Rather than use rewards (extrinsic motivation) learn to spike dopamine from the activity itself (intrinsic motivation).",3년 전,0,

I never understood what was happening until now.  This also explains why I always have several paintings in progress simultaneously. It's like each color has its own precious mood. Each mood retains a separate aesthetic response. Its own personality. I feel the rushes and mood and get extreme spectrums but all of them give me the sharp blast of what must be dopamine. That's dope!,3년 전,2,

@nottyseel949,"Second time through I got so much more out of it.  It seems the simplest way for balance is seek challenge where failure is always a possibility regardless of effort (but success is possible), and seek new experiences more than favorite pastimes where you occasionally will love it and occasionally will hate it.  Simply put, without putting actual survival at risk like getting a new job every day or abandoning your family and making a new one every year, try to live life without knowing what to expect.     This has really changed my perspective in a positive way.  I do not really have an addictive personality or trouble with addictions, I occasionally drop alcohol, games, anything I think I may become addicted to for long periods (often 3-6 months) and often forget about them.  However, I do not open up to new experiences,  I feel like part of maturity is  having the wisdom to avoid failure, especially when others are depending on you.  As such I have a very controlled life.  I'm excited to put into practice how without being negligent or reckless and within those important controls (keeping my job and protecting my family/relationships) I can make sure I'm pursuing challenge constantly.   I can see a lot of room for expansion there.  It's easy to use life as medicine where you do consistent things for an expected result especially managing stress by watching your favorite shows, playing your favorite games, eating your favorite foods, hanging with your favorite people.   The risk of ruining your very limited free time is daunting when responsibility controls so much of your time.  My brain is exploding with this topic because I'm also seeing the connection to working too much and living for the weekend as it were, basically though, the goal is don't be a drone and you won't feel like one.  I'm going to come back to this video in 6 months and see how I'm doing.   Really appreciate this topic and your hard work.",3년 전,0,

@rawrevelations2002,"I am my brother's keeper, literally.  I took him in after a motorcycle accident.  We had to teach him everything, walk, talk etc.  We achieved miraculous recovery...physically.  The traumatic brain injury was in his frontal lobe. It has been 13 years but the last 5 yrs or so has revealed  anti-social behavior and a severe sugar addiction, he will steal any sugary thing he can.  He is VERY passive aggressive, (I call it silent but deadly) He lies, steals, destroys, ..all secretly, all the time   He has to be watched 24/7.  I just found someone who would give him a nuero-saliva test.  This revealed that he makes seratonin but is severely low in dopamine, nor & ep-inephrine.  We added daily workouts and Mediterranean/raw food diet as recommended by my personal Dr. (The late Toni Bark). These changes reversed his chirosis and healed my one kidney.  My eyes have  20)20 vision now.  But my brother's behaviors are horrible.  So this new therapy we are starting related to the saliva test results is nutritional supplements to provide the precursors needed to create and release each level of catecholamines.  I pray to God this helps him.  I will not institutionalize him before I have tried everything but life is difficult. I am so disappointed in mainstream medicine. It has turned me into a SUPER NERD that reads medical books and peer reviewed papers with my tea every morning.  I'm absorbing information from geniuses like this guy on You Tube.

Wouldn't the concentration of readily releasable pool of dopamine be proportional to the amount released when a substance is used, with the only difference being one is used up immediately and the other over time?

My challenge now is that I have to take Progivil to work as a home health nurse because of narcolepsy and I crash when it wears off which makes going home and finishing my charting absolute drudgery.

@liljuz1981,"Amazing information as always, Mr Huberman, very compelling. Although I kind of already knew these concepts I never fully understood the mechanism of action. Looking forward to continue pushing further and working on my baseline but to be completely honest this is incredibly stressful and makes me feel less apt to even attempt. Overwhelming even. It seems like there are innumerable factors that must be considered to just barely feel normal and it pains me to think that feeling any degree of pleasure is purely transient and leads to a subsequent drop in baseline. It seems horribly counterintuitive and just makes me believe that it makes more sense to seek death rather than constantly trying to fight antiquated neurochemistry just to only sort of feel normal. It's painful, even. I've been making progress toward the betterment of my self and those around me but what use is it if I'm just going to become miserable at any slight taste of pleasure? This Rollercoaster of neurology is extraordinarily overwhelming. I'm completely lost despite covering so many aspects of exercise, diet, pharmacology, and personal growth. Yeah it feels good sometimes to accomplish goals, key word being sometimes. Why even bother if I'm not even guaranteed to feel level? Pushing through despite these intrusive thoughts becomes painful despite conditioning myself to feel or think otherwise.",3년 전,1,

But is it not like if you reached your goal then and have nothing coming in front of you like new challenges or more effort it gives you again a lower baseline dopamine. I have had this just when I wrote my first Master's thesis by the end of last year where I really liked the effort while working on it but after I graduated I felt kind of depressed cause there was no actual benefit from that goal. It is only a title so what I am going to do next with it. I am facing this now while writing my second Master's thesis and I am thinking now: ""..ok it is nice engaging with the effort and this process is really beneficial.."" but after that I am done nd the next step would be finding a job which is not appealing to me at all.

It was a reward, but it wasn't planned ahead, and I only did it once. But I feel like this is a way to both work hard and get a nice reward without lowering the dopamine baseline.

@iSimka1,You didn't mention the relation between meditation and dopamine release. Or I didn't catch it.  Anyway I perceive the whole buddhism goal as a mechanism how to ged rid of suffering which you attain through getting rid of the attachment. Which in fact leads in reducing the distance between peaks and valleys of dopamine release. Which in my understanding should increase your baseline level of dopamine.  What do you think? This is at least how I perceive meditation linked to dopamine release. But it is possible that I am biased because I have never had problems with focusing on the effort itself. And the meditation itself has the calming effect on the mind.,3년 전,0,
@autumnsilverwolves,"What do you do when your dopamine is naturally depleted? For over a decade, I've found it harder and harder to do anything, even with antidepressants and antianxiety meds. It literally takes me hours to get out the door to get to the library, which is only a 15-minute walk. I build up fines and don't care. I finally cared that I didn't care, and I owed over $100. There are times when it has gotten so bad that I'm laying down, or sitting, and not even being able to make myself get up to do anything.

@MOAB-UT,"It's important to acknowledge that ""Dopamine"" is just one piece of the puzzle. Consider how there are many high achievers who routinely violate all of these dopamine rules and do great. Many functioning alcoholics thrive in sales roles. Studies have shown they tend to do better than sober folks since they are more outgoing. Then there are low achievers who follow every step of this advice and still fail. I believe that ""long term"" success is about balance.   First and foremost, people need to be in somewhat control of their mind, body and lives.  That is foundational. Balance also includes being in generally good health which usually includes eating well and exercising. When this stress is reduced, it has numerous benefits which certainly include chemical benefits however my point is that we are not merely chemical factories.  We are souls first, followed by our chemistry- though if we are sick, that may flip real quick. Even the highest achiever won't be very motivated if they have a hang over! Chemical reactions are super important but so are many other things. Why is it that some thrive under high pressure situations and other crumble? Some people can listen to music, work out, then do work using two monitor screens and watch two videos simultaneously- both playing at 1.5x speed. Everyone is different so it is important to never lose site of the big picture which includes the entire person, mind, body and spirit.",3년 전,0,

@JFactotum,"I am very annoyed by your presentation.  Up front, you should have said clearly what emotion a person feels when the amount of dopamine increases, or what its effect feels like in common terms. Cravings and rewards sound almost opposite to me, so does it create both? You talked about increasing levels with cold water before you even stated plainly why we want increases, as if everyone already knows what dopamine is and what it is for, and yet you keep going back to saying ""dopamine hit"" is a misleading concept.  Well, you never gave a simple replacement for that misleading concept. You also use vague terms like ""is associated with"" and ""depends on.""  If the level depends on the baseline level, we still don't know what the dependency is: direct correlation, inverse correlation, what?

I'm asking this because while I am trying to learn coding and most of the times it feels overwhelming when I'm unable to solve a problem, suddenly it feels like this is not for me and I shut it down. However, I really want to complete what I've taken up so I come back the next day try doing the same thing and get stuck again. This is going on for years now and it's hampering my motivation and has made me more anxious day by day. How do I keep up my motivation and change the way my brain sees problems?

I had over 35 surgeries before I was 19. I can not maintain enough thrive and motivation to accomplish anything. Because of my faith I'd never take my life because I know it's not my own. But I don't want to live. People act like they don't understand. But they aren't trying to understand. I feel like I was suppose to fall for something but I didn't. I am still here so no one knows what to say. The best view of people is from the bottom. No one cared what I thought so they dropped their guard. I got to see their true colors. Because there's no accountability upheld for how I am treated I've became vulnerable to the worst kind of predators....wicked people in high places. We have stopped hearing each other.

@ndndndnnduwjqams,"“Don’t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort, and don’t spike dopamine after engaging in effort. Learn to spike dopamine from effort itself.” - Andrew Huberman 1:47:31   So to recap..  1) Don't trigger dopamine all the time, even if gained through various sources. Try to dopamine fast.   2) Cold showers can raise dopamine without the crash.   3) Don't layer in dopamine raising activities with things you want to get more motivated for. E.g Listening to music while working.   4) Don't reward yourself before or after hard activities, let the activity itself produce dopamine.   5) Intermittent schedule of celebrating your wins. Don't celebrate every time and use a randomiser to dictate when to celebrate.  6) exception to the rule is caffeine (I.e coffee, tea) 1:20:00 1:19:45 Coffee good in moderation, Drugs and energy drinks bad  also 7) social media in general are bad because they basically let us waste dopamine that would be released in other circumstances. Pleasure and dopamine can basically become a conscious choice. If we deprive ourselves from dopaminergic situations or behaviours, the ones that do give us dopamine will become very pleasurable.    the achievement shouldnt be the reward, the process itself should be",3년 전(수정됨),12,

Imagine your sole experience on thorazine stretched out over years taken every 24hours. Its herculean mental and emotional survival and navigation. Its the brain Olympics when this many receptors have been occupied and augmented. So many levers pulled.   I am now 8 mos off amitriptyline and all pharma brain drugs after a 9.5 year poly pharm taper and my dopaminergic system is very sick. I am naturally a highly motivated person. Now I can barely complete a task. Increased daily sun direct on eyes charges my brain up with serotonin and dopamine. I use homeopathic L-Dopa drops along with all the neurotransmitters in energetic form. Phenylalanine, cacao, mucuna, 5HTP, tryptophan are all part of my brain injury recovery protocol.   These brain augmenting drugs absolutely cause brain injuries. Chemical, from the inside. Especially the high affinity ligands like amitriptyline. I bet thorazine is high affinity, too. Amitriptyline acts on serotonin, norepinephrine, acetyl choline, dopamine, histamine, calcium, potassium and sodium channels and recently I discovered opiate occupation as well.

@ryang3071,"I would like to know more about this.  Unfortunately growing up I had an absent Mother and a missing Father.  My Mother’s way of dealing with any back talk or anything that strayed away from a “star child” was dealt with by medication.  I was taken from psychiatrist from psychiatrist with a “trial” to each medication and once prescribed and requested for a follow up, would take me to the next and inform them that the previous medication was working but there was still issues with other things.  By 15 years old I was on bipolar, anti-depressants, anti anxiety and anti psychotics and never had a proper evaluation for a diagnosis. At 17 I got away from it and was taken off of it under doctor supervision and haven’t needed it for 10 years.    I’m curious as to what permanent damage that those medications have.  I know I can’t be the only one to have dealt with this, as I saw how easy it was for a doctor to “pencil whip” a script with little to no understanding of what I felt at the time. A typical psych appointment was 25-55 minutes of waiting in the waiting room and 5 minutes of being told what was wrong with me and that I’m going on a new medication.

Is there a relation between our so called comfort zone and the baseline level of dopamine and the fact that sometimes we don't want to grow in life of in other words we lose our driver to grow in life?

@BeRightBack131,"I'm 60. My sister is 68. My younger sister is 52. NONE of us, including our mother when she was alive,  ever took a single dose of any kind of hormone therapy. Women have been going through menopause since the beginning of time. It's as natural as breathing,  giving birth, etc etc. Besides, who wants to ingest the urine of pregnant mares, lol? That's what it's made of. It's also incredibly cruel to the horses.  They're chained in a standing only stall their entire lives, artificially inseminated, a tube inserted in their ureter to collect urine.  As soon as they give birth, the babies are killed and they're artificially impregnated again. The urine that gets collected is dehydrated and compressed into a pill form. So when you swallow it with water,  you're rehydrating the urine. Sounds yummy, doesn't it? 🤢 Anyway,  just thought you should know there are many,  many women who never take hormone replacement therapy,  and do just fine. Matter of fact, I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life. I really don't know why, but it could have something to do with being in menopause,  or it could be something else. 🤔  All I know is none of the women in my family ever used hormone replacements, and I personally am quite happy and well adjusted.  I'm not sure women really need that replacement,  or if it's a man thing where THEY think we should take it 🤔 🤷‍♀️. And like I said, women have been surviving menopause for thousands of years. Matter of fact,  I think this latest generation is actually the first to take a horse pee pill 💊 (lol) to alleviate something that is as natural as breathing.",3년 전,0,

@PedroD25B11,"Hey guys I have I dubious question but here it goes. In the past 6 months I just stopped drinking alcohol at all, simply because I didn't go to parties anymore and didn't feel like drinking, but the alcohol used to help me in social relations in some events and eventually I will be back in these parties/events when I consider that the pandemic ""over"". So since the effects of the alcohol in my body is the least thing I want for me, so I though that somehow using another substance would be better for me to socializing and not having a bad impact to my healthy overall as alcohol does, so using L-tyrosine or mucuna pruriens to substitute alcohol would be a good idea? Note that I wouldn't take more than twice a month or so. I know that asking this for some might be dumb or even childish, but overall doesn't hurt to ask and at the end I just want the better overall for me.",3년 전,0,

The XRs seems to make me fell less like ""me"" and more emotional, more grandiose, and that wired but tired feeling, and the crash lasts days it seems like.. meanwhile the immediate-release DRAs feel more like a cup of coffee + theanine after a good nights rest but it still I still feel like I am myself, and I barely notice when the effects wear off because I am able to still relax.  It wasn't always like this but really only in the last year or so -- none my docs have had good answers but could this be because liver metabolism or genetics?

It eventually wore off without any ostensible side effects. My girlfriend was so worried that she picked me up from the hospital and brought me to my favorite restaurant for a steak and live entertainment. An old school rock band was playing. She's old school--when in doubt, bring on the percussion and feed him. I never went near the bottle of huperzine again, although I didn't throw it out.

I have a question (just want to check that I got it right): is it possible that some people have a lower dopamine baseline (genetics, other issues) than the general population? If yes, I understand from this episode that the only ways to truly increase the baseline is though cold exposure, dopamine fasting and training the mind to enjoy the effort and not (so much) the reward. Is this correct? Note that I'm talking about the actual baseline.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@bethesun4209,"This is incredible...! I've been meditating for many years now, but only as of recently I've started using self-hypnosis to advance myself (and more specifically, to let go of bad habits). I've been using an affirmation of ""My mind and my thoughts are always enhancing my self-betterment and my advancement in all aspects of existence"". I do not really visualize the end result, but I focus this statement in my aura - basically programming the energy around my body (that also affects the thoughts inside my head) to act that way.  I know this can be considered ""pseudoscience"" but regardless... I had been following a drawing tutorial online, and PRIOR to starting self-hypnosis I had great difficulty with it! I would always take many-breaks in-between and feel very troubled by my inability to ""do it right"". And indeed, although I practiced a lot, I didn't see the end result I was supposed to see.  Now, two or three days after I started this self-hypnosis I noticed something that I did NOT understand the biology behind it - but I do now!! I noticed that, although I was still struggling to get the result I wanted, I had started loving doing it! I had started loving the struggle of it - the trying to do it again and again! I had started thinking ""it's alright, I know it's difficult but I'm trying! That's what's important!""... This is insane because I had zero knowledge about how dopamine works... This is the first video I'm watching on this subject.  I am extremely happy on how my affirmation worked, even without me realizing the science behind it.  Thank you so much for this video! I have also bookmarked more videos of you to watch in the future. This information is pure gold, and especially for people who have zero knowledge about these things (like myself :P ).

I’m not sure if it’s from that or one of the other things mentioned in the video. The best thing I got from the video was Yerba mate, cold showers, and dopamine fasting. I also suffer from anxiety (which is one reason I stopped my adderall prescription, along with just not wanting to take it anymore because of this high and crash effect).

@saj1dsal33m,"Actionable: 	- Cold showers can raise dopamine without the crash.  	- You cannot raise your dopamine level by lying to yourself but talking to yourself, being positive and finding and acknowledging what is pleasurable about an activity can certainly raise your base level dopamine. Also don't say I hate this but I love the reward I give myself afterward. 	- Addiction to a behavior can severely affect dopamine base level and won't let you be productive elsewhere  	- Dopamine system can replenish itself if you avoid engaging in addictive behaviors and your base level of dopamine may get back  	- Don't let an activity give you a very big high, have an intermittent schedule. Start paying attention to what gives you what level of dopamine release and start modulating it. Key is intermittent. 	- Layering different sources of dopamine during an activity can affect base level of dopamine, enjoy that activity only no music no phone. 	- Caffeine is good for dopamine receptors GPCR's (Chain bucket example) so caffeine is kind of the only exception.. 	- Remaining in a cold shower or bath by slowing breathing, dilating your gaze or try to get energized by leaning into the cold.   	- Forcing yourself to engage in hard work by motivating yourself and friction of that hard will become enjoyable over time because of rising in dopamine level during that activity and baseline dopamine in the long run.

The study on melatonin isn't one that included women, it is quite old, melatonin is related to healthy immunity which has been highlighted repeatedly during the pandemic, favourable outcomes for those who have a full 8 hours sleep. Given the suppression of dopamine, one could even argue the beneficial effects for those who do suffer from mania or other disorders related to elevated dopamine.

@avinashprasadfilms,"Notes. -> There is no such thing as a ""dopamine hit"". There's a basline level of dopamine always in your body. -> Dompamine levels actually drop after you have a peak dopamine experience. -> There are two kinds of dopamine release tonic and phasic. -> Dopamine is not a neurotransmitter it's a neuromodulator. Difference: neurotransmitter is a chemical substance released by the neuron to send signals to the next neuron, while the neuromodulator is a chemical substance released by the neuron to alter the effectiveness of the signal transmission.  -> There two neural circuits for dopamine in your brain one for movement and one for motivation (drive and craving). The names of those neural pathways....i don't know how to spell.  -> The more you engage with an activity or behaviour and appreciate it, the more dopamine get's associated with it i.e your subjective experience has an impact on the rewarding (or non-rewarding property of an activity or behaviour)  -> Motivation and craving in evolutionary terms is foraging and seeking. Dopamine is a driver for us to seek things.  -> The Pain-Pleasure Balance: If you do or take something that rises your dopamine greatly (pleasure), afterwards you're low on dopamine (pain) because there isn't enough to maintain your baseline levels. -> But then if you keep exploiting that particular peak-dopamine activity to make you feel better again, you keep depleting your dopamine and thus further lower your baseline level...that's how addiction starts.  -> What is the healthy way to engage in Dopaminergic activities and substances: intermittent release of dopamine or intermittent reward schedule. Dopamine Reward-prediction error.  ->  Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Rewards. Associating the reward in the effort itself, rather than the end goal. -> Tip: Don't spike dopamine before engaging in effort or after engaging in effort.

Being only a physicist/engineer I find it is easy to follow your work. Thank you!   Dopamine receptors. So, is there also a mechanism as with many hormones (example insulin) where the sensitivity of the receiving end due to over exposure decreases - ie would the dopamine receptors count decrease with increased level of baseline dopamine?  With regards to fasting: while it is fascinating to learn about the all encompassing power of dopamine system, the effects or should I say straight - the benefits range of fasting extends much further. It would be fair to state that the whole biology of the body changes quite dramatically during fasting due to many mechanisms; among of which the dopamine is with the more potent ones.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@tiagosillaspereira8590,"As he explained, the problem is not the release itself, the problem it's HOW it is released. For instance, if you release dopamine in a peak form using a drug, a lot of the dopamine being produced and stored in the vesicles of the neurons are going to be released to attend the request. On the other hand, if there was a way to release it in a transient way (with less of a peak during more time), the levels of dopamine wouldn't change that much, because there would be enough time to restore the levels during this release. This transient way of releasing is the cold water exposure, for example.  You should think that the body continiously produces dopamine to be stored in the neurons vesicles. Yes, it is a limited currency, because lots of things and behaviors use dopamine, even muscle movement, that's why the molecule has to be produced all the time, in order for us to live and move. What matters most, as I said earlier, is how it is released.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

@tiagosillaspereira8590," @kissenklauer7011  Yeah! That makes sense, there are probably some natural substances that have this long lasting effect on dopamine release, but unfortunately I don't any of those. In my opinion, I think that all comes to how much receptors of dopamine you have available, how sensible you are allowing yourself to be to the molecule. As Andrew said, to reach new heights in sensitivity to a substance you have to deprive yourself from it for longer periods.",3년 전,0,
@kissenklauer7011," @tiagosillaspereira8590  another thing that would be good to know is, does a higher receptor density mean released dopamine is ""used up"" faster, or is the dopamine metabolized anyway and the more you can make use of it while its circulating, the better?",3년 전,0,
@tiagosillaspereira8590," @kissenklauer7011  To be honest, I'm not sure. One of the things that a high receptor density means is that the odds of dopamine to connect to the receptor are higher.

@essennagerry,"Hello Bruce, thank you so much for your comment! I have a question for you. I think I have big troubles with dopamine (phone addiction!) and struggle to be even a little bit productive. Even easy tasks are incredibly hard. Even when I start and push through for a long time I still keep quitting. I think this points to a big dopamine problem.  My strategy is to become very radical starting from tomorrow. (Gathering some more practical information today.) So far I have decided:  1. Stop using a smartphone alltogether, for about two months at least, maybe longer 2. Exercise every morning 3. Have cold showers every morning (I don't know which is better to do first - I think cold showers) 4. Eat some eggyolks and small amounts of coffee 5. cut out sugar from my diet (it really does make my brain foggy for between 2 and 4 hours!) 6. Try to actively enjoy the very process of hard work  Now, I finally come to my question! How do I do point 6 the best way? Here is my idea: Focuing on the friction and enjoying the friction so it evokes dopamine. How can I do that? Focus on how much I want to have that skill (I really do want it) and how great it is and feels to be in the process of building it up!  Do you think this will work?  Would there be anything in my plan you would change or something you would add?  Many thanks in advance!",3년 전,0,
@BruceThomson," @essennagerry  Good on you.  I exercise first thing in the day, before ice bath . After the bath, although I'm very zingy with energy, but the cold seems to deprive me of good sustained energy level for running or weights etc. .Same regarding eating - better to exercise with good clean empty stomach running. In ancient times, we often had to run after prey, on an empty stomach, and had clearer head, etc. when hungry. Even in the for to eight hours after eating, I feel weaker and uncomfortable doing physical work. Digesting food is itself work for the body, in addition to the exertion - I'm myself new to the idea of cultivating 'enjoyment' of the struggle, the duress. BUT the way I'll do it will be my usual creation of visualizations about myself, and affirmations (declarations of self-definition that shape my self-attitude, and indeed, my very IDENTITY. I've already firmly defined myself as a person tough enough to ice bath every day, fast 16 hours a day, exercise almost every day, etc. I've created all kinds of images and videos that automatically appear on my PC background, telling me who I am. Who do you actually want to be? What kind of a person? Can you picture yourself like that? Do a Google to find images that inspire it, and if possible, past yourself INTO those pictures. 'Extremely powerful effect. - Truly, the ice bath, after 7 months gradually getting used to it, isn't that much of a hardship. I especially have used 'distraction' to reduce the suffering - I always sing a brave seafaring song, I focus on developing excellent diction (for public speaking in future) and being in tune despite some gasps that distort my breathing. I always also, though still also 'study' - think - what's happening to me, and use the discoveries to steer future events.  - I'm bemused by the smart phone habit. I would have thought you could set yourself policies less drastic. E.g. a chain of habit that only gives you an hour of it before you 'have to' do something else like going to work, or cooking dinner. Personally I use my PC all day long,  prob about 10 hours a day,. It's both serious work, constant crucial learning, and also fun like social networking, which develops my thoughts. I take good breaks - I set up a break reminder to happen every hour, and often obey it. 'Not addicted.  - I'm highly fired up by other activities like renovating, going out.",3년 전,0,
@essennagerry," @BruceThomson  Thank you very much for your reply, it's very helpful!  As for the phone habit - sadly I've tried less drastic measures and I keep sliding back to the old habits, using my phone for ""fun stuff"" many hours over my intent, and it's not even fun anymore. That's why I think I should be drastic at least for a little while, then when my dopamine is better regulated I will use my smartphone again but with restrictions which I'll actually stick to haha.

Also, people don't seem decided on the exact causes (accumulated stress? fatigue? loss of purpose? etc), but given that it's something that arises over time, I wonder if it is because of or at least is associated with dopamine depletion. After all, completing tasks normally provides dopamine fluctuation (notice I didn't ""hits""! thanks for clarifying that...) and motivation to complete another one. With job burnout, so many describe the experience as finding the work they do no longer gratifying, they lose motivation and just go through the motions - sounds pretty aligned with how you describe dopamine depletion. So my questions remain: if dopamine depletion is part of burnout, is this correlation or causation? And how can one specifically serve their dopamine system to help with burnout?",3년 전(수정됨),1,

@BE-tw9de,"@Eugenius Benediktus as far as I understand the point is that you raise your dopamine cap for the next time you'll do that particular activity. So if you're used to listen to music before studying or working, when you don't get the chance you'll fell like shit and won't be as motivated. You basically add more conditions to your performance. Also, if you release a lot of dopamine by adding up many pleasurable activities, you'll increase your dopamine but undergo a crash later. This is true for any activity. The guy also said that basically people that are very active and get to do many dopaminergic activities in the long run end up like addicts, in the sense that they don't feel the same drive they used to before. That's because you keep getting highs all the time. The rule is: beside cold showers, every time you get dopamine you'll undergo a low, too. So the highs can't be too high and can't be too many, because the consequence will be bigger crashes. time stamp: 62:13",3년 전(수정됨),56,

@TheSpecialJ11," @BE-tw9de  I like to think about it in that your brain receptors are equilibrium seeking. Set the equilibrium high and it will be difficult to achieve it so you'll always feel low. Set it low and achieving it will be so easy you'll always feel fine, with occasional spikes of greatness that you have to allow yourself to recover from. The more dopamine you give yourself, the higher that bar becomes, which is why ""dopamine detoxing"" is so popular. What you're really doing is decreasing the intensity of dopamine release allowing the receptors to upregulate and keep your baseline at a better, more fulfilling level. Constant use of porn, sugar, video games, drugs, or even the more innocuous music, podcasts, etc. will bring your baseline down to the point where dull moments become unbearably dull. Waiting for your doctor's appointment becomes so boring you immediately jump to memes on your phone rather than sit quietly a minute or read a book. Reading a nonfiction textbook for class becomes arduous without music, a sugary latte, Adderall, and the promise of chocolate at the end because you've forced low dopamine activities to be high ones and now your brain thinks the lower dopamine state is abysmally low by comparison.",3년 전,19,

@akinolaorederu4872," @BE-tw9de  Lets avoid ""good"" and ""bad"" and just talk about what would happen. So if you are very affective at convincing yourself that hardworking is rewarding you will get a spike in dopamine every time you work hard. The more friction you experience the bigger the spike. If you are getting big spikes all the time from hard work your baseline of dopamine will fall and you will crave hard work. When this goes further you will essentially be addicted to hardwork; you'll crave it, nothing else will be satisfying, and even hard work itself won't do much for you.  If you actually become addicted to hard work that probably means you're doing well in terms of accomplishing things, but you won't feel good. At that point all you need to do is take a break from hard work or avoid the feeling of high friction. From there you can try to find the right balance to maintain a high dopamine baseline or you can just accept that every once in a while you have to take a break.  This wouldn't be the worst problem to have lol",3년 전,7,
@akinolaorederu4872,Now for a question of my own: from my interpretation if someone wanted to be extreme and only cared about working on their goals they should cut out all pleasurable activities (anything that spikes dopamine) that do not work toward their goals.

@Fuzzdope," @jacobjanes6953  had the same question. if going to the gym increases dopamine then when exactly am I supposed to schedule it in before getting hard work done. Huberman says no dopamine before otherwise it’ll make the work harder to endure. but then he also says no dopamine after because that would be associating dopamine to reward. also say I don’t engage in any dopamine peaking behavior until after completing hard work, is any sort of action I do in the hours after (ex. use social media) considered to be a reward. what else are we supposed to do after and then when else can we just relax to use our phones or watch tv or whatever.",2년 전,0,
@L.I.T.H.I.U.M," @jacobjanes6953  No dopamine before hard work (gym) because your dopamine will dip afterwards (while you're exercising). And not rewarding yourself after hard work (gym) is based on the logic that you'll associate the hard work (gym) with the reward, and not learn to release dopamine while working hard itself, our goal. So, try to not associate hard work with reward by not getting cheap dopaminergic hits afterwards, like using social media, watching a movie or TV show, masturbating etc. Instead, you can do things that are neither reward nor work, like making & eating healthy food after exercising, taking a shower (not too enjoyable, adjust the temp accordingly), doing dishes etc. Depends on what you find neutral these days. Then, after an hour or so, you can follow the same protocol of not spiking dopamine too much by adding cheap dopaminergic activities together, like in my case not watching an episode of a TV show, while checking social media from time to time (shut you smartphone down), not checking news, not drinking something with high sugar, not pausing it and opening a YT video in a new tab, not sitting in very bad (but enjoyable) posture, not chewing a gum, not replying to messages, etc.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

@robertaronov3063,"Hello, Dr. Huberman!   I think I’m in disbelief because of how simply you put it (it’s a compliment).   The question is, if I engage in doing more work, like studying, eventually I will like it because I have convinced my self that I need it and allowed my brain (if I’m not mistaken amygdala) to calm down because I am admitting to my self that it is not pleasureful, but necessary.   A follow up question is: How do I control the baseline of my dopamine, if we are in a society where we have a ton of dopamine stimulation? Do you mean I shouldn’t, for example, eat something savory or text, or have some intensely pleasureful activity prior to the action I want to stimulate?  To clarify, how small of an activity in pleasureful things should it be so that I will do the necessary thing better?  Does it also mean that I can’t listen to your podcasts often now?

@dr.princess832,"I'm only 28 minutes in but I think I just understand why relying on motivation to do something is one of the shitties ideas ever. Obviously, it feels right: dopamine high -> we want to do somthething = motivation. But if you want to do something that you DON'T want to do and motivate yourself before than somewhere in the middle of doing the task you're going to feel lethargic and since chemical stuff is more powerfull than the pleasure of simply getting something done you're not going to feel satisfied by finishing your task. You're going to remember that you didn't enjoy finishing the task. And you're going to remember that it was very hard to finish. So the next time doing it you won't feel motivated to do the task whereas someone who only relied on dopamine from finishing the task will. So reapeat it for a couple of months and you'll just end up hating doing that task. Whereas someone who didnt motivate themselves before and, I don't know, let's say, studied or went for a run first thing in the morning, before he consumed food, coffee or nicotine, is going to enjoy not only finishing the task, but also staring it.   Anyway, if you read all of it, can you maybe give a little critique? Because I'm not sure I understand. Thanks!",3년 전,0,

I know it's been over-discussed recently but I expect to live past 100. I'm having challenges getting the fat off around my midsection. I've been strength training for 10 months now, and I know that it's something in my diet that's getting in the way. Throughout this process and changes in my diet, I've learned I can't eat dairy, bananas and oranges -- my midsection bloats like crazy. And when I eat bananas it's as if I've eaten a whole cake. I could barely stomach a third of a banana before I just stopped them altogether recently. I'm thinking this is a cortisol/adrenalin/insulin issue. When I fast and then eat only greens coming off my fast, I feel a lot better. But I feel deprived. I'm a southern-bred girl so basically changed my entire eating routine.

If you can't ""catch"" cancer, diabetes, MS, arthritis, etc., from other people, then you can't ""catch"" colds, flu and Boogey Viruses. So governments around the world are CAUSING fear frights in everyone based on an unproven THEORY by one man, Louis Pastaur, who redacted his claim of the germ theory on his death bed, yet no one listened. So of course, when everyone is allowed to escape the hostage situation the governments have put their people into, and they start relaxing about the Boogey Virus, that's not in any way transmissible, they will begin their healing phase (get sick), and believe they then have it, and more panic will ensue as well as martial law. The longer people allow this government to hold them hostage in their homes, the more severe the ""sickness"" will be. Can anyone put 2 and 2 together to figure out what I'm saying??

@thatyordle1504,"So interesting! I gather from what you said that people with ADHD may need to take substances that increase dopamine, yet I am confused because of some of the other information. Should ADHD medication be taken more intermittantly in order to then not highten the baseline, but only give spikes when more difficult tasks for example have to be done? Also, both you and Edward Hallowell mention social interaction as very important for dopamine. He calls it the other Vitamin C, or Vitamin Connect. Would love to hear an episode with him as a guest. I know you have already covered a lot about ADHD, but I think this is a topic that is very interesting and also (at least seemingly) very complex. One aspect I would love to know more about is rewards (or also negative consequences) and ADHD. There is a lot of sources stating how rewards or also negative consequences are important for helping motivation with ADHD, and how gamification of important tasks can help. But if rewarding only lowers the general baseline again, then how could that help? It certainly seems to help to some extent, but in the long term, is it making the symptoms worse? And what would you count as a reward? For example ticking off a box on the todolist can feel motivating, but would this be enough of a ""reward"" to hurt? And for someone who has ADHD and has a hard time finding and keeping routines (which do help), can some sort of gamification help sustain these routines? Or what other strategies could potentially work? Thank you for all the important work you do and for sharing with us! Very happy to have found your channel! <3",3년 전,0,

@jojisamuel6765,"Im sharing only my intuition after watching this video:: When you started studying while listening to music, you are more motivated. Because in the past you were studying without music and now you have additional dopamine and so more gap from the prior. So, few days or weeks later your prior dapamine is set to new level i.e. with music and you are less motivated compared to you initially were.  And one day you suddenly stop music and starts to study, now you dont even have that additional dopamin. And you are even less motivated to study than you were before you started to study with music. But this is temporary. It does not degrade your ability to study without music forever. After few days of no study or without music your dopamin prior level reset and now you can listen to music for more motivation. So, it would be better to listen music in random days while studying.",3년 전,2,
@mellowstone1513,"​ @jojisamuel6765  Those were my thoughts too, initially, therefore I tried analyzing my behavior in the last days and I've noticed some interesting things:  1. Most of the time putting my headset on means business. With or without music. It helps me to better concentrate, probably just for blocking outside noise. I can't remember a time when I didn't listen to music when learning/doing homework as a child, and then later, at work. I think it has become a habit and somehow even a reflex and I associate music with concentration. During the activity, when I have to really focus on something, I stop the music to perform better, but the headset stays on. 2. My motivation to learn/work doesn't decrease when I don't listen to music, is just that the activity starts when the music starts.  3. There may be a dopamine increase from changing the music to something I prefer that day? I've noticed it helps with activities not related with thinking (cleaning/physical activities). When I need to think, I've noticed that it helps to listen to music that reflects my mood that day, or else I prefer no music at all.   I've read several studies about listening to music for better concentration and most of them show a positive correlation. I'm not sure if there is a long term detriment, by lowering the baseline dopamine levels and that is my main concern. Haven't found anything related to this topic.",3년 전,0,

He told me to cut down on my coffee in the summer of 2018. A few months later I was stressed and asked if I was losing my mind or had ADHD. He said simply, ""You do not have ADHD, go see this psychologist."" In 2020, after talking to a couple of psychologists, and me revisiting the ADHD again after months of reading about it, he sent me to a specialist. Yes... ADHD... I was given Vyvanse... and told to continue to increase it. When I said that I felt I needed a few days off from it every week, he told me that's not how it works and to take it daily. After a few months of the highest doses every day, I lost the will to live. Seriously. I was languishing.   I quit the med... Three days later felt better. FFS... But not as good as I felt before the drug.   I have asked for a small dose of Adderall and a small dose of Wellbutrin but was given Biphentin and told to increase that as needed.   NOOOOOO.... So, after more reading, I took a risk and took the tiniest dose of vyvanse and a tiny dose of biphentin, every two or three days and VOILA! A bit of help and focus...

@ElaHHarrison,"Dear Prof Huberman, just another quick comment, regarding huperzine A. As outlined in my earlier note on your eating disorders podcast, my physiology/neurology are not typical, but I wanted to share, as you mentioned you hadn't experimented personally with huperzine A. I was experimenting with nootropics about five years ago and obtained some powdered huperzine A, because I (thought I had) observed an especially positive response to acetylcholine. This was a microgram dose item, and I weighed it out quite carefully one evening but added a little extra. One of the worst nights of my life! If I hadn't been able to identify excessively activated acetylcholine, I'd have been really frightened. Insane saliva literally pumping out, extremely florid hallucinations, incredible nausea, shakes and sweats -- everything about it was extreme. I've never taken psychedelics, but this was like the worst bad trip I'd ever heard described. I was foolish enough to try again a few weeks later with a much smaller amount -- same results, just slightly less bad. Both times took a long time to recover from. Although an acetylcholine overdose was clearly at issue, I always wondered afterwards why it was so bad when I do so well with acetylcholine in general (and so very badly with any and all anticholinergics). Your mention of the implication of dopamine is perhaps the clue, maybe especially for someone like myself with bipolar/psychosis. I suppose this is a cautionary tale, but just wanted to share.

@TheHaggis007,first time i have listened to this podcast and found it very informative and interesting.I like Andrews delivery style.

I now feel I have some tools and methods to help regulate my dopamine levels and I looking forward to experimenting with those.  I used to love MDMA because I felt so good whilst on it but I see now how that leads to a big crash afterwards. The positive side of the drug is that it shows in a really powerful and existential way how these neuro chemicals impact our feelings and behaviors. Less is definitely more though with this chemical and the natural route is sustainable. would like to see a discussion between Andrew and Prof David Nutt (neuropsychopharmacologist).

@DylanZucker,"This episode was incredible. Great in depth explanation along with real world application.  As thorough as it was, however, I still feel that there’s a slim piece missing that I’d love to discover further.   Despite utilizing effort within itself as a mode for dopamine release, humans typically rationalize exertion and persistent effort by first plotting a goal to achieve that would justify that effort. My question is, if we try to set ‘effort’ as our main long-term dopamine release strategy should our overarching “goal” be set on becoming the best version of ourselves? (Surely there is a huge delta between the utility of persistent effort in arranging your household condiments and consistently working out for example) If effort is the goal, where do we decide to aim that effort for the highest and best result?",3년 전,2,
@F-Bek,"I have a ""But"", can somebody help me?  Ok: If I learn to spike dopamin from effort itself its a good think, we all agree on that i think.  The But: But won't that result in a crash as well? And how much effort (and in that sense dopamin release) can we put in until our dopamin reserve is empty?  The thought process: He says that when you release dopamin while putting in effort, you have basically unlimited energy (because dopamin controlls adrenalin = no quitting). But we also have a reserve which, when empty, crashes our mood. So: Effort releases Dopamin which makes me put in more effort (Good!) which then releases more dopamin, more effort, more dopamin, crash, no effort. right?",3년 전,0,

It is the physiological meaning of the religious dictum that sin is the basin of rebirth; in that moment, you can acknowledge that the pain and suffering you are enduring correspond to an overcoming of weakness, which you've cultivated by way of procrastination, lying (to yourself, or others, or both), cutting corners, etc. The lying itself is not a convincing mechanism; you have to understand the significance of the endurance you are engaging in--I'd conjecture that saying these things to yourself calls your attention to precisely that fact.",3년 전,0,

We all wish that there was an easy way to achieve success but the truth is that the path to success is rough. Sometimes it takes years of effort and hard work to see the results you want while other times you may not see the results the same way as you desire. One must remember that success is not just about achieving goals but building qualities and attributes that can lead to success in any field.

@vadsmixinglab11,"Along the amazing stuff its clear that it still comes from a place of ""if you dont feel good,fix it"" .. I think the biggest dopamine detox is to stop escaping negative emotions and thoughts and allow them completely..what you find then is that the body rebalances everything to its right levels..  It seems like you have a lotttt of knowledge but its still on ina sperated/non holistic view, so when you don't have dopamine and encounter sadness like you mentioned, youre like ""what do i do to stop the sadness"", and the paradox is that when you give total freedom to any  inner state to be as it is without acting fr suppression or identification, you really wont need to bother about dopamine   To look at it at a strictly chemical/physical view without the spiritual element of how the ego/conditioned identity is structured is just a partial view of it..  The down you feel after achievements you thought would give you pleasure is because youre invested and seek happiness from the outside and ""things"".. the dopamine affect is just the chemical menifastation of that in your body, its not ""THE"" thing to understand..the spiritual process gets you there and then these explanations just ground that into chemistry and science..to look for the ultimate goal from science wont work since its such a detached and partial view of the whole picture",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Why is it ok to take cold showers routinely, which spike our dopamine levels as high as cocaine, but not use our phone during a short intense workout? If transient spikes decrease dopamine baseline, it sounds like we should always try to avoid them, no? Is the ideal goal then to never experience transient spikes in dopamine? If so, why would we ever want to take something that directly spikes dopamine as he mentioned he does himself?

He was not clear on why cold showers don't lower the baseline, only that there is a gradual reduction in dopamine vs a sharp drop from a transient spike. Is the goal not to keep baseline high while avoiding transient dopamine spikes? Maybe I just answered one of my questions by suggesting that cold showers are distinctly different from transient spikes (with a crash) vs a more gradual decrease back to baseline.

I want to be able to control my dopamine like a volume on an amp and turn it to 11 when I have to study and do coursework. Now to increase the throughput of my dopamine, my batch sizes/baseline would need to increase while maintaining no change with defects/ any variance below the baseline.

@TheIllerX,"Very good insights into how our dopamine and motivation system works. I am struggling understanding that part about trying to attach dopamine release to the process instead of looking at goals etc. I get what we want the result to be. If we attach dopamine release to the process, this will make us motivated to to things for the sake of doing them and that we know it is good for us. But how to actually accomplish this is a bit fuzzy to me.  So when we feel stress and pain and really don't like what we are doing, we shall tell ourselves we like it because it is good for us to try to somewhat trick ourselves into believing it? This part is confusing to me. My inner psychology don't seem to work like that. I cannot just logically reason with myself or try to fool myself to alter my feelings for something in some substantial way.  I think I somewhat miss the message here. I get that it is a good idea to get motivated by the process itself, like trying to find what is interesting in the process and the details you are learning and appreciate that you get to learn more. But when listening here, is sounds more like you should be in stress and pain and learn to like it? To me it sounds like that would take an enormous amount of energy resulting in some internal battle between two voices where one tells you it is very painful and the other one tells you it is good for you? This sounds like something that would ruin the focus on what I am reading totally if I am busy in an internal battle of conflicting voices.  The message here is a bit too abstract for me to really get a hold on. At the same time I really want to understand this because it seems to be really improtant for the motivation.  Edit :I have listened to that part of the video concerning this several times now. So as I understand it, one should tell oneself ""The effort is the good part."" so many times that we actually start to believe it internally. And also to realize that this is not actually lying to ourselves, since the effort actually is the good and constructive part even if it can feel a bit painful at the moment. When I think about it, it is actually our feelings of pain and resistance that is lying to us in the first place, so it is more like trying to tell us the truth.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

But what about debilitating things that never gets talked about and which is seriously lacking in research? So… talking about myself but many others as well: I have Tourette’s and Endometriosis, and I would LOVE to find some new opinions on these on how to manage them.  But even just endo. So many women suffer from it and it has serious effects on mental health, clear thinking and proper functioning overall. Brain fog, depression, vertigo, pain, gi problems,… a long list.  It’s cool that you dedicated a podcast on depression. But women (or trans ppl) really deserve a podcast of their own about endo.  I think it would shed a much needed light on the seriousness of the condition which is being gaslighted out of public (and personal) discourse.  Of course… you can’t be an expert on everything. But I feel everyone is talking about the things that are talked about a lot.

@EvanG2x,It's interesting that your baseline changes. So say you move somewhere new and you're meeting new people and get a huge rush of dopamine. Eventually your roommates start to not be so incredibly interesting... You still like them but things kind of change a bit. Could you potentially use the motivation of wanting more dopamine as a way to propell you through life? Another example would be that you get a job you really like or you start working.. You slowly lose interest but maybe it was exciting before. How would you healthily reset yourself in situations like that or should you even reset yourself?,3년 전,0,

Classic bulldog demeanor perhaps indicates a dopamine deficit. You could give him a treat or? that stimulates dopamine. It might be amusing. There are probably many other ways he could lighten the density of all the useful facts we are receiving . Keep up the excellent (time consuming?) work.  One other compliment...you are a great teacher as you understand that what might be second nature to you can be new news to others.  I've listened/watched infinite informational videos/podcasts.

@xiscanicolas6009,"So what happens to people who tell themselves a practice or habit is good, but it is not? BIG WARNING BELLOW! Yes they get the benefit of dopamine, serotonine etc but they are hurting themselves! Intermittent fasting is not good for everybody and to be proud of pushing our limits - in particular with comparison -  is more about a competitive serotonine than a motivating dopamine... You also see this use of ""virtue signaling"" in people who get extreme in the spectrum of the omnivore diet... If they do it while not needing it for health reasons, they need motivation indeed, but sometimes to the detriment of their health... Those practices are opposing the right somatic behaviour of listening to our body feedback!!!!  Social media is full of groups with intolerant people who use exaltation as a mean to not ""drop off the wagon"" as they say... So, as they are excited, I wouldn't say they freeze, but the parasympathetic blockage can also happen as a dissociation between body feedback and believes! So please be as careful with food as with cold therapy! Yes it is good to make efforts and feel some discomfort, if we have enough resilience AND DO NOT HURT OURSELVES.
