Or Hitler shorter, hard to say.  But anywho, I'm buying some bread. Hitler's buying some bread. So I give him a salute. And he gives me one of those half Hitler salutes. you know, down low very cool. Guess what you forget? He doesn't say heil hitler. Isn't that funny?  So I say to Hitler, I've actually been quite busy. Hitler laughs, and then says, you and me both.  I mean, he is the fuller. It's so funny because it's an understatement. I mean he's super busy. As Hitler was taking his leave of me.  Hitler says, Well, there's no point in getting bread if you're not going to get, and at the same time Hitler said ""cheese"", I said ""cheese"". And then Hitler and I both said ""Jynx"".

Here's what you forget: He doesn't say 'Hail Hitler'! Isn't that funny?? So I say to Hitler, ""I've actually been quite busy."" Hitler laughs, and then says, ""You and me both."" I mean he's the Furer! It's so funny because it's an understatement. I mean he's super busy. As Hitler was taking his leave of me he said, ""Welp, there's no point in getting bread if you're not going to get-"" And at the same time Hitler said ""cheese"" I said ""cheese"".

@chaztency,"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

@NicoAnimation,"If you ignore the actual sketch and listen to the Nazi Officer he really does tell a pretty awesome story. So the other day he's at the local market buying some bread when he notices Hitler and Eva (who is taller than you might think) doing the same thing. As he is rarely up close to Hitler, he also notices that, being near the weekend, the little hairs on either side of Hitler's mustache are starting to grow in. Someone definitely needs a fresh shave! So, the Officer greets Hitler with a standard salute and is stoked when Hitler returns with a down-low half salute, all cool-like, then he realizes how funny it is that Hitler doesn't say ""Heil Hitler"" back like he's used to hearing from everyone else. Starting some small talk, the Officer tells Hitler that he's been quite busy, and is delighted to hear Hitler chuckle with the response, ""you and me both"". What a sense of humor! Finally, if that wasn't enough, the best part of the story reveals that as Hitler begins to leave, he remarks, ""Well, there's no point in getting bread if you're not going to get..."" Then he and the Nazi Officer both say ""cheese"" at the same time, look to each other and both yell ""Jinx!"" Just like a couple of normal guys! I think it's an awesome story and would've have kept interrupting like the Nazi Cadet did.",2년 전,6,

@Manbear7678,"Please ask Jesus into your heart now if you haven't done so already. Each one of us has sinned and needs redemption, each one of us needs to be forgiven of our sins to enter into Heaven, a sinless place where there's no more tears or sorrow, or they will instead go to Hell, a place of torment without anything good, and only Jesus Christ, the messiah, the savior of the world, is able to forgive you of your sins so you may enter and live for eternity in Heaven with God because Jesus came to earth as a man, born of a virgin, a man that lived a perfect life without ever sinning, Jesus was God in the flesh, He performed miracles like giving sight to the blind, curing diseases, and even bringing people back from death, but was hung up on a cross to die like a criminal. That was the sacrifice that saves us from our sins, because the price to pay for sinning is death, but when Jesus, God in the flesh, is sacrificed for his love of us, he paid that price for us, the sins that would have sent us to Hell were borne by Jesus, our savior, on the cross, and by His wounds we are healed. That wasn't the end though, on the 3rd day he rose from the grave, defeating sin and death. Before returning to Heaven, Jesus told his followers to go out and preach the Good News of salvation so that others may be saved as well. I hope that whoever reads this understands that I love you and want the salvation of your soul, because all of us have sinned, nobody but Jesus was ever perfect, and everyone needs his FREE gift of salvation. All you need to do is say in your heart: ""Jesus, I recognize that I am a sinner in need of salvation and that you are the only way to salvation. I ask you to come into my heart and forgive me of my sins. I submit to you as my lord and savior. Please help me to turn away from the sins of my past life and be born again into a new life of living to resist the temptations of sin and serve your holy purpose for my life. In Jesus Christ's name I pray, amen."" If you said that in your heart, congratulations, I'll see you in Heaven. If not, please don't hesitate to confide in me or ask me questions, I'd love to share more about what I know about Jesus and how He's changed my life",3년 전,1,

Clinton supporters spent 4 years screaming that Trump had stolen the 2016 by colluding with Russia, and they used “evidence” that was bought and paid for by Hillary. The FBI knew in early 2017 that all the “evidence” was a lie because they went to England and interviewed the original source of the “intelligence,” and he read the report where his “intel” was used, and he said: “This is bogus. I don’t have any firsthand knowledge of anything. I had no idea that my ‘intel’ was the cornerstone of this report.” They knew this in early 2017, yet they continue to spread the false narrative that the 2016 election was invalid because of Russian Collusion.

How many people close to trump have been ""indicted, arrested and charged"" who are associated with trump? 20? What's that quote that trump lovers use in 2016? ""lock her (him) up? LMAO Me and you both know that Hillary is laughing her ass off right about now! LMAO  I did not vote for Hillary nor trump in 2016. Speaking of Hillary's fanclub voters? They did cry but atleast they didn't try to storm the US Capitol on the day that our nation's electoral votes were gonna be confirmed. I'll take people crying phony tears over a lost election than have bunch of cowards, traitors, whine babies, un-Americans people who stormed our Capitol and attacked Officers over a phony election lie anyday of the week. Trump party is all about law and order? Back the blue? What do our Capitol Police Officers have to say about this? The trump party is full of Hypocrites. SMH   Pres. Biden put an ass whopping on trump in 2020! Won by 7 million votes and would have won Texas had Texas own Attorney General Ken Paxton not blocked voters mail-in ballots when he noticed the outcome was not gonna be good for Trump. It wasn't like Paxton tried to stop the mail-in ballots before the count. No Paxton wanted to see how his Republicans voters were gonna do and then Paxton made the call. Texas is a purple state now and will probably turn blue in 2022-2024. :)  GOP want to put voting laws up to where they can discount any and all voting ballots for whatever reasons. Do you think GOP would discount their own voters vote? LOL Dumbasses are making this situation worst for themselves.

The enlisted guy’s uniform was strange he has one pip which makes him an untersharfuhrer yet he has shoulder boards that looks like a Wehrmacht Unteroffizier and has a chevron on his sleeve which wouldn’t match either rank unless that was a honour chevron for joining the SS early but then he wouldn’t be an enlisted man.

@takaetono6773," @mariguana7918  they were thinking very much the same as the jews did. at first they were surprised and couldnt believe what was going on, they tried to point out they were germans too, caus thats how they (mostly) felt. but that got them nowhere as the nazis didnt care how others felt. so with every step on the way the people got more desperate, tried to flee while still unable to realize how freaking mad the nazis really were and how far they would go. they got stripped of rights and citizenship, were bullied and excluded sovially just as they were not allowed to work anymore. at some point they were sterilized and in the end they got arrested for whatever reason (mostly accused of ""Rassenschande"" meaning they had or wanted sexual relations with germans). It was a fucked up time to live in for anyone. People often forget that nazis werent nice to the other germans either. Millions of ""regular"" germans died in the KZs too, because they were democrats, communists or for whatever reason showed the slightest refusal or disobedience towards the regime. Up to the point when in the last weeks and days nazis were killing other nazis because they werent fanatic enough... The first thing we should learn from that madness is to never let a state or country be run by madmen. We need to rise and rise again as early as possible to show them we wont follow along when they try to take total controle over everything and start acting out violence. Always be aware. Always watch those who are supposed to use state-power for the common good.",5년 전,4,

@siwel7791,"For anyone that somehow manages to make it to the bottom of this comment thread, what the apologists and obvious Nazis above me won't tell you is why the Nazis recruited Non-Aryans and in what roles they served. For some background on Nazi views in recruitment of Non-Aryans in the early war when they were not suffering very severe manpower shortages, when colonial troops of France fought against Nazi onslaught and were captured, they were overwhelmingly shot on the spot by regular German units. Not the SS, regular army units would shoot them. This fantasy idea that these proponents tout that somehow the Nazis were accepting of Africans is a product of Olympic levels of mental gymnastics. While Mein Kampf does not touch on relations with Africans at length because his ambitions were in Europe, he does speak of them in the same vein of the Jews, and advocates their destruction. Related to this is the 1938 Nuremberg laws passed by Hitler, which among other things, banned non-Aryans from ""reaping the benefits of the German state"" which meant that all non-Germans could not use any public service or be a public servant. This by extension means that no non-Aryans were allowed in the Army. Now what you will see these apologists point to is the very small SS units, which were part of the political branch of the Nazi government. These units were often undertrained and made of conscripts, unlike what Hollywood would have you believe (As a side, most all SS units were just as poorly trained as their Army counterparts by 1943-44, just more fanatical). These SS units were recruited to fill holes were German manpower was running out, especially by 1943-44, where you see most of the recruitment of Non-Aryans when severe manpower shortages were deeply effecting the effectiveness of all branches of Military. These units were not respected, not treated well, under-equipped and often sent on the most dangerous work of the fronts while trying to keep them operating in the nation's they were raised from if possible. The notion that the Nazis weren't racist in is purely fantastical, and the proponents of this myth often have ulterior motive for spouting it other than just ignorance.",5년 전,1,

@cwt2670," @BiggieSmalls574  the SS was a section of the Nazi party, membership was mostly restricted to persons who could prove ""Aryan"" purity back several generations. The Waffen -SS, however was the ARMED units of the SS and was composed of conscripts and volunteers from German colonies, occupied lands, enemy POW's, foreign mercenaries, minor allied nations (Germany's allies) and many from European colonies or territories who the Nazis promised to help with independence from their European colonisers. So there were African blacks from German African colonies, Arabs, Chinese, Indians, Japanese, Italians, Turks, Balkans, Russians, all sorts of Asians, other Europeans, Pacific Islanders etc. There were also black Germans and Jewish Germans in both the Waffen SS and regular German military. There were really no racial or religious barriers to Waffen SS membership. The officers were generally from the SS. The Waffen SS was probably the most ethnically diverse military unit in history. The distinction between the Party SS and the military Waffen SS is hardly known, and the two are generally confused.",4년 전,0,

@cwt2670," @17MrLeon  the haircut was a K&P comedic touch. The Nazi Party and SS were generally restricted to those who could prove ""Aryan"" breeding going back a couple generations, but the Wermacht (Army), the Navy and Air Force had non ""Aryans"". Germany had African colonies and there were German black citizens, there were blacks in different branches of the military. The armed military branch of the SS, the Waffen - SS had members of a wide variety of races, ethnicities and religions (including blacks, Arabs, Jews, Indians, Chinese, French, Russians, Balkans etc) composed mostly of conscripts, pow's, volunteers, mercenaries, from colonies, occupied territories, Axis nations and lesser German allies etc., usually the officers were all ""Aryan"". So while there wouldn't likely be black Nazis, there would be blacks in the military.  Although today, and back then, all Germans and especially the members of the military branches were generally all referred to as Nazis by people outside Germany and especially in the US the actual Nazi Party was an exclusive minority of the population, and the vast majority of the population and military were non members. Still going with Key being surprised to see a black German soldier, hence his reaction upon seeing Peele.",4년 전,0,

The first program was to place babies with ""Aryan"" features in homes across Europe and the later program was to breed ""pure Aryan super soldiers"" for the future generations.

@khosrow,"While I don't know about any black soldiers on the mainland Germany had no problems with multiculturalism (as long as they profited from it of course). The SS famously recruited people from all countries and Chinese, Indian people of other nationalities studied at military academies in Germany.  They really didn't have that much of a problem with black. (Probably because they did deal with them on a daily basis.) Just read up on Jesse Owens, how positive the German press was about him winning and his friendship with NSDAP member Luz Long.  And yes there have been blacks in Germany. Between 2000 and 3000 blacks lived in Nazi Germany. Of course they had to deal with racism but in a far lesser extend than in America. Only at the end they started to round them up and sending them to work camps but afaik not to the infamous death camps.  Among them the actor Theodor Wonja Michael who grew up as a half black child during the nazi regime.   Nazis were not irrationally and cartoonish evil. They were efficient and always willing to make exceptions and see things in shades to reach their goals.",8년 전,1,

Then Stalin looks at the comrade to his left and points his TT-33 at him and asks ""Did you sneeze comrade"" and then he responds like the last guy and is shot dead. The person to the left of him is actually a little girl and her dad is to her left, so Stalin points his pistol at the little girl and asks if she sneezed. She starts crying and suddenly her dad steps forward admitting it was him that sneezed and drops to his knees, begging for his and his daughter's life.

@s.s.r.c.p.b.5583,"It's a joking comedy sketch about an idiot Nazi. It's not meant to be taken seriously. You want a comedy to be historically accurate? Then this sketch wouldn't exist, as he wouldn't be telling Hitler stories on duty and definitely wouldn't have ignored the dead guy. And which soldier do you mean? The Nazi or American? Because the whole joke revolves around the fact that he doesn't realize the American is alive. Also, there where black Nazis. Very few, but some. See, the Nazis believed in a racial hierarchy. Aryans at the top, Jews at the bottom. Blacks, and Asians, I think, where in the middle. They didn't want to kill them, but they felt they were inferior, subjecting them to their no interracial marriage laws. Here's the quote, btw. Oh, and Hitler, from what I remember, wasn't really about the whole Aryan obsession, but his subordinates where, so he added it to his rhetoric.  In the armed forces A number of blacks served in the Wehrmacht. The number of German blacks was low, but there were some instances where blacks were enlisted within Nazi organizations such as the Hitler Youth and later the Wehrmacht. In addition, there was an influx of foreign volunteers during the African campaign, which led to the existence of a number of blacks in the Wehrmacht and SS in such units as the Free Arabian Legion.",8년 전(수정됨),24,

From about 1.2 million years ago to less than 100,000 years ago, archaic humans, including archaic Homo sapiens, were dark-skinned.  2. As Homo sapiens populations began to migrate, the evolutionary constraint keeping skin dark decreased proportionally to the distance north a population migrated, resulting in a range of skin tones within northern populations.  3. At some point, some northern populations experienced positive selection for lighter skin due to the increased production of vitamin D from sunlight and the genes for darker skin disappeared from these populations.  4. Subsequent migrations into different UV environments and admixture between populations have resulted in the varied range of skin pigmentations we see today.",8년 전(수정됨),14,

@jaytduce,I know my history far better than you. If there were black Nazis then prove it and I will say I am wrong. The problem is you will not find them anywhere during WW2. Inasmuch as what I think I will just say this. I think that you have bitten off more than you can chew having to prove that there were black Naze4's.,9년 전,0,
@jaytduce,I doubt it..  Also are you considering persons from India as being black? If so then you and I have very different takes on skin color. Then there is the issue of are you calling a person a Nazi because he helped the Germans or are you doing what I do and would only consider a card carrying  member of the Nazi party a real Nazi. As for Veronica Clarke I have seen her work discredited many many times but the truth is that I am too busy to read everything as I have a life to deal with. My suggestion is that you look at the official Nazi political records because they spell out who can and cannot be a true Nazi. Persons from outside Germany or Austria do not qualify under then German law to be a true card carrying Nazi. I spent many months studying them and I know what it said.,9년 전,0,
@jaytduce,The people that you speak of were never given full membership into the Nazi party. Just because they were allowed to join a unit does not mean that you were a Nazi. Take the people that decided to fight along side Germany such as Romania or Finland as an example. Also I do want to say I am very pleased to see that somebody that knows what National Socialism is and was. You would be surprised how many idiots who have no idea what National Socialism even is that I run into. Persons such as you give me hope that there will never be another Nazi party. As I see it the closest thing we have to National Socialism may well be in the USA. The democrats are treading very close to being them if they continue their ways. ,9년 전,0,

From 1943 to 1945 there was a surge of black volunteers, many even joining the SS.  Contrary to popular belief blacks were not persecuted unless they were Christian, leading many of them to convert to Islam, Hitler needed the support of Islamic leaders in Africa for resources such as oil and precious metals.",10년 전,0,

@ExternusArmy,"***** Do realize Jarl the Nord is comparing the two politcal figures, and noting how similar they are in theory, not if they are related in time, place, or reason. They're both helped lead parties which resulted in a lot of death. Abraham Lincoln wasn't even that swell of a person as we remember him today. He didn't want to abolish slavery and would avoid abolishing the slaves if there were any way to run a steady country, but there wasn't due to severe economic, political and just general issues. There would be a lot of problems. It was easier to abolish slavery and force the South to try to assimilate with the rest of the nation. Regardless, Hitler and Lincoln are very similar in a sense, with an influence on the people in the same way too. It was almost a subconscious turning of mindset, rather than a quick, speedy one. Both the Germans and the Americans felt almost neutral or unswayed until they had issues which began to affect their own lives, in which both groups of people turned to a strong political leader.",10년 전,2,

There is a black man in the German Wehrmacht Heer (Army). Did the Wehrmacht recruit black men during the Second World War? Just wondering. If the Wehrmacht did so, were they from Africa, as the Germans were involved in the North Afrika campaigns?  2. Also, the officer narrating his Awesome Hitler Story has SS badges on his uniform collar, indicating that he is an SS officer. But SS personnel were fanatic in upholding the ideals of the Nazi party, which also included racial purity (of Germans, but also whites, I think). It seems weird that an SS officer would associate with a black man. I would think SS personnel would have harboured hatred not just for Jews, but for blacks as well, and...well, anyone not of Aryan descent.  What do you think, folks?",10년 전,1,

As a soldier, if he wanted his enemy dead, with all of the 'programming' soldiers and citizens get during wartime, the desire to have the enemy die is very strong. If he had reason to think his country was wrong for wanting to fight another country, that might justify his switching sides completely. This was just a guy playing dead so as not to be killed. He did not have a psychological reason to believe in his enemies cause. These are two different things. If he wanted the American soldier dead he would still want the soldier dead even though he wanted to remain alive. One needs to understand just how vicious the German and Chinese soldiers were in WWII. American soldiers were pretty vicious but they didn't burn people in incinerators or march them without food until they died. It's all about history and context. NO shitski, bruh.  ",10년 전,0,

The alliance would be temporary, is the point. Think of Saving Private Ryan and The Nazi soldier that they set free as an example.",10년 전,0,
@wetlazer,"Tyler Frost See Tyler what I was talking about was the narrative. In literature we talk about the motivation of the characters and the underlying concepts. BTW literature can be anything. It can be a cartoon or a joke or a movie. I'm not talking about world history I am talking about character and motivation. If you were going to write this comedy skit you could choose to write it in a few ways. One way would be the way say The Carol Burnett show wrote comedy. Look it up on YouTube, the stories made no sense and the characters were seemingly random. With this comedy bit we have characters which have basic traits that are described in the narrative of the story, and don't tell me that comedy is not story writing because it is a form of story writing. The black Nazi wanted the American killed. So it doesn't matter if he was conscripted or not he wanted him dead. If he wanted him dead then after they were free he would still want him dead, this speaks to the mindset of the character and it specks to the mindset of a NAZI soldier or most any trained soldier. ",10년 전,0,

People of all races wanted to move there and immigrated (or were or brought there), fell in love with white people and had children with them. Those children had the culture of both parents, had children with other people are various races, and this will continue until there are few, if any, “pure” races anymore. America at least will be the melting pot we’ve always claimed to be.  It’s nothing more than genetics mixed with economics mixed with love or social contracts or whatever you want to call it, causing a blending of cultures, races, etc. It ought to be considered a good thing by all standards; if you’re not racist and don’t believe white is better than other races, then there’s nothing wrong with this.",10년 전,0,

Not allow them to marry one another?
