@ChristosNikolis,"@Kurgesagt - In a nutshell ""Pretty much nothing""? All other forces of nature, as you mention in 5:01, do NOT have the power to change the DNA of affected organisms in such a massive way, and cause Teratogeneseis. A LOT of animal life would suffer, the rare Marianna's Trench Ecosystem would be more than surely affected. This is a very VERY well made video guys, and hats off - but I think you need to reconsider your ""Pretty Much Nothing"" words.  PS: Cancer caused by human-made disasters is hard to trace and quantify, because it might slowly happen over the years. The human-made causes seem like ""Pretty Much Nothing"" nothing too - until they are. I don't know. One year from now, it's highly possible that all your viewers remember just that ""Pretty Much Nothing"" punchline from this video. You could have said: ""Highly damaging to the area, but very little damage to Earth as a whole - if it's ONE test"".   Just honest feedback - Overall you are not ""Pretty Much Wrong"" <--- if you see what I mean.   What stayed with in the minds of the readers, with my last sentence? That you are ""Pretty Much Wrong"", although did I really say that? (;",5년 전,1,

@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is the Original Semitic Text. HERE is The REAL Savior  YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”  From the Ancient Semitic Scroll:  ""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moses wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)  Ancient Semitic Direct Translation Yad - ""Behold The Hand"" He - ""Behold the Breath"" Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion He - ""Behold the Breath""  “Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL”   PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified  That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote  Here is what they mean  YaH's Name: (Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)  YaH is The Creator: Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)  YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion: Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)  How YaH arrives: YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...  Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name!

@multilis2,"theory does not always match reality, eg Castle Bravo's yield was 15 megatons of TNT [Mt] (63 PJ), 2.5 times the predicted 6 Mt (25 PJ).  Maybe it it more than 50 megatons because all that water pressure increased the implosion and holds the bomb together longer which allows more nuclear reactions to happen.  maybe more of initial energy is transmitted to trench/land than to the water.  Maybe a weak spot was picked and as a result a volcano is triggered.  volcanos do happen without any nuke, should be obvious that an area that is close to being able to trigger a volcano could be thrown over the edge.  Also should be obvious that focused energy of a nuke can do more damage than the same energy much more spread out in an earthquake, in same way that a bullet does more damage than the same energy in opposite direction of the gun firing it.",1년 전,0,

@Nathan-vt1jz,"I think the video is over estimating the effect of a 50 Mt blast in a couple ways:  Nuke map is showing a much smaller radius of total destruction with an air burst of Tsar Bomba than given in the video (for the 50 megaton explosion). Heavy shockwave damage went out to about a 9 kilometer radius with moderate damage out to about a 21 kilometer radius, which is closer to what kurzgesagt suggested for total shockwave destruction.   Since it’s not an air burst explosion, I’m not sure how much radioactive contamination it would produce. The Soviet test (air burst) had very little lasting radiation and scientists were on site after 2hrs. Given the sheer size of the ocean and radiation blocking effect of water, I doubt this would even be noticeable.  The shockwave effect against fish and whales probably won’t be noticeable outside of the immediate area of the blast. The ocean is so large and the trench so deep the shockwave is going to be limited. Even though marine life is sensitive to shockwave, by the time it reaches the surface it is likely harmless. It simply doesn’t have the energy required to move that much water.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Put bunch of garbage together in car-less garage, yeah family couldn't afford car. Built a ""motor"" from scratch, yup, built my first electric magnetic ""motor"" all by me self, I ""discovered"" that amazing thing in 3rd grade without any tips from book! I wanted to build bigger one, so I could fly in the sky lol.  Can't understand it til learn that in high school physics. Public elementary school won't give much effort, guidance to students, all we did was remember things from text book, write those down on answer sheet, even high school chemistry wasn't learned in chemistry lab cause it's expensive. I got into the best county middle school, best county high school with best grades in counties. I could even go to provincial school for free with my grades, but can't afford to live there and my parents were narrow minded and shortsighted. Meanwhile rich kids never studied for a day bought their way into best county school, became my classmates. They started gangs, violence, I was constantly beaten, those were dark days, I hated school. Today those rich kids got back from foreign colleges, became head office manager in local ""state owned"" company. Me, as a loser, quit another penny less job, no job, no social life, no friend, no lover, retreated from big city, nobody, nothing. My mom urges me getting married, but why? Give birth to children born into lower class family in China, make them suffer again, ended up in sweatshop, going through tough life on and on, generation by generation? Knowledge is beautiful, but reality is not, people live in reality. Guess it is the reason only nobles could seek the pulchritude of science back in medieval time. Government wants talented scientists, engineers, scholars, artists, but no one spend resource to courage them, help them growing from little kids into heroes changed the world.

And detonated them using a precisely timed arrangement, all at once. How would that go? Would it cause a sizeable underwater seismic event, how high on the Richter scale would it map out? And also how much of a tsunami would it cause? Not jus the wave height but how far would it travel to pose as a coastline risk to what distance.",2년 전,0,

That much energy released under that much pressure will be transmitted largely  to the walls and floor of the trench through the hydraulic effect of the water. The seismic energy travelling through the crust would be enormous. A 1 km bubble collapsing with that much pressure around it would cause a secondary impact like Thor's hammer on the bottom of the trench. The state of the tectonic subduction zone would decide what happens next. Thinking it's stable and not likely to move is speculation. If the area has built up stress this could trigger it to release, causing earthquakes and tsunamis. Not from the nuke, but from the can of worms we opened.",2년 전,1,

@SineEyed,"The earthquake event which caused the 2011 tsunami in Japan was more than 6300 times as energetic as the world's nuclear arsenal exploding all at once. So if you put every nuclear bomb from every country which has them, put them all together to make one really big bomb, and then made six thousand more of those, and then detonated them all at the same time, it's still less powerful than the earthquake was..",2년 전,41,

@SineEyed," @Goro_Maj1ma   I mean... not exactly, no. But the answer I did give was sufficient to express how ridiculously powerful that earthquake event was, right? The forces we're talking about here are literally incomprehensible to the human mind. We do not understand numbers that large in any meaningful way. So making the calculation OP asked for wouldn't help anyone understand it any better. No better than the answer I gave, anyway.  But to leave no strings undone, the answer to OP's specific question is this: It would take the equivalent of 185,714.3 Tsar Bombas being detonated all that the same time, all in the same place, to match the energy released by the Tohoku megathrust quake.

@StrazdasLT,"The result of a bomb after such pressure would burn all the radiactive material. The fallout would be minimal due to the radioactive material 99,9% burning in the exploding bubble itself. To add to that, the radiation fallout of a nuclear bomb is highly overrated.

It's ridiculous that the narrator concludes by saying ""nothing would really happen, it wouldn't affect the tectonic plates, or volcanoes, it wouldn't cause huge waves or destructive weather, etc.""  Such a foolish, child-like even, response.  Not to mention irresponsible.  How can it be said that such a test wouldn't have a drastic effects?

@theghostwheel5137,"Great in-depth analysis, but I think you forgot one important issue, landslides.   While the force of the blast would generally be contained to about a 1 km radius, if the bomb was on the floor of the Marianas Trench, then it should be within that distance from.the side of the trench.  So a large amount of force should be hitting the base sides of the trench.  This could trigger some truly massive underwater landslides given how deep the trench is.  There have been cases of large underwater landslides causing tsunamis before, and I'd wonder if thia type of situation could also cause one.  Figuring it out would take quite a bit a work though trying to figure out exactly how the side of the trench would respond and require information on the geometry of the specific area of the trench and information on the composition of the trench walls.",3년 전,141,

Most of the explosion will be directed upwards, since water is easier to push than solid rock.

In the most simple terms, the bottom of the rock is at a higher pressure (deeper in the water) than the top of the rock, thus producing an upwards force (buoyancy). It still has mass, which is acted upon by gravity to create a downwards force, but this is counteracted by the buoyancy force pushing up. The net force depends on the relative density of the object and fluid, and is why things (lighter than water) can float in water!",2년 전,2,

In less than 1,000 years we’ve gone from not even having guns to having atomic bombs that can turn an entire city into rubble. Just think about what we can potentially make in 3,000 years or maybe 5,000. While we might not be able to do that now, humanity might potentially be able to create super weapons that would make what we now consider to be devastating tools capable of the most destructive acts of violence seem like playthings in comparison.  I’m not saying it’s likely we’re going to destroy ourselves, or that I 100% believe that it will happen. But it is a very real potential danger in the future, and it’s better to raise awareness of that now rather than wait until the damage is already on the brink of happening.",3년 전,0,

@GrazieAmigo,"Let me tell you what will actually happen.   A 3 ways (left, right, and up) shockwave in the 3-4 km range and that's approx 50% of the total deepness of the Mariana Trench. the pressure in the trench is eight tons per square inch and thousands of times greater and may crush any bone in the body of any living creature. that's like a caching grip from all sides if something is about to evade. so the TSAR BOMBA won't affect anything at all at our atmospheric level nor will affect the earth's crust in any harmful manner. maybe, probably a 100+ TNT bomb would leave an impact and will be felt across a few hundred kilometers on the surface once exploded. but again, even all the power combined in the world if exploded in the Mariana Trench; won't do any harm to Earth's crust. it's impossible to penetrate the earth's crust or affect Lithosphere or Asthenosphere leave alone the Mantle/Outer/Inner core which is measured 6370 km while the total Mariana Trench height is 8 km.  while your video is interesting and not a factual representation of the currently available science.

@maroro4404," @prandomable  if you are curious about the subject multiples articles talk about the nuclear tests done in our waters but pretty much many islands are around Hao, and people used to fish and still fish in those waters. The most notable article you might find is about the test done in 1974 of a bomb named Centaur and how the dangerous fallout covered Tahiti and Moorea, which were among the most populated islands. Tahiti hosting Papeete, the capital of the French Polynesia and Moorea being its sister island.  I wasn't born yet but it's known that the French government hid the gravity of the situation to us and everyone. I vaguely remember people were told they could still eat fish from those waters from listening to docentaries or some testimonies on the local news. The fish mercury mention was done not that long ago. At least in the span of all of this I was still 12 when they started mentioning it. Today still, people try to ask for retribution from the French government because of health issues related to their radioactive exposure but it is very hard to, it's been years so their radioactive levels in their bodies lowered to the ""normal"" levels over time and that is enough to rule out their application when they had cancers or other health issues. Most of all, it is an unheard issue. Even our local scale government failed to push the cases until recently. It's something you have to be aware of because you happen to have heard about it, otherwise it isn't taught in history classes. We'd know more about Paris or WW2 than what the French has done to us.",3년 전,5,

It confidently prophesied the destruction of the planet in all the ways this one debunked... I wonder if Kurzgesagt released this one as a response?,4년 전(수정됨),59,

@morelenmir," @markangeloporcare5289  I cannot recall who put it out but the information it gave was complete and utter bullshit from start to finish. Literally every time a fact or string of data was given they had obviously pulled it out of their arse. The simplest detail like the bomb having 'a lead casing'... Something that takes twenty seconds to look up on wikipedia. Tsar Bomba had a lead tamper, a substance that was used instead of depleted uranium in order to reduce the yield for testing purposes. However that is not the 'case' which was in reality made from either aeroplane aluminium or just formed steel sheets, the detail varies depending whom you read. Worse still the channel had a lot of followers, some of whom likely believed the rubbish the guy was spewing.  I will check out 'riddle' and see if that is the one.  EDIT: Yep!!! That is the channel... What total dreck!!!   Although It is possible he received so much negative feedback that it forced him to rename the video with the suffix 'fantasy not science'. Which in itself is completely disingenuous as originally there was no suggestion the video was anything but real 'popular science'. Some of his supporters are now even trying to explain it as a 'joke' in the comments... Well... That is partially correct at least! It was certainly a joke--a bad one.",4년 전(수정됨),9,

@jonathanh647,"This video lies. The radioactive isotopes produced will last for various different timescales - not least is strontium 90 which lasts for millions of year and plutonium and uranium which last for billions of years. These can enter the food chain and can cause cancer. Most of the internal land of the United States is radioactively contaminated because of the nuclear testing in Nevada and New Mexico. Look up castle bravo which was a nuclear test that irradiated the local area as well the Japan, the USA and even as far as Europe. The test site is encased in concrete to try and stop the radiation leaks and the concrete dome is failing. Nuclear isotopes are long lasting and dangerous to human life. Only a small number of large thermonuclear (fission followed by fusion) would be high enough from the radioactive plume to irradiate the planet",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@ColeAra,"The energy from a anthropogenic nuclear reaction maybe small conspired to what Mother Nature works with. However the use of nuclear war head doesn’t do “nothing.” I’m a sustainability biologist and I can tell you nuclear material has devastating and longer lasting consequences. Detonating one underground or underwater mitigates some of the effects associated with a nuclear blast but not all of it. The ocean is already dying. Once that happens the ocean will become a salt swamp the emits methane instead of oxygen. You can thank whaling, the whole commercial fishing industry, shark and dolphin killing(they all do it, “dolphin safe” is meaningless) and over fishing in general is all it takes to kill this planet.. it’s really really bad people.. so much has to change for us to survive.. it has to happen right now or we are totally 100%, without a prayer, going to face a grim death.

Look at some of the democratic nations of the world. Look at the USA, a tyrannical and unstable nation with a population that has been divided due to stupid political parties. Look at North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, do I even have to explain how democracy has failed there? What about Libya?

Therefore: not reptiles  Amphibians: they are both marine and terrestrial, but their eggs need to be around a water body because they are not hard shelled. A duck however, DOES have hard shelled eggs  Therefore: not amphibians  Aves/Avians:  they have hard shelled eggs, ✅  They have feathers, ✅  They have bills/beaks, ✅  Birds usually don’t float on water but ducks do.

@FrostProof88,"Uh this isn't quite accurate... the nuclear bomb uses nuclear fusion by crushing atoms together as close as possible until they reach critical mass and start splitting. This starts a chain reaction that continues to the next atom of refined radioactive material. The effectiveness of the bomb has been improved over the years by finding ways to get the atoms closer and contain the explosion within critical mass levels longer, so that when it explodes, it has a greater force of atoms reacting. All this is to say at that depth, assuming they somehow got the device to go that deep (it would crush itself and hit critical mass long before going that deep), it could very well destroy the entire world. The pressure would multiply the effectiveness of the bomb by as many atmospheres as it were deep, plus quite a bit extra. The atoms would be forced so close together, that it's nearly impossible to comprehend how devastating the bomb would be by the time it could break out of the inward pushing force. It would   be far more than what would be required to set off every volcano in the world and create 500+ foot tsunamis. The heated steam and volcanic debree would create a worldwide lightning storm that would create enough magnetic interference to short every electrical device that is powered. 90% of humanity would be burned alive within hours. The rest would perish from tsunamis, nuclear fallout, starving, extreme weather, or the resulting ice age.",4년 전(수정됨),1,

@denysvlasenko9175,"I think it's totally wrong, because it failed to take into account the shock wave. Fireballs of nuclear explosions stop growing not because ""atmosphere pushes back"", but because shock wave loses enough energy to stop ionizing and heating air to temperatures where it glows. But now transparent shock wave happily continues outward. Watch Hardtack Umbrella underwater nuclear test video. Mere 8 kiloton explosion 50 meters down below threw 1.5 kilometer tall, relatively narrow column of water up. Fireball wasn't even visible, but the entire surface of water above the test location ""jumped"" and flew up (including now-pulverized former barge from which test device was hung on the cable) - this was done by the passage of the upward-going shock wave. Zeroth-order approximation tells me that ""similar"" (to scale) effects with 50MT device would require depth of ~1km and would have a water column ~20 km high. Deeper explosion at 11 km depth would be more similar to Operation Wigwam than to Umbrella: lower, wider, bowl-shaped spray dome.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@CrismaFire,I particularly disagree with part of it. First i would use three of those nukes at the bottom of Challenger Deep spaced out 1.5 miles in a line each. I would fire then roughly 1 sec apart. Water is pressurized but the ground is not. The energy would be forced to go into the ground. Remember energy can only be transferred not destroyed. If spaced out a minute crack might develop but like using spikes to split a huge rock it will cause a crack maybe not deep but a crack nevertheless.

@redd3104," @-animetallica4554  a rise in CO2 wont wipe the human population. That's quite literally climate fear porn.Worst case scenario some zones may become more hostile to human life while other will get better, for example Siberia. CO2 is only 0.04% of all the gases in the atmosphere, around the same amount to that of water vapor, which is also classified as a greenhouse gas. That said I'm for a progressive phasing of fossil fuels as technology involves. If governments were serious about CO2 levels the quickest way to reduce levels is to change electrical production from fossil to nuclear+hydro (nuclear research as been stagnant for decades for some reason and no one seems to care) complemented with other less efficient renewable energies (solar, wind, geothermal, biological).

I did a quick search and found that co2 does indeed increase crop yield and reduce water consumption marginally, but any substantial gain was mainly from cereals.   I still hold my position on an overall loss of production due to the increasing severity of weather and changes in rainfall patterns. (Don't forget desertification will also impact land availability for crop growth)  As for rising sea levels, we will lose more livable land than we gain, on top of the billions of dollars of infrastructure invested in those regions.

@redd3104," @오늘나를  lets talk about how they make these predictions. During master degree I got to learn something about climate models. Small scale models are accurate, river segments for example. The more large scale you get the more imprecise the model will be. Climate models are incredibly complex with large amount of variables across big timelines. A small change in variables can have a large effect on outcomes. They are simply not accurate enough.   My thoughts on climate change comes for the Nordhaus approach to it. It will happen but humanity will continue to develop technologies as needs rise. It's not worth making huge social and economical impacts in the ""now"" when we can deal with the problem in the future more cheaply and with less social upheaval.   The mainstream approach is backed by a document called the Stern review. The solution to climate change, according to the Stern review, is to put all our chips on fighting it now. Green taxes, CO2 credits, ""green new deals"", things like this are used to redirect wealth into ""fighting"" climate change. This will cause a large impact on the lower classes because the price of everything rises if you tax CO2 emissions. From gas to food to electricity, prices will rise. It's why politicians like to push things like ""12 years to stop climate change or we'll die"" narrative when scientist aren't sure yet.  I won't even get into the rabbit hole of corruption that these policies contribute to. It's surreal.",4년 전,1,

@Mike-md7op,"I am not denying global warming, but when you say the world will have ""God knows how many times the people"" in the future, I would just note that outside of sub- Saharan Africa, world population growth has peaked. We're not headed to some Malthusian population of 50 billion or something.   Over-consumption is the real issue. For example, an average member of the Chinese middle class today consumes 30 times what they would have consumed in 1990. Now, the Chinese population has not expanded 30 fold since 1990 or there would be something like 40 billion Chinese today.   But it's easier to concentrate on population than consumption. Some middle class Western couple with one kid or no kids can feel like they are saving the world and look down on 3rd worlders with multiple kids, but in fact the Western couple will consume more than a large 3rd world family.  I've lived in the 3rd world.

@NeverTriedHardEnough," @Mike-md7op  All cops are bastards is very simply just a dogshit chant/phrase/whatever.   As someone who understands and agrees with the sentiment behind ACAB (Which is that cops serve a power structure that is wielded by a state that either intentionally targets poor people, or more likely and arguably worse even is just grossly negligent in it's effects on neighborhoods. Arguably ACAB is moreso a ""Anti Drug war"" statement than a statement on the integrity of individual officers. )   ACAB is just a dogshit phrase, evidenced by the fact that I have to explain what it means and it doesn't even mean what it says, wish people would stop saying it, especially since it's become a virtue signal for white middle class kids that don't have much to fear from police.  ""Black Lives Matter"" hits well because it's pretty blunt what it's mostly about, and people going out of their way to make it about things it's not or derail the conversation (i.e. BLM hates whites, which are it's primary base. or ""All Lives Matter"" just intentionally trying to downplay the death/mistreatment of Blacks)  It works well because moderates view the extremists who actively stand against it as insincere and ignorant. Evidenced by BLM's incredibly high approval rate.  I haven't followed your entire argument here but just on the comment I saw I would agree ACAB is a bad saying, but  with a caveat that it has a correct message underneath the terrible marketing. I'm down to have a conversation about the topic if you'd like I enjoy talking about this stuff. As long as the views aren't extremist drivel that don't even represent reality I entertain long winded essays.",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@Mike-md7op," @NeverTriedHardEnough  Thank you for the civil and well-thought out post.  I wouldn't say our government targets poor people but rather that poorer areas, especially poor urban areas, tend to produce crime. This is not a race thing: it was true in Augustine Rome and 19th century London.   Of course it is also true that wealthier people may have resources or connections enable them to make the legal system ""work for them"" rather than against them.  As to BLM, I am opposed to the extremist leftist elements that have attached themselves to it.",4년 전,0,
@NeverTriedHardEnough,"I appreciate yours as well.   The government inadvertently targets poor and particularly black people with laws designed specifically to target them several decades ago.The modern intent behind the implementation of these laws isn't racially motivated but if I pull a trigger on someone and thought the gun wasn't loaded. It doesn't quite matter what my intent is it's still killing that person.   Poor areas producing more crime is a solved issue, With the authority of personal experience as well as the consensus of Socioeconomists, Economists, and Criminal psychologists the cause of crime in poor areas is linked directly to property tax value and poor infrastructure that leads to underfunded and overcrowded schools as well as lack of employment opportunities that actually meet the cost of living of the area.  It's simply easier to live in the hood and move out while involving yourself in the drug trade. it's the most profitable and arguably even safer than minding your own business since you will be targeted by aggressive policing policy and gang members regardless of your involvement.     Now to understand why this falls on racial lines we need simply to look at history and the state of poverty we intentionally put blacks into.    Pre WW2 the Italians and the Blacks had a nearly identical crime rate, with Blacks even dipping below Italians at some points. The modern conception of the ""honorable classy mafioso"" is purely a post WW2 racist construction. The Mafia and Black gangs functioned almost exactly the same with the primary difference being product they sold. They both protected their interests by intimidating innocent populace and coveted a ""community"" of trust and anti police sentiment in the people they oppressed. Just like modern Black gangs.  I say that to say this, Blacks and Italians were both high overrepresented as soldiers who served in WW2, upon return from the war Pensions and land were given out to soldiers who served and propelled us into the invention of the middle class. Italians were given these pensions, putting the majority of them in the middle class and moving them out of the ghettos they once shared with blacks. Blacks on the contrary where denied these pensions purely on the base of their race, and were delegated to not only stay in the hood, but were left with all this slack in the drug market from the Italians pulling out. And so they took over the remaining drug market and the ramifications of this slight are still felt today.    That was long winded and I'm sure you'll agree I am being pretty amicable, but when the history of blacks in America has been Slavery>Segregation>Economic oppression it gets frustrating to most people when you would imply race has nothing or little to do with the circumstances.  That's why you'll get such hostile responses from people privy to this information.  The modern government doesn't operate on ""Fuck black people"" but it does operate on a past that was very clearly ""Fuck black people"" with little effort to right this wrong. Even going as far as to imply blacks put themselves in the hood.    To speak to your final point about BLM. If I judged the merits of a movement or idea not on it's baseline but it's extremists, I'd be a nihilist. It'd be the equivalent of saying voting for republicans is voting for School Shooters because they tend to be right wing. Or that someone who is economically conservative is a neo nazi because Neo Nazi's want to be economically conservative to stop ""the Jews"". Takes that are of course, extremist in their own right, always remember that the quickest path to becoming a extremist yourself is to assume that your opposition are themselves extremists.      I've been pretty far right and I've been pretty far left in my past. I've learned that the vast majority of people are moderates, so I judge politics by the ideas that will actually get passed through moderates, Not what a tweet with 5 likes says from a extremist.  By global standards I'm pretty center/left but by American standards I'm far left, and even still I have 0 extreme beliefs that deviate from what the experts say.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@Mike-md7op," @NeverTriedHardEnough  I don't disagree that various government officials and agencies, from local to state to federal, over the years created policies to oppress blacks. I am far from ignorant of this history.  Still, one cannot attribute crime and poverty in urban areas solely to such ""structural"" issues. People believe that ""structural"" issues are the main cause of these problems because there has long been in our society the implicit belief, derived from humanism, that man is basically good and society corrupts him.  I take the more traditional view. Man is NOT basically good. As the great anti-socialist Russian thinker A.I. Solzhenitsyn said: ""the line between good and evil runs through the heart of EVERY man"".  Structural issues play their part in producing urban poverty and crime, and they play a big part for sure, but so do other basic human vices. But today vice is excused on the basis of structural issues, we say ""go easy on criminals, they had a bad upbringing"" and such an attitude of excusing  vice leads to more vice.    As to BLM, it has long been noted by many thinkers over the past two centuries that the more radical ideology always tends to win out in the long run. Again, as Solzhenitsyn said of Russia: ""liberalism gave way to radicalism, radicalism gave way to socialism and socialism could not resist communism"". Or look at the French Revolution, it might have started with noble intent but before you know it it just devolved into a ""Terror"" lead by the most radical of the revolutionaries.  The fact is, the more radical members of BLM do have and will continue to have a disproportionate influence in comparison with moderate members.  As to your assertion that the same problem exists on the right, it is simply not so. When I read The American Conservative I don't see anyone promoting neo-nazism, but when I look into BLM I see members saying the most crazy far-left things, whether it is that hard work is something invented by white people to oppress minorities, or that the idea of stable two parent families is also an evil creation of whites. These absurdities would not be worth mentioning if not for the sad fact that influential radicals believe in them and get others to believe in them....so much for BLM.",4년 전(수정됨),0,

Yes the earth is very tuff, and can’t stand a lot of abuse and will eventually heal itself,  it still doesn’t change the more immediate harm it does to living animals and plants at the time.   Just like global warming.  Yes it’s very natural for the earth to freeze up (ice age) then melt away and does this cycle over and over naturally.   But these events generally happen pretty slowly,  making it possible for some animals to adjust.   Global warming happening on a rapid scale would be devastating to humans as many of our great cities would be under water costing tons of money and resources.

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name!

HERE is The TRUE Savior  YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”  From the Ancient Semitic Scroll:  ""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moses wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)  Ancient Semitic Direct Translation Yad - ""Behold The Hand"" He - ""Behold the Breath"" Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion He - ""Behold the Breath""  “Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL”   PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified  That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote  Here is what they mean  YaH's Name: (Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)  YaH is The Creator: Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)  YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion: Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)  How YaH arrives: YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...  Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.  Isaiah 43:11 I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.  Isaiah 45:5 I am YaH, and there is none else.",4년 전,1,

Second, if it did ""circle"" the earth three times, we would all have noticed it very well indeed. There was, however, a seismic wave caused by the shock wave, which allegedly circled the earth three times. But at what latitude? The Tsar bomba was detonated north of the Polar circle, and the seismic wave was certainly not registered in South Africa. But could it circle the earth latitudinally? Sure it could, but at that particular latitude the earth is only about 10,000 miles around. So the seismic waves would travel about 5,000 miles before colliding and returning, for more than 30,000 miles, but less than 40,000 miles.",4년 전,0,

@StrazdasLT,"Theoretically yes, but the explosion would also waste a lot of power fighting the pressure. Also of note - due to high pressure in the water more energy would get transfered to ground than if it was exploded on atmosphere because above ground low pressure would mean most energy escape that way.  If you want best effect detonate it around 200 meters bellow water surface. The water would hold it in enough so it could give all its energy to water without wasting it in atmosphere, but its also close enough to the surface where that energy would be turned into a massive tsunami instead. Now detonate that a few kilometers off the coast of London and all the birds would be drinking radiactive water.",3년 전,0,

@David-yf5fo,"The Tsar Bomb (Big Ivan) did not have a fission booster stage which made its yield proportionally cleaner than any other thermonuclear device ever tested.  It was a prototype for a 100-150 Mt device.  No, there would not be much radiation from the 50 Mt version of the device.  That was dated technology by 1961 and nothing more than a spectacle used to scare the Americans.  The Mariana Trench is not a steep walled canyon and its true horizontal scale is not widely known.  It is formed mostly by grades of just a few percent that may run downward for many tens of miles.  Its horizontal scale is massive.  Shock waves would not be impacting against solid vertical rock walls as suggested by the animation.  Challenger deep, the deepest spot known at this time, is a small area 200 miles southwest of Guam.  The actual depression, most likely akin to a big mud hole is maybe a mile wide and seven miles long.  No living vertebrates (fish) have ever been found below 26,000 feet to date.  Biochemistry literally begins to change under that much pressure and it is no longer a simple matter of pressure inside canceling out the pressure on the outside of an organism.  Piccard and Walsh were not biologists and would not have known a fish from something else they might have seen while at the bottom of the Mariana Trench back in 1960.  Agreed, such a detonation would not amount to much.",4년 전,0,

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name!

@craignocantsorry9277,"this is NOT accurate!   The 1 kilometer bubble you explained is correct, but you completely forgot that  at the exact moment that 1 km  bubble is created, there is also an equal reaction happening  above it as well. Water barely compresses at all, in fact only a   micro fraction can be compressed. if 1 km of water is created in a bubble, than almost 1 kilometer of water also has to be displaced!, this would SURELY  be felt not only at the center above the explosion on the surface, but would DEFINATELY create a HUGE disturbance equally when it implodes, even if all that takes  only fractions of seconds. we see this equally when deep underground explosions happen. At the surface there can be a rise of several hundred feet, and thats with earth which can be compressed alot compared to water!!",5년 전(수정됨),1,

Secondly, if North Korea were somehow able to transport the nuclear weapon there in the first place, they will almost certainly be stopped by the USA forces who are located in Oceania and the Philipines, as well as some from South Korea and Japan. Even if the bomb were to arrive without being destroyed by nature or the USA, it would do them no help whatsoever. Lastly, to fire a nuclear weapon into the Mariana Trench is virtually useless for them to achieve their goals, and even if it were to somehow defy the laws of physics, it would barely give them any military advantage, while they ignited the hot oil of war. For North Korea to fire a nuclear weapon into the Mariana Trench would be useless. For North Korea, it would be a much better investment to pick on South Korea or to strengthen their ties with China.

@neorenamon,"Hmm, they talk about a fusion-based bomb (which is what the Tzar Bomb is: A hydrogen fusion bomb), but show how a fission-based (uranium/plutonium) bomb works. Also, a hydrogen bomb does not generate as much radioactive fallout as a fission based bomb.  Also, if the force could be applied below ground (near a sensitive point in the fault line), it could have some effect. Not a global effect, but some regional effect. The Tzar Bomb was rated at 50 megatons (50 million tons) of TNT. A 9.0 earthquake releases about 100 megatons of TNT equivalent energy. Because of the logarithmic nature of the Richter scale, the bomb explosion would probably be somewhere 8.3 on the scale.  The problem is getting the bomb into a useful position. The deepest drill hole know is 7.5 miles, and the deepest part of the trench is about 7 miles. A machine would have to be built to make a hole large enough to take the bomb down to the fault line (which will probably take at least 10 years and many millions of dollars). The operation would have to be done on one of the Marianas Islands (like Guam), so it's most likely not to remain a secret for very long.  The Cannikin underground test (1971) was a 5 megaton bomb that triggered a 7.0 earthquake on Amchitka Island (with 4.0 aftershocks for a few weeks after), so using an atomic weapon to generate an earthquake is feasible, but not necessarily practical.  Also, just because most of the 'force' of the blast would go up doesn't negate the fact that the shockwave from the blast would penetrate the sides of the Marianas trench and radiate into the earth over several miles. After all, both water and rock transmit shockwaves better than air does. If the circumstances are right, it could generate a number of aftershocks in excess of 5.0 on the Richter scale.",5년 전,3,

Also, 1 Terraton is a pretty huge number, its about 1,000,000 megatons - as a Terraton is about 1,000 gigatons and a single gigaton is 1,000 megaton - nukes, no, any explosion on that level would probably kill the entirety of human civilization.",5년 전,1,

@SolLunaris,"But what if the pressure was bottlenosed down and most of the force went into the crust. Granted I know it cant break through 100s of kilometers of crust but the force combined with the pressure already being put on it, as well as the more focused blast (as the trench acts somewhat like a bottleneck and focuses the energey into more of a bullet) as well as the cold water and currents race in to fill the new big f'ing hole that appeared in like a second. Could under these circumstances, damage be done to the earth. I figured that could potentially trigger tectonic plates to shift and change currents in that part of the ocean which in turn could affect alot of species of marine life. Also sorry after thought here, if there's a magma tube close to said explosion could that cause the force to further bottleneck down into the crust for potentially 10s of 100s of kilometers while also gaining potentially a large amount of kenetic energy back as well. If this happened volcanic eruptions are likely to occur and im not sure how radioactive that magma could be but if it is even a little bit radioactive and it's coupled with a large volcanic eruption the ash and debris released could get into our atmosphere and cause insane weather shifts and radioactive rain which would kill most crops and the few that survive would have no sunlight to thrive in, as ash clouds can linger for weeks even months and our atmosphere would have a hard time filtering out such a large radioactive ash cloud. And with that or those multiple volcanic explosions, brings changed air currents and potential hurricanes that are definitely carrying some level of residual radioactive waste which could reach all over the world. Im just saying under the right conditions this small radioactive pool with litte harm to humanity could be its end, ironically as you said by using a much more powerful force then we have at our disposal for mass destruction and that's mother nature herself. Welp that's my mandated theoretical essay for the day Sensei, I appreciate your videos and your hard work this is very interesting highly technical information that has alot of critical thinking put into a condensed, artistic and entertaining way while not losing the severity of the conversation, not everyone can do that so thank you to you and your team and know your deeply appreciated by a random nerd who needed to know this answer at 8 in morning for some odd reason.",5년 전,0,

It would be pretty devastating for the immediate area around where they were placed, but overall human life would go on just fine everywhere else, maybe with a little bit more cancer for a while after due to roughly doubled ambient radiation.",3년 전(수정됨),0,

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name!

@vasudevraghav2109, @2VeryIceyGaming  Elon Musk put the idea forward a long time ago to melt the ice caps of mars and raise the planets temperature to make it a lot more habitable but nobody want to give up their bombs cause dominating other nations is priority of all nations........

@vasudevraghav2109, @farelrajwa1300  literally every nuke available need to be detonated on mars' ice caps...... In the beginning there wasn't any O2 to breathe on earth amd microbs depend on anaerobic respiration. Then there came cyanobacteria.... One of the oldest organism on earth using enormously available carbon dioxides and converting it into O2 for life to evolve. As bad it seems to us carbon dioxide is major for early set up of a planet to evolve habitable zones for life as we know it. Mars is full of it,5년 전(수정됨),1,

@ChristosNikolis,"@Kurgesagt - In a nutshell ""Pretty much nothing""? All other forces of nature, as you mention in 5:01, do NOT have the power to change the DNA of affected organisms in such a massive way, and cause Teratogeneseis. A LOT of animal life would suffer, the rare Marianna's Trench Ecosystem would be more than surely affected. This is a very VERY well made video guys, and hats off - but I think you need to reconsider your ""Pretty Much Nothing"" words.  PS: Cancer caused by human-made disasters is hard to trace and quantify, because it might slowly happen over the years. The human-made causes seem like ""Pretty Much Nothing"" nothing too - until they are. I don't know.

Before you throw more of your ""factoids"" on me, while completely disregarding mine, you should at least try to explain how it is possible that humans have dug up a crapload of fossil fuels, burned them in a hundred years span while growing a billion heads of cattle, and at the same time have absolutely nothing to do with the doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere across the same hundred years or so.

@jarikosonen4079,"There is possibly tensions in these continental plates that could be released (also without explosives). If the plate is already very deep there with high tensions it could release some day a lot of energy without any warning and that could result into megatsunami. But the earthquake prediction is possibly very difficult science and there is hardly no measurement for the plate tension and movement in the depths of the ocean. If the trench bottom jumps up by 30meters (in few seconds) by the earthquake that could cause a lot of problem. The penetration of the bottom sinking plate into the mantle is possibly very long like 1,000km with a lot of friction and thus large movements would not easily happen very fast. But the top sinking plate has its edge there and that edge could jump upwards when tensions released. Even the rock (what makes the plates) is not very strong material it could store a lot of energy like a piece of string. It can be hard to say if plate edges that are deeper have thus more tensions or less tensions. If the plates are heated more (nearly melted) in the depths the heat could allow the tension to release continuously and bending to occur that does not store the energy as much as colder plates could store.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

@rockbore,"Science, not fantasy.   Really? So if i for example, wanted to murder thousands of innocent scientists, to see how many bodies it takes to fill up the Mariana trench, would that be science? In the 1950s and 60s the USA/USSR war machine dentonated many thousands of Mtons of tnt equivalent nukes in the Stratosphere.  Is that science or just stupidity based on some deranged, meglomanic, death cult fantasy? My point is that the word 'science' is being used here to sanitize an act which is totally unacceptable. This is how 'science' has been used in the past.  It's something which you are not expected to understand because you are not a scientist,.and you just need to defer and know that 'science"" has got your best interests at its cold,  mechanical, irrefutable, heart.  Actually, Operation Domonic was based on a false notion concerning magnetism. James Van Allen told them that the right EMP might disperse the magentic field round the planet and allow for manned space missions to the moon etc.  The cold war was a hoax, so was Apollo.  Science is the principle of not deffering  to anyone, but testing for your self. It is self evident that destroying the planet is strictly unscientific in any helpful meaning of 'science'.",5년 전,0,

@johnsnowkumar359,"Scientist Kurchatov and others delayed the Soviet atom bomb, as indicated by bits and pieces of reseach materials on the  Internet.      Racism also plays a role among scientists, as indicated by a few documents as researched on the Internet. The Soviet atom bomb program was started in 1936 or so. The scientists , predominantly from Russia and other nations, were spearheaded by Eagor Kurchatov, a brilliant and good-looking scientist. Everyone had a code name. Head scientist Kurchatov's code name was ""Beard"" or ""Brown Beard"". Kurchatov's secretary was ""Miss Beard"". Kurchatov along with his more famous dissident nuclear scientists and made the final blue prints of the atom bombs in the early 1940's. The team  simply refused to ask for bomb materials  to actally make the bomb. The Soviet Union was ruled by a Georgian named Joseph Stalin. Scientist Kurchatov and others delayed the Soviet atom bomb. Kurchatov and the other nuclear scientists were convinced that Stalin may immediately use the their atom bomb against Germany or Japan, as they felt that Stalin, an ethnic Georgian, may be a mad man. They only tested their atom bomb in 1949 under threats and duress from Moscow, who said ""Enough is enough. Your Kurchatov team could have built the Soviet atom bomb in 1944. We want the bomb in 1949, before the decade of 1940's is out."" They wrote, Otherwise You Soviet scientist comrades, consider yourselves fired, whether from your jobs as nuclear scientist or by a bullet to the head.""""        Scientist Kurchatov and others delayed the Soviet atom bomb. So, the Soviet atom bomb was delayed by 5 years. They wanted a Slav at the helm in power before giving the ready bomb to the Soviet leaders. Stalin was still in power in 1949.         The Soviet scientists were convinced that an ethnic non European leader will immediately use the atom bomb, and hence their attempt at delay. Guess what? they were right: An American president named Truman used the atom bomb, and he is a non European leader.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

Humanity just barely recovered from the very first hiro...bomb was set off on one of the Hawaii island in 1950's (maybe not too sure on yr) We maybe the youngest planet in all of galaxies...we actually almost took out ourselves in the process. Theres a very fine line your not meant to cross (you all know what i mean but play stupid) there are forces out there and here that are greater beyond all comprehension.  Those forces are put there to take us out if someone crosses that line. I dont even think we were suppose to come this far so obviously more than a few ppl are out actually doing good; trying to make up 4 the biggest mistake humanity ever committed.

This cut the yield by nearly half and also resulted in the Tsar Bomba being amongst the 'cleanest' nukes ever detonated with almost all of the yield coming from the fusion detonations.  As such, radioactivity would be minimal and given the sheer size of the ocean and the depths over which that radiation would travel before reaching the surface, radiation would be a minimal concern.",5년 전,0,

That's why all hydrogen bombs are 2 or 3 stage devices. They require a fission explosion to start the fusion. So there is still fallout.,6년 전,12,

Additionally, certainly there would be some form of gasses created, other than water vapor which has changed phases due to the thermal energy changes,  which upon rising would also expanded enormously from 11km down to the surface where pressure is only atmospheric.

It was dialed down 100 Megatons by the lead scientist/engineer (look up the details), who determined it's ground destruction would be negligibly effected (most of it rising upwards) compared to the fallout and they removed the liner or something that fully fusioned the device payload. Or it was lithium which did that . Either way it wasn't 1 Megaton. There were planned bombs for multiple Terratons to be dropped from orbit ( from aboard the government seized Orion project , which was originally a space exploration program). All pale in comparison to hurricane energies though. i wonder what energies extraterrestials and their individuals wield. Since the stupid and violent human species can't even weild petty nuclear technology, (or do anything for our individual survival and thrival, that isn't shackled to a hive collective) individually, meaning that a small space vessel that used small forces relative to hurricanes, was a classified weapon and regulated and run by hive like military institutions, and the society was also nothing respectable; and, there was no freedom of self will, and only that of the collective.

John 14.6 - 1 Cor. 15: 1 In addition, brothers, I declare to you the Gospel that I preached to you, which you also received and in which you stand; 2 Thanks to which you are also saved if you keep in memory what I preached to you, if you did not believe in vain. 3 For first of all, I delivered to you what I received and how Christ died for our sins according to the Holy Scriptures; 4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 5 And that he was seen by Cephas (Peter)  and then of the 12 (as a group): -  In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; Ephesians. 1: 7 - Romans 10: 9 That if you shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved. 10 For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 13 For whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. - Therefore, since we were justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 5: 1",6년 전,2,

If you say that word again I'm bringing all of my friends to teach you a lesson about being mean to me can cause consequences. So you got two choices 1. We can both leave and never talk about this ever again or 2. I can always do the thing that my friend Fluttershy did, and that is to record this on Video and really see who people react to you being mean to me and wont see you And by the way your not the only Matt from wii sports account My friend Rarity saw another Matt from wii sports in a live stream and it was a nice person unlike you like to be the WORST PERSON TO CALL SOMEONE BY THE RACE OF PEOPLE. Matt that i never know By the way choose wisely because if don't pick any I'll think you said 2 and record this and upload it Or I can bring Applejack here and tell her to record this on Video and upload it to her side of the view or (POV) of her perspective of this video and see how the whole world see you as the meanest person in the world and also in 🇷🇺 and will think your not the The person they know from their comments on their video. So whats it gonna Be? 1 or 2? Ill be waiting for your answer Because I'll be watching cute videos while i wait By the way, do not say bad words in the replies that will make me frustrated and send mean replies back So we can do this the easy way or the hard way Choose wisely 😇🇪🇸🇩🇪🇫🇷🇮🇹🇷🇺🇬🇧",5년 전,0,
@mattfromwiisports2468," @cutieshows142  how about no. Just you leave. I know more about getting a life than you. In fact, I know more about getting a life than most people but everyone (including those who dont know how to get a life) know how to get better than you. I dont care that your grandma will see your other accounts videos. Your friends don't exist. Even if they did, 0 times any number is 0. Please just like, realize that you dont have any actual friends and shut up about you having them. You're only gonna last so long pretending you do. Anyways. If you dont want me to call you racist, don't be racist lmao. Its that easy. Look at a black person and say you matter. No need to tell them anything else. 4, lmao. I've been acting more mature than you'll ever be. I see that I have 2 choices, but you (unfortunately) only have 1.  1. Leave and admit that you'll never amount to anything or do anything important. You know that you'll lose an argument of wits against me. You dont have the brain mass to outsmart me. I knew you'd give me many choices all along. Thats how weak minded you are.

@cutieshows142, @mattfromwiisports2468   Apple Bloom: How about we can just forget everything that happened and go our seperate ways. Its for the best of us. talks politely thinks about the past I feel everything I have done has made me mad during these years and I have felt what have i gotten myself into with these people here and it doesnt matter about what the reply says its about just not letting them make you mad. I felt if this keeps up in 2020 this could be the WORST thing to ever happen to us and everything that everyone loved about YouTube. All im saying is just that if you werent mean to Rarity everything would been back to normal but no you decided to join and say the bad words to her and threw everything you could away and faced it with your newness. All im saying is just Calm down amd listen to some music to calm you down because im just letting all of this go. You can do the same. The Days has gone long enough for this to keep up so i will say this once. Let it all go away and forget this never happened. calms down thinks about the future Let this go and think about your future and maybe have a great time making friends and have a great time in your world where anything is possible. If we can go separate ways we can just let this go because you know its just gonna come back and hurt you and me. So If this helps then ill be happy for you. politely talks Remember this: Resolving conflicts can help people have a great future. Now lets leave this behind and have a great life.

Only about 1/50th of the nuclear fuel is used because the rest is destroyed/dissipated when that small portion explodes.  The much-higher pressures down there would contain the reaction for a slightly longer time allowing a significantly greater portion...maybe 2 or 3 times as much of the nuclear fuel to be converted to energy or maybe more.

@maxwellschmidt235,"It's about the cumulative efficiency of spreading anthropogenic effect.  One nuclear weapon is an incredibly violent event.  But in that incredibly violent event, most of the energy is dissipated as heat, and the amount of new radioactive chemicals brought to the surface of the earth is rather small.  Because earth systems are constantly acting to spread and mitigate the damage, the overall effect of a nuclear weapon is inefficient at causing lasting and persistent damage beyond the locality which it completely destroys and saturates with radioactivity.  Meanwhile, the production, use, and disposal of plastics creates a number of effects by bringing a large amount of toxic substances locked away in the earth to the surface.  Given the wide geographic dispersion of humans who use plastics, the effects of plastics are dispersed to all ecosystems.  In terms of messaging, a youtube video won't divert a nuclear test.  But it may influence some number of people in some way to be more careful to ensure efficiency in the disposal of plastics, mitigating at least some portion of the cumulative pollution of humanity.",5년 전,0,

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name!

@ChristosNikolis,"@Kurgesagt - In a nutshell ""Pretty much nothing""? All other forces of nature, as you mention in 5:01, do NOT have the power to change the DNA of affected organisms in such a massive way, and cause Teratogeneseis. A LOT of animal life would suffer, the rare Marianna's Trench Ecosystem would be more than surely affected. This is a very VERY well made video guys, and hats off - but I think you need to reconsider your ""Pretty Much Nothing"" words.  PS: Cancer caused by human-made disasters is hard to trace and quantify, because it might slowly happen over the years. The human-made causes seem like ""Pretty Much Nothing"" nothing too - until they are. I don't know. One year from now, it's highly possible that all your viewers remember just that ""Pretty Much Nothing"" punchline from this video. You could have said: ""Highly damaging to the area, but very little damage to Earth as a whole - if it's ONE test"".   Just honest feedback - Overall you are not ""Pretty Much Wrong"" <--- if you see what I mean.   What stayed with in the minds of the readers, with my last sentence? That you are ""Pretty Much Wrong"", although did I really say that? (;",5년 전,1,

@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is the Original Semitic Text. HERE is The REAL Savior  YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”  From the Ancient Semitic Scroll:  ""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moses wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)  Ancient Semitic Direct Translation Yad - ""Behold The Hand"" He - ""Behold the Breath"" Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion He - ""Behold the Breath""  “Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL”   PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified  That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote  Here is what they mean  YaH's Name: (Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)  YaH is The Creator: Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)  YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion: Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)  How YaH arrives: YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...  Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name!

@Ronnibearable,"I don't appreciate this explanation. I understand why you came to the conclusion that you did, but you are  only accounting for the fallout in terms of how nuclear bombs were tested under air pressure, and applying that to the hadal pressure of the mariana trench. Okay. I understand it's all hypothetical, but you failed to take into account a few things. Yes, while the pressure of  that depth is massive, something as fast and as hot as a fusion chain reaction is not gonna just cancel out with some bubbles floating to the top. If there was no crust, maybe that would be a reality. but detonating that type of power right between two tectonic plates would DEFINITELY cause an earthquake. Have you ever taken a glass out of the dishwasher, when it's still hot, and then rinsed it under cold water only to have it shatter?  dingding  So you are not accounting for that reaction. #2, whatever the byproduct is, that the radiation makes after being exposed to certain molecular elements, whether that be sand, or water- the chemical chain reaction under pressure makes it harder to rise to the surface, yes,  but so far, I don't think many humans have been down to the bottom of the Mariana trench, THEREFORE, what kind of minerals, animals, OIL WELLS, OR OTHERWISE are down there, and NOT being accounted for in terms of chemical reactions, is just a MASSIVE oversight on your part. I know its a hypothetical situation, but I would hate for your ""hypothetical"" situation to become a ""bright idea"" for the current president of Guam ahem to think of as an idea for execution.

All it needs to do is to be systematically detonated at a few key points -- perhaps split evenly three ways all the nuclear weapons of the world, one of them being in the Mariana trench perhaps and the other two being deep within volcanoes...   It is laughable to expect the summation of our weaponry to put anything more than a dent or massive crater on the surface of the planet if done in one place, yes. But that was never the point.

@storm12weather," @KryptOwO  A nuclear weapon has a capacity to kill more efficiently than most natural events due to the energy concentration over a rather small area and the fact that all of that energy is released in less than 1 second. But it does not imply the total energy release is anywhere near that of natural events. Large thermonuclear bombs are indeed impressive, but compare the total energy release to something like a large earthquake or a hurricane. A hurricane releases most of its energy through latent heat when billions of tons of water vapor condenses to form clouds. Based on the estimated water in a hurricane and the rate of condensation within it, its estimated at about 6×10^14 joules a second. That's about 1 megaton of TNT equivalent every 7 seconds. Or over 514 megatons in 1 hour. 12,355 megatons in one day. That's more energy than our entire nuclear arsenal.       Earthquake total energy is even more insane. The true total energy of an earthquake is called the moment magnitude energy. For a large 9.0 earthquake, it's about 9 teratons equivalent. Or 9 million megatons. (3.9x10^22 joules). Though only about 500 megatons of this radiates as surface waves that directly impact structures. (2×10^18 joules). Still, the surface energy alone is 10 times that of the tsar bomb. The total energy at 9 teratons, is thousands of times that of our nuclear arsenal and could power the US for 750 years.       So in terms of energy, nukes are quite small compared to some natural events on earth. The idea that a large nuclear weapon could actually physically affect the planet to a greater extent than, say a large earthquake is wrong. A nuke cannot displace even close to the amount of water as a large earthquake, and therefore, it would not produce a massive, far reaching  tsunami either. If detonated near the water surface, it would certainly create a huge wave within a few miles of the detonation, but do to far less displacement than an earthquake, the waves would lose energy and diminish past a few miles.",6년 전,7,

@nepsyasudra3262,Yeah but compared to earth originated natural disasters space originated natural disasters are exceptionally rare. Like you'd have to wait millions or even billions of years because we're talking cosmological timescales. Earth originated natural disasters happen practically every day and don't often exceed a few hundred or maybe a few thousand human fatalities. However human made nuclear weapons can kill hundreds of thousands if not millions of humans in a flash and can be launched today. The only earth originated disaster that can happen relatively soon and do significant damage to humanity is a super volcano eruption which like a direct powerful solar flare has the power to bring human civilization to it's knees.,6년 전(수정됨),3,
@frantisekvtelensky820,"​ @KryptOwO  Forces, how they acts, reacts, how they looks, are exactly the same in the whole known universe.

So, in very, very, basic form it means, that nature is the universe and universe is the nature. Laws of the universe and nature will always be above everything and the only thing that could possibly somehow beat the nature, is the nature itself. But, of course, if you count us as the product of nature - as we undoubtly are the natural product - it would be nature again, who could possibly beat itself by itself.

@philliplopez2231,"If the Tsar Bomba was detonated at the bottom of the Mariana trench and still had enough power to vaporize approximately a one kilometer sphere then yes there would be second order consequences. For starters the trench would direct most of that energy up towards the surface. Just a one kilometer bubble would displace approximately one tenth the depth of the water In the trench. Between the pressure wave moving upward and the subsequent backfill of water there would indeed be massive waves produced. Raw math would predict a one kilometer tall initial wave but I expect that some of that height would be mitigated by expansion to the sides. Even if only a third of this energy emerged as discernable wave height we would still expect to see approximately 330 meter or close to 1000 foot waves. Also we could expect the trench to direct that energy up and then perpendicular to the trench.  I like your consideration of the raw pressures exerted at the trench floor but would love to see some math backing up your claim that it would likely and effectively negate the power of the bomb.

@theporcupine9993, @jakethesnake3513  that's not how radiation and cancer works. Cancer isn't damage that can be repaired. Cancer is caused by mistakes in the DNA of cells the cell normally checks it's genetic code and by having control mechanisms in the code itself. If there are a few faults so the control mechanisms are also not working you have cancer. This is a very short explanation.

Then and only then in the 0.001% will it be cancerous. Except wait, add a lot more 0s. Cancer is unlikely as hell. Like, stupid unlikely. It's like randomly typing into a notepad file and making a computer virus. That's why the sun radiation doesn't instant cancer us, because cancer is hella unlikely to happen.

@leslawrence3865,"I call BS.  The trench has walls.  And that massive pressure change would push on those walls.  The explosion is in every direction.  And, we know how volcanos happen.  Trapped pressure builds until it finds a way out... eruption.  I would argue that the pressure on the walls are already very high, just like right before a volcano erupts.  And just a slight bit of pressure (the last drop in a bucket causes the water to spill) and we know the Mariana Trench is from the crust moving/plates shifting.  So, if we were to add so much energy/pressure we could be that last bit of pressure that causes enables the shift to be severe.  And, we also know pressure on solid material, like the trench walls, are barely absorbed but actually transferred through the material under it finds an outlet... like, an eruption.  If you drop a grenade into a pool and have inflated balloons secured to the opposite side of the pool wall or bottom (to simulate a human’s body/lungs) the explosive force pressurized the water and those balloons or a human body will be crushed/burst.  I agree that the pressure of that depth would be significant enough to diminish the explosive force above the destination point but the explosive force is in every direction, 3D.  This theory may be true and I would accept that it is somewhat likely but I wouldn’t bet all life on it.  Fracking is already causing earthquakes/tremors and that’s just because they pressurize an gas-filled pocket to force the gas up and out.  And, I fear that fracking may causes eruptions.  Eruptions are mostly caused by water favor/steam pressure finding a way out and then after the eruption, the liquid magma has a way out, too.  Yellowstone Park is actually a huge volcanic field.  The geysers release the pressure at a significant rate that the pressure does not become eruption-worthy.  But, Old Faithful is no longer faithful and other areas of the park are becoming more active.  If the geysers somehow no longer relieve the pressure, say because more water is pumped into the earth and turns to steam, Yellowstone could become a huge volcano and erupt.  So much ash that the farmlands in the Midwest are no longer producing and enough very small ash/dirt erupted into the sky that we experience less sunlight reaching the surface.  And the eruption would have enough force that it would make Tsar Bomba seems harmless.  Fault lines, especially in the US, would break apart.  Bye bye most of California.  I am a pessimist and we are all, by nature.  We fear and worry about the negatives for survival.  And this video/theory is very incomplete.",6년 전,2,

@railandaviation,if you nuke the Mariana trench correct end of the world but not nesaceraly if you drop it from plane height which is 10'000 meters it will obviously enter the Mariana trench obvious fact there but as the bomb sinks the water pressure will crush it half way down like putting an empty nuke shell in a hydraulic press therefore there is one way to blow up the nuke at the bottom of the Mariana trench/if you take a submersible under water with the bomb underneath you will get your bang but there a consequences like earthquakes globally global tsunamis volcano eruption don't forget yellow stone park that will be destroyed by the yellow stone volcano and possibly all of the U.S.A  and the UK along with south America and therefore acid rain will be evolved also nuclear winter and like I said at the beginning the end of earth and humanity as we know it,7년 전,0,

Also, the flowing water would probably carry the radiation a little bit. Water has been known to be a good protector against neutron radiation, but that is only in controlled environments like nuclear reactors. Also, wasn’t the Tsar Bomba in this video half the strength of the intended models actual output, since the original model probably would’ve split the Earth? It may have been, but I’m not sure.  Just so you all know, I specify neutron radiation because that is the only kind that makes affected atomic structures radioactive as well.",7년 전,0,

There are even more material on the power of the Force, but this should be enough to get you started.  PS: Some people would suggest you see the episodes in the following order, 4 - 5 - 6 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 7 - 8 - 9, this is for the most part due to one small but vital piece of information revealed in Episode 5 that's not all that shocking if you see episodes 1 - 2 - 3 first.",7년 전,3,

Yea it probably wouldnt effect us much but it would effect the life that does thrive in the trench. If you want to test a nuke best place to do it is outside the orbit of the planet some place between us and the moon because at least our atmosphere would shield us from the radio active fall out like it does rays from our sun.,6년 전(수정됨),0,

In the scenario you have described here the effect would probably be limited, but I'm wondering about the effect more generally.  Would fallout from a nuclear war kill the phytoplankton and deprive us of a key source of oxygen thus adding one more very nasty outcome to a scenario already filled with very nasty outcomes?  If the nuclear explosions, radiation, fallout, and nuclear winter don't kill us, would the lack of oxygen?  Also, how much oxygen would all of those massive nuclear explosions and the resulting fires consume?

We had no idea what happened to it until we decided to test this again. we used an extremely efficient camera to record what happened.

@ZenGeekDad,"The Tsar bomb was estimated at various strengths, but the most common number is 50 megatons, not the 1 megaton (of TNT) shown in the graphic at 4:30.  The 1906 earthquake in San Francisco has been updated to ~7.9 on the Richter scale, or 4.5 x 10^16 Joules.  One megaton (of TNT) is 4.2x10^15 Joules.  This puts the San Francisco quake at ~10 megatons, so the 4:30 graphic got that right.  I'll have to ask a nuke colleague if the 1 megaton (for the Tsar bomb) shown here was some modification of the energy released, as a result of being under 1,086 atmospheres.  I know chemical explosions, but DK if nuclear ones might be moderated in this way.  Maybe.  Seems that if anything compression should increase the yield by increasing the fraction of the fuel that fuses.",7년 전,0,

@pirobot668beta,"In  typical year, the Pacific tectonic plate moves about 1-2 cm. The estimated mass of all that rock, magma and water is on the order of trillions of tons. The energy it takes to move the plate is equally immense. It would take around 15000 Tzar-Bomba, the biggest nuke ever made, to approximate the energy of one year of plate-shift. And that's jut the Pacific. Reference: Mt. St. Helens, 1980, blew off about 1/4 of its volume in a blast that was estimated to be around 24 megatons. Watch the video of the blast: the dirt and rocks sort of heave, then slide down one side of the mountain. Hardly the show a planet-ending bomb should have had, amirite? This mountain could completely hide in any of the deep trenches, BTW. Toggle a nuke in a trench, you get some earthquakes, some sloppy-water events on the shore-line, and not much else. Reference:  Hurricane Katrina, at peak power, was dumping around a megaton of energy per minute! Megatons per minute.  Hour after hour. A 'typical' hurricane dumps around 10,000 'Hiroshima' units of energy during its life-span. Yeah, nukes are terrible 'from a certain point of view', but Earth and Sky are so much bigger than our small machines.",7년 전,0,

@UnkleSanik,"I'm sorry pal but as a nuclear physics student I can confirm to you nothing would happen as explained, radiation depends on the lack of pressure to generate stuff like the images of buildings getting blown up by their expansion wave.  The pressure in the Mariana Trench bottom isn't just high, it's high enough to transform even the strongest of materials into a mucous substance.  Of course, as he said as well it would mean a consequence for the fauna around, that would still be pretty much known fauna and fauna we can see in other deep points, as nothing can live under such pressure, even if it'd somehow manage to evolve for that.  Tectonic plaques are also incredibly rough to move, stuff like fracking manages to do so because injecting water into fuel deposits generates as much pressure as the trench, which in such a a small space is strong enough to move the earth.

It would have helped to have an initial as a symbol on the bird and I only have given viewers curiosity but also to have given the sponsor something to share with friends and family as their support is now in the video and would probably Proctor other family members to pursue it as well.

@storm12weather,"Still not much. For a comparison, the total energy or moment energy of a 9.0 Earthquake is over 5 teratons of TNT equivalent. That's 1,000 times greater than our entire nuclear arsenal. When compared to the mass of Earths plates, our bombs are nothing. The displacement from a bomb in water is tiny compared to an Earthquake as well, so they aren't good tsunami producers. A large wave can be made by an explosion, but it dissipates within a few miles of the epicenter because of the short wavelength. In comparison, a large tsunami from an Earthquake has a huge wavelength and can travel across an entire ocean yet still cause destruction.",7년 전(수정됨),9,

@joshuasalud326,"tsar bomba actually does not produce radioactive biproducts because it does not use plutonium or uranium. in fact, peak cold war nuclear weaponry was mostly fusion, as opposed to fission powered, meaning the explosion was a reaction of atoms combining not spliting, so these combing reactions were known as fusion. fusion was generally fueled by smaller atoms, such as hydrogen becuase the took less energy to bring together. and when fusing two hydrogen atoms, the biproduct is well just helium, like the stuff that makes your voice high pitched when you suck it out of a ballon. these bombs like project ivy, castle bravo, the infamous tsar were not meant to devastate a land and make it inhabitable for thousands of years, rather to relive them of their populace so that another may thrive in their place.",7년 전,0,

@joshuasalud326,"NAREN ROHAN I can actually but it is slightly more complex than a conventional nuclear weapon. early fusion weaponry only consisted of two stages. the first is a conventional nuclear weapon with minimal yeild designed solely to give ignition to the second stage. it consists of plutonium, very small amount of tritium, and an electric nutron beam emmiter. nothing new here. once the detonation occurs the reaction goes super critical and pumps out  loads of X-rays. These are quite important for the next two stages. In quantam mechaincs these whould be known as bussons which are basically categorized photons. anyways these xrays would go on to ignite the second stage witch is a little different. the first stage is a sphere while the second is actaully a cylinder. it is a chamber made of plutonium with a plutonium rod penetrating the chamber down the center and it is filled with deterium the second isotope of hydrogen. the plutonium reacts with the x-rays and rapidly expands, creating basically instant and nearly infinite pressure, like somthing youd read at the convection zone in the sun. the deterium compresses and well the atoms fuse and you get yourself a fusion reaction. the stages are held together by styrafoam which allows the x-rays to pass through and the shell is of iridum which reflects x-rays from stage one to stage two. the biproduct of the reaction is helium.",7년 전,0,
@joshuasalud326,"Holmes 45 tread carefully. the development of nuclear weaponry led to the introduction of chemotherapy along with nuclear power. nuclear power is a soucre of energy that does not require loads of fossil fuels, and greenhouse gas emissions that are lower than even the mighty solar, and if you concern over radioactive waste, consider that we actaully re enrich nuclear waste to reuse as fuel and if not they are sent to fuel smaller reactors. and even if you are not satisfied with this, there is a project in france in construction known as ITER. it is currently the world most expensive science expiriment so expensive that not only france, but the USA, India, china, and germany have all pitched in becuase fusion energy is powered by... tritium which you can refine from decommisioned nuclear weaponry or the ocean, and its practically unlimited and free. and the generation of electricity through fusion energy would never have been concived without, you named it, nuclear weaponry.",7년 전,0,

My family owns a 100 acre island there, a resort, and many homes, and these were not pleasure investments. millions flock to the philipines every year to expirience the worlds most proclaimed beaches and oceans.

The test itself was also clean because it was an airburst - that is, the explosion's fireball didn't touch the ground. If it did, literal tons of dirt would be vaporized inside the fireball and lifted into the mushroom cloud, irradiated, and turned into radioactive fallout.

@hrthrhs,"Hang on, I think there'd be more than just bubbles.  As air and water are both fluids, the expanding blast would behave the same in both, although (as the vid said) wouldn't expand as far underwater due to the much higher pressure. But I see no reason why there wouldn't be an outward push of the water, followed by the quick rush of the pushed out water back to the center, just as we see happen in with air on the surface. This expanding would push water out (which continue to the water's surface) and may become a giant wave. OR, it's the rapid rush of water to fill the void left by the explosion would create it's own shock wave, just like how when someone bomb dives, it's not the impact which creates the largest wave, it's water rushing back in and colliding which does.   If course seeing as the trench i so deep, perhaps the energy wouldn't reach the surface.  Or, instead of pushing out the water, it just gets vaporised, in which case,  you'd still have a void that the water would quickly rush back in to fill.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@jamessheesley5484,"The smaller your bomb the more deadly it is in the long term. The long term radiation and fallout are caused by the parts of the fission core that did not react. No fission reaction is even close to 100% efficient. Bomb that are in the high kiloton range will not produce a cloud that will reach the high atmosphere and will dump their fallout fairly close. This will cause a grater loss of life in the local area in the long term. So with a fission weapon to get a big blast you need a bigger core and so more fallout and more fallout = more dead. A fusion bomb on the other hand uses a vary small fission bomb to get the ball rolling with a vary small core and so less fallout. All this is beside the point in any case. The biggest problem is not the nukes but the world wide famine that would in all likelihood follow. Not from the much touted ""nuclear winter"" but all the firestorms. The heat from a nuke can light cement on fire much less any thing else and the soot and ash from these global fires would fill the upper atmosphere with a sun choking fog for years, maybe decades. Global temperatures would drop quit a bit and grow sessions would drop to one or two months. You do not need nukes to do this but they are far better at it, just sufficient forest fires would do which could be stared by any number of thing in theory.

But an actual fusion bomb that can work up a perpetual fusion cycle (something we don't actually have, since the only thing we got close to that are stars heavier than the Sun itself) would indeed use all it had if we managed to make one; though I think that will forever stay as only a theory, I don't think we can build something like that.  ""the tsar bomba was technically detonated at ""half power"" as the design was capable of a 50 MT configuration and 100 MT configuration"" I meant that the rumors were about the 50 MT version only exploding half of its charge. But I never found any actual proof, so I dismissed them. Maybe the rumors mixed up the fact that they had made the bomb able to carry 100 MT but only carried 50 for the test. Anyways, perhaps the bomb detonated around 80% of its charge, maybe less or more than that, it's hard to know for sure. What we knew is what it was supposed to detonate and that it actually used less destructive power than our expectation, and that alone scared the world into deciding that maybe exploding nuclear bombs of such magnitude around was a bad idea.",7년 전,0,
@coughsyrupconnoisseur,"If we ever make a pure fusion weapon, it's still entirely possible that it won't consume all of its fuel depending on the weapon design. The principle is that consumption of the fuel, whether fission or fusion fuel, has to be completed before complete explosive disassembly makes it impossible to consume more. A pure fusion weapon could still surely suffer from this problem if it doesn't consume its fusion fuel faster than the already-consumed fuel can blow the device apart.  The situation with the Tsar Bomba isn't a baseless rumor, that's literally how it is. It exploded at exactly the yield the Soviets knew it would explode at. The warhead inside of the Tsar Bomba, the AN602, was originally meant to be produced in greater numbers and operationally deployed as a three-stage, 100 MT fission-fusion-fission weapon, with the last fission stage (a tamper) accounting for about half of the yield - as most hydrogen bomb designs using a fissionable tamper do. However, for the test of the weapon, it was to be delivered by a modified Tu-95 known as a Tu-95V, and in order for the plane to escape the blast safely, the fissionable uranium tamper was replaced with one of lead in order to reduce the yield to 50 MT.",7년 전,0,
@RagnarLothbrok-il3jr,"If thats so,  would't the bomb consume all of its material, or have much more efficiency when placed deep in the sea? i mean the water can keep the explosion 'together' in a 'bubble', so it would be something pretty close to some kind of nuclear deep sea sun",7년 전,0,
@coughsyrupconnoisseur,"The pressure is higher in the bottom of the ocean, of course, but I don't think it's enough to hold the bomb together enough, fast enough, and for long enough to make a noticeable impact on how the explosion comes out. The pressure produced in radiation implosion from a thermonuclear weapon's primary is far greater than the pressure even at the bottom of the sea, if I recall correctly.",7년 전,0,
@123leyang321,"""The principle is that consumption of the fuel, whether fission or fusion fuel, has to be completed before complete explosive disassembly makes it impossible to consume more."" That's exactly what the perpetual fusion cycle does, it consumes everything before it gets blown away. But so far only stars with more mass than the Sun are capable of that because they have enough gravity to pull the particles back for another fusion reaction. The destructive power comes from the energy dispersion alone. But, yeah, I really doubt we can make something like that. Unless we somehow managed to make the equivalent of a tiny black hole inside the bomb that keeps pulling the particles back so they can fuse again and release the energy until there's no more mass left and the black hole dissipates (I said black hole because it's the only thing so far that might, and only maybe, have enough gravity in such a small volume to fit inside a bomb). I can't say about a very far future, who knows what we might be able to do in 1000s of years ahead of now (granted we didn't destroy ourselves and our planet by then). But even then, that sounds too far fetched to be built. Though I guess it could be an interesting theoretical weapon.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
@coughsyrupconnoisseur,"I think if you had a black hole big enough (still small, but big enough) for its gravity to have a significant effect on holding the bomb together until all of its fuel is consumed, you wouldn't need a fusion bomb in the first place. A black hole like that would probably just as quickly evaporate due to Hawking radiation and release an explosion that could nearly be the same size as the fusion bomb would be itself. Depending on the complexity and size of the device needed to create and maintain a black hole like that, you could just use that as the bomb - make the black hole and let it go up in flames.",7년 전,1,
@123leyang321,"""you wouldn't need a fusion bomb in the first place"" Probably not, it'd be more practical to simply go for a black hole bomb straight away indeed. But if we managed to make something else that had a small volume but huge mass to hold the bomb together, something that wouldn't dissipate like the black hole from lack of mass to turn into energy... Maybe millennia from now we will be trying our first experiments with, for an instance, dark matter and dark energy bombs. They say those have an effect on gravity, though there have been completely new theories that refute that by explaining gravity in a new way, so there's that, we've kinda reached a wall of confusion and we can only speculate with those now. But it's very intriguing!",7년 전,0,
@coughsyrupconnoisseur,"indeed it is. I think it all stands to reason, though, that by the time we come up with methods of completely confining a nuclear bomb until all its fuel is consumed, via black holes, dark matter or energy, or whatever else, we won't need those nuclear bombs anymore because we've come up with even better and efficient explosives! lmao",7년 전,0,
@123leyang321,"I know right! It's so crazy that by trying to find new ways to build the same old nuclear bomb as efficiently as possible we actually make a new kind of bomb that works even better than what we were trying to achieve before. And that kinda thing sometimes also happens with other discoveries of ours.

Proton-proton fusion is probably not a viable pathway, despite the density of protium in water, given its extremely small probability of occurring for any given interaction, but would it be at least hypothetically possible to initiate a proton-deuterium chain reaction in Earth’s oceans, triggering a runaway fusion reaction (which, given the volume of the ocean and the quantity of deuterium therein, would trivially release enough energy to vaporize Earth and probably the Moon as well)?  From what (clumsy, amateurish) calculations I’ve been able to make, given the known concentration of deuterium in seawater, the answer seems to be yes, but with the caveat that even the Tsar Bomba’s energy was about a hundredfold too small to actually initiate such a reaction.  My own unfamiliarity with the science in question, though, and my inability to find any papers specifically addressing the topic (there were some very educational papers looking at the fusion of nitrogen in the atmosphere, but nothing specifically addressing the energetics of an aquatic detonation), leaves me very suspicious of my result.",7년 전,0,

@yosefmacgruber1920,"Do you see such irresponsible experiments, going right?  Yeah, what if God did not cause the Great Flood that so many pagans try to blame God for? What if God had ""allowed"" it to occur? What if God saw it coming, gave Noah advanced warning, a century prior, allowing Noah to save the human race from its own demise, and allowed the calamity to go ahead and occur? Poetic justice. The evil mad scientists destroying themselves. In watching some documentary video, maybe hearing the crazy topics that they talk about on the radio talk show, ""Coast to Coast"", it suggests to me how it might have really happened. The evil mad scientists cracked the earth open, and the waters exploded out, covering the entire earth. Even in The Book of Jasher, it describes the people frantically banging on the side of the Ark, demanding Noah let them in, but God sent animals to chase them away. Too late! (They must have mocked Noah for a century, building that Ark, talking about it is going to rain and flood. They had all that time to change their ways. It was God who had shut the door to the Ark.) What a horror that must have been. A very terrible storm in which the people were just getting pelted by torrents of water pouring out the sky. Massive water volcanoes? I wonder how much tremendous pressure the ""fountains of the deep"" might be under? Well let's just open them up and see, before we bother to measure to see if it might be safe to do so? Of course I can not prove this interpretation, because the Bible is not specific enough to verify it.  Many people think that AIDS came to Africa in the vaccines. AIDS, Ebola, and whatever else, coming out of some evil mad scientists' laboratories, used by the evil NWO as a depopulation tool. Won't people be so surprised once the truth comes out, and people see how much rampant fake science is going on.

I'm only considering gravitational force, otherwise the problem would be too complicated. By integration I found that the center of mass of each hemisphere is 3R8 away from the center, so the distance between the two centers of mass is 6R8.  Most equals (=) mean approximately equal to (≈), but because the method to calculate this force is already a huge approximation, it won't really matter.  GMmR6R8=6.67×10−11 m3⋅kg−1⋅s−2=5.97×1024 kg=M2=2.99×1024 kg=6.37×106 m=4.78×106 m Newton's Law of Gravitation:  F=Gm2r2=2.61×1025 N which is: 2.610.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 Newtons which is 2 septilions and 610 sextillion or something hahaha  That's the force each of those hemispheres exerts on the other, so to separate them, you would need a force larger than this value.  NEW: I'll add to these calculations the amount of energy necessary to separate these two hemispheres in a way that they wouldn't pull each other and be together again.  U=Gm2r=1.25×1032 joule which is HUGE.  Just for you to have an idea, the sun releases 3.85×1026 J per second of energy in the form of light. You would need all the energy that the sun releases over a period of 3.76 days (assuming you weren't losing any, which is almost impossible).  Really cool :D  New 2: According to Wikipedia, the Earth receives 174 petawatts at the upper atmosphere, which is 1.74×1017 W.  To gather enough energy to blow the planet apart, one would need to save all the energy that hits the Earth for 7.18×1014 s, which is 23100000 years. Don't forget that people need energy to live and that it's almost impossible to manage to gather all of it.  So... maybe someday :D",7년 전,72,

@jimsagubigula7337,"+Fyukfuykfjym Popuouiyfth If I understood correctly what you are trying to do, you are trying to find out the energy needed to split the planet apart i.e. destroy it. OK, I'll give it a shot. As I see the problem, there are two things that you can do. You'll either have to dig to the center of the planet, place a nuke there and detonate it, or you'll simply detonate a powerful enough nuke on the surface of the planet to destroy it. Let's work out its case one by one. Firstly, we'll try to destroy the planet by detonating a nuke at its center. This is a fairly simple case actually. The energy released by the nuke must be at least the same as the gravitational binding energy of the Earth (A gravitational binding energy is the minimum energy that must be added to a system for the system to cease being in a gravitationally bound state). If we symbolize the gravitational binding energy by the letter U, we have U=(3GM^2)/5R=(3*6,67*10^-11*(5,97*10^24)^2)/5*6,371*10^6=2,24*10^32 J or 53 Zettatons of TNT (1.060.000.000.000.000x Tsar Bomba). The second situation is a little bit harder. If the nuke explodes on the surface of the Earth, it will form a crater. It has been found that, if the crater formed by the explosion is roughly 50% of the volume of the Earth, the Earth will be destroyed. We know that the volume of the Earth is 1,1*10^21 m^3. Thus, the volume of the crater must be 5,5*10^20 m^3. Now, although for a surface explosion it's much more complicated, using some scaling laws for nuclear explosions, I found out that you'll need approximately the same energy to do the job.",7년 전,2,

Granted, they probably wouldn't be catastrophic, but when you have sudden 1 km void, it will probably oscillate few times (cavitation effect included) and that will propagate to the surface. Near the shores, a tiny displacement from the point right above the explosion would grow considerably. How much, that's a matter of complicated calculations, but I fear it would not be a laughing matter.  Calculations get really complicated when you include the compressibility of water. Mariana's trench would be some 15 m deeper if water wasn't compressible.  Also, it's really called ""Tsar"". Not ""Tsar bomba"". ""Bomba"" is not part of its name, it's just bomb in Russian.

@Dreamz99,Um nope. One gram of anti matter bomb is enough to destroy entire New York city and even it's surrounding cities to the core. So the size of tsar Bomba antimatter bomb would be immensely destructive.,7년 전,0,
@MariOfTheMountains,"New York city is just a tiny, insignificant speck on the Earth's crust compared to the entire planet itself.   Let's do some math here. The mass of Little Boy's fissible material was 140 lb, which translates 63502.9 grams. Little Boy released 15 kilotons of TNT's worth of energy. In contrast one gram of antimatter releases about 42 kilotons worth of energy when reacting with a gram of matter. So in terms of destructive power, antimatter would be about 100,000 times more powerful than an equivalent mass of an atom bomb, given the most generous estimate.  The blast radius of maximum damage for Little Boy was about 3 miles. Now since an increase in radius requires a cubed increase in volume and therefore power, let's assume then that the blast radius of an antimatter bomb is 1,000 times that of Little Boy. So...3000 miles. Seems like a lot, no? Well...not really, if we're talking about the destruction of the planet. Little Boy failed to break the strongest reinforced concrete frames 1 mile away from the blast, and the Earth's crust and mantle are much, much more massive, stronger, and denser than those. So basically an antimatter weapon the size of a standard thermonuclear weapon will stand no chance of destroying the Earth. Recall that this planet has a mass 5.972 × 10^24 kg, which is more than capable of withstanding an antimatter weapon, albeit probably with some serious damage (say, a hole in the ground hundreds of mile across, exposing a lot of magma...basically what happens when you MCedit in a giant ball of TnT in Minecraft). And the other planets are so far away that this likely wouldn't have an effect on them.   Humanity would probably perish for sure. But the Earth? It will abide.",7년 전,9,

@crazypeepsbrosk1,"Fergus Mo do you know what Anti-Matter is? Since you don't seem to here's how to figure out the energy released. E=mc^2. Just multiply the mass of Anti-Matter you want to use by 2 (since it will annihilate regular matter in a 1:1 ratio producing energy from both) then multiply by the speed of light (in m/s) squared! So let's take little boy. Little boy released 6.3*10^13 joules of energy. So how much Anti-Matter would we need to produce the same energy? .35 grams. Less about a third the mass of a penny to produce the same energy yield. But don't worry, antimatter isn't exactly accessable right now.

@crazypeepsbrosk1,"Shilp Mehta that claim is false as well. The tsar bomba was about 27000kg. So using the same equation, the energy released would be 4.86*10^21 joules. In order for there to be ""debris"" to hit other planets, something would have to be going at escape velocity, 11.2km/s. However most energy is released in the core where everything is vaporized. This is why you don't see a bunch of rocks traveling at emense speeds from the center of nuclear blasts... The rocks are vaporized. But even so, if all the energy went into a ball of iron that hit another planet then..  it would have the same explosive force of 4.86×10^21 joules.. but since that essentially says we had no damage here because all the energy released left Earth in a ball of iron. Clearly you can see how this wouldn't work out this way. At best there could be a few small rocks traveling at escape velocity, sure, but there are way more small rocks out there already wandering the solar system. All in all, while it's a lot of energy released, way more would need to be produced to destroy a planet into pieces. Planets are way bigger than one might first think.

@echomjp,"With a 1 km diameter, the sphere would have a volume that would raise the average ocean volume by something like 1 micrometer, or one millionth of a meter. Near the original explosion, it might be slightly more of a rise, but if the detonation were this deep it would be essentially nothing.   The energies involved with nuclear weapons are definitely impressive, but they are nothing compared to tectonic activity, or natural forces in general. A hurricane alone releases an amount of energy that is about equivalent to all of the nuclear weapons on the planet (in that ballpark) throughout its lifetime, assuming said weapons were all detonated at once.  Then again a nuclear weapon can be far more ""deadly"" for what it does. Since in the case of a hurricane, much of the energy is simply being dispersed into the atmosphere, and an earthquake mostly into the deep ground as opposed to the surface. A nuclear weapon on the other hand, if detonated in close proximity and in open air, creates a massive shockwave of compressed air that does most of the real damage. Of course the heat and radiation are also significant, but not in terms of immediate damage.",7년 전,0,

@aronbraswell1589,hold on..... ocean water has many types of radio active isotopes concentrated at depth and heavy water. Also hydrogen bomb temps would split salt into sodium and chloride which are both explosive. Not to mention those same temps would brake water into hydrogen and oxygen. Also with that much pressure on the explosion it might sustain longer like a tokamak. An explosion like this may be much bigger than just the bomb. Look up Americas' first hydrogen bomb test. A mistake with lithium isotopes degrading during the explosion increased the blast by a third or more. Scientists calculated to be safe in a bunker during the test thought they were going to die and got near fatal radiation poisoning.,7년 전,0,

@awesomelyshorticles,"Couple things worth mentioning that I'm quite surprised they didnt explain: The bubble it is describing is a giant cavitation bubble. The water causes it to collapse and bounce back out, but instability causes it to be less effective. It would look EXACTLY like it does in the slowMo guys video where they fire a gun underwater.  Water is a good radiation absorber, so radiation wouldnt travel and wouldnt last long. That's why nuclear power plants use pools of water to store waste.  There is no sea life at the deepest point of the marianas trench. The pressure is too great for many organics compounds to form and be stable. No sea life will be harmed by the detonation of a nuclear bomb at the deepest part of the ocean.",7년 전,0,

@Jixijenga,"Nunya Bznz No, not really, this video is assuming that the ocean's few hundred atmospheres worth of pressure will just go easy on that swarm of bubbles. That radiation you're referring to comes from fallout particles, dust, which wouldn't last long traveling several miles through water and would begin their descent pretty much as soon as they hit cold water. Most of the very, very energetic isotopes in radioactive fallout are beta or alpha emitters which are stopped by nearly everything denser than open air, so the water itself will contain that.  Those that aren't, the source of gamma rays and so on, are still going to be trapped in the water and unless you're literally swimming in the warm plume you're not going to notice anything. Since we don't normally frolic at the bottom of the ocean the fallout itself isn't going to come into contact with us any time soon. When it does all those very dangerous radioactive isotopes will have decayed (7-10 rule still applies) as they would have normally.  Of course I'm not really addressing the cesium-flavored elephant in the room, but honestly I think the detonation of a one-hundred megaton warhead at the bottom of the ocean would be enough for people to start testing the tuna haul.",7년 전,37,

Absolutely correct, except that amount of radiation unleashed that low in the nutritional chain of the ocean would cause an immense nutritional up-swelling, enjoyed by algal blooms across the globe! except this one would be radioactive. Juuuust radioactive enough for the algae to survive!

As demonstrated in the video, there'd be a bunch of radiation reaching the surface, some nuclear glass on the bottom of the ocean, a bunch of irradiated fish, but little else.   What you're looking for is earthquakes and volcanic explosions, which are far more powerful than any nuclear weapon we have ever built.

@fyukfuykfjympopuouiyfth940,"Firstly, I'm assuming that the earth is split in two hemispheres and we are trying to separate those. I'm only considering gravitational force, otherwise the problem would be too complicated. By integration I found that the center of mass of each hemisphere is 3R8 away from the center, so the distance between the two centers of mass is 6R8.  Most equals (=) mean approximately equal to (≈), but because the method to calculate this force is already a huge approximation, it won't really matter.  GMmR6R8=6.67×10−11 m3⋅kg−1⋅s−2=5.97×1024 kg=M2=2.99×1024 kg=6.37×106 m=4.78×106 m Newton's Law of Gravitation:  F=Gm2r2=2.61×1025 N which is: 2.610.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 Newtons which is 2 septilions and 610 sextillion or something hahaha  That's the force each of those hemispheres exerts on the other, so to separate them, you would need a force larger than this value.  NEW: I'll add to these calculations the amount of energy necessary to separate these two hemispheres in a way that they wouldn't pull each other and be together again.  U=Gm2r=1.25×1032 joule which is HUGE.  Just for you to have an idea, the sun releases 3.85×1026 J per second of energy in the form of light. You would need all the energy that the sun releases over a period of 3.76 days (assuming you weren't losing any, which is almost impossible).  Really cool :D  New 2: According to Wikipedia, the Earth receives 174 petawatts at the upper atmosphere, which is 1.74×1017 W.  To gather enough energy to blow the planet apart, one would need to save all the energy that hits the Earth for 7.18×1014 s, which is 23100000 years. Don't forget that people need energy to live and that it's almost impossible to manage to gather all of it.  So... maybe someday :D",7년 전,2,

Firstly we don’t know the size of the black hole in question and how much Anti-Matter is there being used on the Black hole, given how severely warped time is around a Black hole I assume it would effect what would happen to any created energy from the Anti-matter. The energy created from the Anti-matter would most likely expire due to the time effected around the Black Hole from my guess, all in all nothing much would be seen imo.",7년 전,1,
@BizarreCoyote,"Short answer: Nothing.  Long answer: To anyone outside the Black Hole's perspective? Nothing. You would see it approach the Hole's 'entrance', slowly coming to a stop, and then just fade from your sight. Even if you could survive long enough to ensure that the Black Hole ""swallowed"" it, you still wouldn't see anything. Light can't escape a Black Hole, so you wouldn't see an explosion. The pressure would be so immense in there, that even individual particles inside won't shift when the matter-antimatter annihilation occurs. The only thing that may occur is that the Black Hole becomes that much lighter (throw in 5 kg of antimatter, Black Hole becomes 10kg lighter). If you could throw in enough to cause the Black Hole to ""starve"", then sure, you might destroy it (in which case it still won't explode, only dissolve into Hawking Radiation).  If you could get your hands on enough antimatter to outweigh stars, though, why are you wasting it doing that when you could use it as a perfectly efficient fuel source?",7년 전,1,

@XDbored1,that's pretty underwhelming how big a bomb would we need for the fireballs diameter to reach the surface and what would happen if we made a bomb 13x more powerful or do we need to larger bomb because of volume a bomb 40X as powerful? or 80x i am sure we could make a bomb 100x that if we really wanted to destroy the earth but there's a question how big a nuke could we make if we gathered all of the nuclear fuel in the earths crust and made 1 bomb out of it,7년 전,0,

@MrMarksam1,"Well I wouldn't say they considered everything.  I mean the tzar bomb wasn't fission bomb it was a fusion bomb which in my opinion means that the additional pressure an fuel (water) would make the chain reaction last even longer.  And why wouldn't there be a wave. The pressure can only go in 3 directions and one of those is up. If 11km of water get shot upwards 1km at an fairly high speed, I believe this will couse a wave.",7년 전,0,
@gmsherry1953,"So ... does it fizzle before it ever makes it to fusion?  Is that kind of the point, that the atomic bomb trigger is all that detonates?

@puncheex2,"Some things:  Early testing proved that bombs (atomic or conventional) are lousy tsunami creators.  The ideal tsunami creator creates a permanent  (or at least one that lasts hours) displacement in the water measured in cubic miles.  A large bomb creates a bubble (a cavitation bubble, containing steam, not air) that expands against the pressure and then collapses, rebounds outward to a smaller diameter, collapses again, and continues the cycle until all the potential/kinetic energy is converted into heat.  That will create waves close in but not the long-period waves that are tsunamis.  Under huge pressure not even a bubble will be created.  Water is NOT incompressible, only relatively so compared to air.  If it were totally incompressible, it would not be able to transmit sound, which is a pure compression waveform.  Nothing I know of is totally incompressible, even neutronium in neutron stars transmits shock waves.      Underwater bomb experiments:     Crossroads/Baker - in 50 meters inside the Bikini lagoon, 20 kT.     Wigwam - in 610 meters of water in the Pacific Ocean, 400 miles off LA, 30 kT.     Hardtack I/Wahoo - in 150 meters outside Bikini Lagoon, 9 kT.     Hardtack I/Umbrella - in 50 meters inside the lagoon, 9 kT.     Dominic/Swordfish - in 198 meters in the Pacific Ocean, ASROC test, undisclosed yield.     USSR #22 (Joe 17) - in 12 meters at Novaya Zemlya, 3.6 kT. (these three USSR tests were torpedo tests)     USSR #48 (Joe 42) - in 20 meters at NZ, 10 kT.     USSR #122 (Koral-1, Joe-117) - in  58 meters at NZ, 4.8 kT. That's the complete list of underwater tests.  All the US tests and the USSR #22 are featured in videos on YT.  Radioactivity generated by the bomb is not a hazard.  First, there is no life as we know it in the trench.  No energy.  No smokers (they work at plate spread joints, not subduction), no sunlight, no currents, no nothing.  Secondly, water is a very good shield from radioactivity.  6 meters is enough to lower the worst radioactivity we have (fresh spent reactor fuel) to background. Third, nothing to spread the radioactivity around.  Too deep and protected from even the deepest circulation currents.  All material from the bomb will drop no farther from the blast than, say, a mile.  No bubble to the surface (too much pressure).  Oops: it appears that I am wrong about life in the trench.  OK, scratch that argument.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Maybe we could design self replicating machines to mine the earth or go into space and redirect asteroids to hit it to get chunks into orbit then direct that into the sun and destroy the earth over a few million years of this process exponentially being accelerated by the machines constantly increasing in number.  Not sure where to get all the energy needed to get the fuel for rockets or whatever to redirect that much mass thought.. Might not even be possible using only what is available and in reach in our solar system.   However, we don't need to do anything to destroy the earth, over the next half of our stars lifetime it will do that for us as it becomes a red giant and expands to the size the earths orbit now is nearly inside of it. About a billion give or take another 500 million years the sun will have increased in outputting energy enough that the oceans on the surface of the earth will like all evaporate away and liquid water will no longer exist here.   Everything is on a path to oblivion from the beginning as nothing is eternal from the way things look so we don't need to figure out how to destroy a planet that for some reason we think as individuals today is small when it isn't small at all compared to things on our scale, even when you account for all 7.3 billion of us we're tiny.",7년 전,1,

@UnloadingMouse,Rifle Shooter Channel I wasn't going for intellectual honesty mostly because this is the first time I have heard this term. I stated this simply because I had already agreed with the idea of water pressure destroying the tsar bomb. With the presumption that the bomb would have not been designed to withstand such pressure.

I personally feel that a noticeable amount of your (Kurzgesagt) videos have a bit of a political bias (not this one, it's just the most recent). While you are completely entitled to your views, and even though I agree with a fair bit of them, I personally would like to see that this channel be a bit more clear cut and less bias if possible. While there will always be some trace amount of bias, I do feel that it could definitely be lessened for the sake of raw information. This all being said, I have yet to dislike a single video, and if nothing were to change I would not be hurt one bit. I just find that sometimes bias can cloud up the information, and especially make it hard for some to differentiate from what is the creators opinion, and what is fact.

We can, and it's actually much more efficient. It's called hydroponics. - Once we have efficient enough way to turn solar into electricity, we can just use red LEDs to grow plants, not wasting loads of energy, water and land to grow food. People already do that, even though it's still far from perfect and our solar panels are still pretty bad. It's just still more expensive (especially initial investment) than classical agriculture.  And the best solution is making O'neill cylinders anyway: that way we can control everything much more easily, efficiently use our sun.... if we properly figure out fusion, that will honestly solve everything.

@AdrenalStorm,"Maybe not in current times or the near future. And definitely not with limited resources. So... What about in the distant future if we could harness anti-matter efficiently, and gather several metric tons worth of it? I know 1 gram of anti-matter holds a power significantly more powerful than nuclear bombs (and my understanding of hydrogen bombs is in theory there's no limit to how powerful they can be made), though of course nuclear bombs as of now can't even make a dent in earth's crust, let alone the mantle and core. So maybe not metric tons, but instead kilotons or megatons of anti-matter and if technology eventually allows it, we detonate the explosion in the planet's core. There are some articles I googled that show you in theory how you can do that, though again it's a long way off from current technology. And maybe not blow up a planet, but with self-replicating nano-probes in the far distant future if we could make it, we can theoretically dismantle an entire planet and use it to build something else, but that's of course if we can achieve type 2 or 3 civilization before we blow ourselves up or get killed by nature/unexpected event. If we can then with super-technology, it's also theoretically possible to create a gigantic lens sufficient to channel and redirect a small portion of the energy of a supernova, and even a small portion of a supernova is astronomically more powerful than the Death Star in the Star Wars original trilogy, which was able to completely vaporize a planet. It's all speculation at this point, but it's interesting to think about. And I would love to see Kurzgesagt's take on how we could in theory vaporize a planet or celestial body either realistically or in theory (sci-fi scenarios)",7년 전(수정됨),7,
@ssg4predater,"Well technically speaking nuclear fusion is what makes a star, So with enough(and I mean alot) we could definitely destroy a celestial body with it's energy, if we know how to make the output larger. The tsaar while a monsters, was made over 60 years ago, I can tell you as a fact, that we'll have bigger bombs than that by now, known or otherwise.  Anti-Matter is a natural progression of things. Technically speaking Type 3, or even 2 Civs are theoretically at best. We still don't know if we even CAN move at the speed of light, or that we'd want to if we even could. While it's great fun to speculate, few like to believe that there's a limit to what science and technology can go to.   Theoretically speaking the biggest bombs I think we could make something out of, would be taking energy from blackholes, since they at the present point in time, are the natural creators of the largest explosions we know of.",7년 전,2,

@lierdakil,"Tsar Bomba was one of the cleanest nuclear explosions on record in terms of fallout. It had lead casing to stop fast neutrons and avoid ternary fission reaction and most of its yield was due to deuterium-tritium fusion (which does not create any particularly radioactive products besides neutrons which will happily brake in water). So your whole dance around the radioactive plumes etc is inaccurate at best and misleading at worst. Most of the effects would boil down to creating a few tons of heavy water via neutron irradiation, some radioactive sediment from ""starter"" fission charge (no more than 10 metric tonnes), a little bit of radioactive Krypton (no more than 50 kg according to a back-of-the-envelope calculation, which is just 8 cubic meters under normal conditions), and quite a bit of your garden-variety helium-4 (ionized). Almost all of the radioactive materials, with the exception of Krypton, will stay at the bottom of the sea. Also, tell your animator that illustrating a thermonuclear fusion-type bomb with a fission reaction is more than a bit misleading -- while a smaller fission bomb is used to start a fusion reaction, it's not where most of the yield comes from, not by a long shot.",7년 전(수정됨),2,

Or did you mean how some people think the Earth is flat because the Bible says some things that aren't meant to be taken literally? (Not trying to start a religion flamewar or anything!!) You can't define a group by a small portion of it, for example Flat Earthers don't represent humanity as a whole.    Also, we have no reason to bomb the Mariana Trench. That's the primary reason. Why waste time and effort and resources just to do something because we can? Plus, the Mariana Trench is so deep and has so much pressure being exerted on it that we haven't been able to explore it much, if at all. Which means there are still probably-definitely undiscovered species down there, not to mention the ecosystem untouched by humanity and therefore preserved.

@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is the Original Semitic Text. HERE is The TRUE Savior  YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”  From the Ancient Semitic Scroll:  ""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moses wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)  Ancient Semitic Direct Translation Yad - ""Behold The Hand"" He - ""Behold the Breath"" Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion He - ""Behold the Breath""  “Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL”   PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified  That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote  Here is what they mean  YaH's Name: (Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)  YaH is The Creator: Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)  YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion: Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)  How YaH arrives: YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...  Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name!

Your animation suggests that a chicken would be compressed into an unrecognizable sphere of goo, which is very far from reality. being at depth is NOT like being crushed by a hydraulic press from every direction, it's like being underwater at very high pressure. Any compressible materials will be compressed, and a few chemical reactions in your body will change because molecules interact differently at higher pressure, but the majority of materials in animals, people, in fact the majority of solids are in-compressible. The chicken in the example will have the air in its lungs squeezed down to the size of a pin-head, which will probably cause some mechanical damage to the alveoli, and it will obviously suffocate. However, otherwise, it will still look like a chicken as it falls into the abyss.   This is a surprisingly common misconception, as we saw in the other (unnamed) video.",7년 전,0,

@LunarDelta,"Controlled fusion in a reactor intended to generate power is difficult but not impossible. Fusion inside a bomb is simple in comparison.  I'd also like to add that thechecker111 wasn't entirely incorrect in their statement. While hydrogen bombs do derive most of their power (sometimes as much as 70%) from the fast fissioning of the U-238 tamper, Tsar Bomba had its uranium tamper replaced with one made of lead in order to reduce the yield from 100MT to ~50 megatons. So this particular bomb did indeed get most of its energy from fusion. In addition to reducing the yield, this also GREATLY reduced the amount of fallout the bomb generated. Had the bomb been exploded with the uranium tamper in place, it would have increased worldwide fallout levels by 25%!",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@NobleWolf,"The Fallout of the a nuke going off in the ocean would be far more extreme the one going off on land. The Radio fallout would be deadly to life and would spread through the oceans quickly. It would make most complex life sick, but would kill off most tiny organisms like krill and and tiny photosynthetic plants  floating around in the jet streams. This would spread all over one if not all of our oceans eventually. The Radio active fallout would delude once spread enough around our oceans and maybe its low enough for life to survive. Sadly this won't be true for the ocean the detention happens. In a week or two we would see lots of dead marine life within 1000km.  Everything from Whales, to tiny fish would be floating around dead having  the base of their food chain demolished to a extreme degree, effectively starving to death. Predator animals wouldn't starve so easily, thye may just get sick from eatting radio active fish, but they would leave seeking other prey in other oceans. This would drastically change the ecosystem of that ocean It would effect us humans that much but it will me less fish food will be on the table for awhile. As for the fun idea of a nuke going off in the ocean causing something else more awesome to happen, the Answer is no, No Big Waves , Earthquakes or Storms will happen but we will get a damaged Ecosystem and we wouldn't see the effects until it is too late.",7년 전,0,

@iucYT,I understand what this video likes to tell but no it is not true. The energy produced by that bomb is capable of heating 10 power 14 kgs of water by one degree centigrade. Following conservation laws energy has to be now shared by surroundings and the medium. Now as you have told the bubble will be of 1 km and do you know from where this one kilometer is being shared from has to be water and pressure travels the same along all directions but below it is higher pressure and above it is lower pressure so the bubble rises at immense speed and before you know the whole ocean will be chaotic. This prediction is correct to some extent but it's wrong to a major extent. Anyway nice idea though but try applying physics to it more than just feelings.,7년 전,1,
@42nomnomnom,How big would a bomb have to be to create serious damage?  I did a quick google search(I know nothing about this sort of thing) and apparently Edward Teller theorized that we could create a 10 Gigaton Bomb(200x stronger than Tsar Bomba). I suppose that would do some damage?,7년 전,0,

This is the big problem with fission for both its civilian and military use. With fusion (D/D fusion like with the Tsar), you get almost only harmless helium and plenty of neutron radiation. You either harvest the energy of that neutron burst by coating the fission-fusion warhead with another layer of fission material (= larger explosion and more fallout), you coat it with a thick layer of lead (= diminish neutron burst) or you go with a minimal coating and end up with a dirty bomb that will partially irradiate stuff in its vincinity.",7년 전,6,

@zeromailss,"AFAIK if it was not exploded in the ocean then the danger outside of the direct damage from the explosion would be the dust lifted up by the explosion would cover a big part of the planet and will mess up the climate by covering the sun, also if more bomb exploded in many part of the world the dust could cover the entire earth for a long time that it would kill most creature on the surface of the earth",7년 전,1,

@Jerl-ksk,"Well, considering that we can currently only acquire minuscule amounts of antimatter, I imagine it'd be pretty tame.  In fact, if you combined all the antimatter both Fermilab and CERN have collectively isolated into one bomb, you could watch it on the Earth's surface from fairly closely with just a blast shield for protection - it would only release about 2kJ of energy.  Hand grenades release about 300kJ, so this wouldn't be a very spectacular explosion.  Antimatter is very difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to create and store.  If you're talking purely hypothetically, that would depend on the amount of antimatter in the antimatter bomb.  One antiproton?  You wouldn't even notice it.  We've actually detonated many, many antiprotons inside of particle accelerators.  An entire anti-Earth?  The explosion would briefly outshine the entire galaxy and release an amount of energy comparable to a supernova, destroying the entire solar system and possibly other nearby solar systems.  If you're asking purely hypothetically, there are no actual antimatter bombs to make a comparison to.  The amount of energy released is going to be less than or equal to the combined mass of matter and antimatter reacting together times the speed of light squared - E=MC^2.  Plug in any amount of antimatter you want to make a bomb out of and you'll get an upper limit for how much energy it'll release.",7년 전(수정됨),4,

Firstly, in the description of the initial blast, only a nuclear fission reaction is described, which is in fact only the primer for the fusion of hydrogen which causes the main thermonuclear explosion in a bomb this size.   Later, when comparing the seismic energy of the bomb to earthquakes, the Tsar Bomba is labeled as having a 1 Mt blast, while the actual energy of the bomb was over 50 Mt, twice that of the Indian Ocean Earthquake. Granted, far from all the energy would go into seismic impact, but surely it's got to be more than a fiftieth of the blast energy, right?",7년 전,0,

@PaddedShaman,"Not much. By the time the radiation gets spread wide enough to do any damage, it's been diluted too much. Water is also a great radiation insulator, so the effects of radiation are drastically reduced below the surface.

@Tyrandus89,"No Daniel Everest, it wouldn't. He said ""In the immediate area."" Not ""The entire ecosystem.""

@Meitti,"You get dangerous puddles here and there but water is pretty good at diluting and shielding from radiation. Why radiation is a bigger problem with surface bombs is the fallout, the explosion sends tons and tons of dust and small particles in the air, all of which are irradiated.

@bubbalover71,"A hydrogen bomb is a fission bomb that compresses tritium or deuterium (hydrogen isotopes) to the point that they fuse into helium, hence ""fusion bomb"". The amount of residual radiation is a product of the efficiency of the fission process, the more efficient the bomb the less radioactive material is left after detonation. In Tsar Bomba the casing went through a second fission reaction, making it a fission-fusion-fission bomb. If a bomb is 100% efficient it produces no fall out. If that makes sense.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Outside the context of religious scripture or Philosophy, how could we make such judgment? Because if human life indeed doesn't matter? Why bother trying to survive? why bother advancing ourselves in technology or society?  Because ""just"" and ""only"" the chemicals in our brain make us want to create a better living and to avoid death? Sure, it would be that way if you believe the chemicals in your brain that convince you that they are ""just"" and ""only"" chemicals, or that chemicals are intrinsically lesser than the concept of some ""soul."" You could say that Earth is the only life-bearing planet or one of unmeasurable many, but either way, we do not know, and to question whether the abundance or lack of life, does it make matter the individual existence thereof? Does the intentional torture, or killing of even a single being whatever it is, matter? Then why not torture or kill everything around us because it doesn't matter? Why not kill ourselves? Again, brain chemistry. Either way, we are designed upon ourselves to think about ourselves and consequently others, whether you believe in altruism or not, doesn't matter to me, in my opinion, there's nothing wrong with that.  As for the matter of the weapons themselves, you can say using a nuclear weapon does nothing compared the grand scale of the entire universe, but a galactic scale is not what we are dealing with on Earth. So it does always matter, whenever we do test these weapons, modify them, and actively use them with intent to destroy.",7년 전(수정됨),1,

@ProtonCannon,"Saying ""Nothing happens"" is just flat out not true.  An incredible amount of the deep sea life will be damaged irreparably by the explosion, then the nuclear fallout of the bomb will do and even greater untold amounts of devastation in the area for many years to come, the explosion itself cause incredible destruction but that is only a fraction of the damage that the nuclear fallout will do for the next 20-50 years. With the oceanic currents  taking the fallout even further horribly damaging and killing a lot of the wildlife on both macroscopic and microscopic levels carrying the nuclear fallout in their bodies through the ecosystem causing death and radiation disease in the oceanic life for generations to come.  So no, many MANY horrible things will happen to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of rare animals and plants that we do not even know yet of and may even go extinct without us ever seeing them.

In the current political climate (in America at least) this seems like a very dangerous idea to accidentally seen to promote. Can you do another video about how bad nuclear war would be, a la the excellent BBC Docudrama “Threads” or the long term terrifyingly widespread effects of “Cobalt-enhanced nuclear bombs”, which cause a huge fallout zone that’s deadly radioactive for decades or more, not just years. In particular, the part in this video about thousands of nuclear weapons being detonated and the implication that “Earth is still fine” will lead many people to suddenly think that everything they have heard about the dangers of radiation and fallout were just overblown, and that nuclear weapons aren’t all that scary. Please make another video ASAP to re-emphasize the horrors of nuclear weapons so that credible people won’t suddenly think that deploying them is okay because a cartoon said so.",7년 전,0,

The quality of your videos is better than ever, and the way you explain stuff is still top notch, but I don't think hypothetical topics and scenarios like this one get me the same way that your informative, theoretical and factual videos do (like the one on how your body fights off infections). Your videos on ebola, black holes, and other real things just have so much interesting content in them that you do such a good job of explaining, and while this video was still dope, it doesn't give me the same feeling as learning about some real 'thing' that makes me say ""fuck me, that's insane!"" the same way that learning about how the immune system works.

@protocolic,"ATLANTIS Why are you so easily and deliciously presumptuous? Have you read their ""About"" page? Have you been here since their 6th or 7th video ever? Nihilism - whether optimistic or pessimistic - is still nihilism. Death is all that matters and all that is real since life and existence can have no meaning.   The achievement of any level of technology can be reason for boundless, quiet joy, conviction and meaningfulness in living a uniquely human life. How I wish animals could comprehend our gorgeous world and their own matchless beauty. And it is thanks to that first fire, all the way to washing machines and now YouTube, that we are able to enjoy security, abundance and limitless potential to survive and grow intellectually.  I like the vilest, most unnatural, terrifying  costumes and art and makeup if it is done well - it still represents a universe or world where that form has human-life-sustaining function, and is open to every wonder of conceptual intelligence that is open to us, just in different physical form. Regardless of whether the populist aesthetic judgement of it is as being stereotypically (baselessly) ""villainous, ugly, or dangerous"", or as safely (boringly) ""pretty, harmless, or graceful"".   Stop excusing their philosophical inconsistencies. At least if they made strictly fact-based videos without biased commentary and cruelty-oriented style of animation - I'd have nothing but praise even if they continued to be unscientific about their epistemological, metaphysical, ethical and (somewhat down-played) political conclusions. That is, if you add all parts of philosophy up - if they left their philosophical conclusions and approach out of objective science.   In a nutshell - follow your own advice if you can't even address the issues at hand - whether with my comment, or even your defense of titles like ""What would happen if you dropped an elephant from the sky?"" or ""The earth is a prison and how to escape it"" - regardless of the validity of the facts in the videos, and the tasteless invalidity of their subjective opinions about those facts.",7년 전,0,

@dankaroor,Banana yeah but dpe a while it would be high enough to kill a lot of fish and then there is the ecosystem thing it would affect actually quite a lot because the ah i dont know how to explain it well the lets say that a fish that is relly deep gets eaten by a fish that is less deep and that goes on and on and so we get to the fish that is the   least deep and that affects the eco system quite some amount it isnt as drastic but the lesa deep fish have to eat othera at the same level or higher as they now also eat lower fish,7년 전(수정됨),0,

@NoJusticeNoPeace,"There was a minority opinion on the Manhattan Project that a nuclear bomb would ignite the entire atmosphere in a sustained reaction which would incinerate all life on Earth.  They decided it was unlikely and tested it anyway.  Likewise, there was a theory that the first fusion bombs would be hot enough to cause a sustained reaction and they tested those too.  The LHC has the potential to create strange matter with unknown properties which could conceivably be more stable than regular matter, and which would transform the entire Earth -- and eventually the entire Universe -- into this new, more stable form of matter, radiating outward at the speed of light.  And of course, the men in white smocks have deemed the risk small enough that they're just keeping right on merrily smashing atoms into their component quarks.",7년 전,0,

@tifoziPT,"NoJusticeNoPeace, Both of the things  you said are false, completely inaccurate and downright bullshit. Allow me to explain:  1) Nobody in the Manhattan Project thought that they would ignite the whole atmosphere with the fission reaction. They knew the math, they where the ones who did it. They knew what it would take to cause the initial explosion, the chain reaction,  and how far it would go on it's own, knowing exactly when it would lose it's ""punch"" and energy. The ""ignite the whole atmosphere"" started as a joke by Enrico Fermi, who was a  physicist who worked in the Manhattan Project, but he did it as a joke. So much, that some of his colleagues didn't like the joke at all, because they already knew what happens in a fission reaction. It was already well known and studied.  2) ...but the ""serious"" joke wasn't during the Manhattan Project, it was after 1950. In fact, it was when Edward Teller and other scientists were working on the Hydrogen Bomb, a much later project, not the first bomb project. They verified the calculations just to be SAFE and realized the whole atmosphere ignition scenario was wrong by a magnitude of 60 or more. So your whole premise that they feared igniting the whole atmosphere with the first test, but did it anyway, is idiotic and tries to portray scientists as some evil geniuses that don't care for human life. Most, if not all the scientists that were first involved in the MP left after the bombs were used. Oppenheimer being obviously the most known and vocal opposition of their use.  3) The whole LHC bullshit is getting old. Nobody, absolutely NOBODY involved with LHC ever thought they would create something that would consume the universe. They probably joked about it, and someone in the audience was probably stupid enough to be so ignorant they didn't understand the joke, so they thought it was real, but whatever... The point is, these scientists work their whole life on these projects. It takes decades to get them done, years to get approval and then more years of investment and building that might or might not pay-off. They don't spend millions upon millions on a hunch, or on something they know nothing about. They knew what the LHC would do, what kind of experiments could be done with it, and how they could record and analyze those experiments. They didn't know the results that they were going to get, but to assume they would somehow create a blackhole, or a new form of idiotic matter that somehow multiplies and consumes the whole fucking universe, is just retarded, unscientific, dribbled bullshit.  Honestly, if you don't know shit about what you're talking about, don't talk about it. Many people might read your comment and become one of those ballsweat smelling a-holes who shits on the benefits of science, because once he ""read about what those scientists did with the Manhattan Project"". It hurts actual science, and it makes you look like an idiot who didn't do his research before ""educating"" people.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
@NoJusticeNoPeace,"+Tiago Azevedo I think we agree on the facts, just have very different interpretations.  The fact that the possibility of a sustained reaction was even discussed and then they went ahead and tested anyway speaks to their irresponsibility.  And don't forget, they nearly melted their own ships at Bikini Atoll.  It's the same kind of arrogance we saw in NASA with the O-rings and the missing heat tiles, where people just shrugged their shoulders and rolled the dice with no regard for the seriousness of the consequences.  As for the LHC, I read several debates in the letters of peer-reviewed science journals among physicists who took the possibility of creating singularities or strange matter very seriously.  They concluded it was unlikely, but it was serious enough that it warranted debate and examination.  The possibility of forms of strange matter more stable than what exists now is remote but non-zero.  We simply don't understand particle physics well enough yet to be certain, and we won't until there is a GUT.  A non-zero chance of obliterating the galaxy through an ice-9 event is, in my humble opinion, too high for the sake of earning some old white men tenure.  Will the LHC destroy all life?  Probably not.  Will grey goo destroy the solar system?  Again, probably not.  Will a genetically engineered military superbug escape and kill all of humanity?  Odds are small but not impossible.  Would HAARP permanently alter the Earth's ionosphere?  Turns out it didn't, but they weren't 100% certain.  My point is that if you keep rolling the dice, eventually you will crap out.  And when the consequences are as existentially significant as ending all life, rolling the dice is arrogant and criminally irresponsible.",7년 전,0,

Depending on the distance between the two pieces, there could be a massive devastating earthquake though.  If the slices are also pushed apart far enough though, they would end up becoming independent stellar objects. The global effects on each half would be absolutely devastating, with large chunks falling off and occasionally falling back down, while other areas will crumble towards the gravitational center.

@NoJusticeNoPeace,"If you magically separated the halves by some distance, it wouldn't just slam together again.  The core and mantle are under such compressive pressure that you'd have an instant explosion outward on both sides, forcing the two halves of the Earth apart while filling the gap with suddenly uncompressed matter.  All that compressive energy would be released as (a) a shockwave forcing each half away from the other half, and (b) heat.  The two halves would push each other apart until the compression was relieved.  You'd end up with two bulbous hemispherical lobes connected by a kilometres-wide ribbon of rubble and magma, essentially a single giant volcano stretching all the way around the Earth.  Of course, the energy released by such a shockwave would kill all complex life on Earth in a few minutes, so that as the atmosphere was blown into space there wouldn't be any life left to asphyxiate.  Some extremophile life would probably survive deep in the Earth's crust, but that's about it.

Outside that range, the local pressure would be too high for it to split the matter around it. The thing is, that limits reach to just shy of 12 kilometers beneath the surface; in order to have any effect on the core, the bomb would have to affect the earth thousands of kilometers beneath the surface. At most, we might have a slight effect on the mantle, if our bomb was 8,000 times more powerful, but even then, the effect there would be minimal.

However this is nothing compared to the continuous harm that we’re causing by other more gradual activities like plastic production, burning of coal and etc...

@CarFreeSegnitz,The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami released an estimated 26 megatons of energy.  The vast majority of that energy went into moving the crust while a megathrust moved the water.  Had it been a strike-thrust movement there would have been an insignificant tsunami.  The hypothetical Tsar bomb in the Marianna trench would release the vast majority of its energy into the water in a motion very similiar to a megathrust plate movement.  While I agree it will not break the surface of the water it will rapidly raise then lower the water column.  That can't help but produce a very large tsunami.,7년 전,0,

@psyneur9182,"I don't know about stable, and I can't find anything about what kind of mechanism such a large bomb would have to use to function, but I did find that 1,100 kg thermonuclear weapon can produce about 1.2 megatons of power. Assuming mass scales linearly with output power, the bomb would have mass of about 9.2 billion kilograms. That seems pretty infeasible to build currently, especially if most of that mass is the fusion fuel (lithium deuteride).",7년 전,0,

@livedandletdie,"Xiren Seo... the average wave on the ocean is 4.5 meters in height. plus the pressure of 100 atm at the bottom of the trench, and only gets lower by 1 atm for each 111 meters, meaning if the pressure wave reached 1 kilometer it would still have 91 Atm of pressure to fight against, and I don't really care that much but you need a lot more than the original 100 atm of pressure to dislodge 10000m of water above you and the fact that even the rock down there is strong enough to withstand 100 atm of pressure. The rocks around might melt a bit, but they are still under such high pressure that it's ridiculous. To expect that the expansion of the shockwave would do anything to the surface is ridiculous. first of the expansion of 1 km, will just create a huge fucking bubble of water vapor the shockwaves which would let's say have for fun 300 Atm of pressure, well, then after moving through the first layer of water at the shockfront would have lost let's say 90 atm of pressure, okay, now the 210 atm will hit the next layer of 89 atm pressure, going down to 121 atm. then going down to 32 atm, which isn't even enough to budge the next layer. And that is in a tube where the sides have infinite pressure and the shockwave can only pass in a linear fashion...  Now imagine that you add the inverse square law to this, or even rather just calculate the atmospheric pressure applied to the expanding shockwave at the surface of the spherical mess and reduce it's pressure for each millimeter of expansion accordingly in a exponential fashion and you will suddenly find that the bomb has many many atmospheres of pressure released at that split instant which in turn makes it expand roughly 1 kilometer but since it doesn't really have more energy as it's an instantaneous reaction in which all the fuel is instantly vaporized and after 2.4 seconds that there is no more fuel.. as it's vaporized and non reacting. And you will expect to only use 5 to 10% of the fuel at maximum. Because Nuclear bombs are highly inefficient.  And I suck at physics and I know this shit.",7년 전,5,

@xirensixseo,"Guys I'm not saying its going to make a wave. I'm just saying its going to be a large depth charge. I exaggerated the whole ""rise up a kilometer"" part but its quite close, gases are very very *not dense. The 100 times or so pressure compared to atmospheric pressures would push that so far up so fast its literally just a depth charge. And we know they work. They sink ships and hammer submarines. I didn't include real numbers in my comment but this is fact. Arguing with it is saying world war two was a lie because depth charges don't work.  But yes humans even with Tsar bomba under the ocean is muuuuch less than an earthquake and resulting tsunami. I'm not saying the video is wrong I just wanted to include the point that its a very large depth charge.   Also I meant mayyybe 3 meters excluding waves. Maybe. Its weak.

Since it was a fusion bomb, you could theoretically have kept adding fuel, which was not done in the past, because for atmospheric detonations there is an upper efficiency level, after which the detonation energy escapes into space.  If you detonate it in the deep sea, this threshhold does not matter though, so one could build a far bigger bomb to detonate there.",7년 전,0,

@Duijnkiller,"The Tsar bomba could have been 100+ mt, but they wisely decided to limit it to 57mt by replacing the uranium in the third stage with lead. There has been no other bomb detonated (or even assembled) that was larger. In theory you could build teller ulam design H bombs of infinite size with multiple stages.  Hydrogen (technically “fusion”) bombs have no theoretical limit. The current Teller-Ulam design scales up extremely well to ludicrous sizes. or thermonuclear weapons can theoretically be any size and any power at all.  There are many disadvantages to a bigger bomb course... Don't call any theoretically possible Wrong. it's impossible no it's not. It's just very extremely difficult to achieve that kind of power. just like antimatter  Think before you make a comment like that dumbass.",7년 전(수정됨),1,
@BizarreCoyote,"@Duijnkiller Jesus Christ, you're deluded. First of all, nature is still more than willing to kill us all with an even bigger explosion. Go ahead and look up Yellowstone volcano. If that ever erupts (unlikely but possible), life all over the world is FUCKED . No single nuclear weapon will ever match that kind of power. I doubt all of humanity's nuclear arsenal in total could do that. Even the Tsar Bomba was only 1/4th the power of Krakatoa, and making Tsar Bomba full strength would, surprise, still make it only half as strong.  Second of all: I hate assholes like you. ""Lol its classified of course you don't know. I do though, because I've got a special tinfoil hat I wear to keep the CIA from spying on me.""  Then you go and spout some stupid bullshit and claim ""theoretical"" at the end so it doesn't seem like you're a moron.   ""Theoretical"" and ""realistic"" are nowhere CLOSE to the same. ""Theoretically"" a particle could cause a runaway black hole from the LHC, but that hasn't happened and never will happen. ""Theoretically"" the first nuclear weapon could have set fire to the atmosphere and killed us all, but it didn't and never will. Hydrogen bombs may not have a 'theoretical' limit, but they do have a REALISTIC limit.  If there was a nuclear weapon on this planet that could devastate half of a continent, then it would be ludicrously large (The Tsar Bomba was so large it almost couldn't be carried by the TU-95 (Russia's largest bomber, btw), they had to remove the bomb doors to fit it in). As in, 'so large you could see it from orbit' large, and so heavy you couldn't lift it.  ICBM warheads have to be smaller, just a heads up. I'm including MIRV warheads (which are no longer in use because of the several denuclearization programs the US and Russia have agreed to). We don't use ICBMs for our largest nukes, either. We carry them in planes, because ICBMS need to move fast for specific targets, and with a heavier warhead comes a slower speed. A slower speed means a greater chance of being intercepted. That realistic limit coming back to kick you in the ass, isn't it?  Even incoming asteroids didn't have so much power they could literally annihilate half a continent. The worst of them made craters 150-190mi in diameter (and one of them wiped out 75% of life on the planet). You WILDLY overestimate humanity compared to the forces of nature.

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 ""I am YaH; that is my Name!
