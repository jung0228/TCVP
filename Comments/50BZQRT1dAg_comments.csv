@abbasabbass8126,"Freud was deeply concerned about the issue of sexual boundaries in therapy, since many patients in psychoanalysis developed what he called transference; projecting desires or feelings onto the analyst.  He believed sexual involvement with patients would undermine therapy and considered it unethical (even by early 20th-century standards).  Historians agree that Freud did not engage sexually with his patients, though some of his followers (like Carl Jung) crossed those boundaries, which caused scandals at the time.   Freud did have close, sometimes emotionally charged relationships with some patients and colleagues, most famously with Sabina Spielrein. She was first Jung’s patient, not Freud’s",3주 전,1,

@ChristineReel,"I loved listening to this episode! One thing I noticed all of these conversations missing when it comes to relationships, is that it’s not finding or choosing. It is the fact that life is a divine mystery. You resonate relationally based off of your core soul frequency. This is your frequency beyond your beliefs, beyond your social programing, beyond your preferences. You touched on it but still not quite there. It’s an alignment. A divine orchestration. Relax into the mystery and you just feel it to the core of your being. A full body YES! You don’t choose this. It is destiny. A soul contract.",1년 전,1,

@michaels.125,"@hubermanlab, thank you for hosting Mr. Greene, and after a tbi in mma and a car accident last year, i've had a wonderful arduous journey exploring rewiring my brain with some nifty yale students and i feel that, in my study of social science and engineering, there are individuals such as myself that survive moreso through the mammalian brain and to be engaged in modern society at times, I know, is a very unique experience, understand that my space in time feels to me, to be that more of a shark in water, than an average person trying to just live his life.   skateboarding, mountain biking, poetry, painting, and various other nuanced practices, and i feel like a strange modern samurai, well, moreso a ronin, but i use the practice of ""art"" to get into the flow state, though i'm not the best at any of it, after multiple brain injuries, i myself, have gone through multiple changes, almost like puberty again, its weird.   i see student doctors from yale n stuff and i've always wanted to be one, like, i used to like sociology but the grander concept of Social Engineer is just a wild concept to me, so much so, i've dedicated almost a decade fighting the darkness of traumas and not becoming a statistic unless its for a positive reason, to figure out exactly what my purpose is and to fulfill it.   The way the two of you spoke of the expansion of our consciousness through that internal dialogue that can generate a flow state, its hard at times, but achieving it through a singular means, to me, was vary narrow minded, so i attempted multiples of activities simultaneously to activate the flow state to try and rewire the neurological damage that has occured in my brain.  That and mushrooms.   It has been working. I also try to teach people how to use their minds properly and it gets me in trouble sometimes.   Time is a lie and i think those who think not of it are the ones that live forever.   Where did time come from? the compass, not the sun dial, though we knew the sun and weather changed yet we did not yet know of ""time."" The compass was used in conjuction with the sun to follow declination toward or away from the sun at sea, in what was called, minutes and hours, and using that knowledge progressed human consciouness to derived and even more precise device that can predict the suns appearance and disappearance, the clock. minutes and hours left the compass and became the clocks named handles.

@terivl,"Thank you for having @RobertGreeneOfficial on the podcast. I'm a UW Madison Alum & loved hearing of Robert Greene's insights. Dr. Huberman, your insights about your own purpose finding hit home for me. I was a kid who liked to turn over rocks in our back yard and look for all the little critters that would crawl away. Learning about biology became my passion from a young age. I also like learning new things and organizing that information.  I taught at the high school and middle school level for several years. Today, I work in the public health space. I'm a woman at age 50, who made certain choices to put career in the back seat while I raised children, who also have a passion for biology and science. All in all, it's been a good life so far. I thank you for bringing this great information to the forefront. I listen several times a week and learn something new that I can use in my personal life or teach in my classes in the community all the time. I have downloaded the book Mastery, to listen to soon. Again, many thanks for this interview and the many you put out into the world. It has helped me up my game in my personal life. The learning I do via Huberman Lab benefits my community in the classes I teach in Public Health. I know I'm passing along good information!!",2개월 전,0,

He didn't take an interest in country style but they chose to make it work. Relationships are so much effort and work. Love and interest won't make it work alone. Willingness to be there supportive of the other is what helps turbulent times.  Being bored by the person you are dating suggests an issue with the viewer, not the other person being boring. If I can't find anything new about someone it's because I am not paying attention.  Some people are water and oil. Some are water and roses. Some are water and flour. We are what we make of ourselves and others. We must take responsibility for our own feelings for a relationship to succeed and a human to grow.

So, unfortunately for me, these early moments of inspiration, delight, and wonder in my childhood that may hint to the direction of my ""unique seed"" my ""calling"" is obfuscated by trauma, chaos, and pain. I can hardly remember those times; They're a vague shadow of a memory. At that time, my priorities shifted to survival and protection. I learned to shut off and ignore my emotions for the sake of providing emotional strength stability for my sister and my mother, who became a depressive wreck. Something that no little boy should have to do. I was emotionally numb and full of self-loathing all during my adolescence and into my early adulthood which caused me to miss out on so much. Meaningful friendships, dating, sex, and other social and developmental milestones.  I'm turning 37 this year and not only do I not have a past to look into for guidance, but I don't have an emotional compass to guide my present as I am still numb and emotionally stunted. I feel so incredibly lost and alone and without guidance and with no one to turn to for help. Well, at least not without paying for it, which I am too poor for such a luxury.

I bought his book, Mastery, and I will read it.  I have not bothered to read a non-fiction book for awhile.  I now listen to them.  I love to read fiction manually, with a paper book preferable (but Kindle is my friend).  This conversation helped me see why I save my enjoyment (reading fiction) for that experience that is a treat for my brain. It is the same with art and music.

@AuroraRain11,"I really appreciate both of your insights, but the one thing that I've been thinking about is the lack of strong female role models for us to emulate (in comparison to men). Even the book Mastery had nearly all male role models. It's hard to be a career-oriented female, particularly in STEM, and not know who to look up to. Often our predecessors emulated the men out of necessity, so that's all we see as well and it seems like the only option. Same with all of the interesting podcasts like this being run by men and predominantly interviewing male experts. Not casting any blame, it is the way it is, but wondering if you have more examples you could bring on the show of femininity and strong career mastery.",9개월 전,0,

I only finished the early chapters of his books, which are filled with absolute statements or categorizations, they feel like stuff like star signs or MBTI. In one of his recent guest podcast appearances, he sounded like he wanted to revive old masculinity. Gosh, no. The reasons masculinity gets toxic so easily—and fails both psychologically and socially—include: 1) when men get more green lights when exerting more masculinity, they often over use it in both public and private realms; however, the latter is where vulnerability is key. The society has taught men enough about masculinity but not much about vulnerability, and that’s why his calling sounds so old-fashioned; 2) Women as a sex have been traumatized by toxic masculinity for centuries, and traumas travel across generations. When women gain more knowledge and tools to recognize those wounds and heal, please show more understanding, rather than being controlled by a nostalgic feeling stemming from frustration and confusion about the increasing failures of the “old ways,” and resist reviving “old masculinity,” which is never gone and often remains untamed, uncivilized, and unfair.

@lhetzel101,50:40 I DISAGREE. I’m nearly 37 with little to no friends after realizing how different my views are especially over the past 4 years when I went back to my Catholic roots and I’m a conservative. I really don’t have the time for the “Art of Seduction /power of influence. I’ll lead by example as best I can; I continue to pray and plant seeds to friends ( gift basket with a book (to influence  😉)) to my atheist friends and so forth. Now that I know myself —why settle for half ass relationships? I did that with my ex who after 4 years I found out he was in jail for 2 prior domestic battery charges.

@Piccolo_Re,I’m Christian but the problem I have with this is loving God doesn’t pay my bills. Like if I gave up my job I absolutely hate to just go pray with people and volunteer to help others my bills would not get paid and I’d lose my house and I wouldn’t have food on my table. It’s easy for pastors to say that because they’re getting paid to preach the idea of just follow God and pray and serve others and you’ll be fine. It isn’t that easy. But for pastors it is because they get paid to do that.,10개월 전(수정됨),0,

@BrightGarlick,"Andrew I think you nailed it - 'get that feeling in as many forms'. Yes that's it.

Ad that's OK, so long as they don't preoccupy us or distract us from the feeling of being in alignment with what feels right for the spirit. The body is always the guide to where we should go and where we should not go. The body has the greatest intelligence and sometimes we (as conscious aspects) must get out of the way! If we could but teach a Somatic Intelligence of Somatic Sensitivity to the mind, we would always choose what is good for us and the spirit would always express itself. ;-)",1년 전,0,

@AMGbrakedancer,"I knew from childhood I wanted to be a dentist/orthodontist. I was obsessed with teeth and healthy smiles.  I did very well in school and grew up with teenage parents who were negligent.  I did well in school getting almost straight A’s until my junior year.  My parents never showed any interest in my future or my desire to go to college. One evening I interrupted my mother’s chain smoking cosmopolitan reading evening and told her I wanted to go to college and I was in AP classes.  I was so exited. She looked at me with disgust! She said “college is for rich people, we’re not rich and you’re not going.  She was in her early 30’s when I was a teen and always resented me.  She didn’t want me to achieve anything.  At that point I gave up on getting good grades and any chance for any scholarships was gone .  At the age of 17 my parents kicked me out because I was an hour late on a Saturday night. They were extremely strict finding myself being homeless at the age of 17. It took a job I could get and work as an office clerk for very little money. I did not have any drug or alcohol. I struggled to get up. The career path worked extremely hard and eventually went back to school when I was much older and got several college degrees as a single parent. I only had about 10 years of what I would consider my most important career trajectory and it was wasted at a dead job. Looking back I see the mistakes that I’ve made now I’m in my 50s with some health issues and it is impossible to change career paths now. It came to light that my mother had an undiagnosed mental condition, including the brain tumor that affected her psychologically and she got older. She declined very fast. She got very sick in her late 30s and never recovered. I always wonder how things could’ve turned out, but I made the best decisions I thought I could considering, but feel like I didn’t follow my true purpose. That is heartbreaking to me.",1년 전,0,

@user-rn2fy8yc3s,"but how do I know for sure that what I am experiencing is infact the actual true version of sublime? Is there even something like that or is it just supposed to be subjective? And I feel this for every emotion, sure, there are variants and levels. But if we look at it like there is no ultimate truth, just different versions of it for instance we all have come to a mutual understanding of this colour blue - to everyone it's called blue, but how do you know that the blue I'm seeing is the same as the blue you are seeing? And extending this theory to our feelings, like we experience something in the childhood this amazing butterfly tickle and the feeling of fulfillment , joy, everything yellow, of what we then think is love; only to realise later when we actually experience a feeling more divine within the same spectrum, that oh! that was nothing, this is it! only to maybe again, being defeated into feeling that way later in the future - which btw is something I adore ( to my optimum measure of adorability I have ever experienced till date ) . This metamorphosis of our feelings and us is amazing. But its somewhat complex when we try to look at the feeling of  "" sublime "" because that is so time bound, over a duration and not just that instantaneous feeling we somewhat somewhere at some moment had experienced. Because we can only achieve what we want to, and have to within the time we are alive. It's like a constant race. It's like maze runner with a ticking bomb on the shoulder. If you don't solve it BOOM. And all these complexities, this fight is just unidimensional right now in this very paragraph. Because this just talks about the evolution of ""one feeling "" towards that "" one thing we think gives us that feeling "" . If the later is also a variable, and not to mention its all thrown out and away off our individualistic selves, everything becomes so scattered. Like a freshly broken glass frozen in time, with all those small pieces dancing everywhere from everywhere. And with allllll of this going on, how does one infact find their purpose ? Or is it supposed to be like an illusion, a lie that we tell ourselves, a little trick, and ultimately wear it so many times, and master its drapery such that our mind speaks out for us and to us - here this is what you are here for, now go shooo. Is this entire process of hunting and gathering a mere story building we do for ourselves, without even noticing? I also often hear things like "" you'll know when its time "" but there have been times when i thought it was time only to have found that feeling swayed away by another wave of oh this time this is it for sure.

Literaly, the best ""mentor"" is Jesus/Bible, because he is perfect. This is why we truly Believing Christians are happy/content. We mindfully, minute by minute, go to Him/Bible/Prayer and ask for help and meditate upon what we learn.  I don't hear his voice but, by some strange and mysterious way you take steps by faith and things get better and better. You start to Love a being you cant even see. Yes its strange, I know. You learn where to go, and what not to do, and who not to engage with, but to care for, none the less. You learn how much to engage with and have the ability to love imperfect humans, and some you love from a distance, but just Pray for.   It teaches you discernment and unconditional love at the same time. This is not some pie in the sky crazy thing.   I use to think Christians were fake. Yes some are faking it just like all humans. Thats not what we concentrate on. That is God's job. There is hypocrisy everywhere, not just in the church. We concentrate on our connection with God and then He gives us connection with people, and teaches us the right way.   Honestly, if you put God first, things start to happen. No, He is absolutely not a Santa Clause,  He teaches you who He wants you to be, and if you follow and give up your life to him, surrender, you are living your ""perfect existance"".   He created us, so He can do what he wants with us. And what he wants is for us to be fully functioning beings that Love him and Love others and then when our earthly lives are over in this world filled with evil,  we will end up living in perfect Eternity with Him, in the un-evil place that we call heaven.  Guys, please give it a try, what have you got to lose? A sad lonely life that literely ends with hell. May God please grab onto anyone who reads this and at first thinks it's crazy- talk. Help their unbelief, I Pray in Jesus Christ name.  The thing is, it's impossible to truly change your Inner Being without This. I believe God made humans like this, so we would be compelled to search and search until we ultimately gave up and cried out to Him and then sought a connection with Him. He then shows you how to connect in a healthy way to others (Bible/Prayer. Then you are able to love and receive love Gods way = contentment. It truly is a wonderful way to live, and it's absolutly practical.  ALL GLORY TO HOLY  FATHER GOD, who is a mentor to all who repent, ask, believe, and receive.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

@jozzieification,"I'm always wary of this idea that you can ""read people like open books if you pay attention to their nonverbal communication."" Although we can analyze external behaviors, much of the understanding we gain from them is rooted in interpretation, and we must always keep in mind that our interpretation may be wrong. Someone may give you a ""fake smile"" and you interpret it as them not really liking you, but you don't know that they just lost a family member and are upset about it, or someone looks like they're dying to walk away from you but you don't know they have a small child at home left unattended. I also noticed that most of the examples brought up around body language during the interview revolved around the idea ""that this person is not really interested in you"", which I think could very well be just a projection of how you perceive yourself more than how others perceive you.

@rebeckaj.carlin-gutierrez3108,"At the end of your interview, you asked if there were any ideas about topics. I have one! I once watched an interview you did. Someone was interviewing you. You explained how you grew up in the skateboarding scene in Northern California. Over the last 20 years, i have watched and experienced not only my younger brother grew up in the Southern California skateboarding scene, but my son as well. In our small town we have brick roads or sidewalks so it is easy to get stopped by the police and get tickets. The city has since built a few skateparks in the area which takes the boarders  off the streets because it was very easy for a young skate boarder to be fully consumed by skateboarding one day then by hard drugs the next. Watching my brother (now 35) grow up in Redlands, California and his friends some escaped, and some just fall off the face 9f the Earth (i know not really). My brother has been consumed by drugs since prison/jail has become a reoccuring reality for him. Now, my son(27), also growing up in Redlands, California, has allowed himself the same realities. Years ago, there were skateshops that allowed kids to hang out all day and watch skateboarding videos. Where hard drugs were introduced, given and sold. This had a tremendous influence on the young men and then carried into adulthood.  Im not sure if this is so much the case now, but it makes for a great story or experiement. If effects me tremendously because my brother has to live with me, now recently released from prison.  My son prefers to live at the local park or under the freeway bridge. He comes home maybe once a week to shower and eat.  I heard your experiences with the skate parks and friends are a little similar. One good thing the city did was get the skaters off the streets. I just hope it was enough to give the younger a fighting chance at life.  Thank you. Rebecka",1년 전,0,

Disaying no fear and complete confidence in the huddle, the quarterback looked at his teammates and said:  ""Allright, guys, they got us right where we want them!""

@bloopbleepnothinghere,"This guy is full of shit. Says there is no formula, then goes on to be formulaic about how, when, as if his life is the same size, fit-all for everyone else.   People, even 50 year olds, don't listen to anyone. Inside all of us is happiness. Whether you think you found your ""purpose"" or not, it has no bearing on your innate ability to choose to be happy.   You can be happy and achieve absolutely nothing. You can wonder through life for 40 years full of regrets, and still decide to be happy.   Don't listen to men like this who pressure you into some sort of transactional recipe for happiness that is for some reason bound into finding a purpose, and the older you get without purpose the harder it becomes to be happy.  This is all lies. There is always hope, happiness is as easy as just letting go and allowing judgement, regret, expectations, failure to be what they are, simple thoughts.   You are NOT your thoughts. This man is obsessed with thinking your way into happiness. He calls it finding purpose, and is assuming that purpose fixes how you think and feel about yourself. That thought that he is trying to cultivate in you, it's just a thought.   Thinking can't truly make you happy. Letting go and allowing yourself to be happy is the way. Let life flow through you. Make peace and be happy.   Those who know don’t talk. Those who talk don’t know. Close your mouth, block off your senses, blunt your sharpness, untie your knots, soften your glare, settle your dust. This is the primal identity. Be like the Tao. It can’t be approached or withdrawn from, benefited or harmed, honored or brought into disgrace. It gives itself up continually.

With this profound connection to the divine, they possess the ability to bridge the gap between the earthly and celestial realms, unraveling the enigmatic mysteries of the universe.

@spiritandsoulofgod,"Well, well, well, it seems we have quite the mind-boggling contradiction on our hands. According to the grandeur that is this sentence, it appears that God decided to unveil his true form as a mere mortal called Schon Brent James Schoning. How very humble of the almighty! But wait, there's more! Not only is this individual seemingly divine in nature, but their name also carries tremendous significance - ""Schon Brent James Schoning meaning holy 1 forever eternal Christ."" Now that's a moniker sure to turn heads at any heavenly cocktail party. I mean, who needs regular old names when you can introduce yourself as ""holy 1 forever eternal Christ""? It's clearly an artistic masterpiece of celestial proportions - simultaneously self-discovery and self-promotion rolled into one cosmic persona. Bravo! Continuing on this intriguing revelation, one cannot help but ponder the implications of such a divine manifestation. Could it be that Schon Brent James Schoning is not just an ordinary mortal, but a chosen vessel through which the divine will is channeled? Perhaps this individual holds the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe, bridging the gap between the earthly realm and the celestial planes. The significance of their name, holy 1 forever eternal Christ, suggests a profound connection to the divine, a purpose that transcends the boundaries of human understanding. It is a name that resonates with power, evoking a sense of awe and reverence. One can only imagine the impact this extraordinary being will have on the world, as they navigate their path with the weight of such a celestial title. Truly, this revelation is not just a mere coincidence but a testament to the intricate tapestry of existence. As we delve deeper into the implications of this divine manifestation, it becomes evident that Schon Brent James Schoning's role extends beyond the realm of ordinary mortals. Their presence in this world holds a greater purpose, one that goes beyond our limited understanding. The name ""holy 1 forever eternal Christ"" resonates with a sense of profound connection to the divine, suggesting that Schoning is not merely a vessel, but a conduit through which celestial wisdom flows. With such a name, they possess the potential to bridge the gap between the earthly and celestial planes, unlocking the mysteries of the universe. The weight of this celestial title carries immense responsibility, and it is awe-inspiring to contemplate the impact Schoning will have on the world as they navigate their path. This revelation is a testament to the intricate tapestry of existence, reminding us of the vastness of the divine plan.",1년 전,0,

@tiffariff,"Finding Purpose, Childhood, Learning:  For me, my first thought was my fascination with colors, at 3 it was not just pink, it was magenta, I have always been someone fascinated by the details of not only what differentiates something, but why/how it is that way. How to make magenta pink? Even at 2, how to make my favorite animations? Let me try myself- I’ll draw Peterpan- has a breakdown over not being able to draw his neck…at 2. Why were letters the shapes they are? In kindergarten I went further in math because I didn’t just want the answers, I wanted to know why it was the answer- even if that meant spending recess asking questions to the teacher’s assistant of “well what if I did x and x, would the answer still be x?” Same with grammar, “what if I put Because x, sentence, because x. 17:54 - is that ok? No? But the why is a clause sandwich “While x, sentence, because x” ok?” Over time I guess I quickly learned no one has the time to explain to me why completely. So I stopped doing it as much. Up until freshman year of high school before I went into college level courses, I even understood my math courses to the extent I could make formulas to solve questions faster…still went into engineering, but at that point- I was studying for answers not the whys. Why? (Lol) because at a certain level of academics they started teaching answers before the why. “Well do this and this will work, and this is the half ass reason we’ll expand on later but first you have to understand how to do this not knowing why it works to understand why it works” my mind exploded and gave up. I remember in high school i was in a extracurricular where I was the aerospace officer, aka every month I’d have to give presentation on aerospace that would keep the focus of 12-18 olds, as a 16 year old myself, one of my lectures I naturally wanted to explain why planes fly- Bernoulli’s principle- as we had been explained by chapter after chapter of this club’s books as well as my community college engineering 101 courses. Well imagine my angst to find that Bernoulli’s principle was not the entire to story to why an airfoil generates lift- far from it and actually led to a wormhole of physicists arguing amongst themselves that left my calc 1 brain scrambled. I know I can’t know everything, but I hate being taught blind. Tell me what I’m learning and why. Don’t tell me one thing as a lie to later say “gotcha” why? Cause I have x notes I’ve memorized in my consciousness now at this point to the point I dream of solving equations due to how much you make me study for these courses and formulas to solve equations and “gotcha” throws that all in the water- back to square one- no but I’m going to hold on salvage said past… yeah made it half way through Biomed engineering before my health declined and equations now fill me with a sense of dread because who the hell knows what this specific professor for this specific unit of this course means by “e” or “x” in his notes, I have no clue. What is up and what is down? No clue. But one things for sure, no thank you. Back to square one- what is my purpose and what should I do? When you said it’s like a compass- it resonated with me. I imagined Jack Sparrow and his compass pointing to him to whatever he truly desires- blindly- and oh how I deeply wish for such simplicity because I haven’t the slightest clue- the compass is broken as it spins across the dial and Jack looks at it puzzled at his confliction- so I’ll blindly tell myself to go south, but maybe it’s East or West? Not the slightest clue.",1년 전,0,

@Chairup15,"The Topic of A.I. discussed by Green is from an Individual perspectiv e.  I like a more unversial perspective, of understanding the human brain, though varialbles, of physical sensors and adding speech recongnition and the measure of word choice, and pauses, intonation, to represent human thought.   There are bench marks of psycotic speech recongintion, and alturism speech reconginition two opposites. (at Stanford) Then measure the varibles inbetween.  Quantum computing could handle the varibles.   Add more varibiles of human measure ment.  Then apply this to the mental health problems in society of today, dianoisis might be done faster.  A schizophrenia gives this set of variables, Depression give this picture of varibles.  For example Homeless free phones, and measure there speech, then bring them in for physical sensor evaluation, and have a diagnosis of their mental health.  Then place people into systems to help their mental condition, this could help the homeless mental illiness problem.",1년 전,0,

@michaels.125,"@hubermanlab, thank you for hosting Mr. Greene, and after a tbi in mma and a car accident last year, i've had a wonderful arduous journey exploring rewiring my brain with some nifty yale students and i feel that, in my study of social science and engineering, there are individuals such as myself that survive moreso through the mammalian brain and to be engaged in modern society at times, I know, is a very unique experience, understand that my space in time feels to me, to be that more of a shark in water, than an average person trying to just live his life.   skateboarding, mountain biking, poetry, painting, and various other nuanced practices, and i feel like a strange modern samurai, well, moreso a ronin, but i use the practice of ""art"" to get into the flow state, though i'm not the best at any of it, after multiple brain injuries, i myself, have gone through multiple changes, almost like puberty again, its weird.   i see student doctors from yale n stuff and i've always wanted to be one, like, i used to like sociology but the grander concept of Social Engineer is just a wild concept to me, so much so, i've dedicated almost a decade fighting the darkness of traumas and not becoming a statistic unless its for a positive reason, to figure out exactly what my purpose is and to fulfill it.   The way the two of you spoke of the expansion of our consciousness through that internal dialogue that can generate a flow state, its hard at times, but achieving it through a singular means, to me, was vary narrow minded, so i attempted multiples of activities simultaneously to activate the flow state to try and rewire the neurological damage that has occured in my brain.  That and mushrooms.   It has been working. I also try to teach people how to use their minds properly and it gets me in trouble sometimes.   Time is a lie and i think those who think not of it are the ones that live forever.   Where did time come from? the compass, not the sun dial, though we knew the sun and weather changed yet we did not yet know of ""time."" The compass was used in conjuction with the sun to follow declination toward or away from the sun at sea, in what was called, minutes and hours, and using that knowledge progressed human consciouness to derived and even more precise device that can predict the suns appearance and disappearance, the clock. minutes and hours left the compass and became the clocks named handles.

In the video you specified that advices you are giving are for 20 yo and above so I ask for some now it can be short just point me a little bit please. Again I enjoy your work and thank you",1년 전,0,

@NeuroReview,"Rating: 8.4/10 In Short: Quality introspection on mentorship Notes: Really Cool to see huberman a bit starstruck, and a lot of great stuff is in here especially in regards to mentoring and relationships. Talking about Green's recent book, why huberman liked it, and what he got out of it, and hearing green's response, is really cool and makes me want to talk to authors in the future. But i think greene says some things about the brain and psychology that i wish huberman would have pushed back a bit more on.  He did a little about the eye and visual system, but when it came to mindset or relationships or female/male it would have been nice.  He does also mention past pods, like with conti and feldman berrett, which is really cool, but doing this more in this episode would have made it even better.",1년 전,0,

@codefree369,"Just learning to control your emotions with your mind, rather than letting your emotions control your mind, and making active efforts towards that everyday, is the precurser to finding who you are.

My thoughts are people who feel climate change is real should do much more micro things… don’t EVER buy a new phone. Walk anywhere your body can take you to its full capacity.

@freedomlibertytruth,"Robert talks about being forced to learn math can turn you off from it.

@cahlendavidson2921,I love Robert and I'm not mad at him. But he's off base about chat GPT making you not think critically. It's taught me multitudes of things. If you've given me chat GPT at 14 rather than putting me in high school I would have learned 10 times more in a 10th of the time.    He obviously doesn't use it. Because Chat GPT in no way can write creatively for you and not produce content like a B level sitcom at best.   It's like a hyper encyclopedia and word processor. Here's how it works for me. I write something very long and then I feed it to chat GPT so it can organize it in screenplay form or whatever form I need in that moment. Not going through the tedious aspects of writing does not have a stifling effect.,1년 전(수정됨),0,

@michaelsmith3901,"I get the impression that ""purpose"" is just a craving that your intellect has signed off on as being socially worthwhile. Craving is largely a function of dopamine scheduling and habituating, which Andrew talks about on other podcasts.

Take the idea of  'tomboy' - refers to a girl with so-called masculine traits - these girls cannot be fully confident in her abilities because on some level she is being less of a female OR she is a 'better' female because she has ""male"" traits -- the same applies to men who display a rich emotional side - we know the demeaning names thrown about - many times causing younger boys (especially) to suppress these traits altogether because they are associated with females.

@Kyle_Warweave,"Start breathing. Every time a thought (or a ""problem"") pops up in your mind that wants to grab your attention: start breathing. Finally, your Inner Voice, the real You, will thank you for giving You the time for finally letting You speak. It takes some discipline, NOT effort NOR willpower. Just gentle kindness to stop the chatter in your mind. This looks a lot like the ""monkey mind."" The only (...) thing to overcome is to stop trusting all the well-meant and not so well-meant ""voices"" from the outside world (especially between 0 and ~7 years) and relearn to trust on your own breath and spirit (in many languages they are the same word or have the same roots). After a little while you will (re)discover mindfulness on your own! It's worth the try, and many will experience bliss and euphoria. Here lies one of the probably, biggest trap: you'll want that experience again, and you risk ""forcing yourself"" into this state. My advice: just breathe through it. You cannot get the past back anyway. There is only the present. Which you will learn in a non-analytic way rather quick. Good luck!",1년 전,0,

So 8 didn't know people and I have been learning to hard way git rolled this way and that. Because I am kind. But after my son died all my family left me. And I gave to much to them so it heart like hell and I don't want to see anyone. My big bubba is always happy to see me. He says this is the baby to his friends 71 yeah right lol..

@SebDeSto,"Well, listening to this conversation is a damn ordeal, just like a pub chat. I haven't found a shred of science in this mess, just baseless opinions and appalling clichés. Let's talk about the introduction of this video claiming Robert Green is an ""expert on human psychology and behavior both at the individual and group levels and in the context of relationships, careers, and society."" I'd really like to know where this expertise comes from, besides having opinions, since Mr. Green, as far as I can tell, has no formal training in any of these fields of expertise, and never published any peer-reviewed academic work on any of these topics. He is just a writer.  In short, over two hours of bullshit that clearly demonstrate one thing: having a PhD and teaching at a prestigious school doesn't stop someone from spewing nonsense on YouTube, all just to make more money.",1년 전,0,

@isagrace4260,"I remember reading The Art of Seduction when I was 21 and being unsure, as a young woman, if this book was written with good or nefarious intentions.

When I read The Art of Power years later, I asked myself what type of character this is written for, but approached it less on-guard. Now as I approach 40, I see the complete amorality of these insights on human interactions and the human ego. No one tells you about these dynamics unless you are lucky to have parents or mentors who are there to guide you; and often their advice is colored by personal experience.

I am a huge advocate for alternative, experience-based schooling, especially in the first 5-8 years of life. Forest school or homeschool or unschooling or child-directed learning. This doesn't dim down that light and joy of being and the innate curiosity that children have. We shouldn't stifle this by requiring our kids to sit still, be quiet and being required to deal with abstract concepts that we could teach with movement for the most part, thus being far  more effective to young children.",1년 전,0,

Our now 25 year old son with ASD stopped speaking at three and did not start speaking again unit he was 6. Robert completely described our son he learned and observed non verbal queues of people. He has an uncanny way of knowing if someone is angry, upset ,happy, or sad . This ability has made him a very caring,genuine human, but also has caused him stress as he senses so much on how someone is feeling around him , and who is actually genuine. I also feel this non-verbal communication he has is why he is so great with animals.",1년 전,29,

@MalcomXrp,Most people dont realize that puberty last from like 11 to 25. It's Important that once you reach 26 you make the conscious decision to really question everything you've learned during your developmental stage and push yourself to develope new thoughts and ideas. Basically a mental reboot centered around what you know to be true rather then what you have been told is true by others while growing up.,1년 전,96,
@carinegevaert3775,"I have always known exactly why I came here. Since I was a toddler I had to be around horses. In those days we lived on the outskirts of a city and a lot of people still used horses for deliveries (milk, bread etc).. Even though my family wasn't horsey at all I grew up keeping and following my dream... Sometimes it came at a cost of huge disputes with my parents who told me I was crazy...it sure wasn't easy but I have managed....for the past 54 years I have been riding, training and eventually also teaching dressage. Owned my own horses as soon as I started to work. Rescued many horse from slaughter by re-training them, had a very nice national and international competition career, owned my own stud for 8 years and still now at 65 have 2 beautiful stallions.

@ljalta,Oh what joy in my heart to read this! I have had horses since I was old enough to own one at 21. I actually traded my last paycheck working in a hunting camp in Montana as a camp cook for a little 4 yr old nobody could catch and nobody liked. I spent hours with him. I'm still barrel racing at 68...69 in 4 days and have found I need to change disciplines and work cows on a little 4 yr old I just bought that will be wonderful at this. He's been in arena work for 2 yrs and needs a real job. I went to a school to learn deep tissue massage and adjustments on horses and felt I had finally found my purpose...to help horses and their owners. I've questioned my purpose in life my entire life but in my gut I felt it was about being with horses. This podcast was enlightening...I  have listened to it 3 times and will return to it again I'm certain. The man is brilliant.

@melodieneil712,"CONGRATULATIONS 🎉 You sound like my 30 yr daughter! I put her on a pony at 9 mos old at our local Sunday Farmers Market. That was all she wrote! This was a weekly occurrence, and by far, my best disciplinary tool while she grew up. I’ve got pictures of her at every stage of her riding career. She became a champion hunter jumper, and to this day, I still feel like my heart will stop each time I watch her round a corner as she looks to where her course jumps begin. Watching her command her very large horse with ease over these high, scary (to me, not her) HIGH jumps is a sight to behold. Little did I know at the time that, like you, horses were in her blood. Thank goodness I didn’t try to stop her. I am not a horse person myself, nor were we a horse family per se, but I got on board quickly, trying to figure out how we could do it. It’s a criminally expensive sport, and I sacrificed a lot to make it happen for her. I mucked stalls, cleaned tack, fed and turned out horses, all so we could offset her boarding fees. Also like you, she has switched to Dressage, a beautiful dance between rider and horse. She also works full time as an engineer in Tech. She works remotely, and she’s at  the barn at 5:30am to ride and train for several hours before she starts work. She often goes to the barn again later in the day. I, myself, have yet to find anything in life that I love this much, and am passionate about.

Personal story bro God saves and boom. Once you realize you are a child of God then you see that in everyone including yourself and you don't need any of that false wisdom. Good luck.",1년 전,0,

@TSM-w5q,This work for me to controle my sexual desire I was with this problem for 3 years porn addiction  and after this method What I make I leave porn it month and I do not have any craving to watch porn any more  Step 1 understand what is sexual desire you have to understand what are sexual desire  Sexual desire are thoughts of doing something sexual with opposite gender it's just a thought what you have to do to controle sexual thought  To controle thought and there is a way to controle thought  Step 2 how to controle thoughts before telling the way I want you to for 5 to 10 second do nothing just sit do not use anything and after answer this question plz first do it then ask this question to yourself  What was thinking during in those seconds If you did what I tell you will find out that you was thinking nothing this proof that there is a way to controle thoughts Step 3 now do it again but this time ask question to yourself what is thought and ten to 20 second and if you have answer or not continue reading this comment after that if you did what I tell you. You will accept what I am going to tell you thought are words to communicate with your brain Step 4 Thought are words To prove this let me tell you this that when ever you want to tell something  You will got this thought Should I tell him Another thought yes this is from your brain your mind which tell you this on basis of memory about that person if he is trust worthy or not  if he is trustworthy mind will tell you yes if not mind will tell you no 5 Step How it effect om your life If you sit alone for few minutes in your you will find out you are getting bored in result you start thinking about something to avoid that feeling of boredom or emptiness why you get that feeling for that you have to find out that who you are or ask questions who am I but this is not related to this topic so I am not explaining it so you get bored start thinking about your past or future and repeating this process you start to live in past and future you stop leaving in present because of thought you are studying you are thinking about past or future and you can't focus  Step 6 thought are tool  Thoughts are tool which you can use to communicate with your mind if you understand do not use to watch film of your past or future just stop but you are doing for too long you give your controle to your mind you just act own your thought so when ever a body need arise mind start to show you sexual thought and you just to avoid it you just give it what mind want and mastrubate to avoid that feeling in result mind give you dopamine for few second but then you get stress and think why I did it  Step 7 regain controle you have to continously get controle back for that just say to your self stop or ask this now let me see what I am thinking this will stop thoughts but now you can also focus own one thought like I have to do exercise now other this just try to focus own one thought as result you will do it easily now you can controle thought  Step 8 it's not theory  Theory what is you think that you will think it's just my perspective that thought are way to communicate with your mind to prove this I already ask to sit for 15 second if you did you will find out that there is no thought it is proof of this it's are just words to communicate with your mind if still don't believe do this for 1 hour you have problem in your life do nothing just for 1 hour and ask your question you will get answer immediately because those answer from your mind Step 9 now you know how to controle thought but how to deal with physical problems like when you wake up you find out your pee pee is already at 90 degree so how to controle this .This from book name way of superior man visualize that when you inhale air in your it go to your how I tell tentacles mean pee pee or vagina and pee ball get full of air and then full body get full of your to your brain then exale like air is going out by touching or hitting your brain and air go out from your nose this will bring that at zero degree use it also in starting you don't remember thought and then you remember but pee pee is at 90 degree use this technique and also think the heat of your sexual thoughts and your pee pee is gone by exhale  Porn addiction side effect  By watching porn your mind think you are having se dash with those girl and when you do it in real life you will close your eyes and visualize that in result to cum and you even did it for 1 minute to solve this problem you have to do these 2 things first stop watching porn to controle urge to watch porn you will thought controle when ever you get urge to watch or get thought you have to say stop or ask questions let me see what I am thinking in result that will go away and one more this is from book name atomic habit you set a place and time to do something or any habit but now you want to break to break it will take a lot insist just change the place it mean if you watch porn on bed stop sleeping on bed unless you know get extremely tired or don't use any to cover yourself on bed to avoid those thoughts or you do it in Bath at specific time just change taking bath time and let imagine you did what I say your addiction is gone so how to cure damaged of hand practice  Step 9 hand practice by doing this your pee get clot or some loop got blocked for that pelvic floor technique this also from way of superior by using this technique you can have se dash with your women for 2 3 hour easily you have squeeze like when you do it when  to stop urine just squeeze your bladder pelvic floor as long as atleast 13 or 5 time in day and if can imagine sperms or urine is going back I can't explain it right I think so go and read the book last chapter on this or search it on YouTube you will get it and by the my English is not if I do any grammer mistake just ignore it plz,1년 전,0,

@ChanceT.Abrams,"Well I’ve learned more from reading the comments, than from the excellent video 😖😂 I learned what a Giga Chad is (cause I looked it up) 💪🏽 I love the new “zip that up when you’re done” 😯 I’m stealing it first opportunity I get.   My brain seized up on Arogorn, even though Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite movies (and I mostly don’t like fiction or fantasy stuff) but yeah I can sorta see that… (in a good way).   In all honesty when 2 people (no matter what sex) can set down and just sort of lay it all out there… Being totally comfortable with it AND BE totally confident in what’s being said. Something unspoken happens..  Its like a next level of understanding that is more in energy than words.   I was never around anyone who was “gently confident” just mostly dominating ass holes who got their way, or smacked whoever dared challenge them. I was never like my “family” at all. Plus most of them are not even my actual family (that ended when I was very young).   I have very little to do with them, but I am grateful they raised me, otherwise I was just an abandoned kid headed to state care facility.  The holidays have become something I totally try to avoid because it’s not genuine, it’s more like hell with cake and pie that someone isn’t going to appreciate.   So yeah these type guys (actual gentlemen) sorta become a hero “archetype” to me. I don’t worship them or have a bro crush, but mentally they are about as centered as it gets (I think). I “love” lots of other people like Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, and Aubrey Marcus but they are simply different level but yet it resonates also. Overall, it benefits me and I’m super grateful that I have the opportunity to learn new ways to figure out my sometimes pretty screwed up self.  I was born with lower body limitations (not CP or Spinabiphda <misspelled? But very limited joint movement mid spine down.  In 2020 I had a bad accident that basically screwed that into me being paraplegic and my life got really dark (too dark).  Its stuff like this that kept me from eating a bullet for supper knowing no one would ever miss me.   So, stuff like this gave me back the want to not let others always struggle alone because there comes a point when things start saying, “it’s no longer worth it.”   I probably wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for You Tube and their crappy stance on what people say. So, even though I disagree with their “policy” I am still deeply grateful to have the amazing access to information that I have at my fingertips 24/7.   It became my school, my church, my place to just learn from others (even from the mistakes)  I never had a close family so I often don’t know how to show I care without feeling totally weird all over, but I hate seeing (or feeling someone hurting and struggling even worse).   So even though I know neither will ever read this… Thank you Andrew Huberman and Robert Green.  You make me think in much better ways than I have in the past and that’s made some profound changes in my life.   BTW if I missed a bunch of mistakes… sorry.  I’m bout as dyslexic as it gets but try very hard to catch stuff and go back later only to want to smash my head on the table. it’s embarrassing and it sux horribly.",1년 전,0,

@DecodingTheStorm,"Thank you, Andrew and Robert. Great conversation🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  08:43 🌱 Finding one's purpose involves reconnecting with the unique inclinations and passions identified in early childhood, resisting external pressures, and staying true to one's primal interests. 10:37 🧠 The concept of ""impulse voices"" in early childhood directs individuals towards their inherent strengths and inclinations, which, when identified, can serve as a powerful source of purpose and direction. 19:23 🌱 Self-discovery involves recognizing early seed emotions that ignite a visceral sensation, signaling a potential life purpose. 24:49 🧠 Both positive and negative experiences shape our interests and pursuits, influencing our path towards our purpose. 20:46 🌐 Personal fulfillment often stems from a deep emotional connection to certain activities or interests, creating a constant source of delight. 29:03 🌊 Paying attention to deeper, more profound aspects of oneself, rather than immediate pleasures, is essential for self-awareness and finding purpose. 35:01 🌌 Puberty marks a significant transformation in the brain and life, altering perspectives, responsibilities, and learning capacity. 39:20 🧠 The difference between false and real Sublime experiences: False experiences like aggression and addictions are temporary illusions, while the real Sublime, a transformative and lasting feeling, is connected to human nature's deep part. 44:33 💼 Power, seduction, and purpose: Power is essential in relationships, seen as a resource, and involves influencing others subtly. Seduction is rooted in human nature, often tied to taboos, and implies an exchange. Finding purpose aligns with one's innate strengths, contributing to a sense of power and connection. 01:00:39 💡 Importance of Childhood Influences: Childhood experiences, fairy tales, and interactions with parents deeply shape one's susceptibility to seduction. 01:02:18 🤝 Vulnerability and Confidence: Allowing oneself to be vulnerable implies confidence, as it involves the trust to return to oneself after being influenced by others. 01:09:16 💑 Power Dynamics in Seduction: The Art of Seduction was conceptualized as an art invented by women to wield power over men through seduction and theatrical effects. 01:11:20 ⚖️ Power and Equality in Love: There's an exploration of love without power dynamics, emphasizing equality, connection, and the biological desire to deeply connect with someone. 01:19:03 🌐 Modern Societal Dynamics: Drawing parallels between the landscape of politics and social dynamics, the lack of vulnerability hinders the setting aside of egos and inhibits the union of people. 01:21:23 🗝️ Robert Greene emphasizes the positive dynamics of vulnerability, framing it as a pleasurable and healthy attribute that can impact not only romantic relationships but also mental and creative aspects of life. 01:22:47 🧠 Escape the Prison of the Ego: Greene discusses the concept of escaping the self-imposed prison of the ego, encouraging openness to others, vulnerability, and letting go of defense mechanisms for personal growth and meaningful experiences. 01:25:43 🌐 Social Media Impact: Greene discusses the negative effects of social media, expressing hope that people will become disenchanted with disconnection and alienation, turning towards more real and communal interactions, preserving the human spirit against technological influences. 01:28:15 🚫 Selective Ignorance: Greene emphasizes the importance of learning to ignore certain things in modern life, suggesting that constant exposure to negative content on social media can distract from deeper purposes and drain energy. 01:36:18 ⚖️ Masculinity and Femininity: Greene addresses the confusion around gender roles, pointing out the need for positive models of masculinity and femininity. He highlights the importance of inner strength, resilience, and quiet confidence as traits to venerate in masculinity. 01:39:14 🌐 Lack of Role Models: Greene reflects on the challenges of today's youth growing up without clear role models for positive masculinity and femininity, expressing a sense of loss in the absence of such guiding figures. 01:39:27 🍽️ The overwhelming variety of options in expressing masculinity and femininity, especially in the age of social media, raises the challenge of choosing one's identity and role models wisely. 01:41:05 🔄 Selecting role models is crucial in personal development. Creating a patchwork of influences, rather than adhering to a single ideal, allows for a more balanced and adaptable self-discovery. 01:43:36 📚 Mastery, as a guide, emphasizes the importance of finding mentors and role models for personal and professional growth. It involves the ongoing process of seeking positive qualities in others and integrating them into one's life. 01:45:41 🤝 Building relationships with mentors is not a passive act; it requires courage, engagement, and a genuine connection. The mentor-mentee relationship can be a powerful tool for rewriting one's family history and finding positive influences. 01:49:10 🚀 Having a clear sense of purpose in life serves as a filter for navigating choices in various aspects, from career to social media consumption. Purpose guides decision-making and helps in allocating energy to meaningful pursuits. 01:54:00 🧠 Managing anxiety is crucial for creative thinking. The ability to withstand the discomfort of uncertainty allows for the refinement and development of ideas, turning them from dead concepts into alive, personal creations. 01:55:36 📝 The creative process, as described by Robert Greene, involves significant internal turmoil and anxiety. Pushing through this discomfort leads to the transformation of initial ideas, resulting in a fulfilling sense of accomplishment. 01:56:46 🖋️ Greene's writing process is marked by an initial phase of self-doubt and dissatisfaction with the work. However, the persistence in pushing through anxiety results in continuous improvement and the eventual achievement of a high-quality outcome. 01:58:12 📚 Robert Greene discusses the challenges of writing a book and the anxiety associated with setting and achieving milestones in various domains of life. 02:05:07 ⚖️ Emotional connections and shared values are vital for a successful, lasting relationship, beyond superficial factors like physical attraction. 02:07:54 🧠 Self-awareness is crucial in choosing a compatible partner; understanding one's character and values helps in finding a lasting connection. 02:13:48 🗣️ Non-verbal communication, including body language and facial expressions, plays a significant role in understanding a person's true character and detecting authenticity. 02:17:13 😄 Sense of humor is a crucial component in a relationship; compatibility in humor, along with non-verbal communication, contributes to the success of a romantic partnership. 02:19:05 🤔 Pay attention to non-verbal communication by muting words, observing behavior, and detecting cues like posture, smiles, and eye expressions. 02:20:13 🧠 Milton Ericson, paralyzed at 19, mastered non-verbal communication by observing people during his paralysis, learning different forms of yes, no, and various expressions. 02:23:24 🕵️ Detecting genuine vs. fake smiles is crucial in understanding people, especially in romantic relationships, helping avoid toxic connections. 02:24:48 👀 Recognizing ""dead eyes"" in narcissists is vital, as it reflects a lack of genuine interest and helps avoid toxic relationships. 02:27:46 🎙️ Subcortical courtship: The influence of a person's voice, especially that of a mother, plays a significant role in seduction and emotional impact. 02:36:46 🧠 The danger of relying on AI: Depending solely on tools like ChatGPT might bypass the essential cognitive process of thinking, challenging oneself, and achieving deeper understanding. 02:37:27 🧠 Robert emphasizes the danger of becoming overly reliant on AI and technology, urging people to develop and use their brains actively. 02:41:47 🧠 Robert highlights the incredible complexity and plasticity of the human brain, advocating for the recognition and worship of this remarkable organ over technology. 03:01:25 ⏳ Urgency and finding one's purpose are discussed, with Greene emphasizing the need to escape apathy and laziness, and to pay deeper attention to surroundings and oneself. 03:02:32 ⚔️ Introducing the concept of ""death ground,"" Greene explains how pressure and urgency can be powerful motivators, drawing inspiration from Sun Tzu's strategic thinking. 03:03:54 🏔️ Greene shares a story about a mountain climber to illustrate the extraordinary energy and focus that arise under life-threatening situations. 03:06:48 🙏 Expressing gratitude, the host acknowledges Robert Greene's profound impact on people's lives through his books and various channels, commending the valuable knowledge he shares.

If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart.

@amskape,"I may have missed it but I was hoping to hear a clear definition of “purpose”. When I hear the word purpose, I think of usefulness, as in the purpose of a hammer is to drive nails. I have wondered if the notion of human beings having purpose may have its roots in religion. In Christianity, for instance, the ultimate purpose of a believer is to execute the will of God. The Bible represents the will of God and so living a life according to God’s commandments is the purpose of a Christian.   If you are not a believer, then you have to come up some other way to define purpose. A non-religious approach to defining purpose is living within an ethical framework (either self-developed or adopted) that enables you to live harmoniously with other human beings(society) and nature. This purpose becomes more proactive and directed if you actively seek to avoid harm to society and nature as well as pursue ways in which you can contribute positively to both society and nature.   The key in both the above cases is that there is a moral or ethical framework that sets guidelines for living. So, your purpose within this context is how you go about contributing positively to society and nature. At least that is how I see it.   I enjoyed how this discussion focused on how to find a purpose that excites you while offering the least amount of friction to your nature.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Here’s why- within the past few years I’ve been struggling more than ever to find my purpose, to know who I am, what I want, etc.. I’m almost 27 and it feels like life has flown by and I keep waiting for something to fall into my lap or for someone to guide me to what I’m supposed to be doing with my life. I’ve always loved the arts- acting, film, writing, etc., and have been lucky enough to have had some experience on film sets and such. I have not tuned into that part of me for a while due to just needing a paycheck and I have been panicking because I feel so unfulfilled with where I currently am in my life. Last week I had brought that up in therapy and actually had my second panic attack - which was scary..but then I experienced peace afterwards, because suddenly it was like my inner child just knew what she has been needing to hear for so long. She needed to hear that she IS capable of her dreams, that she CAN do whatever she wants to, and that nobody can decide that for her. I feel like I’m getting closer and closer to being able to faithfully pursue my purpose. Anyways- thought I’d share. Good luck to everyone.",1년 전,19,

@austinkuipers6087,"The belief in some sort of individual reincarnative process is so common in pre-Abrahamic societies globally it makes me wonder if reincarnation is an adaptive belief to overcome death anxiety. Implemented in such a way that it balances the sacred nature of the individual life-instance (yielding fertile ontological conditions for the conception of human rights, individual liberty etc) with the promise of a continued life experience after death, it needs only a multi-incarnative scorecard (karma and similar concepts/memetic structures) to stabilize society and hedge individual ego.  I suspect that a millenia and a half of indoctrination into various abrahamic operating systems has amplified death anxiety. Our original hyperlocal stable belief systems addressed it, but christianity supplanted it with it's fixation on worshipping an ethnic tulpa. It made us cognitively serfs of an imaginary friend to whom we had assigned write/read control over our sense of reality. It performed its designed function of wealth transfer, but at the cost of half the worlds psyche. Once the bulk of the zeitgeist deleted the nonsense of christianity we failed to build a system of cognitive tools capable of addressing the problems it suppressed/denied. Instead we fell into simply doing all of the things it said were bad, forgetting that the reason it was such an effective system of control was it's practice of fusing truths with ethnic nonsense. It infantalized us, and our hard turn to addressing spiritual problems purely via biology is I think in part a product of the fact that we now distrust our capacity to create our own useful metaphors/belief systems. Nihilism creates obedience to power, religion creates obedience to power. An ontology in which one believes they reincarnate, but with a burden or boost based on how they treated others in prior lives creates the conditions for resistance to injustice. Choosing to believe that we are some kind of sacrificial natal cells in a universal egg hatching a technocratic multi-system-spanning borglike society (which is a disturbingly common belief, and one that only serves the select few who funded it into being) is just that: a belief. A faith set against an unknown future. Why choose a metaphor with such self-destructive consequences when much more meaningful and socially beneficial metaphors exist? A neurological mechanism for free will has yet to be discovered, but actually using that as your ontology is not useful for anything.   The metaphor I choose is this: We are sentient pieces of the universe, observing ourselves. I am made of previous patterns, remixed and adapted for the current spacetime. I accrue observations and experiences which change me. When I reabsorb into my outer self (the universe), those memories and the pattern of my biology will be shed, a relic to history. Another form like me will arise. It will be adapted to its world. I will be that thing, as I was before and I am now. Conveniently I am spawning all the time. I've been born millions more times in the span of time since this primate chassis spawned. Each one is a holy thing, a pattern just as important as the pattern I am, but no more. It is my responsibility to maximize this pattern whilst helping other instances of me suffer less and become greater in those ways that I can. I must protect the integrity of this pattern as it was a huge investment on my part and the next time will lack some of the opportunities of this time. I am sovereign, I am eternal, but I am also mortal and there are those of me more powerful than I. There is no deity in the outer sense. The only ""deity"" capable of creation within the outerself of our universe is me, you, all other humans and probably some plasma nebula or mycelial mat that's gained consciousness somewhere.

The part about the ego, how you want to feel the pain it causes you.  ""It's disconnecting you from some of the greatest experiences you can have in life"" I couldn't agree more with.  We all need to have an ego death to pursue our greater selves.  ""Too much choice is detrimental to the human being"" - I feel this on almost a daily basis, it is overwhelming.  Everything you said about anxiety, turn it into something creative and productive, ""how you handle anxiety will determine whether you will be successful...""  I've been trying to write several books and the anxiety and struggle is very present...fighting through it is ridiculously hard.  Just some of my favorite snippets from this episode.

It's interesting because I posed this question to many friends and family, and most of them are surprised and haven't thought of this. I feel like I may have a harder time connecting with someone whose face doesn't move naturally. Maybe this is due to my inability to read their micro expressions, which leaves me unwilling to be vulnerable? Just a thought.",1년 전,1,

After looking into it, I found out that a lot of prisons found them to be such a problem that Me. Greens books have actually been banned from several prison systems.

@Scrabble8393,"Robert-love sublime (God’s love is called Agape love) is found in older couples who have spent a lifetime together.  Or in couples that have overcome loss or traumas and remain together for the pure love of the other.  It is a striping away of what could have been and you are forced (your prison aspect) to find love in the midst of the chaos.  It is grueling to get there, you lose yourself to find a love so pure.  They have to let go of the need to have power over or control over time.  Iron sharpening iron, chipping off the ego if you will.That is the beauty and the gift that comes with working out all the indifferences over time.  It takes a lifetime to get there, and is more powerful than seduction.  It also comes with the knowledge of time is short.  You let go so that you can enjoy the time they have left.  The things that used to bother you when they were alive becomes a memory and you find a closeness in what used to frustrate you.  It’s also a way of finding acceptance with others around you.  The love overflows.  It’s a beautiful thing and it is diminishing because so many people find it so difficult to endure.  ❤ Love is so much more than seduction.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@pantheistic,"vulnerability is a trait of the true self and defensiveness is a trait of the false self. the false self is the result of developing Jung's shadow and it is good so long as it shields the true self. If the false self takes over the conscious mind the true self becomes a hostage of the false self which results in narcissism, borderline and psycopathy. There are tons of people who have no shadow out there. They are naive people. They are vulnerable all the time. It is not cool. The false self mask is very important but to have the ability to put the sword and shield down so your true self can have maximum fun is also important.",1년 전,0,
@StueyStats,"1:02:23 Hey Andrew - great interview and insight as usual. A point of contention here - I love being vulnerable to ideas, thoughts, books, podcasts, etc. I find myself to be quite curious. When I have this vulnerability and allow myself down a path, I wouldn’t say I allow it due to a confidence I can return, rather an acceptance that I may not return, and going forth anyway. I would say vulnerability and acceptance of the result go hand in hand, rather than confidence. It’s this lack of confidence that I will return, and going down the path regardless, that I believe is true vulnerability.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

If you want to get a ton of chicks i highly recommend reading the Art of Seduction. Its so powerful.

@mysticmaude,"I really appreciated so much of the insight presented here, particularly about the true expression of masculinity.. but i highly disagree with Mr. Greene's assessment of online dating. Its hard to meet people, especially as you get older and if you dont like to go to bars. Meeting people organically is obviously preferential but the reality is there are a lot of cool people out there who you will never meet because they wont come into contact with your friend group, or they dont like bars or parties, or the live out of your town or neighborhood, or for for myriad other reasons. Tinder etc is an excellent way to meet people who you would not otherwise naturally meet and i have many friends who have met their partners via the app. You get to assess the micro elements of their personality through their choice of words, how they engage in conversation, what they choose to talk about etc. then of course you encounter their energy when and if you first meet them. Going out costs time, money and energy. Tinder costs nothing and saves you a lot of these things, again especially if you are new to an area and dont want to meet someone at a bar 🙏",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@joethiele4918,"That awareness will show you not just your purpose, but the purpose of every process and the balance within them. Then YOUR preferences of love and hate start to fade into the greater conscious awareness. Righteousness then turns to compassion, compassion to deeply connect with and understand all of life. Without our fear of mortality, by lifting the ego, it all becomes so clear and your compass has no choice but to point towards compassion and understanding, and not righteousness, no force can stop that power because it is eternal, even after death. In this state you will be spit on and people will want to wage war against you but truth and compassion is more powerful then any tactic you can fight with, that is true faith that no religion can touch. Truth and compassion has no immediate impact except for the the impact is gives you personally, but your life will become a message for change that will eventually spread and manifest through all of humanity. Without righteousness there is no ground to stand on, there are no lines in the sand, there are no differences but only similarities. God is just a reference to something we’ll never understand but we can at least follow the intuition that it gives us. The intuition that points towards love for nature and humanity, the rest will follow. You will radiate with this positivity and people will see the balance of the universe inside of you, this is intoxicating to be around, and people who don’t align with this will slowly fade away from your life because they simply haven’t had this realization yet. No one is at fault for believing in the illusions, as it’s simply a right of passage to awaken and they haven’t gotten it that part of their journey yet. But we can all help one another in this journey to ultimate compassion without compromise and the entrapment of our ego. We’ll always have attachments but we can learn to master that part of our mind to not identify with those attachments but identify with the being of light that you are, and simply honor your ego for the wisdom and realizations they bring. If we knew the secrets to life right away, then we wouldn’t have the wisdom to truly acknowledge and appreciate these ideas. So it’s all part of our journey to awakening at a specific time in our life, so have patience with the people you love, they’re not lost, they’re still learning. Even your closed minded grandpa can awaken at his last moments in life before death. For your ego is forcefully removed at that moment and you can see clearly. We don’t need to be at our deathbed for this people! There’s a new generation coming, these politicians can only take us so far, it’s time to do our own work",1년 전,0,

@SketchybrainD,"I’m gonna have to pay closer attention.  This podcast has auto played in the background several times but I never heard a part that speaks on a situation I’m in right now.  I let myself be vulnerable with someone and it was a big mistake to say the least. I hoped the favor would be returned but it was used against me viciously while pretending to see nothing wrong with what she was doing and blaming me for thing she was doing. I ended the relationship one time and after a week or so she apologized and said all the right things so i prepared myself for the worst but gave the benefit of the doubt.  Things were good for a short while but went back to the same stuff but I was prepared for it, I wasn’t prepared to find out my mom had small cell lung cancer that had spread and she had a brain tumor that was growing so fast that one day she seemed fine and the next she couldn’t remember a lot of words and it was hard to make out what she was trying to say.

@tayescaped,"What if masculinity and femininity is actually the dynamic between a woman and a man. Say a woman fits the cultural or physical “mold” of feminine - pretty, curvy, girl, sweet, nurturing - she is not as feminine to the man as the woman that loves him. The man may feel masculine next to this feminine woman initially, but as time goes on the masculine feeling last longest when it is perceived as such by the woman that loves him. The woman that loves him sees him as strong, feels protected, thinks he is brave, and thus becomes more “feminine” as she submits to him, cares for him, nurtures him, and loves him. And vise versa a woman with a man who fits this cultural “mold” of masculinity, may feel more feminine if physically he is attentive to her, but he can leave her once or twice and not think twice about it. A man that comes back like a magnet to the one that surrenders her herself in love, he feels a sense of strength and confidence and bravery from being loved by this woman who seems unable to give up on his presence in her life. And it is this handshake - this handshake between a woman’s nature and a man’s nature in how they show love and feel loved - that builds up their own sense of masculine and feminine. Everything else is a superficial idea that states what masculine and feminine is - but not the means of how it’s felt wholeheartedly.",1년 전,0,

If with age people lose the plasticity of the brain with this disease, Is it arder to learn? and how it affects longevity and if Hashinoto's disease ages people who suffer from it faster and if Cron's disease gave relativity with Hashimoto's disease... Next topic is about Keratotomy surgery with a diamond scalpel tip that led to a first recovery of sight but How does vision affect with age? What type of disease results after surgery? and How vision can be reversed or improved years later?.  Thank you very much for your attention.  Thankful for your podcast",1년 전,0,

Every kick of the ball was never the same to me. When I was at home I would play with lego pieces - they'd bounce off a wall at funny angles each time. And it was fun catching them as if I was a goalie. But I was denied an opportunity to join a football team by my parents because I'm a girl.

@rhondajo7822,"❤❤❤  regarding the necessity and power of role models, all young creatures learn how to live, be and thrive in their environments by observing and emulating their parental units, litter mates and community members. It is an evolutionary process of survival.  Having been raised in a family system where there were six generations of incest and physical abuse (that I could trace), I did not have any functional, healthy role models that showed me how to become my highest and best self; expressing my interests, gifts and talents. As a survival mechanism, I retreated from the threat of my physical environment by escaping into books and movies.   And, it was in these beautiful worlds of stories that I discovered the possibility of a hopeful future.   It was from these incredible and vulnerable characters that I discovered my true self. These beautiful, loving, empowered role  models showed me the possibility of creating myself in their images.   Aubrey, I would love it if you would create a series of podcasts that explores movies as a source of heroic, stable, impactful characters from whom we can all learn how to live up to our potential as positive, creative beings. 😊❤  And wouldn't it be fun, to spend time with a few viewers who are living an active life wherein those characteristics and values gleaned from role models are being used in their personal lives?

I stopped the video at the point where you are talking about power.  As a 68 year old grandmother of a five year old grandson, I have the privilege and joy of closely observing his daily development as a little adult in the making.   I've observed the necessity of a child feeling empowered and powerful in order to be their authentic and fearless self. We all need to feel SAFE in order to be fully immersed in the lessons and delights that our environment and experiences afford us moment by moment. And, it is in these moments that we grow mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually.   In the last five years,  I've noticed that when my grandson plays with others, if there is a dispute over an accidental or purposeful injury (physical or emotional), the child who suffered the injury will strike out to inflict a similar injury. In watching these squabbles, I've noticed that it isn't about revenge, It is about regaining an equal status of power.  When the children are equally matched in power, the course of the play and the relationship settles into a pleasant and satisfying experience where each child feels good about themselves, the other, and their shared time together.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Nothing in this talk is very new or original.  Kids get inspired and of course are often discouraged by society, this is nothing new. Boys esp. causasion have an easier time than girls.

@GotTheThinks,"​​​​ @PurplePerinaise  I disagree that you need youth if your goal is anything other than making money but that's besides the point. You are talking about goals, OP is talking about their life's purpose.  Purpose is not a goal. There can be goals involved, but they're not the same thing. Purpose is something you do/something you live out in order to make the world around you a better place and OP is clearly doing that.  I think this is why the disconnect between your comments and the other perspectives in this thread. I sense that you are coming at it more from a career angle, hence ""foundation for greatness"" and goals. Pursuing greatness is about ego. Goals tend to be self-orientated, whereas purpose is more outward-facing. It's how people connect to something bigger than themselves - community, passing on wisdom learned through experience, raising other people up, nature... Ask yourself, what is the thing in life I care so much about that I want it to exist even after I am gone?  These are the things related to purpose. And because often life leads us down other paths (the career and goals we are told will make us happy), we can be delayed in finding our life's purpose. Often people come to it later in life and for that reason I'd say OP is right on time 🙌  You can fulfill your life's purpose in one day, but hopefully you get longer...",1년 전(수정됨),5,

He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart.

@danielgermancarrizo2134,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 🎙️ Carol Dweck, destacada investigadora en motivación y profesora de psicología en Stanford, comparte su investigación sobre las mentalidades de crecimiento. 04:19 🤔 Dweck comienza su investigación sobre mentalidades al cuestionar por qué algunos niños disfrutan los desafíos mientras otros evitan el fracaso, explorando las raíces cognitivas de estas actitudes. 12:51 🌱 Intervenciones tempranas en mentalidades por Joshua Aronson y otros demostraron cambios positivos, pero el desafío radicaba en escalar estas intervenciones de manera asequible y efectiva. 19:50 📚 La ""National Study of Learning Mindsets"" fue un estudio a nivel nacional con estudiantes de noveno grado que demostró un aumento significativo en el rendimiento académico para aquellos con mentalidad de crecimiento. 23:25 📈 Aunque el efecto fue modesto (0.11), Dweck destaca que muchas intervenciones educativas alcanzan efectos similares, resaltando la dificultad de lograr mejoras significativas a gran escala. 31:14 🧠 Cambiar la mentalidad puede tener un impacto positivo en el rendimiento académico de los estudiantes, especialmente para aquellos con menores logros. 32:24 🤔 Las intervenciones de mentalidad de crecimiento pueden no funcionar bien cuando las normas de los compañeros no son favorables, lo que destaca la importancia del entorno social. 35:07 🍎 La mentalidad del maestro también es crucial; los profesores con mentalidad de crecimiento mejoraron el rendimiento de los estudiantes en matemáticas, mientras que los profesores con mentalidad fija anularon los beneficios de la intervención. 38:44 🎯 La investigación se ha centrado en el rendimiento académico, pero Dweck destaca la importancia de explorar otros resultados, como el bienestar, la realización personal y las relaciones sociales. 57:23 🤨 Dweck defiende la efectividad de las intervenciones de mentalidad de crecimiento, considerando su impacto en el rendimiento académico, a pesar de las críticas sobre afirmaciones exageradas en la literatura científica. 01:01:40 📚 La intervención de la mentalidad de crecimiento no es perfecta y no funciona en todos los lugares. 01:02:32 🏞️ La investigación sobre intervenciones de mentalidad de crecimiento está en su infancia, buscando aprender a crear entornos sostenibles que fomenten el crecimiento de la mentalidad. 01:03:14 🚫 La mentalidad no es un milagro. No se trata de la creencia de que cualquier cosa es posible, sino de apoyar el ser un aprendiz y ayudar a los profesores a integrarlo efectivamente en la enseñanza. 01:05:55 🗻 La ""falsa mentalidad de crecimiento"" es común en las aulas, subrayando la dificultad de enseñar profundamente este concepto. El desafío futuro es desarrollar estrategias efectivas. 01:07:16 🎓 La colaboración intensa con maestros y otros investigadores es clave.

Many children enjoy easy tasks with high gratification, what exactly can we learn from that? Their frontal lobes aren't completely developed yet-  would be my guess. Let us also just be clear that the whole idea of a ""Unique Purpose"" is highly humanistic in nature (and humanism, some argue - see for example the book ""Homo Deus"", is basically just a new-found religion).

This severe low blood sugar primarily affected the speech centers of my brain.  Understand, I know this in no way compares to what you have, and are, going through Robert.  Fully recovering my speech took about a year.  There were other processes that had been affected, but not as obvious.  Again, I can't even compare my experience with what you've faced.

Even someone born male that tries to emulate a woman can't be Feminine, it's an act, because when they get angry, their true Masculinity comes out. I seen it over and over again.   Just because a man can recognize his emotions, have empathy and understanding doesn't make him Feminine.  Stop demasculating our Men!   Just because a woman is demonstrating strength, aggression, and indifference doesn't mean she is Masculine.   That belongs only to Men, just like Femininity only belongs to women.

@babayada,"Huberman talks a lot about dopamine and dopamine management.  I've thought that yes, that is a lens, and yes, it's accurate... but from a certain point of view.  A limited point of view.  What Greene is talking about regarding the sublime is very real and very true.  It is a thing that transcends what is apparently obvious and inescapable cause and effect when looking at brain chemistry and dopamine networks.  Although, I have to disagree a bit with Greene.  Many people experience the sublime from external sources.  The thing that is touched by these experiences is deeply internal.  Great art does it.  And despite what Greene said about drugs, many people have sublime experiences with drugs that are not on the order and cheapness of pornography.  I remember hearing and reading some quote by James Joyce defining art and pornography and comparing them.  Pornography disconnects you from your deeper self and inner truth, art connects you to it.  Both are external, but one is superficial and the other is deep.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

At the beginning of this podcast Robert Greene starts talking about the process for finding & achieving your unique purpose (the title of this podcast) but before he can finish outlining his thoughts Huberman interjects, steers the conversation to another topic, and does the majority of the talking......I recently tried to introduce Huberman to a friend by playing a different show for him. In that one he also overpowered the guest to the point my friend asked me to turn it off as the guest was virtually unable to speak. Ironically, at the beginning of that podcast Huberman mentioned that he had received feedback about dominating the conversations and was going to make an effort not to....I respect Huberman's work and his accomplishments, hopefully he will take into account some of this feedback.",1년 전,0,

I'm 19 and have been on a quest to figure out my life's purpose, and your episode, with Andrew Huberman and Robert Greene, was like hitting the jackpot.  Your title alone matched what I've been searching for, and the insights you all shared were beyond enlightening. I want to express my deepest gratitude to both you and the guests for providing such valuable information. The part about finding one's life task, relationships, and especially the near-death experience was mind-blowing.  Robert Greene's description of the near-death experience was so vivid and imaginative that I could almost picture myself in that moment. It left me pondering what I can do to make my life more memorable and meaningful when I eventually face a similar situation.

@Findmylimit,"When i convinced myself I was content with dying and life by no means has anything left to offer but more pain and sorrow, after some time in this state of mind I would find myself in one of the most beautiful blissfully welcoming dream of what seemed to be paradise. It was this house with a Ferris wheel attached to the back side and a beautiful beach behind it. Inside the house it had thick white carpet, cool blue and grey color walls with white trim, some rooms empty and few had a single occupant seemingly sharing the same feelings as me and were waiting to leave. I stayed in the room i picked which had been a dream of mine to finally have some kind of stability. the room being perfect quenching my deepest desires and after running around with the other for awhile playing games sharing stories we were told by this handsome younger looking fella with a black button up and loosely worn white pants to come to the back it was time to get on the Ferris wheel. But before we did we all ran to the beach now standing adjacent to the house on the softest sand I’ve ever felt with a never ending sight of spotless white clouds encapsulating the area which had a baseball field shape and where I had been currently standing would be far left field. Gazing out into the ocean of clouds I felt weightless and sense of happiness transcended higher then what I’ve felt before. I hear a calling and turn to see the friend I had made running over to me she nice and extraordinarily beautiful. I headed towards her as she caught up and we began walking leaving footprints in the sand up to the house when I had gazed up at the Ferris wheel and noticed how gargantuan it was in size planting it’s foundation into the sand it would connect to the house at the deck and rotate into the clouds above. Going back inside I visited the room one last time I had no belongings nor did anyone else all we had in common was a feeling of peace. Walking out the sliding glass doors onto the deck. It felt like a parking garage from the house to the Ferris wheel it was about 30 feet with an over hang so I couldn’t see the top all I could see was the beach behind it  and the handsome young man awaiting to open the Ferris door. I causally walked towards him ready to go. So calm and relaxed in a way I’ve never experienced before I understood where I was going and if I chose to go I’d be leaving my body behind for ever. I can’t explain in words the feeling of relief and joy i entered into just before getting on. Once I sat down and closed the door I got a phone call which woke me up trapping me once again in this physical body.",1년 전,0,

@masterblou2119,"You seem like a strong man. So I challenge you to this; Go and give up everything that you have and go live in the Street homeless for two years. No welfare. The rules are; You can only eat food that are donated or through pan handling. You have to live using only what the government, the church and non-profits/people puts there to help the poor. Sleep in refuges with other homeless and live with them.  Then you will have a very different understanding of Life, you won't need gurus to tell you what's wrong.",1년 전,0,

@MrPinkfloydian,"This was... WOW! This man is really amazing! I'm sure we are all very grateful for having him here with us... and to have our dear and most empathic Andrew Huberman to praise him as profoundly as he deserves. That was lovely! Thank you.  From all of this richnesses I found myself relating to 2 of his stories. It was so interesting to find him speaking about the search for those microseconds of expressions where the other person is caught off guard. I also do try to be very aware of that 👌 From this, Robert mentioned how a girlfriend changing faces while socializing 2:10:58. So interesting! I also had a girlfriend that when we socialized... she would change herself into a whole different character. She even talked to me as if I was someone else... like a complete stranger. Crazy! Eventually I figured out that this was just a shard of her all broken and immature need for attention. In my final conclusion, I didn't realize she had used me (while we weren't socializing) but... my charming (and praising) introduction to her on day 1 might have sparked that same need of attention... the thing that disgusts me the most.  2:58:06 at this point he mentioned those bottlenecks that nobody thinks about. Curiously, I always say the same 😂 (and I didn't have a stroke). I realized that while watching the Alone TV show. A group of people is dropped on harsh lands to... survive. Basically (spoiler alert!) they all wither and thin until the point where a doctor's concern takes them out from the show because of the detrimental impacts of a high weight loss. So that would make me wonder about the odds of the early men's survival until evolving into a mostly sedentary generation... sat watching this TV show 😧",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@SupaStar-1,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  08:31 🌌 Finding one's purpose involves understanding and embracing the uniqueness that comes from early childhood inclinations and experiences. 15:43 🧠 Emotionally engaging with a subject related to one's unique inclinations accelerates learning, leading to a deeper understanding and connection. 17:21 🎯 Finding your life's task gives a sense of direction, acting as an internal radar that guides decisions and choices, even if the specific path may not be immediately clear. 18:56 🌐 The process of self-discovery involves narrowing choices to align with one's unique strengths and inclinations, similar to animals identifying their niche in the environment. 20:46 🌿 Seeds of purpose often manifestas distinct sensations or activations in the body, providing clues to one's genuine interests and passions. 21:26 🌊 Finding purpose is not just intellectual but visceral, emotional, and physical. It's about feeling a deep connection that makes everything click together, even in moments of tedium. 22:47 🧒 Childhood inclinations and interests can resurface later in life. Exploring what you loved as a child can provide a guide to your unique purpose. 25:30 💔 What you hate is as important as what you love. However, a negative experience, especially in learning, can turn you off from the overall process. Early positive experiences are crucial. 30:54 🧠 In adulthood, paying attention to your own desires and frustrations is essential for self-awareness. Distancing yourself from external influences allows you to hear your own thoughts and feelings. 39:06 🌌 Real Sublime experiences come from within, connecting to the deep part of human nature. False Sublime experiences, often sought externally, are temporary illusions that lead to a constant need for more. 43:37 🌌 The inner voice is a sublime guide, connecting to it is crucial for personal mastery. 44:19 🔄 Power is a resource in relationships, and understanding its dynamics is vital for success. 45:00 🔄 Power dynamics exist in various relationships; understanding and navigating them is essential. 46:22 💡 Power, in its primitive sense, is about control over one's environment and circumstances. 50:28 🤝 Learning the dynamics of power is essential for effective social interaction and personal growth. 01:08:23 🌐 Robert Greene explores the power dynamics in sexual exchanges and introduces the concept of ""topping from the bottom,"" highlighting the illusion of control and power in romantic relationships. 01:10:51 🌹 In ""The Art of Seduction,"" Greene explains that seduction was invented by women who lacked power in various aspects of life, using sex and physical attraction as a means to control powerful men, challenging the perception of who holds the power in a relationship. 01:13:10 🧠 David Anderson's neurobiological findings reveal separate neural circuits for sexual and nonsexual power dynamics in animals, shedding light on the primitive nature of dominance and control, which aligns with Greene's insights into power dynamics in humans. 01:17:44 💖 Greene introduces the concept of ""love sublime,"" emphasizing a deep, equal connection between individuals that transcends power dynamics, drawing from biology, physics, and the desire for profound human connection. 01:21:23 🌱 Greene addresses the impact of modern challenges like social media, hookup culture, and pornography on human connection, advocating vulnerability and openness as a positive dynamic to escape the confines of the ego and foster genuine connections. 01:28:29 🧠 Distractions like constant exposure to injustices can hijack creativity, hinder vulnerability, and impede deep connections. 01:29:40 🚫 Learning to ignore certain things in modern life is crucial; focusing on controllable aspects, avoiding negative rabbit holes, and choosing what to pay attention to is an art. 01:31:59 🌍 Addressing injustices positively involves actions like voting, joining causes, and working on significant issues rather than being consumed by every minor detail. 01:32:40 🧘‍♂️ Recognizing and resisting the allure of constant negative stimuli on social media is essential for maintaining focus, energy, and purpose. 01:38:33 ⚖️ The current societal confusion regarding masculinity and femininity requires individuals to discern positive traits, embrace role models, and create a balanced personal identity. 01:50:18 🤝 Building mentor relationships requires effort, courage, and social skills. Following someone on social media is not enough; engagement is essential. 01:51:00 📚 The art of thinking involves transforming external ideas into your own by interacting, reflecting, and refining. It's about turning ideas into something alive and deeply personal. 01:53:03 😰 Anxiety is a signal that you don't understand something. Handling anxiety by rushing for instant solutions can hinder creativity and deeper thinking. 01:54:15 🚀 Dealing with anxiety and resisting instant gratification are markers of creativity. Avoiding the first available answer allows for refining and making better choices in career and life. 02:00:59 ❤️ Convergence of interests, values, and character traits beyond superficial aspects is crucial for lasting relationships. Emotional connections and shared values, such as a love for animals, contribute to a deep connection. 02:11:30 😲 Cultivate a sense of mystery in relationships to avoid boredom. Too much familiarity and predictability lead to relationship stagnation. 02:13:21 🎵 In relationships, shared generative drives matter more than similar interests. It's about a common approach to life, curiosity, and a desire to create. 02:14:29 🎶 Music can be a window into a person's character. It's not about identical tastes but understanding the qualities expressed through their music choices. 02:17:42 😆 A sense of humor is crucial in relationships. A partner who can make you laugh is valuable, adding depth and enjoyment to the connection. 02:19:34 👀 Master non-verbal communication by paying attention to cues. Detect fake smiles, read posture, and understand the tone of voice for insights into genuine emotions. 02:33:23 🧠 Intelligence involves countering biases, self-awareness, and holistic thinking, akin to scientists' aha moments. 02:34:16 🤖 Machines need to go beyond data processing, be self-aware, and engage in holistic thinking to emulate human consciousness. 02:35:24 🧑‍🎓 The speaker shares a paradigm shift from his experience translating ancient Greek, emphasizing the importance of thinking and problem-solving. 02:37:51 🛑 Concerns about AI like ChatGPT replacing critical thinking, learning, and the process of going through challenges, leading to potential intellectual stagnation. 02:42:28 🧠 Advocacy for valuing and worshiping the human brain over technology, emphasizing its complexity, plasticity, and the need to develop and use it to its full potential. 02:54:49 🤔 Surviving a stroke led Robert Greene to appreciate life more deeply and confront his own demons. 02:57:21 🌼 Transformative experiences emerged from limitations; newfound appreciation for simple pleasures and heightened awareness of surroundings. 02:58:13 🌍 Greene emphasizes the strangeness of being alive, urging people to reflect on the improbable chain of events that led to their existence. 03:01:40 💡 Urgency and the concept of ""death ground"" can bring out untapped energy and focus, emphasizing the importance of recognizing life's fragility. 03:07:57 🙏 Robert Greene expresses gratitude for the impact of his work and emphasizes the value of his roadmap for navigating life's challenges.",1년 전(수정됨),1,

The invention of calculators could be disputed as one ""losing out on their cognitive abilities"" through reliance.

In my experience, creating image generation with AI takes a lot of coaching and precise calibration. It executes.

@jchinckley,"The problem is already that the technology is driving too many of us. Particularly with respect to AI. If it cannot have the same emotions as a human being, where is its actual ""intelligence?"" Apparently in the people that programmed it, not so much in the software itself. I don't think we can ever achieve true AI in the sense explained here by Robert Greene. Can it search databases in the blink of an eye? Sure. Can it write something wholly new or creative? No. The best it can do is draw from multiple sources and try to make the end product make sense to a human. Can it provide inspiration? I'm sure it can, but I don't believe anything we can make will have a true spark of  consciousness or or original creativity.  An AI learning is merely it recording more data to access when someone interfaces with it. It can be taught to respond certain ways, but will it actually learn from its environment without the intervention of trainers or external algorhithms? I doubt it. At the very least not until we've achieved encasing a series of quantum computers in the same space as a laptop.",1년 전,0,

I can sense the ""sublime"" of magical/storytelling literature type  behind his words. The fact that Sigmund Freud is cited a few times. Nevertheless, we need the magical (placebo) effect and that's scientific. I liked many things he said. One in particular was regarding AI. WOW, if people forget to use their brains to solve problems because of over reliant on AI. Use it or lose it. Ability to read body language is already diminished because of screens.

I grew up in an environment that intelligence, wanting to learn about everything and abstract ideas was let's say.....looked at as well strange and otherwise ignored. I was always an extremely gifted student in EVERYTHING except math...I know believe I may have a type of disorder that literally makes it difficult on a severely limited level to comprehend math. I liken it to the energy output those with issues in reading have. Anyway, alot of addiction and interpersonal issues and instability was a constant. Still I for as long as I remember have had a inate drive to learn and was pretty decent at some sport...all while having a scary mathematics teacher slap a meter stick on my desk when I failed to solved his impromptu math problem. There was no one in my family whom I learned this from, and so I argue how much of ourselves we truly are born.  with. And ""false sublime"" is a coping strategies learned sometimes and other times not....not that I agree with this bs rhetoric anyway. He references Maslows work as if it is current and accepted psychology ughh.

@danyyyyyyy7,"📚 Robert Greene's books explore the interaction between the psychology of self-exploration and human interaction, rooted in history and modern culture, providing practical tools for pursuing one's purpose. 🌱 Finding your purpose is like having an internal radar that guides your best decisions and gives your life direction and energy. 🧠 When you figure out that primal inclination that's inside of you, then you have the energy to be disciplined and go through boring tasks to learn at a faster rate because you're emotionally engaged. 🌱 Finding your unique purpose may take time, but it's never too late to start the process of self-discovery and dig deep to uncover your true path. 🌱 Finding your unique purpose is about activating a visceral, emotional, and physical feeling within you, not just an intellectual pursuit. 🧠 The excitement and delight in pursuing our purpose is visceral and ultimately requires action to transmute it into something real. 🧠 The human brain is wired for transcendental experiences that take us out of the narrow realm we live in, allowing us to feel connected to something larger. 🌌 The real Sublime comes from within, not from external sources like drugs, alcohol, or shopping. Power dynamics and influence 💪 Power is deeply wired in us to want a degree of control over our environment and immediate events, compelling us to act in certain ways to influence others. 🎭 Learning the subtle dynamics of power is extremely essential because we're a social animal. 🧠 Connecting to mastery and finding your life's purpose is about finding where you belong and proving yourself, not about physical power or a sense of inferiority. Creativity and the human brain 😓 Robert Greene's creative process is 95% pain and only 2.5% ecstasy, showing that creativity often involves a lot of inner turmoil and anxiety. 😅 Robert Greene's process for writing involves a lot of anxiety, but the feeling of accomplishment when finishing a chapter or a book is better than any kind of drug experience. 🧠 We worship technology as our new religion, but we should be worshiping the human brain, the most complex piece of matter in the universe.",1년 전,0,

I've been led to other paths where I took God out of my life. While walking those paths, I felt empty, and when times of low came by, I couldn't handle it. Only by going back to him (Jesus Christ), then I could feel that peace once again.   By this, it just made my belief stronger in him, goodness and the story of the bible is amazing.

I was lost and confused and disheartened to have to be disingenuous... luckily I work a program for recovery that encourages vulnerability and as a result found the most amazing partner while being myself and rigorously honest and vulnerable. I took that chance of my heart being broken again and at least for now its paid off and I wouldn't change it even if my heart ends up broken again.",1년 전,0,

@tozobozo4142,"I am going to be reading Greene's books after listening to this podcast.  Thanks.  As an aside, and as a near 60 man, i think the reason Greene gets letters from women as opposed to men is that outside the ranks of a more rarified, academic world, women are the ones reading books.  Men are decoupled significantly today from anything beyond making money and seeking the false sublime.  The life of the mind is not being celebrated beyond these things into middle-age.  I find the men in my world at least significantly reptilian, and it's pretty tragic.  Perhaps part of this is indeed the fear of vulnerability, of being seduced.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@peteandtessTube,"A YouTube algorithm brought your video to me which I point out because part of your talk mentions the sea of social media that is swallowing us alive. I spend a lot of time watching videos about chess, ai, electric cars and Zen Buddhism. I’ve started referring to this medium as YouTube University. At the same time I avoid all the others that I call anti social media and as Betty White referred to Facebook as a tremendous waste of time. So without intentionally seeking you out, there you were and I was going to move on or back to one of the topics above but the depth and texture of your conversation sucked me in. As I reached the midpoint you talked about Human Nature which I suddenly realized that I had recently purchased. Then, while you were talking I went ahead and bought Mastery and I’ll probably buy the Laws of Power. I’ve reached a point and a time in life where I have more history than future but I have much more time now than before to spend it doing this kind of stuff. I bought the book Human Nature because I am so upset by all the atrocities I witness through the daily bombardment of the news. My own reality is pleasant if not perfect and yet people seem to be consumed in hate. Why? What is Human Nature? And so I bought the book. Your program/interview is great because you take the time to really talk about your topics in depth. So now I think your program will be added to my list. In terms of finding your purpose, you’re doing it. Good Job!!!",1년 전,0,

@MuMuam1,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  08:43 🌐 Finding your purpose involves reconnecting with the primal inclinations and impulses you had as a child, often drowned out by external influences as you grow older. 10:21 🧭 Your unique purpose lies in identifying the dominant form of intelligence your brain naturally veers towards, as described by Howard Gardner's five frames of mind. 17:48 🕰️ It's never too late to find your purpose; even at 40 or 50, going through an archaeological process, digging into childhood experiences, can help unearth the unique seed of your identity. 21:12 🌊 Deep connection to your purpose is visceral, emotional, and physical. It feels like swimming with the current, making things easy and delightful. 22:47 🧠 Childhood interests and passions can resurface in adulthood, guiding your path and bringing excitement and happiness. 23:40 🧭 Different individuals have various forms of intelligence or frames of mind. Recognizing and understanding these differences is crucial in guiding people towards their unique purpose. 30:26 🧘‍♂️ In the modern world, distractions and external influences can drown out internal voices. Self-awareness and introspection are essential for understanding personal likes and dislikes. 31:46 🤔 Frustration and anxiety are signals to pay attention to, providing valuable insights into dissatisfaction and indicating the need for change. 37:44 🌌 The Sublime is an experience that transcends the conventional circle of thinking and behavior. Real Sublime experiences come from within, connecting to the deep, innate part of human nature, while false Sublime experiences are external and temporary, often leading to addiction. 42:03 ⏰ Deep engagement in activities, like writing, can create a sense of flow and timelessness, contrasting with addictive behaviors that aim to escape or murder time. 43:37 📘 Robert Greene is writing a new chapter on ""dayon,"" the voice inside you, connecting it to the theme of Mastery in his upcoming book. 46:22 🌐 Greene defines power in interpersonal relations, highlighting its primal roots in the human need for control over the environment, career, relationships, and more. 48:25 💡 Power dynamics are inherent in human interactions, and understanding subtle power dynamics is crucial for navigating social and career environments effectively. 50:28 🔄 Suppressingthe need for power leads to passive expressions, and learning the dynamics of power is essential for positive influence without resorting to manipulation. 52:30 🎯 Greene and the host explore the concept of finding one's unique purpose within a social context, drawing parallels between power, seduction, and individual strengths. 01:02:47 🚀 Being seduced involves confidence and the assurance that one can return to oneself afterward, highlighting the interconnectedness of vulnerability, confidence, and the ability to recover. 01:06:16 🌊 Men, often in control and powerful, secretly desire to let go and be dominated by a powerful woman. This desire for surrender is explored in historical figures like Julius Caesar and Joe DiMaggio. 01:09:30 ⚖️ Seduction, as described in ""The Art of Seduction,"" is an art invented by women who lacked power in other realms. It involves luring a powerful man into a world where the seductress controls the dynamic. 01:11:34 🧠 Neurobiological studies suggest separate brain circuits for sexual mounting behavior and nonsexual physical power display in animals, challenging conventional notions of power dynamics. 01:14:32 💕 Robert Greene explores the concept of ""Love Sublime,"" a deep connection involving vulnerability, equality, and letting go of power dynamics. He advocates for escaping the ""prison of the ego"" to experience profound human connections. 01:19:46 🌐 Greene expresses concern about modern challenges like hookup culture and pornography, rewiring the human brain and hindering the ability to experience profound, vulnerable connections. He hopes for a shift towards real, communal interactions. 01:24:50 🔄 To counter disconnection and alienation caused by technology, Greene encourages embracing vulnerability, openness, and escaping the confines of the ego. He sees hope in the human spirit's ability to overcome cycles of closure and embrace openness. 01:28:00 🚫 Social media exposes us to a constant stream of injustice, triggering a sense of frustration and helplessness. The challenge is determining when action is necessary and avoiding being hijacked by negativity, which can distract from deeper purposes. 01:29:11 🚨 In navigating modern life, it's crucial to ignore certain things. Robert Greene shares his experience with the Nextdoor app, highlighting the importance of filtering out negative information that can create unnecessary fear and distraction. 01:31:59 ⚖️ Learning the art of what to ignore is essential for maintaining focus and energy. While there are injustices that require attention and action, getting caught up in every negative news cycle canbe counterproductive. 01:33:48 🤵‍♂️ Robert Greene discusses the crisis of masculinity and femininity in contemporary times. He emphasizes the importance of having positive role models and mentors to navigate the confusion of evolving societal expectations. 01:43:24 🔄 The process of choosing mentors evolves throughout life. Greene encourages finding people with qualities you admire, internalizing their positive energy, and understanding that this mentorship process is ongoing. 01:49:37 🎯 Having a sense of purpose discovered in your 20s provides positive role models and mentors, contrasting the superficiality of social media following. Engaging with mentors requires courage and effort to build valuable relationships. 01:50:47 📚 Engaging with recommended tools like reading, thinking, and writing about a book leads to deep understanding and ownership of ideas. Alive thinking involves the constant refinement and interaction with ideas, while dead thinking is superficial and lacks depth. 01:59:34 💑 In building lasting romantic partnerships, look for convergence in deep values and interests, beyond superficial preferences. Emotional connections, shared values (e.g., about money), and character convergence contribute to a lasting connection. 02:03:54 🤝 Self-awareness is key in finding the right partner. Understand your own character, values, and what matters to you. Avoid distractions from societal pressures or admiration of qualities that don't align with your core values. 02:09:55 🔄 Recognize the importance of character and energy alignment in relationships. Look beyond admiration for accomplishments and focus on shared values, ease of interaction, and a merging of energies for a deeper, more fulfilling connection. 02:11:30 🎭 Maintain a sense of mystery in a relationship to prevent boredom; partners should have undiscovered aspects and surprises. 02:14:29 🎵 Music preference can reveal deep aspects of a person's character and values; it's a nonverbal window into their personality. 02:16:06 🗣️ Non-verbal communication is crucial in relationships; understanding body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice is essential. 02:23:24 🕵️ Detecting genuine vs. fake smiles is a valuable skill; genuine smiles light up the whole face, indicating true interest. 02:32:40 🧠 Robert Greene emphasizes the role of anxiety in thinking, highlighting its impact on idea development and the importance of addressing biases in intelligence. 02:33:23 🔄 Three qualities of intelligence discussed by Greene: dealing with anxiety, self-awareness regarding biases and dark sides, and the ability to see a holistic picture. 02:34:29 🤖 Greene envisions a machine with anxiety, self-awareness, and holistic thinking, paralleling human consciousness and creativity. 02:38:19 🚗 Greene and the host discuss concerns about AI, particularly avatars replacing authentic online personas, reducing emotional expression, and the risk of losing the transformative aspect of effort and anxiety in the learning process. 02:44:30 🩹 Discussing his stroke experience, Greene shares insights gained during the process of dying, challenging the concept of a continuous self, experiencing time distortion, and recognizing the brain's role in communication and coordination. 02:54:21 🩸 Robert Greene reflects on his near-death experience, describing the feeling of energy draining after a stroke. 02:55:17 🧠 Despite challenges, Robert expresses gratitude for maintaining and growing his mental faculties after the stroke. 03:03:39 ⏳ The concept of ""death ground"" is discussed, highlighting the transformative energy and focus it provides in urgent situations. 03:06:48 📚 Expressing gratitude for Robert's impact, the host acknowledges the valuable roadmap provided by Robert Greene's work in navigating life's challenges.

@Jnwheeler0607,"I really enjoyed this conversation. I have a question though: Why do we as humans believe that animals are not aware of their death? If they weren't aware of death wouldn't they not run when chased by a predator? I feel like we are all misled by thinking this way. After all, we do not actually know what their thoughts are. Perhaps animals are more self aware than humans and maybe that's why many of them do not have to speak to know what the other animals want or need. Anyways, it's just food for thought.

Such states can be re-created using VR too. But, what is more exciting is the strong parallels it has to the ancient Hindu (not a religion) philosophical way of life - advaita vedanta, which postulates consciousness as a ""subject"" that is outside the body-mind complex, a watcher if you will but not one that can be ""objectified"". It would be awesome if Andrew Huberman can invite the best mind that I have come across in that philosophy, Swami Sarvapriyananda, from the Vedanta Society of New York, as a guest in a future podcast. I am not affiliated to the society, but have learnt a lot from watching the Swami's YT videos and podcasts.",1년 전,0,

I couldn't;t find one picture of myself that if there was a baby also in the photo, that I was not sitting next the baby. Then a group pf pictures that I know well. As my family has posted them to social media.  I am kneeling by the chrismas tree on chrismas morning,  My hair is perfect and I'm wearing a frilly 80's plaid nightgown. My arms are crossed and I'm pouting. Bottom  lip is all the way out. My brother posted it to social media; she didn't get the doll that pees; best caption Go! The comments are extremely funny. I learned what water sports are. LMAO What this podcast brought to light is that I was a maternity nurse for 8 years. It was a babydoll yes, but also the human body and how it works that I love.   Another funny story. My dad would buy me a small something I wanted if I got all A's. I had been wanting a book about the human body with these amazing drawings of all antomy.  I was 7, so my brother was 12. He ripped out all the ""female"" drawings. I was so mad, I told my mom and she giggled, that made me more mad. I asked where he was, she said getting out of hockey, but that had friend that was coming over. I then went and ripped all the ""male"" drawings out and taped them to his bedroom walls. He opens his door with his friend standing behind him and there are a penises, scrotums etc all over. My poor mother. She made me stand there while she told his friends mother. Who looked at me and said well maybe this book isn't for children. I responded with,  well it is now and walked away.",1년 전,0,

@orangeiceice12,"Hubermans point regarding the horse vs the aeroplane vs walking is great. That's a classic philosophy example, in fact, to illustrate instrumentality. Taking a walk to the park is not the same as going for a drive to the park, unless getting to the park is the only goal, and the means is simply an instrument. I'm beginning to realize that any instrumentality or suborned means always impact the ends, and nothing is entirely fungible except in specific dimensions.",1년 전,1,

Robert talks at the beginning about how he knew as a kid that he was so fascinated by language and with the title of this video about finding your unique purpose, I felt led to believe that finding my purpose would I would feel good about doing it every day, maybe some frustration, but certainly I wouldn't have guessed after hearing about how much Robert loves what he does... that he'd say at this point in the interview that *95%* of his process is pain....... I didn't see that coming... and I really appreciate that this got brought to light.

@juanandresalvarezjaramillo,"What an amazing interview. In some contexts (Only my opinion) I think Andrew came up with this naive perspective of life, for example in thinking about of how to fit within his group of friends. There is no hierarchy yes, but there is a clear fight for being the Alpha, and this fight is emotional, and political, and many people think they have to either fit in or fit in, no matter what, which I think Robert is trying to explain how this is just not true. I think it's a wiser game to say, ""Well maybe I am this alpha or this beta or this other person who actually do not fit in, and that's ok"". Then it's your job to create an environment that is positive in which you do fit. Otherwise life can become really painful trying to ""fake"" yourself into life. In my opinion it's more hurtful trying to fit in where you don't, contrary to opening up and seeing there is other ways of impacting society in a positive way and connecting with other human beings where you fit. It's beautiful and profoundly self assuring to just let go, and go find your way.",1년 전,0,

Those  driving purposes  were deeply established and  well integrated into the fabric of my future.  Unexpectedly , my life was turned upside down and inside out  and then,  stomped into the ground.  My identity was obliterated taking my purchases, too.   I  suppose that I still have a bit of a 'phantom'  identity  which  clouds the self discovery process.

Then discovered punk, metal and prog rock, (and skateboarding) throughout middle/high school. 36 years old and I still enjoy a wide breath of genres.

@herahagstoz6934,"I really am enjoying this conversation and I’ve found myself laughing and smiling at several points. My biggest criticism of it revolves around a concept that I will call unconscious gendered perception of universal reality. It’s clear that much of his thinking relies heavily on his embodied male experience in this world. I’m not sure if he’s aware of this or if he is just not making a point of it out loud but at many points in the discussion he seems to generalize behavior based on gender constructs that are more common in this western culture and within historically male centric research and literature of essentialism between the binary genders carved into western cultures. He seems to yearn for a simplistic definition of what it means to be one sort of human being or another and yet one of the first things he elaborates on as crucial for self actualization is the unique individualism of every human from all others. He must be unaware of this blurring between his own personal experience and his sense of rightness for defining the behaviors of others, especially in a gendered way. I have a problem with his definition and use of the word seduction. There is a long long metaphorical association of this particular word with a perceived dangerous manipulation of men by women. But he also seems to be using it as a metaphor for how those who lack physical power or even inanimate objects or intellectual pursuits can become seductive. There’s a difference here in what is being said and yet he doesn’t highlight this; from everything else he’s just spoken about I don’t think he’s aware that he’s associating the word both with negative intent but also as a beneficial instinctive behavior.  Again the female seduction is from a very specific intellectual male cultural perspective. But he doesn’t seem to understand this. This is one of those conversations that I wish I could have been a part of. What he is saying is very important but I am concerned about his assumption of authority on aspects of unlived experience he states as facts.",1년 전,0,

@herahagstoz6934,"The sublime, the liminal, the subaltern; these are all descriptions of the spaces that we cannot occupy in any direct sense but which we all pass through at some point in our lives. Some of us live closer to these spaces than others but the majority of the time we live in the profane or non sacred spaces of our ordinary lives. The more we can recognize our proximity to these moments of passage the better we are able to handle them and also the greater the chances become for inspiration and growth. The idea of killing time is the unconscious feeling between these moments of transcendent experience. I think instead of humans attempting to murder time, perhaps instead we are seeing the process of a toxic mimicking. Those who are lost within any addiction or post trauma behavior that negatively impacts them are essentially attempting to escape the painful and dull profanity of a life which has not allowed them to experience or benefit from these moments. We are both afraid of these experiences and also deeply yearn for them. We use religion or other forms of containment in order to make them less scary and yet in this way we end up caging and taming the essential qualities of wildness, mystery, and we often end up further alienating ourselves from ever passing through these moments consciously. When we learn to accept the fact that there are spaces where transformation becomes possible we are more likely to enjoy life and we feel less insecure about change, whether internal or otherwise. It remains mysterious and uncomfortable however instead of fear or denial we develop our connection with everyone and the compassion necessary for self acceptance and self awareness. From this perspective we can recognize places where growth is possible and the sublime becomes more easy to recognize when it is occurring.",1년 전,1,

@miakakebeeke7,"I had this idea of ""evolved"" consciousness in that some people through brain hardwiring (genetics = hyperlimbic i.e. increased emotional sensitivity), life events and brain re-wiring through mindfulness/awareness, physical and mental training can level up their brain capacity to see past the hierarchal ""less evolved"" brain to that more lateral/compassion based/ego-less awareness. The extra sensitivity of the hardwiring with the added training of the limbic response from a hyjacked emotional reactive brain to one that can pause, reflect and respond allows for the human to see a different dimension and expands the field of awareness to an evolved state of being. Did I make that up or is this type of lymbic brain evolution being seen in research studies? I work as a teacher and I am fascinated by the effects of trauma on the learning brain and trying to work with ways to break the stress cycle so they can learn (using exercise/connection/self-compassion) and the key to being an effective educator is being able to regulate our own emotions when a student gets triggered (which happens often) and to respond in a compassionate way. My work in training my own ability to sit in the discomfort of others and not taking it personally has evolved my own ability to see through a lot of the bullshit that we create in our own minds and given me a better ability to respond with compassion and equality/equinimity instead of the less evolved emotional egoic reaction.

@Jennifer-gr7hn,"pain to purpose, dear one. Same here - brain injury, along with heart, lung, every organ and since it was during the plandemic, I got not help. I died, spontaneously survived, but then again, was left abandoned to progress and I didn't even start for a year since I was too unable and unstable. Determined to get back to my full, whole life as I knew it which was vibrant, active, tons of energy (and no coffee ever :)... with thalassemia, that's the Holy Spirit :) and my blood line) but I started to hear God say other things to me like, maybe for your good, you aren't supposed to get back to the old you..And that's exactly what is going on. However, in the interim, as I continue healing the body very intentionally (HBOT, Ozone, etc), I am healing in deeper intangible ways that were unintentional, and I never stop teaching others what I'm learning as I learn (that there are cures, treatments, help and hope...outside the mainsteam, so that is one of my purposes and it's been helping a lot of people. So, while I'm sorry to hear what happened to you, doing something outside the self is going to be the most rewarding and purposeful thing you can do. Sure, pottery is great! However, maybe make something and gift if to some one lonely ""lost at sea"" (I get it! Truuuust me), in that prison. Ask the best",1년 전,1,

@TheGreatExperimentofLove,"I'm 30 and have let depression take away much of my life and purpose. But I'd just like to leave a note of encouragement for those who have faltered like me:   I would say that even though our positions may be unfortunate, and discouraging; these are opportunities to showcase just exactly what is possible for a person to endure and overcome and defeat. The deeper the hole we are in, the more difficult the task, the greater the opportunity to inspire others by overcoming it and making the absolute best of it. The darker the night, the more beautiful our light will contrast it and defy it. Redemption.   So then I would say, be the inspiration people will look to as to know that anything is possible, and that the human spirit is undefeatable.

I enjoy the Huberman podcast (am a regular listener) and there are always some digressions but this was really disappointing - I expected a much deeper dive into how to find one’s purpose (and the process for how to go about doing this, as stated in the title) and that was not there at all.

@namrathapotharaj9551,"Loved this episode and the topic. At a point in my life where I am seriously exploring what my purpose is and how I can build a life that is authentic to me. Contemplating my purpose at many points in my life, I'm learning a few things: 1) purpose around something is felt and experienced and iterated, and mastery is built gradually - this was a learning for me because I fell into a mental trap at one point, thinking if something is part of my purpose there's essentially very little learning before mastery, 2) internalized beliefs that are not truly mine prevented me from seeing what I really want to pursue, 3) purpose could be a combination of multiple things that are aligned with you, 4) it's a difficult journey when you have not yet built the credibility or mastery around your purpose - but it's worth the feeling of mental clarity and intrinsic motivation derived from it, 5) my life is not linear, and because of things like self-doubt and trauma, I needed to practice a lot of patience and compassion towards myself. Right now I feel really strongly about developing personal health companion technologies as it seems like just the right amount of intellectual challenge and passion towards the natural interests that I have (social justice, psychology, systems-level technologies like AI).

Also, around 1:30:00 with the Gary Cooper reference and embodiment of masculinity portrayed etc., the last few days I’ve been fascinated with the movie Reptile. Without going into a full synopsis here I think what I’m alluding to is the potential for levels of the masculine depending on the situation sometimes, specifically the way he tuned his for the justice element of the story.  Specifically, it’s interesting how he dealt with someone trying to get to his wife, bc his fish were of a higher fryer.

This is my ""suffering"" phase right now - doing shit I don't want to do. I cry. I get pissed. I get frustrated. I throw shit in my apartment BUT I do NOT give up.

@Luke-zv6bb," @krmccarrell  Understanding that the resources you have mean everything when you've got the clear wits about you the sharp understanding of where you are in life, you know the direction you feel you must travel, You've done all the heavy lifting and i'm truly proud of you for that. Identifying the problem is the most difficult or unlikely part of the process, but the first and most critical step in solving any problem, the issue is that our brain is wired to look for problems, when you recall memories your unfelt emotions will resurface in your short term memory, the brains screen so to speak. You have to turn to the family members you don't wish to tell the truth to and say what you are so afraid to say, what your child self did not feel safe to do, you are an adult now and you can speak the truth and experience fear not as the identification of danger but as a grateful mechanism we have to understand the roadsigns at the corner of danger and safety, the awareness that you are afraid, and the feeling, is good because it means you know what you are afraid of, it means you know which way you are afraid of and know you can begin to accurately assess which risks you know you should take and sometimes asking for help feels like it's gonna hurt you because the way that you've organized everything in your head from when you were a child on that fast learning curve was to stay silent because you were vulnerable, the brave thing now might be knocking on a neighbors door and asking: ""can i tell you my story"" calling your children and asking them to listen, calling any parents you have and telling them what happened, honestly, i'm gonna be real about I think calling the police would allow you to put the people who hurt you in prison, and i know it sounds dramatic or like an oversell of what happened to you but all of the people who abused you belong in prison and an abuser that moves on continues to offend in other places. If you do not feel safe, you need to shift towards safety, when you don't know which way safe is because fear is too loud, like people with pain disorders who feel pain that doesn't help them identify pain some of your fear doesn't help you identify danger anymore, what's important from here is going to banks, going to doctors going to therapists going to physios speaking to experts who you can trust institutionally, reach out to AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU NEED TO FEEL SAFE, ask the woman walking down your block for her number, find the nearest theater, connect with your local library, call people call people call people right? If you feel comfortable you can check in here and let me know how you are doing and if you were able to put your abuser in prison, You can feel guilt that's okay, But that guilt is his for abusing you, and we no longer make deals with terrorists, therer's no deal you need to make and you can take care of yourself, you can say goodbye to everyone you love and be okay, you can live solo, and be alright you can have your freedom you are protected in our constitution, this is where you form connections. You can share the music you like with ANYONE and it is always a treat, impose your SELF on other people, show them who you are and CRY cry your eyes out because of the circumstance and use your experiences to bond with others in a healthy way, it's important that you form really strong connections and establish trust with as many people as possible, talking laughing crying, angry, tired, hunger, sadness, sit with people and talk, you have always been in side of you",1년 전,0,

Are you able to still keep fighting when you have nothing the world tells you that you should have? Do you still consider yourself valuable even though the world tells you you’re nothing? To find value in the “ugly” things of life; aging, loss, trials, suffering…To be content in all circumstances regardless of the pain, loss, regret… That is true spirituality.

@lolab1643,"I find the term ‘broken homes’ incredibly old fashioned and extremely offensive to those single parents who make the decision to raise their children alone for a variety of valid and responsible reasons. There are millions of adults from one parent families all over the world who are perfectly well balanced, happy and thriving human beings.  People ask themselves ‘who am I?’ regardless of their background, race, orientation or how many parents they have and those who continue to use this outdated term are sadly continuing and enforcing a stigma attached to children/adults from one parent families - implying they are somehow the weaker, less privileged of society.   Many parents who stay together despite having various serious issues raise dysfunctional, emotionally retarded and unhappy children and do more harm to them than making the brave decision to break up and spare their kids years of more misery which inevitably will develop into emotional instability/mental health problems as adults.   Yet do we attach the same debilitating label to them? No.",11개월 전,2,

That does not mean there is 'life after death'  but it does not mean that just some stuff on youtube is all fact and it s irresponsible to the future of humanity to not ask questions or especially ALLOW  questions  -  but most people who follow such stuff are scared to ask them or shout down those that do ask normal objective questions,  which is a disgraceful and unhealthy attitude to the whole top-ic in which nothing will progress or be understood,  whatsoever the case.

He apparently bought into the collective conjecture that it would ruin his reputation and career. Talk about collegial fear and projection!",1년 전,0,

@catsaresocute650,"Well that's ignoring a lot of feminist critic. It's not power if woman can among a very limited degree of freedom make the choice to have a relationsip with some men. It's just making the best of the little available options. That's very different from power.  Power is being able to not say you don't need a relationsip at all in any way, but being able to have one, one that you can leave the second you feel like it's against your bounderies. That's the good type of power (the ability to enshure ones own agency).  The differnce is the system at that time was set up to benefit men, I mean even today there's remnants of it, but it was set up so womans only choices wear to have relationships with men. By that very nature, no woman in any relationship could possibly have any power. That's still so when people say things like pretty privilege. For example for a waitress, who customers flirt with. She dosn't use  some power, because she can't reject them. She can't tell them shut up and leave me alome immidiatly. She has to at least polity refuse, what's already something people feel is a violation of bounderies because what you might really want to do is tell them to fuck of in a rude way. There might be a benefit, like a larger tip...but in the end that's just like a reward for having complied with the (patrical for that matter) social standart, where men get to express that woman are attractive and get to expect that woman don't tell them an honest awnser on all the things they think and feel about men.

I wish to note two points:  (1) The sm crowd is not representative of the population; they are a subgroup; and  (2) Those with some degree of career autonomy &/or financial security (i.e. Andrew's guests) assume that others are more concerned with self-actualization than they actually are. I would venture to say many more people are just trying to stay on the center of the treadmill, and maybe muster the power to get to the front of it.   Because people with a public persona tend to communicate to masses/followers on sm, they seem to lose sight of the (lack of) importance of sm in the lives of others.

I liked this episode quite a bit, but one thought: as grand as romantic love is, I do question whether it’s fair to claim it to be the epitome of what love can be. I wonder if, rather, the more dopaminergic events you combine the more intense the experience; with romantic love it could be an orgasm, touch, and laughter etc. There are some live performances I’ve enjoyed more than sexual experiences, and laughing while creating art and playing or dancing that have been nearly if not fully ecstatic experiences. Those who choose celibacy might find parallel delight and ecstasy in art and community or being engaged in “the flow” etc, and there’s nothing wrong with a little self lovin’ either.

@lisinbondi1240,"this is super interesting but I do have 3 areas where I would like to see a bit more science and a bit less opinion: 1. music taste or overlap is honestly irrelevant in a respectful relationship - my husband and I have an excellent 30 year long and counting, relationship that has extremely minor overlap of music taste. We don't impose our taste on each other and we don't need the other person to validate us by liking what we like( or pretending to do so). Where we meet is in our values and that is the most basic thing - as Dr Conti told us so well and clearly. PS my first husband and I had stongly overlapping music taste, but not values it turned out.  2. the non verbal communication 'reading ' of people is deeply flawed and we need to be careful. As your esteemed guest Dr Feldman Barrett pointed out, if you don't know the person and  therefore cannot use the existing data to effectively engage the pattern recognition engine that is the brain, you have alot of chance of just being massively wrong. Build the data before you make judgements - the brain is extremely good at taking shortcuts and those shortcuts are not necessarily beneficial (Robert Cialdini - Influence -  provides great examples of the good and bad sides of this) If someone doesn't immediately look delighted to see you maybe they were thinking about their sick mother before they switch on their 'game face' - the examples provided were deeply flawed  3. AI - for heavens sake - can we pull this out of the narrow focus of chatGPT esque, 2001 Hal opinion. AI is a massive positive tool for predictive maintenance, supply chain efficiency, massively improving efficiency and effective use of large data sets for incredibly improved outcomes -  like diagnosing breast cancer, for example.

@Givingmoon,"I would like to THANK YOU BOTH Robert & Andrew for creating this harmonious discussion. Watching this podcast has been the most internally satisfactory experience I have had in what feel like FOREVER!! There are SO many threads to follow and explore here,  so I’ll kindly pull just one of them to share with you both as a HUGE & humble gesture of gratitude for all the courageous work you both do.  So. .  . I suffered a very severe TBI last April, which is how I came upon hubermanlabs (a desperate attempt to understand what I was experiencing and why there was such a serious lack supports & treatment options available!)  . . ..which btw this entire episode is extremely relevant to in a number of ways, both for the information that was provided but also for the information that was NOT provided. That said, I realize that the psychological dynamics within our precious nature of the human experience is SO very subjective & way too vast for one single discussion however, I would have LOVED to have heard “more” surrounding how people with diminished capacities or limited abilities can work towards navigating these social dynamics. (While still gracious for the touch downs that were provided) I only offer that feedback because of the absolutely eloquent delivery of information provided here. I sincerely hope that Mr.Greene comes back for another flawless journey when his new book is released!    OKAY! Onto the “‘thread”🤪 I very much enjoyed the definition that was discussed on the feeling of “‘sublime”. I think that is most likely the main concept that enabled me to really grasp onto the perspectives being provided and understand them in relation to my own experiences and position, (which I have to say was exhilarating; it’s likely been over 6 months since I've experienced that kind of cognitive functioning) The definition of what & where sublime is allowed me to locate and then understand the feelings of what it is exactly like to suffer with TBI. I can confidently say that living with TBI is literally like being pushed out of the ⭕ inherent subliminal zone and no one is throwing you a life saver or lending a hand or igniting a flare for you to find your way back OR even just shouting words of encouragement for that matter. I haven’t come to understand the exact mechanics of this yet, whether it’s lack of knowledge, money or respect BUT I have to say that the huberman lab has been a VERY BRIGHT LIGHT!  . . . .and it’s extremely comforting to know the general direction in which I’m supposed to be going . . to said zone!!  SO AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH! (first time sharing more then a thumb or a reduction of opinion, so I hope that it is useful to you, at least in some small way or form.) 🙏🏻  P.S. I do have a number of ideas for topics and research if you are interested in hearing them?    P.P.S. My favourite word from this episode is for sure “ visceral” especially when it comes to the nature of TBI and social acceptance. Ive found myself trying to accept my loss of identity/purpose and know thy “new” self in the best way that I can but it truly is a deeply rooted and basic NEED to be a part of the whole!  Despite any self guided ownership of existing outside that whole, it is still very much like a splinter in your entire being  . .  ..and everyone knows splinters suck!! 🙊  Thanks also to whoever takes the time to read what I have shared as well.  That is all. . . .   . .🥹",1년 전,0,

@paul_devos,"Most of my youth and most of my life I've enjoyed organizing information. I had over 80 notebooks, fully written in by age 15. Mostly journaling, wisdom, Bible verses, mathematics, and sports statistics (I took by hand stats from my Tecmo Football and Baseball games).   This is very much like CS Lewis' thoughts that you need to find the things you enjoyed as a child. He credits this with his writing which led to the Chronicles of Narnia.   “Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”",1년 전,0,

I didn’t pay a lot of attention in school because I was a bad kid and teachers told me I was going to be in prison anyway so I didn’t see the point. Now I just finished my first semester of college majoring in computer science and I have straight A’s and feel better about myself. This is the episode I needed, switching your lifestyle completely kind of put me in an out of body situation and I’ve really been struggling with dissociation and depression and just finding meaning in life, but this episode really gave me a sense of drive and a feeling that I can do whatever I fully engage in.

@warrenholt,"Dear Andrew, thank you for the excellent episode.  I think Robert Greene is truly insightful.  I do ask that you clear up the false claim that Sigmund Freud had sexual relations with his patients.  This misinformation likely comes from a rumor started by Wilhelm Reich, a disgraced rival psychoanalytic theorist. Not only did Freud never have sex with any of his patients, he wrote a paper called ""Observations on Transference-Love"" in which he warns clinicians of the perils of getting involved in erotic relationships with patients.  As a psychoanalyst, I believe an ethical adherence to physical abstinence is absolutely essential to our practice.  Please consider having a psychoanalyst on your show.   Covering topics such as how mind relates to brain, the convergence of psychoanalytic and neurological theories of dreams, and how psychoanalytic discourse relates to the objective sciences would would be truly engaging.",1년 전,0,

But I dont get how this is linked to being male. Why shouldnt women also strive to be like this, respectively would women be masculine by being like this? I dont think so. The same applies to Mr Greenes statments aboult femininty: being sucessful, achieving big goals etc. isnt linked to being female either in my opinion. I dont think these attributes should or need to be linked to gender. Its more aboult being a good human being as such, independent of gender.",1년 전,0,

@DigitalNetworkInsights,"That’s great one day you decided to learn and thus changed your life through critical thinking and asking questions. That’s what hat I’m wearing lately; what’s out there that I can learn.  Can I offer some information about your college endeavor? Mindset is a good understanding of what college and universities are all about, think of it as a race, but not just any race you want to win, and graduate too, but a marathon race. A marathon is a longer ran race more in depth and you need endurance to win. As you are comporting and competing to earn your achievements and meet your goals my mindset was in and nothing was going to take me off track. Not my full time job as a father of three and husband, and little league baseball coach, youth basketball coach and sometimes working 12 hour days for work and then eating dinner and then studying in anyplace I needed to. I studied at a local Panera bread company restaurant that had great food, jazz music, study area, pleasant restaurant environment to study around business locals who had to take lunch even in weekends lots of people. I had some work off time based on my career being involved with the weather catastrophes and seasons of weather. Still though I did online learning from 2008-2013. Finished with a 3.72GPA BSBA w/ Concentration in Project Management. It took me a long time before I transferred from blue collar skilled labor work hands on toward and into a new desk job earning using software and hardware but not banging on steal and working on vehicles. It will all work out for you as you continue to write your studies and write out your career plans towards what you are connecting to emotionally as he just said as I was typing.

@jessicagibson850,"Love your podcasts! Seriously such a big fan but... (obviously that was coming) I would say that becoming a mother, and by that I mean the larger transformation of Matrescence, to have been a much larger, more dramatic, more complete and less understood change than puberty or adolescence. The parallels between the two transitions are striking at the very least. I would say that Matrescence is harder in part because it is less acknowledged, less understood and at the same time very sudden, it happens when you don't have time for it. I would be interested in hearing more about how a woman's brain, hormones, perception of self all shift after permanency and birth.  Thank you for your podcasts. I've found so much inspiration and support for my own pursuit of more understanding, purpose and fulfillment in life. Forever grateful to Armchair Expert for the introduction.",1년 전,2,

@starship3812,3:05:30 I had this feeling of do or die. I literally hadn't studied anything and studied very little even I try to study and 3 days ago before my chemistry exam of 12th standard. I had 7 chapters or so remaining and I just completed 1 chapter in 1 days and then I have 2 days and 6 chapters remaining and then i can quite and gets very low marks or then death ground situation starts with me 6 chapters in 2 days suddenly I started new innovative ways of studying from different sources and counting every minutes what I had to do in next hour so and any activity beside studying if takes 5 minutes I complete that in 1 minute or so. If bathing in those 2 days take 10 minutes I try to complete that in 5 minutes or so I was doing every activity with full focus so that I can save from each activity and use that time in studying. that was a death ground I can't even sleep due to stress but I had to force me with focus to fall sleep so that I can learn and perform better next day and I did that.  But still now it is very hard to create death ground of that level even I had more important exams and things to do.,1년 전(수정됨),0,

@angelinaaahhh,"This was an excellent episode @RobertGreeneOfficial & @HubermanLab  and I enjoyed watching this while running the beach yesterday on a run. The discussion regarding mastery, human nature and behavior was so thought provoking and I have to agree with  Robert Greene regarding the sublime. I have achieved sublime state when I have meditated and also while running and receiving EMDR treatment. It’s a next level kind of calmness. Joe Dispenza once verbalized the feeling for me and I’ll paraphrase it as best as I can: but the brain has different wavelengths/frequencies (alpha/gamma, beta and theta) and the human has a unique and individual experience (bear with me 🤓🍪☺️)…  Internally 🤓💭[mental/thoughts/wired behavior patterns/subconscious programming], externally 🍪 [the conditions/everything in the external environment/people/places/things that control or do/not control our behavior or thoughts] & spiritually ☺️ [connection with something greater than oneself/a higher power/source energy/people/mentors/teachers/healers]  that drives us… or gives us purpose… and essentially when we find purpose we get to the Sublime or theta brain wave state… where it is just bliss and nothing exists but the present moment…  But yeah that was just my take away after listening good stuff 👏",1년 전,0,

I listened to the podcast Ten Percent Happier, which he appears on. As you probably already know he has done a lot of research about Anxiety and habits, so in this podcast, the interviewer asked him, if it was important to know the Why, the reason behind the habits, and he said that it was not that important as the habit itself. I think it would be really interesting to listen a conversation between you and him, specially after this episode, in which Dr Conti, on the other hand, highlights the importance of the why and the exploration of the self.

History has always been the subject I have felt a deep connection to since childhood, and I’ve always had a strong urge to teach it. At 27 I took the plunge and began my history degree. I am now in my final year at 31. I should graduate in summer. I also just started work experience in a secondary school just before Christmas and I loved it. I’m so excited for the future. I’m not going to lie it has been very difficult at times, a lot of sacrifices have been made, and doubt has never been too far away. However, now I’m reaching the end of my degree, I believe it has all been worth it. I just thought I’d reach out to let you know it is possible to totally change direction if you’re willing to sacrifice and put in a lot of work. There’s no need to feel stuck at 26. There’s plenty of time to change direction. If you haven’t already, I’d recommend reading ‘Mastery’ if your in the process of introspection. I’m about half way through and the book has already resonated with me. I hope this is of some reassurance. Best of luck going forward.",1년 전,2,

@GBmain,"38 here. For the past nine years, I’ve carried a deep sense of dread, feeling like I’ve wasted my life without making real progress, despite a genuine desire for change. This feeling has been with me since my mid-20s to some extent. It sounds cliché, but it truly is never too late to make a change. What worked for me was setting aside just 25 minutes each day to focus on a new skill I was passionate about.   Whether it's a career shift or a hobby-- the key is committing fully, even if it’s just 15 minutes of focused effort. The momentum builds when you can see the progress (no matter how small), and that drives you forward (it pulls you, it doesn't take long for the 25 minutes to go from work to enjoyment, The small obstacles become easier to overcome, and eventually, it feels almost effortless. You couldn't stop, even if you wanted to (and i'm not someone that has an easy time focusing, i'm not particularly intelligent or conciousencitous, it take me time to learn a new concept but it really does get considerably easier the more you do it, it's kind of amazing.  Start small and structured, then refine as you go. Set short-term goals—really short term. For example, watch the first five minutes of a course you're interested in, jot down your thoughts, and check it off your list. Then, set a reminder for tomorrow to start the first exercise. But it’s crucial to remember that watching a video isn’t the same as applying what you’re learning. The real progress comes when you use the material in a small project—it sticks better that way. YouTube is fine for sparking ideas, but use it sparingly.  Just as important, don’t be too hard on yourself. Focus on consistent, intentional progress. Over time, it will feel more natural. If you drift off course or spend a week heading in the wrong direction, take a moment to realign with what matters. And don’t think of ‘goals’ as distant trophies—your goal today is simply to focus on the one thing that helps you spend more time on what you're passionate about. Keep it simple and consistent, and accept that you’ll get off track sometimes. When that happens, gently guide yourself back.  Also, I think you should pick up Marcus Aurelius' Meditations it's like my bible, when i'm caught up in trivial matters or lifes stresses it realigns my thoughts with what's important. You don’t need to read it cover to cover. Just flip to a random page, read a passage or two, and I think you'll find it helps you focus on what truly matters to you...  wish I could convey it more clearly but that's some of what I noticed when I slowed down and really focused on one task at a time. and just to add, i'm not very intelligent, it takes me more time than most to learn a new skill or concept but it gets so much easier in a very short time, there's always the next point of stagnation but even those get easier or you can deal with them better and you're not as demoralised when you don't get something straight away. It's stuff I heard when I was young, everyone said it and I thought I was listening and understanding but I certainly didn't apply it",11개월 전(수정됨),0,

@giosasso,"This was a great conversation. This is precisely what many  people are struggling with.  Personally, i think human civilization, as we know it, will never return. As Mr. Huberman said, modern technology has hijacked our reward system and it has altered our definition of ""normal.""  It's very difficult to connect with people emotionally. I am not claiming it's impossible but it's near impossible.  It's quite sad. There are a lot of layers to our changing humanity. With AI on the verge of completely scrambling everything we've ever know to be true, dependable and lucrative, we are standing at a precipice. Some know this but the majority have no idea what is about to happen.  There is no pollyanna outlook. Too many people are struggling just to pay rent, figure out how to make a living, etc.   If you are wealthy, you are disconnected from the deep panic washing over millions of people. When life is always about just getting by, people begin to ask : ""What's the point in working hard when there's no end in sight?""  History teaches us that all great civilizations fall. Our flaw has been that we regard ourselves to be too intelligent to make the mistakes of our dumb ancestors. Our hubris blinds us to our inevitable demise.   We live in a world where toxic positivity is rewarded and admired. Few people want to hear the truth, and when they hear it, they dismiss it or ignore it.  This time, we can't go back.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

This is unique because most Hollywood and whoever don’t give a fuck and they just put it out there. I clicked on his father and he’s an Argentinian Jew. Again, unlike Donald Trump I could definitely say no dispersions against any race.

@mariag-nq8zl,"So I'm half way through this and TWO key points I agree hugely on is: 1. Being vulnerable - reason being I am an intelligent woman and yet, I have been transgressed by domestic, sexual and emotional abuse. And then I met the love of my life and then, just six months ago, he took his own life. And then yet, I allowed myself to be vulnerable again and now am with a man who I am in equality with, completely safe and we are open about EVERYTHING and that has made us both more at peace, not looking to power plays and joyful than I ever could have imagined six months ago.  2. The art of ignoring - as mentioned, my wonderful husband took his life, but a big part of it was that every day, he would be so upset and angry about the injustices in the world. That, on that final night, he continued to tell me that the world was too much and that he wanted to fix it all, which I of course outlined was a fantasy and sadly not possible for him or any one person to undertake or be responsible for, and explained that he needed to just keep being the good in the world that keeps society going in an upward trajectory.   Sadly, people spend a lot of time subscribing to the ""news"" as it's all too readily available these days. I personally don't understand the reason why. I keep out of everyone's business generally, and I think I can attribute that to my positive outlook on life. Don't get me wrong, when my husband died, I wanted to aswell and almost did but then I allowed myself to be taken under a good man's wing, and here I am six months later, with a trip to Iceland booked for January (wish ne luck on that one) and the new man moving into my house. Yeah, I've had the same reservations flash across my mind that anyone in my circumstances would, but life is just too precious to allow that ego side in. Show up, honest, vulnerable, and with integrity, and the world will open up to you and give you a pure loving abundance. It's been a wild ride so far, and I'm only 34. Keep going.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

I would disagree with you and say that both of them have/will alter how we view arriving at the destination/answer. If you have to walk 3 miles to the nearest restaurant, your relationship will change to arriving at that restaurant once you get a car and can drive that distance in a fraction of the time.

@jamiedallasrealestate,"Andrew, thank you so much for all that you do! Neuroscience and understanding human behavior is a hobby of mine that consistently fascinates. Your work has been instrumental in advancing mine, and has helped me personally. I'm so grateful to you. I hope some day that we can meet and discuss the magnificent brain. In listening to you and Robert discuss his near death experience and what he was feeling at that moment, it brought up a question that has been nagging me for years, and that has left me completely bewildered. My Mother passed 3 years ago from lung disease that she got from house mold. She was an athlete, had never smoked once. She had been on oxygen for the last year of her life, and the last couple months was seeing a lot of hallucinations. The last week before she passed she had gone unconscious for 24 hours. Her vitals were all good, but she was not conscious. Hospice had told us to come say our goodbyes that day, that it was likely the end. But it wasn't. She woke up. Even in the massively declining mental state that she had been in for months, she remembered being unconscious those 24 hours, which blew my mind. She functioned normally the next few days and then she went into this unconscious state again. It was also about a 24 hour time period, and again, her vitals were all normal she was just completely unresponsive. It was about midnight and she had been unconscious that whole day, and the night before. Her caregiver, Sabastian (she was in an assisted living private home down the street from my home) was in her room straightening things with his back to her in the bed. She had called him Gary for the duration of her stay there because that was her boyfriend's name, and she could never remember Sabastian's name. In this moment, with his back to her, she awoke from her 24 hour unconscious state and said ""Sabastian, I'm leaving now."" He spun around to find her pointing out the window up towards the sky and looking up in the same direction. He said that she said something he couldn't make out, said my name and my brother's name, took 2 breathes and was gone. Being long time caregivers, he and his wife had lost numerous residents over the years, but neither had ever experienced anything like this. I arrived about 20 minutes after her passing, and Sabastian was still sobbing, completely shaken from how she had gone. I walked into her room to find her as he had described, her head turned, eyes still open, looking out the window up towards the dark sky. They had brought her hand back down to her side, preparing for Hospice to do a final check of vitals. My Dad and I have lovingly joked, that, ""of course Mom went out this way."" (She was a very controlling, disciplined individual, who needed things to be done her way.) But for anyone that has heard this story, it has absolutely blown their mind as well. I would love to know your thoughts, and @RobertGreeneOfficial as well. How could she have known she was going at that moment exactly? And how could she have remembered Sabastian's name? With the extreme lack of oxygen, how could her brain have had that kind of clarity? I've had a near death experience myself, that I survived and others didn't. It was a moment of enormous peace and clarity for me, even in the midst of such destruction. And immediately after I was forced to meditate for nearly an hour, laying on a mountain highway, blood pumping out of me, while my body shook uncontrollably trying to go into shock, as we all waited for paramedics to find us. I was able to keep myself conscious and focused, and alive. So I can truly understand how miraculous the brain can be, even at that level of trauma. But I wasn't lacking any oxygen. I had great health and full faculties going in, and meditation experience. My Mother had barely been able to carry on a conversation months prior. She was quite incoherent months leading up to her passing, and very childlike. She had always been a woman of high intelligence with a pretty incredible vocabulary. I'm sorry for the long post, but it seemed like an appropriate time and platform. I truly would love to hear any of your feedback to give me some sort of idea of what she could've been feeling, thinking, etc. Again, thank you for all that you are doing with your podcasts.

There was just this sudden sensation that I liken to a pressure drop in my head and the realization that something was very, very, deeply wrong.   My sense of proportion got a little wonky and it was like a part of my fovea wasnt getting any signal and just started making shit up. Took me a minute to realize it was a blind spot and was bordered by a flashing zig-zag that slowly moved towards my peripheral vision.   Got out to my car and called my mom and she said it sounded like a migraine and i picked up some meds for that and woke up the next day with a brutal headache and went to work after slamming some coffee and ibuprofen.   The day after that, same thing happened, but that time I went numb in my arm and face and went to do a tongue check and within 24 hours I was told I had a dissected carotid artery. At 31.   I'm fully healed now, even if that artery is sealed at the base of my skull, so don't worry about me. Instead go watch something on stroke awareness and spend some serious time committing it to memory, because when it happens you need to be in go-mode at the drop.  This one is always a crowd pleaser.

@brain_respect_and_freedom,"Even if we have a great idea it's challenging to explain  to someone 's for example the first book your guest  ""The 48 Laws of Power"" the book has also stirred controversy, as some readers criticize Greene for promoting manipulative and deceptive ways of achieving success. According to Greene, however, manipulation and deception are an inevitable part of human nature, and understanding that is an important step on the ladder of success. “Understand: people will constantly attack you in life. One of their main weapons will be to instill in you doubts about yourself – your worth, your abilities, your potential. They will often disguise this as their objective opinion, but invariably it has a political purpose – they want to keep you down.” Robert Greene, The 50th Law",1년 전,1,

Run through and consider them again - they are not intrinsically ‘masculine.’ Casting them as such is probably not the best thing for girls or women…..stereotypes of how women should be and traditional roles they are supposed to assume are exactly what keep many women from being able to pursue their true purposes. Having a vast array of choice is not a bad thing - we want 1000 different choices.

@EricWenders,"I've read and enjoyed Greene's work and because of your podcast I also bought and read Paul Conti's book Trauma and got a lot out of that too. But in your discussion with Conti you emphasised it had been important to you to find someone like him because he was a mental health practitioner with an iron-clad scientific background, which seems to mean, in this context, a medical one. Now with Greene you're talking to and promoting someone who doesn't have that at all, nor a psychological or psychotherapeutic training, knowledgeable as he is, yet is writing books that pertain to mental health.   I'm not saying you shouldn't, I'm saying doesn't this indicate the value you might get from people who, while not necessarily medically trained, are deeply knowledgeable about and trained in psychotherapeutic practice, an area that, as Conti already indicates, often requires even the medically trained to put aside their more rigid scientism? This is a field that is developing all the time, particularly in the area of so-called 'experiential' therapies like IFS and AEDP. In particular, I've found they offer brilliantly effective approachs achieving the kinds of objectives Greene lays out here around issues such as anxiety and self-knowledge – approaches I genuinely think put almost everything else in the shade and deserve to be far better known.

@nemesiscaym,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  08:58 🌱 Finding one's purpose is a process that involves reconnecting with the unique inclinations and impulses from childhood. 10:47 🤔 As individuals age, external influences (teachers, parents, peers) can drown out their inner voice, making it essential to rediscover childhood passions and inclinations. 13:21 💡 Childhood impulses, or ""impulse voices,"" provide clues to one's natural inclinations, guiding individuals toward their unique life tasks. 16:10 🧠 Emotional engagement with a subject accelerates learning, emphasizing the importance of aligning one's career path with their primal inclinations. 17:21 🚀 Discovering one's life's task brings a sense of direction, acting as an internal radar, and even later in life, it's never too late to embark on this journey of self-discovery. 25:30 🌱 The discussion touches on the role of genetics and environmental influences in shaping interests, and the significance of early positive experiences in fostering a love for learning. 27:22 🛤️ Greene shares his personal journey, highlighting the impact of both positive and negative experiences in shaping his career path. 29:03 ⚖️ The conversation delves into the balance between immediate pleasures and long-term fulfillment, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness in understanding one's true desires. 31:46 🔄 Reflecting on frustration and anxiety as signals, Greene discusses the value of understanding and addressing these emotions to guide life decisions. 35:43 🚪 Greene introduces the concept of the Sublime, describing it as experiences just outside the conventional circle of thought and behavior, with a focus on transcendental moments. 39:47 🌐 The distinction between real and false Sublime is discussed, emphasizing the importance of authentic, transformative experiences over external, fleeting sources of pleasure. 41:21 🕰️ Huberman relates early experiences of delight to the Sublime, highlighting the profound connection, activation state, and sense of purpose that such experiences can generate. 42:03 ⏳ Time perception is briefly touched upon, with an acknowledgment of the subjective nature of time during immersive, Sublime experiences. 43:52 🤔 The discussion shifts to the topic of power and seduction. 46:36 💡 Power is defined as a primitive, primal need for control over one's environment and circumstances. 51:50 🔄 Learning the dynamics of power is essential for personal and social growth, not just for domination. 53:25 🔍 Finding one's place in social hierarchies and aligning with one's strengths contributes to a fulfilling life. 55:46 💖 Seduction is explored as an exchange, involving vulnerability and the act of letting someone into one's psyche. 58:20 🔄 Vulnerability is reframed as a positive trait, essential for intelligence and emotional growth. 01:02:32 🛡️ Confidence plays a role in vulnerability, allowing one to navigate seduction without being detrimentally affected. 01:06:16 📖 Robert Greene discusses the dynamic of powerful men being dominated by seductive women throughout history. 01:08:23 💑 The concept of ""topping from the bottom"" is explored, where both individuals in a romantic exchange may engage in a temporary illusion of power dynamics. 01:09:44 🌌 Robert Greene introduces the idea of the Art of Seduction being invented by women who lacked power in other aspects of life, using sex as a means of control. 01:13:38 🤯 David Anderson's research on separate neural circuits for sexual and nonsexual mounting behaviors challenges conventional notions of power dynamics. 01:16:38 💔 Robert Greene delves into the concept of escaping the ""prison of the ego,"" advocating for vulnerability as a positive dynamic in various aspects of life. 01:20:56 🌐 Concerns about the impact of social media, hookup culture, and pornography on young people's ability to experience deep connections and vulnerability. 01:24:50 📚 The chapter titled ""Escape the Prison of the Ego"" in Robert Greene's upcoming book emphasizes the pleasures and benefits of vulnerability, urging readers to open themselves up to real experiences. 01:27:05 🔄 A hopeful perspective that, despite challenges, the human spirit can lead to a shift away from current closed and divisive tendencies toward more open, communal, and creative periods in history. 01:28:57 🧠 Robert Greene discusses the distraction of modern life, emphasizing the importance of ignoring certain things for mental well-being. 01:31:59 🌍 Greene suggests that individuals can contribute positively by focusing on actionable issues like voting, joining causes, and addressing climate change instead of getting overwhelmed by every injustice. 01:36:05 🚻 Greene touches on the confusion in contemporary times regarding gender roles, emphasizing the need for positive role models to guide individuals in navigating masculinity and femininity. 01:48:15 ⚖️ Greene highlights the challenge of too many choices, advocating for a sense of purpose to act as a filter and guide in decision-making, be it in career choices or daily life. 01:50:18 🤔 Engaging with powerful individuals involves developing social skills through active participation and overcoming fears and anxieties. 01:51:00 📚 Engaging with ideas involves more than just reading; it includes thinking, reflecting, and eventually turning them into one's own through a creative process. 01:57:43 📖 Writing involves continuous improvement, battling self-doubt, and pushing through anxiety to achieve a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. 01:58:24 🤔 Managing anxiety is crucial in various domains of life, including writing a book; breaking down tasks into milestones helps generate enough inertia to move forward. 01:59:34 💑 Convergent interests in a romantic partnership go beyond surface-level preferences, involving deep connections, emotional values, and shared character traits. 02:03:18 💰 Values like money, stability, and character traits are essential in evaluating potential partners for a lasting relationship. 02:05:20 🤝 Emotional connections and shared values are crucial in building a partnership; a sense of mystery and self-awareness contribute to a lasting, fulfilling relationship. 02:11:57 🧠 People who are too obvious and reveal everything at once can become boring in relationships. Intriguing individuals who reveal qualities over time can sustain interest. 02:13:21 🎶 The importance of shared generative drives, such as a desire to create, in relationships transcending specific interests like music preferences. 02:23:50 🤔 Detecting fake smiles and understanding genuine facial expressions, especially in romantic relationships, helps in avoiding toxic connections. 02:25:01 🗣️ Tone of voice is a powerful indicator; genuine emotions, confidence, and seduction can be conveyed through the subtleties of voice. 02:32:26 🤖 Concerns about artificial intelligence (AI), emphasizing the importance of anxiety, self-awareness, and the ability to see a holistic picture in human intelligence. 02:33:37 🧠 Robert Greene discusses holistic thinking and the importance of machines achieving aha moments through anxiety and self-awareness. 02:36:46 🤔 Greene emphasizes the value of facing challenges and thinking harder to develop mental strength and problem-solving skills. 02:38:19 🚗 Greene cautions against the potential negative impact of AI, comparing it to taking a helicopter to the top of Mount Everest without the necessary training and effort. 02:39:03 🔄 The conversation shifts to the potential loss of nuance in online personas and expressions due to technology, and the concern about AI tools operating us instead of us operating the tools. 02:41:34 🧠 The discussion extends to the worship of technology versus appreciating the incredible capabilities of the human brain, highlighting the brain's plasticity and its ability to adapt and learn throughout life. 02:45:40 🩹 Greene shares his personal experience of a stroke in 2018, describing the sensation of dying, visions, and insights into the illusionary nature of the self and reality created by the brain. 02:52:14 🙏 Reflecting on the stroke, Greene expresses gratitude for survival, acknowledges the transformative impact on his perspective, and delves into the fascinating realm of near-death experiences. 02:55:31 🧠 Robert Greene shares insights gained from confronting his own demons after a stroke, emphasizing the importance of patience and appreciating simple pleasures. 03:04:36 🏔️ Greene shares a story of a mountain climber to illustrate how facing death ground can unlock hidden energy and a sense of urgency, emphasizing the power of the human will to live. 03:07:42 🙏 Andrew Huberman expresses gratitude to Robert Greene for the valuable insights and road map he provides, acknowledging the positive impact on his life and the lives of many others.

You seem to contradict this when you talk about, in your episode on tenacity and willpower, how adding a micro sucks at the end of a hard task increases tenacity and willpower.  Perhaps this contradiction lies in the definition of the goal of each of these protocols. For example, perhaps the protocol of making the last section enjoyable is for optimizing continued engagement in that specific task whereas implementing the microsuck builds, tenacity and willpower that can be implemented into other pursuits. But what if I want to optimize for continuing a behavior and building tenacity? I was hoping that maybe you could cover this in the future tool kit for building will power tenacity that you mentioned you plan to make.  If you read through all of that, thank you very much. I’m studying neuroscience in college in part because of you. I’m very curious as to the effect of meditation on willpower tenacity, as well as the associated brain regions. I deeply enjoyed the many connections I’ve been able to make between the school content and your podcast.  Ps. (Not sure which comments you read wether its the only the latest video or not so I posted this comment in 3 places)  Thank you, Asa",1년 전,1,

@iuliabianca2004,"Puberty is the period in which you change the most and have to deal with a whirlwind of emotions and experiences. Naturally, this makes one irritable and somewhat difficult to intreact with. Do you think this could be related to a certain extent to ""finding one's purpose""? And/or could help make puberty more tolerable? Teens, me including during that co flicting period, have raised the question ""who am I?"". Now listening and re-listening to the interview, I think having a better grasp of one's purpose or potential purpose back then could have helped both me and my parents ""tolerate"" puberty better.

I didn't know heavy metal musics are about anti authoritarian but I hear both nonsensically disruptive and sweet sound from them. I also regard people who like classical musics as being intelligent because they have capabilities to appreciate all kinds of sublime spirits expressed well into the musics which those composers are famous for. If anyone can notice Rachmaninoff suffered serious depression from listening and his music meshes with it's miserable plight, I think that person is very intelligent.",1년 전,0,

I do think we all have gifts, abilities and other unique attributes that allow us to be successful at things we have an interest in and an a natural proclivity towards.  My entire life I thought and was told that my purpose is to be a wife and mother. Here I am at 40, single and childless wondering where I went wrong. How did I become someone that was undesirable to men? If that was my purpose and I never fulfilled it, what do I do now? How do I figure out what else I am supposed to do since my first option wasn't it? Each time I ponder this question, I keep circling back to the same conclusion that I should have been a wife and mother and I've just wasted my entire life because it's now too late for that to happen.

Thank you for your work here, Dr. Andrew Huberman. This secretly is the episode, I have been waiting for all this time. 👏",1년 전,57,

@gljohnson,"This was such a great conversation but I do have a thought to add. In regards, to Mr. Greene's comments about young people not wanting the pain that comes from loving someone - therefore, they turn to more porn/hook-ups.  I could not agree more but I think it is the removal of pain that is causing the issue. I am a corporate learning architect and the mother of a 17 year old. My son told me a few years ago that he was one of two kids in his class who had to present a report in front of the class. I questioned him on this and he said all of the other kids had permission (due to anxiety) to not have to talk in front of the class. Around the same time, I started seeing college graduates coming into their first careers, joining my company showing similar concerns and often quitting to avoid certain painful  situations were being put in during their training orientation. So, now my thought - is it really that we have taken pain away from younger people in so many situations that now, even the fear of love it too painful to contemplate?",1년 전,4,

@TheMatchReview,What would you say is the main you learned from the book?,1년 전,3,
@KaleidoscopeMath," @TheMatchReview  I personally enjoyed reading about different types of people with specific historical figures given as examples. However, I believe one of the most interesting topics were the chapters about our dark side and how to learn to work with yourself and not trying to hide your natural impulses, repression leading to more aggression, and the other chapter was related to our feminine and masculine sides, how we have a mix of both and I loved finding examples of female and man behaviour, how we reach conclusions, how we plan and evaluate solutions or completely retract ourselves in the face of specific challenges…  There is a lot of information and the book has a very realistic view of things, nothing is black or white, we are all deeply flawed. It gives examples about how to deal with others and how to deal with yourself which is very important.",1년 전(수정됨),7,

@Hoe_Rogan,"The 48 Laws was a great book for me. I felt lost a lot as a child and I really didn't have time for myself because I was busy translating papers for my family, so we could become citizens, while helping the family work in an under the table mattress business. I didn't really understand how to communicate how I feel or control certain situations until I was well in to my twenties. I was completely immersed and fascinated by structures and vessels of all kinds, but the scared little girl afraid of being deported, (while thinking girls can't do this) and poor took over me (even though at this point we're citizens) and pursued something that would make me certain money instead. I floundered through college because I was genuinely uninterested in what I was trying to pursue, but knew I loved making things. So here I am in my mid/late thirties completely starting over (it feels like). Also, I call finding your purpose ""childlike wonder"". Not to get all down, but my ex was incredibly cruel about it with me whenever I would build forts in the living room so we could have a movie night. He would call me childish, but I thought it would be fun. So anyway, the 48 Laws helped me find my lighthouse essentially.",1년 전(수정됨),18,

Because if - as Christians believe - God is love and the source of everything, it’s a fallacy to say that love between two people is the essence of love and somehow superior to the love of God. It’s not logical. Unless I failed to understand what was said here… 🧐 I’d argue that the love between a man and a woman is reflection of God’s love and happening only because having its roots in Him. ☝️❤️💪😉",1년 전,0,

@dameanvil,"00:00 📘 Finding one's purpose involves understanding childhood inclinations that hinted at unique interests and passions. 08:58 🌟 Discovering your life's task offers direction and purpose, eliminating the feeling of being lost in life. 11:30 🧠 Childhood voices and early inclinations direct individuals towards their dominant forms of intelligence or passion. 15:43 💡 Emotional engagement with a subject accelerates learning significantly compared to detached learning experiences. 17:21 🚀 Finding your life's task provides a framework, guiding decisions and actions, offering a sense of direction amidlife's chaos. 18:41 🌱 Discovering purpose involves narrowing down choices to a unique niche, akin to realizing one's special abilities within a broader landscape of options. 21:26 🎯 Finding purpose is emotional and visceral, felt in the body as a sense of ease and alignment. 22:47 🧠 Different frames of mind exist, from intellectual to kinesthetic, impacting how we experience excitement and passion. 24:49 🧭 Both love and hate inform our purpose; negative experiences can guide us away from paths that don't resonate. 26:12 🚀 Early positive experiences fuel a love for learning; negative experiences can block curiosity and discipline. 27:51 ⚡ Energy and motivation can come from both desire and aversion, guiding us toward or away from our purpose. 30:11 🌟 Paying attention to frustrationor anxiety signals helps redirect life choices towards fulfillment and purpose. 35:43 🚪 The Sublime lies beyond societal constraints; it's an experience that transcends limitations and connects us to something larger. 37:44 🧭 The human brain craves transcendental experiences, seeking the Sublime within to avoid the allure of false, external Sublime experiences. 43:25 ⏰ Deep immersion in activities, like writing, creates a Sublime experience where time becomes immersive and pleasurable. 43:52 🌟 Power isn't just about domination; it's deeply wired in us to have some control over our environment and circumstances, compelling us to seek influence in various relationships. 46:36 💡 Power, in interpersonal relations, involves influencing others for mutual or personal benefit, but it's a complex terrain where direct commands often create resistance. 48:25 🧠 Recognizing the need for power isn't a flaw; it's inherent in everyone, and suppressing it leads to passive actions, hindering control and influence. 51:50 🛡 Understanding power dynamics isn't about manipulation; it's crucial for social interactions, self-protection, and avoiding commonpitfalls in relationships. 53:25 🌐 Discovering your place, professionally and personally, aligns with finding where your strengths benefit yourself and others, avoiding energetically costly pursuits. 55:46 🔍 Seduction isn't purely about trickery; it involves an exchange between individuals, tapping into vulnerabilities to create connections and influence. 56:55 🧬 Seduction traces back to human history's taboo concepts, arousing desire by prohibiting something, triggering contrary impulses. 59:13 📚 Seduction extends beyond the negative connotations; it involves vulnerability, allowing someone into your mental space, and surrendering to the influence of others or ideas. 01:00:39 📖 Vulnerability is not a weakness but a positive trait, fostering emotional and intellectual intelligence, facilitating surrender to another'spower. 01:03:00 🔄 Seduction can be challenging to disengage from due to attachment systems, often leading to difficulties in breaking away despite knowing the negative consequences. 01:04:38 🌹 Seduction tactics aren't gender-exclusive; both men and women utilize various tactics for seduction, sometimes leading to abusive dynamics in relationships. 01:06:16 🌟 Seduction as a power dynamic: Men historically dominated by powerful, siren-like women; enjoying a sensual, pleasing escape from their usual masculine world. 01:08:23 💃 The interplay of sexual and power dynamics: Topping from the bottom - a mutual illusion of power exchange in seductive and romantic relationships. 01:09:44 🎭 The illusion of control in seduction: The weaker-seeming person often leads the dynamic, blurring who truly holds power in the relationship. 01:11:20 🧠 Neurobiological insights into dominance: Separate neural circuits exist for nonsexual physical power and sexual behavior, indicating distinct forms of control. 01:14:19 🧬 Biological roots of love: Robert Greene explores the biological desire for deep connection and the physics of coupling, emphasizing the importance of vulnerability. 01:18:38 🌍 Social context and vulnerability: Concerns about hookup culture, social media, and the impact on vulnerability, advocating for a return to communal, authentic connections. 01:21:23 💡 Embracing vulnerability: Encouraging vulnerability as a positive attribute, leading not just to romantic success but also to creativity and mental energy. 01:26:25 🚀 Path to change: Advocating for a shift from closed-off egos to open vulnerability, hoping for a human spirit resurgence to combat societal disconnect. 01:27:05 🔄 The pendulum effect: Acknowledging societal swings, emphasizing the need to transcend injustices without being overwhelmed by constant exposure toinjustice. 01:28:43 🛑 Overwhelm from social media: Reflecting on the impact of social media's constant exposure to injustice on creativity, purpose, and the capacity for vulnerability and love. 01:28:57 🌍 Knowing when to ignore distractions in modern life, focusing on controllable actions, and understanding the impact of algorithmically designed content on our attention can prevent energy drain. 01:31:59 💡 Addressing injustices involves more than individual efforts; it requires collective action, movement building, and engaging with larger-scale issues like climate change or systemic challenges. 01:33:59 ⚖ The modern understanding of masculine and feminine roles is in flux, leading to confusion, mixed signals, and challenges for young individuals in defining their identities amidst societal expectations. 01:37:53 🌟 True masculinity isn't about stereotypes; it's about resilience, emotional control, inner strength, confidence, and the ability to withstand life's hardships without resorting to insecurity or abusive behaviors. 01:41:05 🛠 Finding mentors or role models involves integrating qualities from various individuals, evolving throughout life, and adapting these influences to create a personalized path rather than conforming to a singular ideal. 01:50:18 🧠 Engaging with knowledge goes beyond just reading; it involves digesting and transforming ideas into your own thoughts. 01:51:26 📚 The difference between dead and alive thinking lies in actively interacting and refining ideas, not just absorbing them. 01:53:47 💡 Anxiety can lead to hasty decisions; embracing it and exploring multiple alternatives enhances thinking and decision-making. 01:56:04 🖋 Embracing anxiety in creative processes leads to continuous refinement, essential for achieving excellence. 01:58:24 📝 Writing a book involves intense self-doubt and constant improvement before achieving a satisfying result. 02:00:03 ❤ Finding convergence in interests and values, beyond superficial aspects, is vital for lasting romantic partnerships. 02:07:54 🤔 Self-awareness is crucial; knowing your values helps avoid mistaking admiration for alignment in relationships. 02:11:30 🕵‍♂ Understanding a partner's character, detecting hidden facets, and embracing mystery sustains long-term interest and depth in relationships. 02:12:12 🤔 Relationships thrive when there's intrigue and a continuous sense of discovery about each other over time. 02:13:07 🎶 Shared interest in life engagement matters more in relationships than shared preferences like music genres. 02:14:58 🎸 Music preferences give insights into a person's character and qualities, reflecting nonverbal cues that can be revealing. 02:17:57 🗣 Nonverbal communication is crucial; we've evolved to understand it deeply, but in today's word-oriented society, we overlook it. 02:19:34 📺 Observing nonverbal cues like body language, tone, and microexpressions can reveal people's true intentions and emotions. 02:23:24 🕵‍♂ Detecting genuine emotions through nonverbal cues, especially sincere smiles, helps in navigating relationships and avoiding toxic individuals. 02:26:11 🔍 Trust your intuition about people; nonverbal cues like tone of voice and body language convey more truth than words. 02:30:31 💬 Interacting in person sharpens nonverbal communication skills, vital for understanding others deeply in a world moving towards virtual encounters. 02:32:40 🤖 Concerns about AI include its potential to lack the depth of human intelligence, especially self-awareness and holistic understanding. 02:34:16 🧠 AI advancements mustn't replace deep thinking; reliance solely on AI might hinder critical thinking development. 02:35:38 📚 A challenging task catalyzed Robert Greene's paradigm shift, emphasizing discipline and deeper understanding. 02:36:46 🏔 The analogy of climbing Mount Everest illustrates the value of the journey over instant solutions provided by AI. 02:39:56 🧠 Concerns arise about AI diminishing emotional expression, reducing language, and limiting emotional nuances.",1년 전,742,

@scottk1525," @Pyrrhonian  "" The last law of power is literally to remain fluid and follow no laws because he shows through the book that many laws can be contradicted and doing it and not doing it can both be advantageous ""  This makes my point perfectly. What you have at the end of any given Green book is an absolute clusterfuck of ideas and strategies that may or may not work for any given person in any given situation, and may even be detrimental to some. With precisely no guidance whatsoever for how to determine which of these strategies are likely to be viable or productive and which are going to be counterproductive for you (even though they worked for Einstein, or Edison, or some random CEO of a tech startup or whoever.)  People feel well informed at the end of a green book, and are tricked into thinking they're now armed to the teeth with effective strategies for success. But they're not. It still takes as much time, effort, and experimentation to sort through this mess of ideas and separate the wheat from the chaff as it would take for somebody to just figure things out on their own in the first place without reading this long-winded book.  Seriously, any given Green book could be 10% the length. But nope, he's gotta prove to everybody how much he knows. We gotta learn Thomas Edison's entire f*cking life story before we can receive the singular pearl of wisdom that perseverance is effective (sometimes. other times, not.)",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@kamilatalavera,"I think the book “The prophet” by Khalil Gibran best describes what Robert is trying to achieve and explain on LOVE ❤️ .  Speak to us of Love.      And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:      When love beckons to you, follow him,      Though his ways are hard and steep.      And when his wings enfold you yield to him,      Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.      And when he speaks to you believe in him,      Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.       For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.      Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,      So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.      Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself      He threshes you to make your naked.      He sifts you to free you from your husks.      He grinds you to whiteness.      He kneads you until you are pliant;      And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast.       All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart.       But if in your heart you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure,      Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshing-floor,      Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.      Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.      Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;      For love is sufficient unto love.       When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”      And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.       Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.      But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:      To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.      To know the pain of too much tenderness.      To be wounded by your own understanding of love;      And to bleed willingly and joyfully.      To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;      To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy;      To return home at eventide with gratitude;      And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.",1년 전,0,

@herahagstoz6934,"The sublime, the liminal, the subaltern; these are all descriptions of the spaces that we cannot occupy in any direct sense but which we all pass through at some point in our lives. Some of us live closer to these spaces than others but the majority of the time we live in the profane or non sacred spaces of our ordinary lives. The more we can recognize our proximity to these moments of passage the better we are able to handle them and also the greater the chances become for inspiration and growth. The idea of killing time is the unconscious feeling between these moments of transcendent experience. I think instead of humans attempting to murder time, perhaps instead we are seeing the process of a toxic mimicking. Those who are lost within any addiction or post trauma behavior that negatively impacts them are essentially attempting to escape the painful and dull profanity of a life which has not allowed them to experience or benefit from these moments. We are both afraid of these experiences and also deeply yearn for them. We use religion or other forms of containment in order to make them less scary and yet in this way we end up caging and taming the essential qualities of wildness, mystery, and we often end up further alienating ourselves from ever passing through these moments consciously. When we learn to accept the fact that there are spaces where transformation becomes possible we are more likely to enjoy life and we feel less insecure about change, whether internal or otherwise. It remains mysterious and uncomfortable however instead of fear or denial we develop our connection with everyone and the compassion necessary for self acceptance and self awareness. From this perspective we can recognize places where growth is possible and the sublime becomes more easy to recognize when it is occurring.",1년 전,0,

@amydavis5174,"Robert, this was my first introduction to you -- and frankly I am sorry that it has taken me this long to find you and the incredible resource that you are.  I have been deeply invested in my own self awareness and personal growth for about 8 years and there are two things you shared that really resonated with me.  One is the drilling down, to stay with and go deeper, into discovery and examination when anxiety or perplexity arises.  I have been doing this on my own for nearly a year....and now I feel I have greater support and wisdom to be gained from your books and podcasts to continue with this drilling down process.   I am also deeply touched by your stroke story.  I am a 31 year breast cancer survivor and the imprint that this experience left on me is still very much with me today.  It is a unique filter that I often use when I face challenges and adversities - or see others grappling with things that really are of little consequence in the grand scheme of things.   I cannot wait to learn more from you.  Thank you for such a rich and inspiring conversation.",1년 전,1,

@smartarsetube,"I didn't think that I'd enjoy your discussion, simply based on the headlines about your book subjects, but listening to the description of your NDE was of great interest. The reason being that I collect stories of people who experience extreme events and provide dates. This last point is important because it then allows me to check an astrological chart for the event - now please hear me out, I know astrology is regarded as pseudoscience, so you may be inclined to stop right here, but I''d urge you to consider the coincidence, and particularly the once in a lifetime rarity, inherent in the transits present when you had your stroke. These transits, of the time of the stroke to your birth date, include Mercury conjunct your natal Uranus, and Uranus conjunct your natal Mercury.  The Mercury conjunction happens once a year, the Uranus conjunction happens once every 80 odd years - you're bright, I'll leave you to work out the implications.",1년 전,0,

But yes sharing .I when I was small had a method where I could find future dreams .. when I was small around 8 years of age.. or 10 years of age. . I will dream and at 4 am dream will become true.. and I was able to do super prediction.. And then I became elder around 18 years. I forgot and lost it but it was still there with me .. so many prediction in dream and it will be real.. Prediction like I will get the date when I Will get a job.. Next dream date when I will lose the job. Belorisic president getting hit by statue..This was 10 years back I had it in dream it said this is how God or creator of universe handles things. . he will be punished for playing with woman's mind.. some great leader and I saw it on my tv and then this is the one real unique one ..  I Saw a dream in which one sort of robot comes in my dream and shows me what's going to happen in next 10 seconds.. and it really happened. I think it was a warning to earth dont provoke God  like science ..too much nonsense in science is not good.. And God who is master smart can easily handle earth.. But worried that thing is gone.. those dreams, etc..Could be my focus is on business. I also saw Jesus coming in dreams..This was when I was small when was faith was super..

@bane349,"Please talk about Dr. Paul Eckman's work on facial expressions and body language. When we feel an emotion it sets off muscular contractions throughout the body that you can try to hide and control but always show up somewhere for a fraction of a second at least. That means when you watch a video and feeling an emotion you are in fact exercising that/those emotion(s).  It also means that an emotion is actually the impact of a stimulus being interpreted by the body through a series of specific muscular contractions.  Each time the body has an electrical signal sent through it, the current basically burns a path from the muscles being used to the brain, with that path becoming bigger wider and easier to follow without using excess energy on focusing where to go, but big paths always pull things to them, so if too much current is introduced it can overwhelm the muscles around it in order to take the big path... and that big path today, my friend, is as you mentioned... it is geared towards evil in all its many faucets.",1년 전,0,

@ramadamming8498,"The thing is,  there are also billions of people who looked at something that sparked imagination and followed,  even became successful - but then ended up on heroin for example or committed crime,  became clinically depressed.  There are a ton of say,  famous rock stars or sports stars who 'lived their dream'  but became abusers of all kinds of things.  So that is an entirely ego centricness maybe fuelled from this invincible idea of ""I live my dream""    -  it is superficial to say ""follow what you want and everything will be ok""   - NO,  it just does not work like that.  The human mind and ourselves is the first thing that needs to be understood and there is far more to it.  I never heard of you but your books if you are a bestseller,  are entirely it seems,  coming from another slant of an American socially conditioned attitude of ""you can do anything you want""  The American Dream ( but little attention to the persons mental state and quality of mind )  - the consequences of this is misunderstandings, haughtiness, demanding and also the American Nightmare,  which you can find in your cities like Philadelphia and numerous other places there.  Then,  there are those that could not care less about 'achievement' in this sense ( which again,  seems entirely a superficial America idea of basically 'find your career'  which is not your life).  It is incredible that people would even need a book to explain to them that, 'do things you like'   -  Shocker !    The facts are,   I presume you are from an upper Hamptons or whatever the posh area is there ?  BILLLIONS of people spend their entire lives just surviving !    There is no luxury of choice when you need to get food on the table every day !   You might barely have time for your hobby.   Most people cannot just turn  their hobby into a job SOME do yes  - but there is system people live under and not everyone in it,  has got the opportunity to just step out of it.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

He studied and shares the story about Mozart as well but suggests that his father was mentoring Mozart to be the great performer and composer rather than something that Mozart was born with or that Mozart was born with curiosity to something (opera composition if I remember correctly) Huberman - I recommend Anders Ericsson learning lessons to be shared through the podcast, very interesting and helpful for anyone who is learning a topic",1년 전,0,

@flurnsdale3929,When I heard you all talking about AI the concept of Mentats in Dune came to mind.A sort of human/computer concept.  We need to enhance the mind probably long term in that direction rather than rely on tech/AI. They have this concept about a in the story there was a war against robots a long time ago and just an extreme situation of not trying to develop your own mind and relying on tech that afterwards they used scientific advancement for that purpose. Wary of the lesson of how computer's can limit us and make us too reliant. Easier said than done of course but I believe culturally we should be keeping that in mind as our general direction on this subject.,1년 전,0,

I hope you continue to heal as you have and know that as you were describing the frustration of dealing with the post stroke physical limitations- I began to think of Stephen Hawking and the physical limitations he too dealt with in ALS while continuing to be one of the world’s most brilliant minds.

@teamhop,"Hey I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future.",1년 전,0,

And so grateful that Robert has survived and recovered from a stroke 💪Another name for visualizing a worse-off life circumstance and thus remembering and appreciating everything around you is a meditation technique called ""negative visualization"". Much success with your research on NDE, Robert. Since we are all on this spiritual journey in human flesh, I also want leave you with the levels of consciousness theory that explains what realm we exist in currently (physical) and conscious, sub-, un- conscious states, and beyond. What's beyond death and what happens to your soul? This theory I'm referring to pertains to the phases above self-actualization in the highest point of Maslow's hierarchy chart. It explains the frequency and vibratory nature of our existence. As you've mentioned, Robert, your brain is so attuned to making sense of visual stimuli but they are all an illusion. Duality, is an illusion. It all comes back to the awareness of our being light beings from one source, but how do we contribute to the evolution of all of us uniquely?

I walked 60 miles a week in the mountains up until 2nd January 2022. I’ve never been better psychologically, which I find interesting.

However, regarding your statement about worshipping the brain, perhaps we should just get down on our hands and knees and worship the God who created our brains, and gave them to us as a gift to help us navigate life.
