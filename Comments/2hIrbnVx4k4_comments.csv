Curry took the 3 pt shot to a different level.  If the NBA introduced a 4 pt shot from maybe 30 ft or 35 ft out, Curry would probably excel at it.  Compare Curry to say Bird and Magic who took BBall to a different level in the early 80's, Nicklaus and later Tiger who took golf to a higher level, Bobby Orr and then Gretzky who took the NHL to a higher level, and say Lombardi and later Bellicheck and Brady who took football to a higher level.

@daviddiaz2007,Curry has done a great job. I believe this has been his best year despite not making playoffs. He shown what it takes to be a 🏆. He really enjoyed himself and made his teammates better. Nobody enjoy the game better than him. His smile is special and if the warriors with have had a better record probably would have won MVP. When you love what u do and do what love. It not a job it's passion . His stature doesn't determine his greatness it's his heart.,4년 전,6,

@luzonrodante704,I just realized how much curry had impacted the nba. Started in nba in 2009 curry revolutionized the game. And as comparison... Curry...after 9yrs in nba got 3 rings Lebron..after 13yrs in nba got 3 rings Kobe...after 14yrs in nba got 5 rings Tim Duncan..after 17yrs in nba got 5 rings Mj...after 14yrs in nba got 6 rings.  Curry's stop of harvesting rings was due to injury. With his leadership and scoring wit combined i believe he is already be considered as a hall of famer.,5년 전,0,

@tannww," @crackpotklass8680  2015 warriors was not stacked u dumbass, and lebum dont got the gravity that curry gets. curry could finish better (not counting dunks), and he got much better handles and similar passing as lebron. lebron gets more assists because his team plays iso a lot, so there's not much passing. curry's warriors pass the ball at least 5 times every possesion not counting fast breaks, so curry could find an open player who could find another open look from another player. lebron's a better scorer, rebounder, defender and obviously a better dunker, while curry's better at shooting, playmaking, finishing (layups), ball handling, and team basketball. lebron's better, but curry could surpass him in a few years.",4년 전,2,
@crackpotklass8680, @tannww  they were clearly,4년 전,0,
@crackpotklass8680," @tannww  the 2015 Warriors had an all star klay and an all star Draymond, an incredible system from Kerr and high was still great and they were super deep, meanwhile the Cavs had Tristan Thompson and Timofee mosgov, clearly one team was far far better yet he won two games anyway, lebron is clearly a better passer I don’t know what ur say8ng, lebron is possibly the best passer in the game and probably top five all time in that category, while curry is a top 12ish passer now Lebron is a much better finisher, as he hits a higher percentage at the rim on much higher volume, (and this is why I think it’s stupid to compare this way, just say lebron is better scorer but curry isn’t too far behind, and lebron is better at every other aspect if the game (curry tho has the ability to play onto ur offense while lebron has to control it )",4년 전,0,
@crackpotklass8680," @dacoreythorns7344  they clearly had a better team... lebron number two that series was Tristan Thompson, and I don’t hate curry he’s probably my third favorite player after lebron and jokic, but he’s not a top 3 player",4년 전,0,

Everyone will call you a basketball genius. Unfortunately for Steph, people remember the bad more than the good.

It's just overkill. They're becoming the peak-Yankees of the NBA. Steph while super over rated at times is also super under rated, no one handles the ball like he does, Lebron has great game sense but Curry does as well and he also has the speed to best him. I just can't wrap my head around how good these plays are.   The sobering truth though is that for every amazing play we see in these videos there are 3 plays where he tried this crazy theatrical shit and fucked up. He is super showy but when he's on, he's fucking on. But as a counter argument to my own counter argument (sorry this is getting super convoluted), he seems to be able to pull this shit off waaay more consistently than any human being should be capable of. With the Globe Trotters it is all planned out ahead of time, the other team isn't trying to win against you, it's all planned ahead of time. Curry is pulling off this shit against live opponents who want nothing more than to stop him from pulling it off. Insanity.",6년 전(수정됨),10,

Before Curry came along I used to marvel when anyone made a basket from half court or further.

Im not a fan of NBA before, but when I saw Curry play way back 2009 I think, that made me want to watch more of the NBA-Stephen Curry game/s. A lot of young kids even those adults in my province in the Philippines adore Curry so much.  I still remember it was only me who watch the NBA game in our place (I watch because of Curry) then kids got to watched him play as well then they became a fan ,a lot of them even adult too. Everytime there's a golden state warriors game, our house is always fully pack with kids and adult watching the game. So much fun though.  Now, I'm here in the usa,  I can only wish I can see him in-person, take photos together and will also definitely ask for autograph. It would be a great bonus if Green and Thompson are there too.

@A-saysitasitis,"Let's get some things out the way first about Stephen Curry:- 1. He is already a hall of famer. 2. Best ball handler. 3. Best passes - nobody has that level of IQ in making passes. 4. Best 3 point shooter in the history of the sport.  Now, the debate: Greatest of All Time?..  The Majority's nominates:- Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant and Lebron James, *Stephen Curry  Some parameters to consider to make the debate a bit more objective- my view:  Personal career achievements:- 1. Number of points scored. 2. Number of MVP awards.  As a team player:- Number of championship rings.  Curry is not the greatest of all time - as at now, he doesn't qualify for the short-list because the other nominees have more rings, and have scored more points. However, he still can qualify because his career is ongoing, and if he keeps playing as he is at the moment, he has a realistic chance of becoming the Greatest of all time - He can score a whole lot of more points and definitely win more rings with the teammates he has. Lebron is a great player in his own right but not getting more rings may take him off this list, objectively speaking.",7년 전,1,

@selassieaspen9940,I'M tired of ignorant ppl! You guy's look at the guy and say he can shoot that's it! some say a Kyrie better! ARE YOU kidding me! If a guy that average the least and plays the least as MVP can put up some big numbers and compare em to a guy that plays 40 or higher minutes! who the do u think plays better? Exactly! the guy with 40 or higher minutes! You guys say that these OLD school legendary are THIS and that! yes they ARE! but you guy's bring down the new players like their nothing! Curry just by focusing I learn something. If the guy's play MORE minutes has MORE athleticism and some times have a second best player! Compared to a guy that average and plays the least min as a MVP! Ok you guy's can overlooked it I Did! but when you think about ever minute you play you can have more advantages then me! Now you look at Steph.... he puts up 176 points in a Week which IS 4 GAMES playing 32min! Compared to MJ who averages 40min or higher and plays back 82 GAMES! let's think..... If u play 40 and play more GAMES who do you think have a better GAMES than a guy who missed his 2 and almost 3rd season! Not to mention he almost average a triple double in the finals! Tristan Thompson who probably played MORE minutes than him AND still loses to Curry in rebounding!?? WTF NOT to mention he has other guys that can play better than him on any given night???,7년 전,0,

If you put MJ in today's NBA he might got schooled and if you put LBJ in 90's NBA he might got schooled. Times change. There is a best player for every generation.

I am a soccer fan and I have to say his game is a reminiscence of Messi playing with ease and with his teammates making it seem otherworldly to watch. If not for Steph i wouldn't have had any interest in watching basketball. Messi is the God of football in the football world and i have to say if not for the physicality and athleticism required in the nba i would have said steph is the God of basketball",7년 전,495,

@cnote181,JR Splash-Smith he isn't a better defender than either of them lol. Has no defensive selections just like curry. Magic better passer for sure but I listed the ways Steph exceeds him. Spacing finishing at rim scoring and playing off ball without being ball dominant. Both of them have the ability to dictate pace as I've said and there's a reason show time and Golden State have the greatest offenses of all time. It's because they are run by the two greatest point guards ever. I already know magic is clear cut number 1 and Steph has a few accolades before he surpasses him.,7년 전,0,
@youngglizzy4732,"C Note yes for sure curry is going to space the floor better because in magic johnsons era it wasnt important it was about inside scoring, magic definitely is better than curry, magic played at a time where the nba had some of its best shot blockers curry may get a few acrobatic layups but thats not his game have to give respect to his work ethic he seems to know where the rim is at all time id still take magic over him even if he cant shoot he will impact the game no point guard would be able to guard him its having 3 big men on the floor but tell me why you think curry and paul are better defenders",7년 전,0,
@cnote181,JR Splash-Smith I don't think curry is a better defender than magic. Theyre both equally ok I guess but cp3 obv the best defender of all 3 since he has so many defensive selections.

Lebron shoots reasonable 3 pointers and makes them. Larry bird, hell he shot so much better than curry that I say Larry bird is the greatest shooter ever.

@frantzellister5715,"I agree. Curry made watching basketball exciting for me again. The last time I was excited about watching basketball was in the 90's when the Bulls, led by Jordan, were creating their dynasty. Curry is without doubt one of the most skilled players to ever play, and definitely the most impactful on the game of basketball since Jordan. (Sorry Lebron James's devotees.) The sad thing is his greatness won't be widely appreciated until he's retired.   Note: Lebron James's devotees are always insecure when Curry's name is brought up, (and thus, lashing out) because in the last 10 years, the only real threat to Lebron's legacy has been Curry (not Durant, not Westbrook, not Leonard, not Harden.) This year's All-Star game was a reflection of the dichotomy that the two represent: Curry -- skill, handles, phenomenal shooting, and LeBron -- athleticism (allegedly by steroid use,) power and dominance. It's David vs Goliath, and quite the microcosm we each deal with. Curry is whom we relate to, in that hard work and the honing of one's skills will produce desired results; Lebron is the ideal, the myth, the one whom we wish we were, in that having his physique and athleticism, and therefore more power, provides us a way of glossing over any insecurity we may have or may face. (Thus, white boys fanboy over him the most.)   Curry is one of the greatest players in the league right now, and I'm sure that when his career's over, or at least nearing its end, he'll be one of the greatest players of all time.",7년 전,6,

Oscar and stockton better than him""  first of all, just because robertson and stockton are already legends doesnt mean that curry is better than them. 2nd, Curry is a champion in his prime and an MVP in his prime, from that alone I can say that stockton is not better than him. Stockton is 0-2 in finals, while Curry is already 2-3 and on pace to win atleast 1-2 more. Big O is already old when he won his chip, and there is where Curry got better than him, and he played in the weakest era ever in history of NBA. So I give you that. Third, Curry holds too many records already, I can say at least 5 records that is hard to beat. Stockton lead the NBA history in total assists and steals, yeah when you're a pass first pg and played with one of the best scorers in NBA history I can see you getting more assists, about his steals he played offball defense greatly but I can say that Curry is good at offball defense also, Oscar held the record for recording a triple double which westbrook did too, and that made it less impressive. It's still impressive but not as impressive as it once was, and westbrook not even in the top 5 pg conversation. Fourth, Curry is the first ever unanimous MVP, and only two point guards won the MVP and championship more than once, Magic and Curry.  Isiah Thomas is ranked higher than him but eventually he'll get the 2nd spot, I could say they are tied, they both are impressive and won championships. If somehow Curry won at least one Finals MVP, he is lock for the 2nd best pg of all time. So you bunch of haters, just stfu and appreciate greatness.",7년 전,1,
@letmegetuhhh3959,Letter A you can't use rings as the defining factor here especially when curry has yet to be the best player on his team in any finals. With the team he had Stockton would have won a ring too. Stockton was unlucky to have to play Jordan and the bulls in 2 of the bulls best years. Curry would have had a hard time there too.  And Stockton was a significantly better passer and defender than curry who's an average on ball defender and above average off ball defender.  The arguement between curry and Stockton is still close,7년 전,0,
@lenirish,"Let Me Get Uhhh What if Jordan never won 6 rings would you call him the goat? What if LeBron never won a ring, would he ever be in goat conversation? No.  Thats the point, the biggest accolade a player can win is winning a championship, Curry was clearly the best player of the championship team before KD came, arguably he's the most impactful player in the NBA right now. ""But he never won finals MVP, and he only won because love and kyrie were injured"" Curry should have won the 2015 finals MVP not iguodala, Just because Iguodala guarded lebron doesn't mean hes the finals MVP, Curry definitely is better that series. Kyrie is injured and thats the reason why he won a championship, same goes with the year later. They had the momentum to close the series 4-1, but what happened? 2 games were lost because Bogut got injured, Bogut was the paint protector, a clear asset on the team, another is draymond got suspended. Cavs got the momentum and won the series, and since then Curry was labeled as choker. But the case is, would I consider rings to be called if you are an all time great? of course. I mean no one would call Jordan the goat if he didnt win a ring, and neither will lebron and kobe.  Yes, i know. Robert Horry won 7, but let's use our common sense. He was clearly a role player on his team. But we can justify it with the players labeled as stars. Derek Fisher won 5 rings he wasnt even in the best pg conversation. The thing is you use your common sense in making an argument. Curry won championships as the star of the team and the clear leader. Championship is a team effort, but a team wil crumble without a good leader.  Some will say ""Curry got Durant, Klay, and Draymond"" Well no shit sherlock. Magic got Kareem and Worthy. Stockton got Malone and Hornacek, Oscar got Kareem, Lebron got Wade, Bosh, Kyrie, Love, Allen. Jordan got Pippen, Rodman and Kukoc. Kobe got Shaq, Pau, Bynum.",7년 전(수정됨),0,
@letmegetuhhh3959,"Letter A how was he the star and clear leader when multiple series he wasn't their best player. Iggy 100% deserved finals MVP, if they won in 2016 it would have went to Draymond and KD got it a year later. Jordan and LeBron were unquestionably the best and most impactful players on any team they've won a ring with. They were elite on both ends and yes they had help but not to the level curry does. If curry doesn't play well they could have won a chip, if LeBron or Jordan didn't play well they had no chance. Curry is blessed to be on by far the best team in basketball so of course he'll get rings. Curry didn't have to play against the bulls and Michael Jordan like Stockton did.  I do think he has a chance to surpass Stockton but I don't believe rings will be the reason why. Put Stockton on the warriors and he win them rings too",7년 전,0,
@lenirish,"Let Me Get Uhhh I ask you, why is it called the best team in the NBA? 2 MVPs played together?",7년 전,0,
@lenirish,"Nobody would call it the best team is Curry wasnt there dude, Do you think Klay can do what Curry does? how about draymond? Look at the box plus minus when hes on and off the court. Youll see how he impacts the team's win",7년 전,0,
@lenirish,"Let Me Get Uhhh and one more thing, Curry will win finals MVP in 2016 not Draymond, Lebron has been outperforming him in their match ups, Curry was balling in the first 4 games",7년 전,0,
@letmegetuhhh3959,Letter A given enough time to adjust they'd still be an elite team. Defensively curry is solid but nothing special and the rest of the team is elite defensively and offensively Klay was able to carry them over the thunder when they were down 3-1. Sure curry makes the team better but take Jordan off the bulls and LeBron off the Cavs and you don't have a team as good as the warriors minus curry. They've played multiple series with curry not playing well and still won.  Last year there wasn't a single team that could contend with the warriors of course they're going to get rings. Imagine if Stockton joined the bulls he'd have rings too.,7년 전,0,
@lenirish,"Let Me Get Uhhh Huh? 1994 bulls, no Jordan, Bulls still made the playoffs with Pippen. Winning 50+ games, impact? Wade won a ring already before LeBron, impact? yea they are impactful but come on! Curry is just as impactful as Them. You can tell the impact with the plus box minus, on and ofd the court. Warriors before KD been losing if Curry goes to the bench.",7년 전,1,
@lenirish,"Let Me Get Uhhh Im not saying that Curry is on Jordan's and Lebron's level, our argument is about him being better than stockton and oscar. I rank him 3rd in pg, all positions I got him at 20",7년 전,0,
@letmegetuhhh3959,Letter A the bulls the year after that 50 win season weren't doing all that well until Jordan came back. And Wade did win in 06 with help from refs but post 06 he was leading some weak teams.  What I'm saying is if Stockton joined the bulls and won a few rings would that have made him a better player than he was? Being on a team that is by far the most loaded team to win rings shouldn't be used as an arguement to determine who's better. Curry is a better shooter and scorer than Stockton but Stockton is a much better defender and playmaker. Curry hasn't yet surpassed Stockton. I think he can by the end of his career but it's a little premature to say it now.,7년 전,0,
