@Youtubemademeaddahandle,"Intelligence is a term used by mankind to recognize those showing a facility to juggle facts and remember them long enough to convey to others how they may correlate. This term is used across all forms of intellectual endeavor. But, it should be recognized as being forever limited to the ability of the one doing the thinking - either to convey or to assess. It is that circular limitation which enforces the futility of anyone to go beyond. Only the real being is capable of transcending.

@dorothyjohnson9151,"My other option of study this summer was to study the Social Sciences of men. I believe that the most underrepresented demographic IS the white male! If ever there was a crisis to divert, it would be the upcoming extinction of the Caucasian male population. I also believe that men are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to having their voices heard. In this era of ""me too"" we are seeing men (primarily white) being discriminated against and no one is doing a thing about it! I cannot for the life of me understand why such a negative connotation as ""toxic masculinity"" has been attached to men. I agree that men today need to reevaluate some of their belief systems. But to assume that ALL men are toxic is just ridiculous! Men today are having their entire culture demolished without ANY type of representation about how to rebuild them selves. Men today need a sense of representation! They need a new way to present themselves. I look at how Eric thinks and believes. All of his values are embedded in his subconscious from a culture passed on from his father. Eric has very abrasive ways of expressing his opinions thanks to the influence of what it means to ""be a man"". So, if ever I wanted to spark enthusiasm and invite the opinions drawn from personal experience, it would be to understand why are men being ""pushed out"". Maybe someday I can approach each of the friends from our generation to gather the pieces of personal  information and experience  left from the most forgotten demographic of our society, the white male.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Society needs change, new knowledge, and revolution that the left brings when order starts to corrupt, and the right needs to step in when the left's new vision for the world spirals into chaos because there isn't an orderly system to keep things stable... I think what he means is there needs to be a change in power every few elections, between the left and right to maintain that balance. You are correct in saying that there was positive change from a change in governance. I believe Jordan Peterson is simply saying freedom of speech is key in all that regardless of who is in power in the government and he will be on the side that enables free speech, regardless of which government is better at management.

@ImGrompy,"This isn't really inconsistent with Christianity at all. It is I think we can make a critical argument that the logos presented is actually a result of Christianity. It is a mystery in what way the Holy Spirit works, but we say God is Truth, and this is the pursuit of Truth. Now there is tons of scripture along the lines of ""Seek me and you shall find me"" or ""you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free"", and God frequently shows he likes to take His time.  If you're going to show Red v Blue politically and not recognize the moral foundation everything is predicated on, you can miss the greater themes. We want Blue Church ideology, does the real world church have a complete understanding of it? No, we ourselves admit divine mysteries. But we are beings which actually like Order so long as that Order is not Tyrannical. Without Order we have Chaos which produces Anxiety, we call that an illness.  What the world Religions have been able to divine about the Nature of reality over who knows how long has to have Merit. If they didn't they would Evaporate. They are literally the foundation of our understanding, and the more we stray from them the closer we get to Hell.  By the nature of Good it prevails over Evil, because it brought Order to Chaos, Darkness doesn't cast out Light, Light casts out Darkness. And a lack of sight physically and spiritually are both Chaos, they're both Hell.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

Try her guru and Muhammad Ali Spirituality Book over 1 million downloaded ...

And Hebrew reference is only 1000 years old. Disregard Koran which 10000s memory by hearts in the time of the prophet and it continues and now over 2 millions remember it by hearts and it us the same written master copies of over 1500 years. Besides Koran though it is 6236 Verses it was revealed over 23 years few at time. Which made it easy to remember and transcribe and spread over 1/4 of earth in the first 100 years of Islam. While were reported another 8266 prophetic statements by 60000 transmitters across 15 centuries... A this shocked the academy universe in Harvard and Oxford..  Enjoy,2년 전,0,

@Elzie-Nou,People villianise JP Because they’re ignorant of just how much he’s thought about the subjects he is talking about  People can’t relate to what they themselves have not experienced in terms of self dialogue and extent of interrogation of external ideas and of ones own ideas and thought processes.   We don’t know what we don’t know-   Also they categorises and catalog things in their minds as isolated and totally stand alone from anything and everything else.   JP doesn’t - he sees and thinks about things in relationship to other things.     The error is truly thinking they themselves know what they think instead of thinking about what they think know.     And secondly if any deeper level of thinking is revealed on JPs part  thus providing a better understanding of the subject - it exposes their initial ignorance which for someone who believes they know what they think- is invested in being knowledgeable and is a source of insecurity so cognitive dissonance kicks in and they dig their heels in further.   The only way to gain knowledge is to approach everything as if you know nothing and be led by the information rather than an idea.   Self important people know only the importance of themselves   Important people know only the importance of everything around them.,2년 전,0,

One of our cultural challenges is that making victims out of us gives resentful, cynical people a kick, and a reason to project their shadow, and I also think the far Left in particular and the Left in general seems to be immersed in a political ideology that requires victims, so that it has the policies to save them. So this has created victims out of everyone who isn't white and male, making them the oppressors. It's sad and dangerous.

I do agree that what the world needs the most these days is certainty, that lay a foundation for clarity. Fundamentally needed to follow , lets call it ""the right path"". One should not overlook fundamental facts, I believe responsible for the situation we are in, in the first place. I.e, with growth and expansion, newer options arise.

@johnbrooke6867,"What I wish people on the Left and Right understood is that the 1% only cares about your leanings as a manipulation tool.  This really isn't a new thing, either, and history is filled with rulers who saw which way the wind was blowing and merely leaned into it and probably did some rebranding.  Pay attention to the economics of any given issue and you can see why certain issues get legislation and other issues are merely there to suck the wind out of all the real issues...like the economy as a whole, YOUR economy, and the economy that the 1% essentially owns.  Pronouns do not cost the 1% a dime.  Gun regulation would, though.  They both serve their purpose in terms of having the masses paying attention to issues take effectively destroy traction on issues that arguably deserve more priority...like living wages, affordable housing, affordable  healthcare, clean water, etc, etc, etc.  This is not to say that some issue aren't important...most issues are connected...but knowing someone's preferred gender should be an issue legislated AFTER all those other things I listed.    The aweseomeness of the internet is that it's the ONLY place that provides a little bit of a home for unfiltered and unscripted content.  That tells you how bad the televised news because pretty much all of the outlets have endless panels of speculators who are experts on topics that don't actually educate anybody.    The media is following the 1%'s orders so you really can't trust CNN, Fox, or even your local news because it's all connected.  The fall out isn't new here, either.  Remember when The Daily Show (with originator Jon Stewart) was getting praised for being more informative than the actual news?  That was like two decades ago, wasn't it?    Anyway, people on both sides need to be careful about blindly following their ""tribe"" and repeating the sound bites crafted by the 1% propaganda machine.  The Machine uses your hatred of Trump and/or Biden as a means of manipulation.  It shouldn't be shocking that old men serve the 1% and that corruption is rampant in both Parties.",2년 전,0,

Dispite all the feminism in reality at the workfloor you barely see the women who do the job using their expertise and they placate to managers managing them. I come across undoable things at work and i can easily see how managers who know nothing about the content of the job take wrong decisions. But i am apalled to see women while beeing higher educated and having experience and beeing experts:  still placating to managers who really arent up for the job. And only if those women stand up: take responsability for their students or in health for their patients: only then we are going to see less burnout in this hiddious toxic situations. It is alwaus the female coworkers that block change at work and women arent known for their solidarity and focus on a common endgoal and fight for that: what toxic femininity means for other women (who do want to level up and take pride and responsability in their job) gossip about your coworker sucking up to the manager and to deal with the hidden consious nagging: go out shopping for a new outfit and say it is men causing the problem.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

They are being exposed, and they’re losing, regardless of what the MSM suggest.  They’re the ones responsible for the absurdity in the first place.  If you really think about it , the common theme is that’s been the narrative is dividing people.  Whether it’s religion, race, sex.  The attempts, and successful ones, has been to cause people to resent each other.  Religion because your god is the wrong god.  Race because your skin colour is inferior to another.  Sex because you’ve been oppressed solely because of being born a woman.  Each person are born with advantages and disadvantages.

People are not that simple, and I know many conservatives who are BOTH open-minded and rigid at the same time - that might sound like a contradiction, but they are usually very open to listening and understanding other points of view, and they also appreciate other cultures, BUT they are rigid only about certain specific ideals that are sacred to them.  So whether they are open or rigid, depends upon the subject at hand.  I am this type of conservative - I’m open-minded when it comes to appreciating different cultures, and I’m also open to listening to differing points of view and trying to understand how other people feel, BUT I am very rigid on matters that are sacred to me, which are mostly my ideological principles of morality.  But Jordan was also wrong when he said that conservatives are always orderly.  I have strong conservative values but I’m very DIS-orderly, if he meant it in the sense of being organized, because I’m very disorganized.",2년 전,0,

@robhulson," @SwissCheese112  I would just say that no one has given me a better picture of the Bible to me than Peterson. I studied it deeply as an Evangelical, but I always felt like the Bible's true worth had eluded me. I memorized many chapters, including the entire books of Titus, James.  And yet somehow Peterson's linking of the Bible to personal experience, and how to receive the Bible without treating it like a secular history textbook, it's brought me back to loving the Bible even more.  So, a lot of time someone will treat Jordan Peterson as if he's someone who doesn't understand the Bible like they do, and yet I look at their lives and it's not filled with anything other than making other cookie cutter followers of their little take on Christianity and the Gospel. Like Peterson is in the foothills of the wisdom of the Bible that they've experienced, and I tried all their lifestyles and much prefer what my life is becoming courtesy of Peterson. Currently, I'll take him over a pastor simply because of how similarly his take on biblical ideas are bearing fruit in my life when practiced, vs. all the Protestant Evangelical American Christian route I grew up with in the Bible Belt.  No offense intended. I've just now wanted to go back to the Bible because I'm starting to find out how true it is when its stories are lived out. My hunch is I'm only starting truly in the foothills of how amazing this book is, even though I struggle with some of its ideas if only because of how deeply engrained the version of Christianity I grew up with sold it to me.",2년 전,0,

Psychology is a scientific study, right, that is not the same as psychology already has all the answers and all of them are simple. Very wrong, pal. And ""feeling"" something is different to scientifically studying a feeling. In no way have I contradicted myself in any way. Why? Because I thought this through and not just babble from the top of my head. Have a good one.",2년 전,1,
@sftcoffe_," @modestoney1577  From what I can tell it seems as though you always want to be right in everything you say. Your ego is too high that you can't let a simple sentence go  as ""I can see it in his eyes that...""  It's funny, and you even point out that you ""studied psychology"". You want to be right in everything you're saying right now, but I haven't said anything illogical, or contradictory.

@modestoney1577," @sftcoffe_  Yeah, it is stupid since I clearly laid out where you contradicted yourself and brought valid arguments why you are wrong. It is not that I want to be right, it is just that you are factually wrong and I have already explained in detail why that is. Sorry, but what else should I do? What do you expect?  That`s the way the world is, some people know more than you, you can either be butthurt about it or you can see it as an opportunity to learn something from it and grow as a person. If you have arguments that prove me wrong, I would be happy to hear them, but there don`t seem to be any.  That`s not my fault and has nothing to do with ego. We just don`t live in a make believe world. The sooner the realisation the better.",2년 전,1,
@sftcoffe_," @modestoney1577  Said by every argumentative person ever. ""you contradicted yourself.""  I never said anything wrong or contradictory. You actually did by saying feeling isn't part of psychology, and it is. Perceiving as well. Psychology is more than what people say. It's how they handle themselves, communicate themselves bodily wise.  Quite frankly you don't even know me to say I'm ignorant. Of course some people know things better than me, and likewise. But really, your argument was about something a woman said. She said, ""One just has to look into this man's eyes to understand the deep knowledge and kindness of heart he posesses.""  ... is stupid, she literally said nothing wrong in that statement. You had to go out of your way and say what JP says, has nothing to do with feeling, or what you see in his eyes. But feeling and connection is part of listening to someone, and sometimes not.  Her stating she sees it in his eyes, that he's kind, is not wrong. Eyes really do show emotion, and deep thought. It doesn't matter if her statement doesn't seem important to you, but it is to her. So leave it be. ""Mr. so called... know it all.""",2년 전(수정됨),1,
@modestoney1577,"​ @sftcoffe_  Funny, you also said I was contradicting myself, even though I wasn`t since I never stated that feelings weren`t investigated by psychology at all, so you you are also one of these ""argumentative persons""? I never said feeling aren`t part of psychological studies. You have to read more carefully if you want to be taken serious in a discussion.  Of course she is wrong, because you cannot see knowledge in someones eyes, that`s just esoterical BS. That`s what people say that don`t even understand JP`s words but follow some sort of personality cult, which just harms the important ideas JP puts forth. No, you cannot tell by someones eyes if his arguments and ideas are valid, to scrutinize them you will have to look at what he says and that alone. If anything you may have an idea if somebody really believes what he says and if he is emotional by looking in his eyes, but that`s the same for everybody, even for people who are wrong. You know how many people looked directly into Hitler`s eyes and were convinced he is such a kindhearted, great person? So much for the value of these kind of judgements. You haven`t understood one word JP says.",2년 전,1,
@sftcoffe_," @modestoney1577  Explain to me what she said that was incorrect? There is no right or wrong to her statement. It's not mathematics where you find an error.  You said, ""Of course she is wrong, because you cannot see knowledge in someones eyes.""  Lets be clear here, she said that in a figure of speech.  You also said,  ""No, you cannot tell by someones eyes if his arguments and ideas are valid, to scrutinize them you will have to look at what he says and that alone.""  Well no shit, you actually believe she meant to just stare into his eyes and not  have a bloody clue what he's saying. The the whole point is to listen, like we do in everyday life. Lastly you said, ""You know how many people looked directly into Hitler`s eyes and were convinced he is such a kindhearted, great person? So much for the value of these kind of judgements. You have'nt understood one word JP says."" Actually it wasn't his eyes, it was his words and the way Hitler expressed himself that drew people towards him. However I would like to note one thing, is that I get six senses or gut feelings around certain people, whether it may be bad or good feelings. And they usually are true. Eyes are the window to the soul, the eye reflects our emotions, our fears, and our deepest emotive shades.  Without a doubt you obviously can see Peterson truly cares for his audience because he sheds actual tears and shows true emotion; I hope. People are usually drawn to those who really care for them, and it's not just his words that lure people in , it's the way he says them. Also I very much understand what JP says. And most things he does say I stand with. Others are a slightly extreme, but not boldly extreme.",2년 전(수정됨),1,
@modestoney1577," @sftcoffe_  You ask me were she was incorrect, and because I already answered it and because it is obvious, you immediately add that this one statement doesn`t count. I mean why ask, when the answer is already given? And no, quote:  ""One just has to look into this man's eyes to understand the deep knowledge and kindness of heart he posesses. You just know without a doubt he is speaking only truth."",  is not a figure of speech, but esoterical BS of the highest kind and exactly what I criticised. It is plain and simply incorrect and false and totally neglects the substance of his ideas and arguments by stating just looking into his eyes is already enough to know. Well, no it is not. And the thought alone is as stupid as dangerous. You cannot separate what makes this man great and important from what he has to say. Not even a little bit. If you do that you are just following the charisma of a person and might as well be following Hitler. The ONLY thing that matters is what a person does and says and if it holds up against rigorous and thorough scrutiny. FULL STOP. BTW, do you think the people who found Hitler so charming were convinced they didn`t have an accurate gut feeling? They also thought they were right about him until suddenly they weren`t anymore. The people I talk about did look Hitler in the eye and most of them were totally in awe of his kindness and were drawn to him. Hardly did one se something suspicious in his eyes, quite the opposite. But they didn`r really listen, they saw what they wanted to see and turned away from everything else. You are a fool and damned to make the same mistakes others made before. You are but a Lemming and would follow the next best person if JP didn`t exist to lift you out of your misery for a short while and make you think you are special. Sadly a lot of people who would otherwise cling on to a cult or random guru, because they are totally lost in live, now cling on to JP and start this cult-like BS.",2년 전,1,

I understood what she meant in her comment, but clearly you didn't. Words have meaning, even if they don't make sense to people like yourself. It was a figure of speech, and a way of expressing how she thinks of Peterson. There is no issue with that at all. What I find funny actually, is how upset you got. You're haughty in the way you comment, it makes me wonder how you are in real life. There was no incorrect word for what she said.

Yes words have meaning, that`s the point. What she specifically said was:  ""One just has to look into this man's eyes to understand the deep knowledge and kindness of heart he posesses. You just know without a doubt he is speaking only truth""  That is not a figure of speech (you sure you know what that is?) and it is also not:  ""...only talking about how she admires JP, and that she thinks he's kind and knowledgable...."", it is way more specific than that.  So yeah, words have meaning, and I am beginning to think you may have troubles with the English language, because I also never claimed that:   ""....it totally neglects what Jordan Peterson had said in the video...""

There’s a lot of ‘reaction’ videos on that notorious interview from all walks of life but this one really does explain why it provoked such strong feelings.

I had a friend used to preach how much he hated women called them ‘beasts of burden’ was into that MGTOW silliness. I told him he sounded like a bitch 😂 safe to say he didn’t like that! Think ultimate men are scared of that part of the feminine equally as women fear toxic masculinity. We just don’t talk about it as much perhaps cos we’ve been taught not to show fear perhaps cos we know women secretly rule the roost.,2년 전,1,

She says women need to take personal responsibility for their own evil,  but then he says 38:20 that Cathy's  irrational, vindictive, spiteful, deceptive side is her masculine side, and that we need to blame society  (not Cathy) for forcing her to express this ""masculinity"". Being combative served her well because she's emulating men and the male ethic of the workplace. And the therapist is nodding in agreement!      I freaking died inside. You just blamed masculinity for her particularly feminine evil side, and excused her personal responsibility by saying the industry/society made her bad, by encouraging her to act masculine.     BTW nobody with a brain blamed her for being confrontational and tough...we blamed her for 1) Having a pre conceived agenda that JP needed to be destroyed at all cost, which was goose stepping to false characterization of him. 2) Deceptively trying to twist the meaning of everything he said.  Listen carefully to this next thing:   There's not a man I know who disrespects combativeness... we disrespect delusional, hate-filled liers.    Then the female evil of falsely pretending to be a victim to mobilize violence by proxy, expecting society to step in and destroy her victim, was what C.N. did immediately after the interview aired... And you never called her out personally for that.    You did everything in your power to blame everyone BUT Cathy Newman. White Knight simping is infantilization of women.    You damage men, boys, masculinity,  and  Cathy Newman with your duplicitous psychobabble.

In this future world women are completely non existent due to the idea that we can grow humans in a test tube and that women are typically more emotive than logical and therefore no longer beneficial to the human race.so the future humans completely eradicated them from human kind. ( And ladies... This is where this type of thinking heads towards naturally under this type of thinking) It also depicts the idea of the reality of the apparent uselessness of emotions that are caring towards human kind as a whole are outweighed by the idea of the need to utilise the sense of sacrificing all emotive feeling and thought are no longer important if they do not fit the collective majority of Indoctrinated views of the futuristic mindset that we....

Watching Peterson's lectures from 1 year (2017 I think - Personality + Maps of meaning) + a small part of another year + part of the Genesis series - gave me more knowledge and insight than all I learned in my school. He is such such such a good professor, looking back he influenced my life so much. What I find is that most of the people villanizing him are people that are not educated enough to understand what he is talking about and where he is coming from. Granted that the topics that relate to archetypes and psychoanalysis are quite complex and they indeed do not catch on to the majority, just a select few who are able to explore their own inside and see the truth, but that still remains the case. Lack of education, lack of internal exploration. While Jordan is not at all a perfect human being (that doesn't exist), he never claims he is as well, and in my eyes he is embodying his lessons and is simply an amazing human being.

They believe their intellect is superior to the rest of the world, specifically the millions who have been unconsciously waiting for someone to speak Truth. Jordan Peterson speaks that Truth. These intellectuals should wake up and follow their own advice.  To them I say;  “Accept that others don’t see the world as you do, with a lifeless unrelenting grip on Marxist Ideology.” I was shocked that the makers of the film explained Leftism as the old world and what Peterson is preaching as new. It’s the other way around my friends. The people who follow Jordan Peterson are crying out for the old world, true western culture, to be part of their life again. But, western culture has been high jacked by communists secretly for years, and now openly, preaching their ideological religion as fact in an overwhelming majority of universities across the world. We know where their religion leads because we saw it play out in various countries throughout the 20th century. Their ideology leads to lack of freedom and bloodshed.

There have only been progressive waves of doubling down on censorship and demands that the 'reds' kneel down in humiliation. The blues won't just compute the arithmetic - they refuse to acknowledge the numbers in front of them. I think this explains the deeper and deeper waves of delusion that seem to multiply by the hour - that there's no such thing as gender, as men, women, races. The blues are right in the sense that the only escape from the red math problem is successive waves of more and more hysterical self delusion.",3년 전,0,

@keithk.3963,"Firstly, I could not think more highly of Dr. Peterson. I should think that he will be considered one of the great thinkers of our time, if not of all time. I am among many that have learned a great deal from him and hope to learn a great deal more.  That being said, I do find it interesting that, while the documentary touches on the value of conversation between blue and red, they simultaneously and discretely act as if “right” is a negative word. Even Dr. Peterson will generalize the “right” or “conservatives” with almost stereotypical traits. Then there are the continual references of the alt right. I live in a major city and the last time there was a rally for white nationalists 5 years ago, it consisted of 10 people. Just because people voted for Trump doesn’t automatically make them white suprematists or white nationalists and justify the conjecture that the numbers are larger than they are.   The other thought that is constantly repeated is that conservatives are against immigration.  They want to keep everyone out. That simply isn’t the truth. Conservatives want legal immigration, not closed boarders.   If we are going to come together, which I want more than anything, having a grounded view of both sides of the isle needs to happen and at the moment, even with a documentary as well intentioned as this, we are still a ways away from that being a reality. But, I will continue to be optimistic that we can eventually get there.",3년 전,0,

Some 50 years ago in my 20's studying the Koine Greek of the New Testament caused me to totally reject all of Psychology  established by Freud and Jung because the Greek word Psyche meant soul, which therefore meant they were attempting to replace the authority of Christian pastors with a new way of administering to the sinful condition of our souls as people. There is a far better way for men and women to deal with their own evil side than attempting to integrate it with their good side. Sure, we have within us the darkness of the soul and there is also the light from God so  how could the two walk together except they agree and what fellowship has darkness with light, come on Children wake up!!

So, there's a cultural context embedded within the vernacular that serves to draw the viewer into movie etc, to spoke specific personal interest of the viewer in a character of a movie (etc) as they exhibit character traits similar to their own, articulating a perspective that they may or may not have the confidence or ability to express on their own. So, you get a subtle allure of a member of the opposite gender who thinks like you, who understands you, who 'gets you', but on a subtle subconscious level a slow gradual cultural shift occurs and how we identify with ourselves (what is 'femanine'/'what is masculine') becomes malleable/distorted/confused...

Why not look at what it would take to get this person back on his own feet to become a productive person again. And that would require not just money but effort. Basically he is saying that it is the beggars fault(responsibility) for getting into that situation or even that it is the beggars fault(responsibility) to get out of that situation.

@davidhunt7427,"A free man is as jealous of his responsibilities as he is of his liberties. ~ Cyril James   Liberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread it. ~ George Bernard Shaw   [On ancient Athens]: In the end, more than freedom, they wanted security. They wanted a comfortable life, and they lost it all - security, comfort, and freedom. When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give to them, when the freedom they wished for most was freedom from responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and was never free again. ~ Edward Gibbon   Government does not grow by seizing our freedoms, but by assuming our responsibilities. ~ Michael Cloud   It is indeed a singular thing that people wish to pass laws to nullify the disagreeable consequences that the law of responsibility entails.  Will they never realize that they do not eliminate these consequences but merely pass them along to other people?  The result is one injustice the more and one moral the less. ~ Frederic Bastiat   Then what is freedom? It is the will to be responsible to ourselves. ~ Friedrich Nietzsche   The essential psychological requirement of a free society is the willingness on the part of the individual to accept responsibility for his life. ~ Edith Packer   The real freedom of any individual can always be measured by the amount of responsibility which he must assume for his own welfare and security. ~ Robert Welch   .. the sense of meaning that life can provide to you, is proportionate to the amount of responsibility you decide to take on.. ~ Jordan Peterson   If you are not free to choose wrongly and irresponsibly, you are not free at all. ~ Jacob Hornberger   Entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States. ~ Ronald Reagan   Any doctrine that weakens personal responsibility for judgment and for action helps create the attitudes that welcome and support the totalitarian state. ~ John Dewey   The great escape of our times is escape from personal responsibility for the consequences of one's own behavior. ~ Thomas Sowell   The vision of the anointed is one in which ills as poverty, irresponsible sex, and crime derive primarily from 'society,' rather than from individual choices and behavior. To believe in personal responsibility would be to destroy the whole special role of the anointed, whose vision casts them in the role of rescuers of people treated unfairly by 'society'. ~ Thomas Sowell   We seem to be getting closer and closer to a situation where nobody is responsible for what they did but we are all responsible for what somebody else did. ~ Thomas Sowell   The police can't stop an intruder, mugger, or stalker from hurting you. They can pursue him only after he has hurt or killed you. Protecting yourself from harm is your responsibility, and you are far less likely to be hurt in a neighborhood of gun-owners than in one of disarmed citizens - even if you don't own a gun yourself. ~ Harry Browne   The free market punishes irresponsibility. Government rewards it. ~ Harry Browne   The increasing dependence on the State is anything but a healthy symptom; it means that the whole nation is in a fair way to becoming a herd of sheep, constantly relying on a shepard to drive them into good pastures.  The shepherd's staff soon becomes a rod of iron, and the shepherds turn into wolves... Any man who still possesses the instinct of self preservation knows perfectly well that only a swindler would offer to relieve him of responsibility, for surely no one in his senses would dream of taking responsibility for the existence of another. The man who promises everything is sure to fulfil nothing, and everyone who promises too much is in danger of using evil means in order to carry out his promises, and is already on the road to perdition. ~ Carl Jung, CW 10, Para 413, Civilization in Transition",4년 전,0,

When this interview took palce, we didnt know what was happening, but we now have confirmed the existence of a global conspiracy, confirmed by Times themselves, thats a ""Shadow Cabal"" was controlling the media to influence people into an emotional rage to intentionally get them to make bad decisions.  Times is also a far left extremist organization, in which nothing on the Right is ever considered reasonable and is actually dangerous and violent, meanwhile everything on the Left is seen as ""common sense"" and even burning buildings are considered ""mostly peaceful""<--- This is the view point of Times, the magezine organization that confirmed the Shadow Cabal.  So, yes, it is now 100% confirmed that the far left extremist organization Times has confirmed the existence of a Shadow Cabal who entered into a global conspiracy to trigger the emotions of the public to get them to make emotional decisions instead of logical rational decisions.  We didnt know this when this interview was done, but its 2021 now, and its been confirmed.

@RoxyWrites,"What's fascinating about the Carl Jung (dark/Animus & also Filemon) discussion is that not only are we fairly unaware of it happening, we're unaware of the major causes and the role children and teenagers play--that they set the template for it & adulthood roles fall into place because of it. None of it suddenly begins when you're an adult out of thin air. No, it begins when you're in diapers-and when you are chastised heavily from 2 yrs old onward for things another gender is encouraged to do simply by the omission of chastisement or punishment of any kind-and you are therefore on many levels oppressed bc of your gender in ways other gender/s are not as a matter of culture, and you become programmed w/certain behaviors as a result. Teenage girls have already been indoctrinated to pimp out to other teenage girls two very specific manifestos:  1. Misogyny & Whiteness Rule - you must tow that line for other women, whether you believe in it or not, you must demonstrate that you do and you must evangelize it to other teenage girls and subsequently to other women as you get older. The punishment for not doing so (for not pimping out misogyny and for not towing that line on both giving/receiving roles) is ostracization by other women, abandonment, scorn, rejection, policing, brutalization, gaslighting, and sometimes psychological and physical violence - all the things women accuse men of also doing against them, and yet, 2. Undercurrent Teaching - You must also not believe in misogyny philosophically, you must not believe the indoctrination or the programming you were taught while you're carrying it out, you must act like a spy and while you're pimping it out, you must not believe it's right, but you must act out as if you do bc you know that you are less than, that has been demonstrated to you all your childhood years by both men and women and you know that men can kill you, destroy your life, take your children away if you don't, you've learned this growing up by watching women around you gaslit, beaten, stalked, raped, and put into mental health clinics (the saying ""men are afraid women will reject them and women are afraid men will kill them"" applies here.)   The existence of these two manifestos seemingly at complete odds with each other creates a similar environment-without costumes-that you see on a Handmaid's Tale, or read about in Margaret Atwood's book of the same name.    Cold War - When you force a group to oppress itself in order to effect its own survival (about 25,000 years women have been living in a non-partnership society approximately) you will automatically force it to develop subterfuge..it will declare cold war tactics to overthrow the oppressors, but do so in such a way as to preserve the life of the children born of that oppression and the survival of the oppressed, whether female or nonbinary, trans, etc.   Now that we are in a modern age, it is more difficult to hide the indoctrination from childhood that women are imprinted with and it is more difficult to hide the cold warfare going on in response. This is why in the U.S. Congress alone you are seeing the introduction of 400-800 Bills every year which have as their goal the legislation of women's reproduction through: women's fertility exams, forced fertility procedures, changing the type and frequency of exams that must be done and when, changes to care during pregnancy, the elimination of reproductive counseling or psychological help, elimination of abortion availability in multiple states and more coming, and the ability and or access to preventive birth control (the word control is clearly paramount).   Consider an unorthodox thought: male orgasm produces ejaculation a majority of the time which directly effects-and can result-in insemination. But when women orgasm there is no direct effect or even possibility of pregnancy occurring from that orgasm alone. By that observation, true control of pregnancy and fertility, logically, would be the prevention, regulation, and control-through legislation-of sperm distribution. But you don't see women's groups lobbying to legislate sperm or viagra. That's not women's warfare.   And if we want to eliminate the warfare on both sides we'll need to stop teaching girls that they're less than and expecting them at 2, 3, 4 yrs old to behave differently than boys. And we'll need to be responsible for our actions, which means responsible parenting-not treating your boy child differently than your girl child.",4년 전,1,

They say that if a man is stoic that is toxic masculinity hurting him. They don't understand what it means to be a man and they want it gone.  They also dismiss femininity. Women have had plenty of power throughout history. But because the kind of power they had were feminine, and not masculine, and the feminists want to pretend women have never had any power, they dismiss the feminine and fear-monger about the masculine.

But human rights do not require the labor of others. It is nobody's right to have their hand in my back pocket. That's the fundamental dissonance between how these people see the world, and how things are actually put together.  To remove someone's hand from your own pocket, is not to suppress them. It is remove a suppression on yourself. If someone wants to instead put their hands into their pockets instead. Then that is not in line with neither stoicism nor the right.

@rbarrett111,"Peterson mentions ""differential productivity,"" or something to that effect.  Why do I assume Peterson himself may be biased toward thinking that talking about philosophy is somehow productive?  Of course, by definition there must also be things that, by extension, are not.  I might assume junk mail distributors, for example.  When we discuss human productivity, we should start with the understanding all humans are productive about 5/8 of their lifetime.  Generally, we all do our time as useless dependents . . . and part of the basis for human society is that we invest in the sheer number of human beings we can produce.  There are all kind of variables that modify the productivity of a human, over the course of a lifetime.  Then there are all the abstractions of who DEFINES productivity . . . and when . . . and how . . . .  Sorry, productivity can be a slippery word.  Mark Twain, having swung a pickaxe in the sun for a living, and having edited a newspaper, said he'd gladly edit the paper for free, in order to avoid swinging the pickaxe in the sun for money.  There are disparate notions of productivity, from as many sources.  Perhaps the world would even be a better place if some of us produced less.",4년 전,0,

@juliawoodman7916,"i'm only quarter way through but he seems to be saying, like i explain in one of my books, that we need both sides in the mix to thrive, or to even consciously exist, so going to one or other extreme is destructive. This is often the case, in thesis and anithesis the pendulum swings, but it is always hard to find the middle ground. However in USA now the dems have already gone so far down to the extreme, well at least many of the powerful ones, that the change had to come, or we become inhuman. Conservatives are not actually the extreme opposite, they are a large and diverse group driven together by a common cause, to deal with the terrible crimes committed (even by some supposed Conservatives sucked into the Dems corruption). The Conservative group contains a huge diversity of people with values coming from both sides of Jordan's argument, so they won't implode the balance of existence. This includes loads of very creative people for example as well as the good manager types. And there are people in the world of course who contain both sides within themselves even as individuals. I suppose the thing here, as that the huge issue of corruption should have been ideally dealt with  by the legal route, rather than by the political, but as we have seen, the depths and extent of the corruption extends throughout the judicial system as well, so there was no other way to deal with trying to correct this disastrous black shroud on humanity.

@Chevy517,"So I have watched the video and see the issues that have risen to discussion. When I listened to your discussion about women being masculine and the men standing down not knowing how to handle the issue I refer to a lesson in books of history contained in one cover. Whether you want to believe or not is up to you but the lesson was covered in these books of history and in the now, we as western society have been allowing these teachings to be removed from what is accepted as a whole party whether some choose to agree or not. They are values of human behavior whether man or women, which will keep getting worse all the way to the predicted future in Revelations. Our Western society has torn down these values as well as the family home with demands from the elite commanding those beneath them not just some but all to serve their purpose for their gain of having enough before sharing with others in mass quantity. These other topics sharing, reverent, responsibility, how to present oneself are also in the same books of history. If you are not offended yet and would like a link to the answers in the history books about the behavior of women which is their responsibility as a women to come to their own understanding and present themselves according to their understanding of what they read in those books to what I am talking about click where I found a good explanation of the topic covered well on this site... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoetIjJl2NM&t=15s ...If you are offended please hold in your offense to respect Jordan B Peterson's site.

For other solutions quiet your minds and your responses and click this link as you see the material presented to you relax take it in and let the answers come to your questions, instead of rising up with hate because of where the information is coming from or the belief you think it will force you into just relax and enjoy the information.

@theslayer794,"I would like to share some information has has changed my entire life.  A few years ago I watched The Matrix again, and just by a hunch by observing the world around me it dawned upon me that maybe we were actually living in a matrix, so much of suffering, corruption, hunger and destruction, and monotony of people acting like robots day in day out until they retire after all life force has been sucked out of them all to die in a few years (one could argue that the movie was just based on our ""mundane"" apparent reality and is just a work of fiction, or that it is actually the truth and that by so brazenly throwing the truth at our faces they are just getting our subconscious acceptance for all the evils they commit and that helps them actually manifest that’s reality, and will continue to do so, this is actually why they show the agenda(AI tech etc) in the movies and then it actually happens).  Anyway, so I started exploring, and I came across a lot of information that resonated with me, David Icke's info being among them. Eventually I came across some information that resonated with me very strongly, this amazing energy healer I know who has been receiving healing frequencies and information from the Arcturians for the past 3 years. It is groundbreaking information and if you are interested I would highly recommend reading the free book where she summarised her findings (she has found a lot more since this book was written) - https://www.abigailsinsights.com/the-holographic-matrix-3/. In a nutshell, the cabal is real, and so are the reptilians who exist in the astral plane and control them (David's Icke's books are highly recommended here as well to make sense of it all especially at a 3 D level), this is an energy extraction matrix we are exactly like batteries whose true power is beyond comprehension, however before we can evolve and realise what we really are off we go into the grave, memories wiped and then returned here and the cycle is repeated. The matrix was a documentary, reality is really stranger than fiction.  Also, would highly recommend to check out her Youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDZXhEY_KYDN9x9lxTJE77g. She has shared some amazing healing frequencies there, even if you are highly skeptical of all this just get into a relaxed state and listen to the frequencies and then see what your heart tells you -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siKwp8bqvsQ  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWtUHhHPMS8&t=300s  Even if all of this sounds crazy to you, try to give this information a chance.

If everyone was happy...so what? If everyone got what they wanted...so what? It only lasts 60-80 years at best! That's NOTHING. No one wants to talk about what happens after death. We are all going to die. And the Bible points out, written over 4000 years by 40 different authors that we have a choice to make in the very small window we have on this earth. We either obey God, the Creator, or we don't and we end up separated from Him for eternity. Life on this earth is a grain of sand on a seashore, yet we want to throw out a bunch of psych-babble, for what? 70 years? If we're lucky?   We are sinners! We are prideful, lustful, hateful, greedy, killers given the right situation in our everyday circumstances. We have proven that over and over and over again. Yet we ignore what is right in from of us: our sin. We throw away a relationship with the Father in Heaven for 70 years of pain, anguish, boredom, petty fighting, vengefulness, spite, war, rebellion and hatred towards others. If this is all you think this is, then you are shallow and ignorant. If women think they have it bad in the most free country in the world, then they have no clue how 90% of the rest of the women in the world lives. And all they care about is themselves. Utter selfishness. The same selfishness we saw in the Garden of Eden.   The Bible is the true authority to getting along with others peacefully, but it's ignored. No one accuses Jesus of being any of the things we are guilty of. He walked a blameless road, sacrificed his life and his body for all of Mankind, healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, fed the hungry, all out of compassion for us and obeying the Father. Who else in the broadcast is willing to walk in his shoes? No one. It's all about THIS world and you get 70 years of it if you're lucky. If the woman in the video got exactly what she wanted for all women, so what? She's still going to die in 30-40 years, if not sooner, just like every other woman will. And for what?  We are living in the end of days. It's all around us JUST LIKE the Book of Revelation told us. Get a right relationship with God so you can look forward to an eternity with Him.

@ThaRealDawn,"Man is created in GODS image. And image of something is just a straight line picture or hallow of the original form.  The form in which GOD is, is subsequently tha same form in which man is percieved or originated. Just and man's rib lives in a woman so therefore GODS perception of man lives with in GOD thus creating the Image of GOD.   To simplify this is to understand the image of something is there for a real, yet unreal value of both being in existence and holding qualities of the original and also not being in existence as it contains NO original form to its origin. Therefore mans relation to GOD is precisely perceived upon the relationship it in turns has to its origin. Hince your personal relationship to GOD.   To take a stupid deeper into the origin one must remember that the human itself is made up of millions of cells, that die, and recreate and also take on new substances and purpose. Yet it contains all the same values of its predecessors.  Humans lack of understanding and overly sense of self and superiority is what clouds man from truth and ultimate knowledge of its origin and existence. This is simply seen on every scale imaginable and unimaginable.   If you ripped the cells from a man's body are those exact same cells the same as its origin? Or less than that of its origin? The natural thought is NO, its merely a part of its origin but not the same at all as man is more. The truth is 1 cells is exactly what the Orion is amd more, it is only that it exists with other likes that it becomes less to make man. Man exists merely because of its attempt to become more and ending up less. The need to place oneself above is the reason for and consequently it is also the the original of which is man.  Just a man is the unity of all things needed to be placed above it smaller counter parts so IS GOD.

It's time to go back (once and for all, hopefully!) to the mind at its beginning; to become - individually and collectively - the tabula rasa we're meant to be.  We each have senses, and a mind that can attempt (at least) to take in information from our environment, sorting, sifting, collating, mixing, matching, etc.  But that mind can also reach out to the world that sends the signals, acting, reacting, moving, shaping, building, destroying.  We can also, of course, send & receive signals, one to another of us.  In each of these areas, it is vitally important that we understand what it is we mean to do; that we consider our thoughts, our words, and our actions - in that order.  Thoughts predict words and actions.  We should be mindful (literally) of what we think, as well as what we feel.  We must stop interacting mostly through knee-jerk reactions which are based either on some rubber-stamp ideology created for us, or an unconscious up-welling into which we allow ourselves to be swept.  We must think for ourselves; each individual carefully considering the available information, and sorting out our feelings and impulses, before coming to a tentative and temporary basis on which to speak and/or act.        I'm pleased to discover that much of what I seem to naturally believe is called 'stoicism'.  I didn't know that being stoic was also related to an entire philosophy!

@GnosisDharma," Jim P  Hi, I read it. Yes I'm under 40 but I haven't experienced any Marxist undertones in the schools I have been too. I'm not an American either, I live in a more progressive society and politics in school aren't discussed much here, I have not gone so high up as to university. I have two degrees, in economy and cleaning. If anyone talked politics in school it was me not the teachers. But that was in my second degree, I used to be a Jehovas Witness and I weren't allowed to have political opinions but to be honest I had them.  Okay if you are right about communism is not really what I think is important. If you think that version of utopia I describe is not communism that is fine by me, but I do see Marx as a critical person of capitalism and our ancestors thought that capitalism would save them from feudalism. But we have the same issues of rich/poor today people with massive power and people who are slaves to the rich. We have revolutions because we have unacceptable inequality. If we don't want a violent revolution like we had in the past. We need to think about what system we want to have and work for it. My utopia fantasy is possible, we can start co-ops, one after an other and people will finally be free and own the fruit of their labor. I have listened to Richard Wolff, he is an professor in economy and there are co-ops already in the world, we need to make it mainstrem.  I do know there are people who call themselves communist and love Lenin and Stalin so we maybe should invent a new word for the utopic society, my point is only that we get propaganda about how bad communism is while capitalism is certainly bad, let people starve to death because they don't have money even if we have enough food for everyone. Capitalism needs to be criticized and we can't give up just because we failed in the past. Capitalism will kill us all, this system will lead us on a road were earth is inhabitable.",5년 전,2,

@GnosisDharma," Jim P  Sorry I didn't reply sooner, but I did not get a notification for your reply apparently. Richard Wolff talks also about that communism has developed from the old days and that they had wrong tactics to get justice, that violent revolutions aren't the solution, that is why Marx-Leninist don't like him because they want that violate revolution. Can you forgive him a bit because he express it like that?   These guys (Stalin Mao worshipers) probably don't vote either because their philosophies is let everyone get so poor so they will do the revolution they want. Probably they want to be dictators which I do understand can be tempting but I think these people are dangerous so we can't let them become that. I have also talked to some of these people too and I wanted to call myself communist but hmm, I don't want to be associated with these people. One also treated me with Kolyma because I said that the far left people are those guys who says Holodomor was not man made famine.  Problem with capitalism is that it is allowed to pay people for work and in the end it ends with people not working at all because they own stocks. These people tend to become spoiled not understanding what work is, having insane time pressure on their employees, which leads to people cheating with their works because it is impossible to actually do what they are supposed to do in that time frame. Also the fact that they want to pay as little as possible and the system needs people with money to buy and it will collapse the way it is designed.  I'm kinda okay with the system we have overall if we just get it more democratic, we can't have a few with so much power, we need these co-ops, democracy at work, we also need a system politically were people feel that they actually have power, we should vote more on issues and less on people. People can lie.   Maybe some would call me a bit anarchist but I'm not against government, I think we can make government whatever we wish and we have evidence of this. Governments in the world are very different and I do think it has a lot to with the attitude of the people. So we don't need a war, we just need to learn to cooperate with each other.

@Phillmagroin," @Profile.4  facism was a big part of what are professor lectured about at the end of our masters course. We had a huge huge debate with over 400 students and what ended up being by far the biggest topic was facism and things that claim to be benevolent when in fact are facist to the core. Long story short at the end we were able to clearly see and for very very obvious reasons how and why this political correctness saga the world is in is in fact pure facism! P.c should be a very good thing but again for very very obvious reasons it is absolutely horrible. P.c is nothing but you can have your freedom and your free speech and your rights so long as I agree with them and if I don't and you do not immediately retract it then you are a racist, bigot, homophobe and I will literally attempt to ruin your family's life! Theres zero argument here this is what it is and you know it! It could have been a wonderful thing for people it really could have changed the world but of course the idea had to be hijacked and 100% corrupted through and through into what it is today! It has nothing to do with protecting people like it is supposed to and has everything to do with forcing ones beliefs on others! So yea we all agreed at the end of the debate that p.c was a absolutely horrible form of facism. Now just like I just explained even though over 400 of us agreed and had studied this topic in and out  are you going to tell me i should go study this topic that I obviously know nothing about it? Are you going to be the exact facist i described above and try to pretend like you believe your correct and everyone else is wrong even though there's literally millions upon millions who say otherwise and for damn good reason. Ya gonna try your hardest to force your belief down our throats and if we don't accept it you will belittle us and do the exact thing your precious p.c practices are supposed to protect us from?

Republicans have much power in America so you don't have to take back your country!  Communism and welfare state is much very different things. I live in a country which would be considered welfare state and it is very much capitalist in every way. The difference is that we pay government to take care of healthcare and help people in need. Some people need more help then others and we help by paying taxes in order to help. Is that so bad to make sure everyone has a roof over their head?

You maybe should see some lecture from someone who is a real leftist like Richard Wolf, he has some lecture called communism for dummies. America had so much propaganda, yes real propaganda about communism, so I'm pretty sure you don't what it really is. No it has nothing to do with dictators, it's about cooperation between people to create a society without hierarchy. So far it has not been really successful but you know if you read history and try to do better you can learn from mistakes and think about how to prevent bad outcomes.

Noam Chomsky for exampled called it state driven capitalism.   When I was a child nobody was worried about political correctness it came a thing while I was an adult. I sure know what political correctness is and don't know why you would assume I don't know what it is. But if that was the case why would you not want me to check Wikipedia?  Political correctness is to use words that people find not offensive so it is controlled speech based on what people find offensive. If it was a personal decision I would not mind it but people had to change words describing the same thing and you need to pay attention to know what word is now offensive.

He is imposing pathology and extreme nagative generalisations upon women here and the comments in support of such bigotry is so unnerving to read. He is not interested in 'conversation' or de polarisation but he is accelerating exactly that with his opinion. This looks like the last flailing attempt at protection of male dominance and scares me to my bones. ' 'We' don't know what women are like in positions of power?' Have you forgotten that this lack of power was imposed by oppressive controlling and aggressive males  over millennia?  Complete demonisation of 'the group' of women and exposing his own hypocrisy. I can't believe the support for such bigotry and unjust analysis of women. Tarring all women with such an horrifically over simplified and 'top-down' approach to their 'misdemeanours' and absolutely justified demands for a fairer world. Not about blame but about truth. Women are not masculine when they are angry and feminine when they do not experience anger. This is the real persecution of feminity. Please, men and women, be true to yourselves.

Debate is fine, but requires all parties involved to understand and respect the information they are given.  Peterson does none of that, and only seeks to fit the findings and examples to retroactively justify social marginalisation based upon pseudoscience and the most vulgar perversions of sociobiology (a discipline already known for its open flirtations with obvious pseudoscientific fields).  Jordan, buddy...you're an idiot.

If I acted crazy, I did it for Father YAHweh; if I acted overly serious, I did it for you. YAHwehShua’s love has moved me to such extremes. His love has the first and last word in everything we do. A NEW LIFE 14-15 Our firm decision is to work from this focused center: ONE MAN ( YAHshua ) DIED FOR EVERYONE.. That puts everyone in the same boat. He included everyone in His death so that everyone could also be included in His life, a resurrection life, a far better life than people ever lived on their own. 16-20 Because of this decision we don’t evaluate people by what they have or how they look. We looked at the Messiah that way once and got it all wrong, as you know. We certainly don’t look at Him that way anymore. Now we look inside, and what we see is that anyone united with the Messiah gets a fresh start, is created new. The old life is gone; a new life burgeons! Look at it! All this comes from Father YAHweh who settled the relationship between us and Him, and then called us to settle our relationships with each other. Father YAHweh put the world square with Himself through the Messiah, giving the world a fresh start by offering forgiveness of sins. Father YAHweh has given us the task of telling everyone what He is doing. We are Father YAHweh's  representatives. Father YAHweh uses us to persuade men and women to drop their differences and enter into Father YAHweh's work of making things right between them. We are speaking for Father YAHweh Himself now: Become friends with Father YAHweh; He’s already a friend with you. 21 How? you ask. In the death of YAHShua. Father YAHweh put the wrong on YAHshua who never did anything wrong, so we could be put right with Father YAHweh. IsaYAH 53: 5 But He ( YAHshua ) was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.

@narniagirl1420,"Speaking as a woman, I have observed such bitterness in women when men have hurt and deceived them in promising committed intimacy when they only wanted gratuitous sex.  I see the problem as being that women have not demanded of themselves that they would hold the line of chastity with men until they are in a committed (and married) relationship.  Of course, most men learn early on to ""conquer""  -- or feel like they SHOULD conquer as many women as they can -- the locker-room braggadocio, the ""stud"" on campus, etc.  Which leads women to such bitterness and hatred of men.  I don't feel bitterness and hatred toward men, I enjoy a good conversation with good men, I appreciate their logical, methodical way of approaching life. But because I have never LET myself be used by men (which is not to say I haven't experienced sexual assault), I don't have this mental backdrop of animosity toward men in general.    A peculiar thing I have learned is when a man is into porn and de-humanizing thoughts toward women, I can tell.  Men think they can hide an addiction to porn.  I've got news for you, it's all over your eyes.  So I avoid those men, trapped in their prison of lonely lust.    And I just enjoy a good conversation with a good man about life.  I hope more women take responsibility for their actions.  Sure men need to be more responsible and not use women, but girls, I've got news for you:  it starts with you holding the line of respect for yourself,  expecting respect --  if it is not there, move on, and quit whining.   I would also say:  girls avoid the guy who thinks he is ""God's gift to woman-kind""  -- the stud, the macho-man.  He can't be faithful to one woman because he is so insecure in himself and his masculinity, he has to constantly ""prove"" himself to himself by bedding yet another woman, even though ""seriously dating"" or even married.  He is incapable of commitment: because that means actually unveiling himself to another human being, and an insecure person can't stand that.   No, look for a man of quiet, unassuming integrity;  someone who keeps his word, is responsible in his work and personal affairs;  a faithful, honest friend to other men and who accomplishes much and doesn't brag about what he HAS accomplished.  Someone who treats you as a mental and emotional  equal;  who recognizes the two of you are equal but with different (hopefully complementary) strengths and not as ""arm candy"". RUN from that guy.  You want someone who is willing to be emotionally vulnerable about his past:  life in his family growing up;  momentous experiences he has had growing up that moved him or scarred him.  Walk  away from the strong, silent, stoic type that won't talk about what has affected them negatively in their life:  they are in a world of pain and will suck all your emotional energy, for YEARS trying to help them.  They need a good counselor, not a wife or a girlfriend.   For men, I would say look for a woman who has integrity above all else:  that she has strong values and whether she has a ""career"" or not, she has self-respect, a sense of humor and joy going through life.   I wish you all well.  Relationships are NOT easy, but that is what makes them precious and a rare treasure.",5년 전(수정됨),69,

@laural3738," @frankfrantic7000  Yes, some feminists actually said there's something bad in staying at home and being a mother and a wife and find self realization in that. There are very few nowadays but they actually were many in the sixties and the seventies. And I agree with you, radical feminism is a dengerous ideology. But this. You totally missed the point. I'm not a radical feminist. And most of my female friends are Christian etherosexual women. None of them however ever thought that people should not be free to live their gender identity the way they feel better. Denying women's rights and LGBTI rights, as JP does, is not about being Christian or etherosexual. It's about being sexist and integralist. He's a radical chouvinist, which is exactly the same dangerous ideology. It's radical feminism on the opposite side. I totally disagree with any suprematist ideology that states that some are better than others no matter who they are presumed to be the better ones. None of these ideologies should ever be fed to our children in democratic societies because they always mistify the truth and manipulate minds by negating science and history . Democracy is a libertarian and equalitarian ideology by definition while suprematism is a totalitarian ideology, it always led to dictatorship in human history and always did this by the means of lies and violence. It's a threat for all democratic regimes. Since I'm intellectually honest and i respect the truth I've no problem to admit that i said something wrong. And I just got wrong in writing a sentence in a comment on YT. What I can't stand are totally dishonest persons like JP who make money selling books which spread this kind of dangerous hate ideologies on the unique basis of blatant lies like: ""we don't know what woman in power would really look like... because they haven't ever had it before"". I bet he never admitted he was wrong as usually does who lies in bad faith. It's the usual suprematist negation of history that both me and all my Cristian etherosexual friends who believe in democracy are sick of. Sice you like so much uppercase letters i write it this way, maybe you get it better: IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO NEGATE SCIENCE AND HISTORY TO SPREAD HATE IDEOLOGIES AND CALL THIS FREEDOM.

I wasn't stating facts! I was quoting Jordan Peterson and i even left a time stamp so you could see for yourself that i quoted him word for word.  Then i made a comment how felt about this I'm sorry that my feelings triggered you, but IF its only the facts your worried about, you should take it up with the man.   as for your question / statement as to where I live?   Yep, your right! I do live in the dark web of ""disinformation"" so to speak.  I grew up in the ghetto, everything i learned i have taught myself, and i know that not everything i read or watch is true and i have to go through all of that, just like everyone and come to my own.   IMO woman have never had real power because as soon as they pass on that power, they get character assassinated to the point where they hardly existed at all and things go back rather then forward so everything is destroyed. Its not true power, its just a political game, they may never find true power;  so we can also argue that neither have men.  RIGHT now we are in a matriarch, and the fact that we (assuming your female)  get to even think and talk here as we do is thanks to Queen Elizabeth all this ""progress"" happened to happen during her reign.  When you said Cleo, you reminded me of my most fav female ruler, Wu Zetian, Empress of China. Unlike Queen Elizabeth she went from ""rags to riches"" but the progress she made in her short rule is the same progress we have currently undergone.  Everything she was, was destroyed the second she died. Men don't like when child concubine's come into power. but woman don't like being rapped as children. so i guess no one is ever happy!!!! >.<   Actually the documentary is completely wrong like everything on TV, yet another part of the ""dark web of disinformation"" so to speak, but there is also a lot of information you would never know if you didn't watch it.   What they don't tell you is, she admitted to being a tyrant and killing her own children because she had no choice.  We will never know how hard that was for her to do... to lie and put on a show. What we do know is that's what all politicians do LOL, and the people were so angry and triggered about all the lies going on, no one knowing for sure what to do or who to believe,  so they just get more triggered and angry, as anger always escalates and its never good.  it never does anything but make things worse I'm sure we can both agree!  She was gonna get killed.  But they didn’t want to kill her because if that happens the riots would just continue and things could get worse. so they made a deal with her, so that “both sides” could be happy.  People lie and make deals all the time because they are scared, from who or what or why…. who knows.... but this is a constant for thousands of years.  its kinda awesome, but also horrible that humans haven't actually gown much or change at all over the ages,  just the stories around us seem to.  And stories affect us deeply, that's why propaganda is so powerful.  So, we need to choose our stories well.   Wu took the deal... and she got to live a nice long and beautiful life. but the second she died they said ""remember, she is a tyrant!""  so they destroy EVERYTHING she did, all that progress.. gone over night.  everything she was, lost and forgotten though time and the documentary (on youtube btw) we get to see them dig up clay remnants and make up a new story.   You could almost say the same story happen to Jesus, but.. he did'nt take the deal.. he didn’t admit to something that was a lie… and he didn’t get to live.. Since he didn’t take the deal they HAD to kill him.  Sometimes they lie and say “take the deal and we will let you live” just to kill you anyways… so what he did was great!!   Jesus was granted eternal life while Wu Zetian name was Damned.  But only in this world, I know God knows the real truth, the world might of forgotten her, but she will never be forgotten.   and people need to remember that, We will all die, and we will all be forgotten by the world because no one is really that special.  Time forgets all...   There is a lie going around that if you are not special enough to be remembered after death and through time, that you are damned too. but the world cant remember everyone forever ONLY God can.. Therefore everyone is going to hell according to the world.. but most people know, this is nonsense..  but some people actually believe this very deeply,  my best friend does.  :<  I see this is just a worldly lie made to scare her into doing things that go against her values.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@bradbryant332,"DAMN  I  LOVE  THIS!     I've been getting my ass whipped (literally!  Yep! they could swat you with a big stick IN 7TH GRADE in the early 1960's! for just telling a ""joke"" without permission......)  since the 5th Grade, when my teacher would put me in the ""Dog House"" (under her desk at the front of the class) for just ""speaking out of turn"" (telling a joke!) Hey.....the ""problem"" was....I WAS FUNNY!  Everybody would laugh....and so, she lost her power for a few seconds...which PISSED HER OFF! Her 'answer' was to LOCK ME DOWN!  She'd say ""Brad, get into the doghouse!""  (I knew very well that THAT meant go up to the front of the class and SIT on the little board UNDER MY DESK!)  The weirdest part, was how she would ""act"" like she ""forgot"" that I was there. When she finished her worthless monologue, she would come, casually sit back down at her desk, pressing her opaque, pantihose-clad FAT knees into me, knowing well that I was still there....but wanting ME to worry that she had ""forgotten about me""!  I SHOULD (all 11 years-old of me) pushed her FAT knees back! and told her what I was feeling, and then I should have slowly and confidently walked to the Principal's office to report her.  Looking back, I feel pretty sure that my parents would have stood up for me!  But....that was the time (1961) when the schools sent letters to all parents, getting their ""permission"" to use corporal punishment on their children, in a Last, Old-World Attempt to beat the individuality out of those ""pesky, and rebellious"" young boys!   Later addicted to drugs I was able to trace my need for anesthetic to THOSE fucking experiences! I could clearly see that ""education"" (as it was fed to us) was a JOKE!  I wanted NOTHING to do with this ""plastic mold factory""...even at the risk of my life. Nowadays, Mrs. Dollens would be imprisoned for abusing a child like that!   We've found more subtle ways of keeping up the Pavlovian conditioning, these days! By my senior year of high school, my friend's parents wouldn't allow me to come to New Years parties, etc.  The rumor was out that I had ""experimented"" with L.S.D.!!! By 1980, I had made my way to a life sentence in a Bangkok Prison.  Stuck on the cement floor of a small cell for years, I learned how to leave my body......and later, how to meditate. By the year 2000, I was in India, trying to get into a monastery, but they wouldn't even consider taking on a guy traveling on a false passport! By THAT time, even the monasteries (the last bastions of lawlessness) needed my ""papers"". Now, I'm the sole caregiver for my 95 and 96-year-old Mother and Father.......trying to explain to them the reason why what's called ""Death"" isn't to be feared.   They've been given NO preparation for the most important of life's transitions!   Our priorities are SO whacky!  People still believe that ""Oswald killed JFK"" and a group of angry ""Arabs with boxcutters"" pulled off 9/11!  My poor parents think I'm out of my mind! Biblical conservatives (and MANY more!) actually believe that Human History began 6,000 years ago! - and that the idea of intelligent beings (other than ourselves) inhabiting this Multiverse is something ""only Whackos think about""!   We need more people shaking up the tree!    Soon I'll be back at that monastery's doors, but this time, with a valid passport.  ""Namaste"" and Good Luck to the rest of you!  It's been nice.......but not THAT nice!",5년 전(수정됨),9,

@vasaricorridor7989,"Governments from Around the World Admit They Carry Out False Flag Terror This tactic is so common that it was given a name hundreds of years ago. “False flag terrorism” is defined as a government attacking its own people,  then blaming others in order to justify going to war against the people  it blames. Or as Wikipedia defines it:      False flag operations are covert operations conducted by governments,  corporations, or other organizations, which are designed to appear as if  they are being carried out by other entities. The name is derived from  the military concept of flying false colors; that is, flying the flag  of a country other than one’s own. False flag operations are not limited  to war and counter-insurgency operations, and have been used in peace-time;  for example, during Italy’s strategy of tension.  The term comes from the old days of wooden ships, when one ship would  hang the flag of its enemy before attacking another ship in its own  navy. Because the enemy’s flag, instead of the flag of the real country  of the attacking ship, was hung, it was called a “false flag” attack.  Indeed, this concept is so well-accepted that rules of engagement for  naval, air and land warfare all prohibit false flag attacks.   the Holy See (Sedes Sacrorum) known as the SS  Dutch financier Insider Ronald Bernard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwyMZIyOB2A  Jesus O Savior  I know not if you are real  Come Come live in me ..

It's okay for women to want to be house wives, and it's also okay for women to choose careers over family. What peterson was trying to say that a majority of women naturally choose those roles and are naturally good at it, not that they SHOULD and that they have to take up those role.

@godgod156,"Kind a like how slavery was used as an excuse to fight the Civil War when it was really just about money and profit. Which I am sure if you harken back to the American Revolution it was also about slavery and not religious freedom. considering King Henry made himself the Pope of England, I doubt religious freedom was the cause of the exodus of Europe. Maybe slavery, maybe the future fear of the backlash from the opium wars, maybe the broken promises to France about considering everyone a friend, maybe the continued devaluation of life, maybe just defining love or defining life or defining a cohesive future vision. Last I checked people who love each other don't call one another sinners or evil or demons. And people who love each other definitely refuse to curse one another to hell. I support the National Guard because of fire rescues and the Coast Guard because of water rescues otherwise the military creates obedient zombies. but if you love someone how can you ever leave them behind? If you truly love someone you will follow that individual to the very bowels of existence, to the depths of hell if necessary to either be with the ones you love or rescue those caught in the ricochet.  I will not force you to do anything you don't wish to do. I will not coerce you or deceive you because the truth is barren of coercion or deception. often I have technically not kept my word and that's because some of you are seriously petty as fuck. But the love's honest truth is when we all decide to love we all will win. Come on, love should be more important than revenge or honor. we can hurt or we can heal. We don't have to be BFFs but we should respect each other's desire to love. And maybe you can't understand why someone loves somebody you possibly despise. but you as an individual deserve the same love and forgiveness you would deny another. You live for love, fighting, killing, hurting, is unnecessary. For the sake of love please try to love. Please and thank you, None(since the name God pisses most of you off so much)..",5년 전,0,

@archh2484,"Interesting, but it's just playing with duality again and again.  There are interesting notions about responsability of consciesness. It as to happen to be awaked. Now, the problem is the masculine vision of the archetips (feminine and masculine) and what is conscience itself. There are some male autors (like Carl Jung) that had some access to some vedic teachings, but produced a utterlly distortion of the principles to adjust to the dominant western concept of what is consciess and feminine and masculine energy. A bit like the spiral dinamics is based in this ancient vedic teachings but utterly denies it's source. The feminine archetipe in vedic teachings is ""enlightment"" itself. Or, as you call it, conscience... So, no, conscience doesn't rise from female inconscience according to ancient vedic teaching. It's the complete opposite! The state of receptiveness (in the female archetipe) is a state of contemplation, in wich connecting with the both poles (earth and universe) receives the energy and information that is essencial to the understanding of everything... Therefore, conciesness itself.  As you well know, the genetics (that is a coil of stored information) and archetypal brain structure in both male and female are different.  The fact that women have a bit more of genétique information in their DNA allows women, in a deep meditative state to acces the information contained in the DNA (XX). Therefore a more broad vision of the world. But, to create ""movement"" the only constante of life, this energy is paired with the dinamic energy of male archetype (XY). This is the collaboration of ""vision"" and energy (invisible) and materialization (visible). Energy (earth and cosmic) is gathered and used as fuel to the process of materialization. The problem, therefore of lack of ""conscience"" comes from the fundamental problem of the ""materialistic"" dogma (or ""religion"") that man should dominate (nature, others) to be conscient. When the manifestation of this ""dogma"" is a mirror of that ignorance (environmental destruction, opression, etc.). As you well know, ""women"" are harwired to think broadly, in an integrated system that sees the relation between all things. ""Men"" brain is hardwire to syntetise, producing archetipes to grasp the reality he lives in and better utilize it in the ""construction"" of his reality. Both of them are needed to work in synergy, or else one of the two dimensions will be lost. So: if women don't are objective they will have problems in changing what needs to be changed; if men continue their endeavours ignoring all about the ""hole picture"" he is not conscient that he is destroying the basis of his survival (environment, wars).  Therefore, all pollarities must be united in a dance of the cosmos (shiva and shakti).   IV. THE PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY. ""Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled."" — The Kybalion.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@jjomalley8986,"YouTube just took a long winded history lesson down so i must have told the truth! The government started women's rights, not for women, but to divide and conquer the country with the same script used for thousands of years, but we will stick to the last couple hundred. The elite wanted women's rights to get your kids! By empowering women they divided the traditional family and got more tax payers.  Women have had power more so than men for thousands of years and have brought down empires! This lady knows her stuff! It take all kinds to make a world, but feminism has come with a price. By the time most feminists want to have kids she is past her prime with a career and already has a kid by some cad from those prime years , and are searching for a good father instead of a good fuck! Many men step up to fill this role as she is past her prime years, but it's like heroin , he will never forget the guy who fathered the kid, and she settles for a good guy, only after being hurt by a cad that was just a dog in heat and you can't blame him because she spread her legs, not giving a thought , or being lied to about her school , career, or whatever! She is damaged goods and won't trust the good guy because of the emotional nature of women.  If a woman wants a career , that's fine, if she wants kids and a family, that's fine too, but make up your mind what you are! There's a mate for everybody, but you have free choice and chose what you want to be, or you will be a liar to yourself any any relationship you enter, there he gave much of his money to plastic surgeons will be doubts, but it's totally up to you. Physical beauty is only skin deep, and you can buy it! You have to find someone who can be your best friend and keep the flame lit. I know a couple rich guys who married trophy wives and wow! I couldn't believe how ugly the kids were, and gave much of his money to plastic surgeons! The family unit is the backbone of the world! Forget everything else, women and the rest of the world have to open their eyes and see what and why what's happening! It's about divide and conquer! Women can be and are equal and need to decide if they want the door opened for them or not, or if they want to be drafted into the military, and many do, just let someone know. You have ruined many good men with the help of society! You can't be equal and always be the victim too! You have to chose or take what you deserve!",5년 전,0,

@nickssmirkingrevenge," @laural3738   I approached Jordan Peterson with a high degree of skepticism based on comments of groups with strong voices in today's society. I was expecting, as you have characterised, a hateful fascist. And I expected him to be a hateful fascist with an urbane, sophisticated veneer. However, having seen many of his interviews and lectures, I see none of what I had originally expected and of what you have asserted. Peterson simply lays out reasoned and substantiated arguments that do not accord with what has become mainstream ideological narrative. Unfortunately, this mainstream ideological narrative reacts with outrage and vilification to any challenge or critique. One wonders whether this desire to evade challenge reflects an underlying lack of confidence in the basis of the ideology. This is what Peterson highlights. And he does so with civility and certainly without hate or fascism. Not everything he says accords with my views. But I am happy for my views to be challenged, just as Peterson is happy for his to be challenged. Unfortunately, many people seem to find a challenge of their ideological views as too psychologically confronting to cope with in a civil and rational manner, which is reflective of an emotional and intellectual immaturity.",5년 전,7,

@derekg5563,"I think there is a pretty big conflation about masculinity and femininity that seems to be going on here, at least with David Fuller, Louise Mazanti, and Rafia Morgan, which is that they are implying a strong association between masculinity and aggression. I think that aggression is far too general of a term to link to either masculinity or femininity. Think about it... if a woman is mad at someone, maybe a friend, or her husband, would it at all be weird for her to yell at them? Men complain about women nagging them all the time. But yelling is surely an aggressive thing to do. Likewise, men keeping their cool is often seen as masculine. I think aggressiveness or lack thereof is just universal: it's a strategy that men or women will use to suit their needs. A woman might try to smooth talk you into something, sure, but so could a man. Likewise, a man or woman could yell at you to try to get what they want.   So we need something much more specific than aggressiveness when it comes to assessing this issue. I would actually argue that Cathy Newman was being pretty feminine. She was simply being aggressive and feminine. After all, people aren't saying Peterson was acting feminine in that same interview, even though he was less aggressive, right? So even in that very interview featured throughout this whole video, we seem to have the conflation I'm talking about in action. I say Newman was being feminine because she is trying to use victimhood to win her arguments, and then frame Peterson as a perpetrator. That's feminine. And she could do it gently or aggressively, but as long as she is pursuing this goal, this is a feminine behavior. If a woman is mad about something, she may well use aggression to resolve what is happening. It's less about the tone of the person and more about, their strategic goals -- is the person trying to play victim to win the argument, or are they letting the logic of the argument speak for itself?  Another aspect of being feminine is avoiding risk, particularly, social risk. Newman's aggressive tactics are not generally risky for a woman to do, because she knows that society is typically on the side of the woman who is playing victim, so they will typically declare her the winner of that kind of debate, or at least, not shame her for simply being aggressive towards a man. Maybe this interview was an exception, but generally it is not socially risky for a woman to be aggressive towards a man, because society is protecting her and supporting her in such situations. I think she would be acting in a masculine way if her viewpoint was not socially acceptable, but she was aggressively expressing it anyway (but again, she could try the gentle approach as well; as long as the viewpoint she is expressing is risky to express, she is being masculine by taking that risk).   So I think that it's not really about aggression versus passivity, and that those approaches are just means that the person wants to use to achieve their goals, or means that they personally prefer or identify with. What the goals are, are closer to the mark in defining masculinity or femininity. I am not intending to make what I mentioned here an exhaustive account of the masculine and feminine. Not at all: I think there are several other things that go into masculinity and femininity that I didn't mention here. (For example, I think that masculinity and femininity both value competition, but what separates them is that masculinity values competition for the sake of competition (for example, sports, video games, where often all that a person wins from them is bragging rights). Maybe that's what people mean by ""combative,"" but it's often pretty moot because women are just as competitive as men if they are trying to get something that will benefit them.)  I was just offering an example, that goes in line with my point that aggression and passivity is pretty universal between the genders.  Both men and women can decide if they should be intimidating, or charming, two classic strategies that both know of very well. Sometimes I wonder if people will think that if a wife is yelling at her husband that it doesn't count as aggression simply because she is a woman. No, aggression is aggression. Some feminine traits are better than others depending on the situation, and I do think that there are some feminine traits that would be beneficial to see in journalism that we are not typically seeing, but it has nothing to do with being more or less aggressive.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

They get the reward of feeling their high horse, with the potential political benefit of being able to bully and extract resources for the glory of their tribe.  Its more of the same as the past. Same energy, same desire to dominate another group of people as a tribe for the sins of going against the ideology of the times.

Black americans have serious issues that need to be addressed.  But i read stuff like this as completely brainwashed. There is no way on earth you could ever possibly judge everyone in the past accurately for their place in the universe. Your narrowness of focus is your preference.  Currently BLM is like a mistress to the liberals. They benefit from attention. and liberals benefit from cultural power. But liberals who are deeply guilty for the actions of people they are completely disconnected from havent really thought about it beyond the pretense.

@calunthomas8963,"I've come to this by way of Adam Curtis' documentary 'Century Of The Self', which I would really recommend to anyone here (link at the end). In it, we see Freud's ideas of the id transformed into a tool by his Nephew and Daughter for businesses to manipulate us into ideal consumers. By telling us that we were powerful, idealised individuals, they in fact commodified the very human experience, and that had the unintentioned consequence of changing governments too, and now we're all consumers with no idea of a real self. Adam Curtis did another film called HyperNormalization, (link attatched) ironically on the very heart of the Blue church in the UK, about the decay in Government power and the atomization of the individual. To see Peterson's views reflected not only excellently by David Fuller but in the frame of reference of the afforementioned, it has been catylitic in my development of ideas.    I've read into the hype that Peterson is something of a bogeyman but this really has shifted my perspective, more than the vapid reading I've done before. I've realised I was doing the very thing that Cathy did; I tried to frame Peterson's views to confirm my own biases. The Jungian ideas he espouses are painfully relevant, and I find a lot of Anima to be self-applicable, and I have also encountered a lot of Animus, in school, in the workplace and in my personal life.  We do need to take a stand, but listen to the good doctor and take responsibility for your and each-others rights. We can't have a world worth living in without collective responsibility, and without responsibility we have no rights. Stay safe guys.

In order to conduct any business with any foreign agent or agency, You must be able to speak and understand their language. And when Dealing with the Corporation you must be able to speak and understand the US Code. The Code has a specific wordsmith syntax that each section uses, and that syntax is the DEFINITIONS at the top of each section and subsection in the Code.    42 U.S. Code § 12111.Definitions  U.S. Code  Notes  prev | next  As used in this subchapter: (1)Commission The term “Commission” means the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission established by section 2000e–4 of this title. (2)Covered entity The term “covered entity” means an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee. (3)Direct threat The term “direct threat” means a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation. (4)Employee The term “employee” means an individual employed by an employer. With respect to employment in a foreign country, such term includes an individual who is a citizen of the United States. (5)Employer (A)In general The term “employer” means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such person, except that, for two years following the effective date of this subchapter, an employer means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 25 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year, and any agent of such person. (B)ExceptionsThe term “employer” does not include—  (i)the United States, a corporation wholly owned by the government of the United States, or an Indian tribe; or  (ii)a bona fide private membership club (other than a labor organization) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(c) of title 26 .                                                                                                                                                                  Violators tagged as #FRAUDSTERS in an effort to bring  accountability of the CORPORATION, the United States of  America, Incorporated, and help others reinstate themselves as people and persons by definition, not ""Property of "". We the People Demand the  reinstatement of the Republic taken without the consent of the people by the 39th Congress wordsmithing of the 14th Amendment and the 41st Congress passing the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871. The Corporation was created by deception, and operated in deception for 148+ years. EVERY aspect of that deception is NULL under the ""FRUITS of the POISONOUS TREE DOCTRINE. Removal of corporate policies and return of the Constitution is vital to the survival of all Americans.                                                                                                                                                    So as you can see in the fine print of the 14th Amendment (certificate of ownership) that you are PROPERTY. And in the fine print of the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, (surrender of ""The Republic For the United States of America"" to  ""United States of America, Inc.), the 41st congress  transferred the ""property"" to the Corporation for the defaulted IMF loans Good ole' Honest Abe borrowed to finance the Civil War.                                                             This is why it is imperative that you become fluent in ""Codeanese"", because the ambiguities of the English Language which has been in the tortfeasor handbook for millenniums is the syntax of the US Code. And EVERY interaction with the ""CORPORATION"" is governed by the definitions in the sections and subsections of the code, regardless of the overt grammatical fraud, remember you are dealing with professional criminals who have been operating in deception for over 148 + years, and that is exactly how everything that used to protect ""We The People"" from tyranny of the Government, to the state of all of these agencies weaponized to protect the ""corporate interests"" from all liabilities to the People still unaware that the Constitution was lost with the Republic. I am in the process of laying out the foundation for a  multi-platform location for information to be accessed and evidence gathering, for the purpose of future litigation. PLEASE, do your part in helping others onto the path to reprogramming themselves so we can uncomplicate the process of changing the definition of the ""property"" back to ""PEOPLE and PERSONS"" necessary to restore the Republic for ourselves and stop waiting for the empty promises to give the power back to the people which is just another lie.  Update; #FRAUDSTERS is the central location that you can add verifiable government criminals and their crimes for the inevitable day of judgement that will follow the return of the Republic for the United States of America the original name of this country, not the United States of America, Inc. as it is listed in 42 USC 12111 definitions",5년 전,0,

That allows me to be a man and accepts our differences. I love when women wear dresses because I think femininity is beautiful but I also love jeans and cowboy boots. Its not  sexism and I'm not old fashioned by any means. I just appreciate a feminine look on a lady. At the end of the day, I want a person to grow with and that practices love,positive actions and follows through on those. As far as chores,femininity and masculinity doesn't mean disagreement,it just means we are different and can exchange positive things through our physical ability. One isn't better than the other, we can just do things differently but equally as important.I cook,clean and sew but that doesn't diminish my masculinity at all. I think a large part of the problem is misogyny and or the disrespect of different genders.All of my life this society has given me terrible messages at how to treat the opposite sex and anyone who is not part of the norm. The respect we give to each other is everything and as a man I want to respect women to the fullest. The problem is that as much as men disrespect women,women disrespect themselves just as much. I'm not saying men aren't responsible for this, I'm just saying too many women play into it and this sends a mixed signal to young and adult males.

The problem is until women are actually physically treated less violently from diapers on up we cannot actually choose our roles we're programmed to respond to what we see and feel around us and what we experience. And like it or not, most female children-from childhood-experience more severe punishment, more psychological damage and negativity than males.

At 3 some babies can't walk or talk yet, so undoing heavy programming and indoctrination provided to us at that age is rather ridiculous. So saying that we ""play into"" something might be better looked at as cultural brainwashing.

Before anyone jumps in and says 'not me', I'm well aware some men do it, but look at the studies on domestic labour and who does it, THEN come talk to me.

@frauleinhohenzollern,"I feel the EXACT same way!  The ""nation snatchers"" are waging a cultural war, the masculine and feminine are under attack and the results have been catastrophic.  They tell women that's it's oppressive to be a mother and raise your kids-instead waste your child bearing years and pursue a meaningless corporate career to prove that were the same as men.  Simultaneously everything masculine is under attack. Masculine behavior, fashion, masculine gender roles, fatherhood, and men in general. ESPECIALLY white men. If you look at testosterone levels decreasing it's clear there is something deliberately being done to chemically pacify men. Suicide rates, drug overdose and disease among men is also rising fast. The results are clear... They retreat into video games and watch super hero movies into their 20s and 30s. With birth control and abortions on every corner there is no incentive to get married before having sex, the man doesn't need to be a suitable mate and the woman doesn't need to be careful about who she sleeps with. Sex has become 100% risk free, it's sole purpose is to create life, but Hollywood brainwashes us into thinking sex is a game.  The destruction of the nuclear family will be our undoing. It's already started.  Not only are we being conditioned to not want a family, being poisoned to not be able to have children, we can't even afford to have children if we wanted to. 60 years ago you could start a family at 20.. The man would get a job and make enough for a nice home, car, and one vacation a year while the wife would stay home and raise the kid, once the children were in school she could spend her days pursuing hobbies, volunteering in the community, even get a part time job for extra income for a bigger house..  At the end of the day the family would get together and discuss their day as they ate a wholesome nutritious meal... Now everything is jammed full of preservatives, GMOs, fake sugar, soy....   Now both parents must work full time while someone else raises their child.",3년 전,1,

You can be de-platformed for simply having a side to an argument, or for simply expressing your right and freedom to freedom of speech. Propaganda (fake news) is now the false reality that we exist under. A lot of people may call me delusional, but Andrew Tate has helped me understand my role as a masculine man in society. He’s inspired me to become the better version of myself. He’s made me understand that being masculine isn’t just physical strength, but also about stoicism and discipline. He made me realize that as a man, I must do the things that I don’t feel like doing and that I must approach everyday this way. I must say, it has helped me more than I could ever imagine… I now wake up very early every morning and I tell myself to “get after it”, because in some place elsewhere, there’s a man that wants it more than me. I’ve now thrown myself into the competitive world of men and I’m willing to work harder than I ever have, everyday. After a day of real hard work, I feel great.

I’m a single mom and have always had to play the part of the disciplinarian AND the nurturer, which is a fine line to walk in parenthood. I was so focused on my child and doing everything around our home and property that my feminine/masculine features were the furthest thing from my mind, but my tomboy side has always been at the forefront due to the chores and jobs I’ve had to do for years.  My fiancé and I are getting married in October, this will finally allow me (to an extent) to allow my feminine side to bloom.

Where is the love and the natural sense to Wana parent your child not chore them yes they should help out and do the shit you do but to a degree and it's should be about life skills not chores and punishment that ruined my childhood and my relationship to my parent it was about what I didn't do not hat I tried to do.

Much more tender than the bipolar heartless mothers portrayed in many stories.

@jonathangems,"There are a few elephants in the room in this documentary. Two main big ones being Communism and the global banking dictatorship. Aristotle said the first thing you need to do in order to make assertions, or have a conversation, is to define your terms.  The term 'liberal' is not defined. It is equated with the idea of gender equality, which is a Communist idea. Does this mean 'liberals' are communists? The 'alt-right' is equated with 'white nationalism.' But 'white nationalism' was an idea of the 19th century British ruling class, as expressed by people like Cecil Rhodes, who believed white people were superior to the people of all other races, and therefore had a 'right to rule.'  Yet many of the people that 'liberals' consign to the 'alt-right' are non-white, like Candace Owens and Kanye West. The truth is that the makers of this film are tangled up in the divide-and-rule swamp created and promulgated by the current rulers of society, who are the central bankers. The central bankers, who control the currency and credit of almost all the world, who own and control the mainstream media, almost all of academia, almost all the big transnational corporations, and most of the politicians, and give the CIA their orders, also employ strategists, such as Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brezinsky, to program people with false ideas, and create or amplify conflicts between them. What is claimed to be 'liberal' is the ideology of the Comintern – the propaganda arm of international communism, which was created and funded by the same international banks that funded Lenin and Trotsky, and still rule us today. Political Correctness, a product of the 'liberals' was first concocted by Vladimir Lenin to suppress dissent in Russia. Peterson is described as a ""classical liberal,"" which, in modern parlance is a 'libertarian' – i.e. someone who believes in freedom of thought and freedom of speech. But he's also described as 'alt-right,' which is painted as the racist, totalitarian ideology of 19th century British oligarchs. In reality, Peterson is a libertarian free-thinker like, say, Voltaire, or Thomas Paine. And the 'liberal establishment' that opposes him is our modern version of the aristocracy – the tyrannical bankers and their many fellow-travellers and flunkies.",5년 전,0,

It happened after I started realizing that responsibility sucked but had positive benefits, like starting to be seen ""as a man"" and be looked to for advice or looked up to. There's certain things in life that give you a mental breakthrough of sorts that is life changing. I think it can be different things that trigger it in different people but I feel like we can cultivate self responsibility and help others have these breakthroughs. It works both ways by self discovery and influence, we can do alot with the influence if we're responsible and examples ourselves, if we're willing to help guide and pick up others who are ""down"" within our means while continuing to grow ourselves. Capitalism is a cruel bitch though and pulls at our pockets constantly if we're ""surviving"" and trying to build and change our environment for the better!!! LOVE THY NEIGHBOR!!!",5년 전,65,

They are the ones who need to be restrained and limited in the scope of their influence. This is the reason that ultimatly we need prisons and capital punishment.

@magicivy9087,"I really enjoyed this conversation and intersted in doing some reading of his works or hearing his lectures. It's important to understand people, society, and life in general, especially as we are raising our children in a society such as this, with so many outside sources of influence on young minds. Especially this issue of attacking anyone who does not agree with a view or opinion.-that upsets me. Things have changed a lot since the cave man  and somehow the ""cave-man and cave woman"" have to adjust to a modern world-the only way to find balance in the  2 extremes is discussion and thought-thought can't be brought about without discussion. I personally am not a feminist, and don't even understand it....I like being a female and feminine things and feminism seems to dislike that-  yet have repeatedly found that in my life I am forced to  ""be the man"" whether I want to or not. Being that I either had a tyrant or a sissy  in relationships-so this is one way to understand it as well as society as a whole.            BTW I have found that from the Tyrant, I learned how to use all the tools at his command and with the sissy I impressed him immensely with my handiness. I escaped the tyrant and dumped the sissy.  I had a son that once asked when he was small, ""Can boys use tools too?""   Anyway, it has been a challenge raising kids alone, but my daughter is about to graduate as a pharmacist and said she never wants to be dependent on anyone, and is quite feminine. She paid off 2 cars by 25 and put herself through school. My son, married well at only 22 , and is becoming a responsible young man (I kicked him out of my house at 20 and said you will sink or swim , but you will do it yourself.....long story). Had some rough times, but he's a lucky young man as well. Here he is working, has a home, helps around the house.....it's a shock to me, but again, his wife is likely to thank more than me, as I had spoiled him-I realized that at some point.Both very responsible. Guess I'm lucky too.       Anyway, through school, I took both philosophy and sociology-it opened my mind  to another level. Basic philosophy should be in school curriculum.I did not grow up with any religious , or racial dogma, and our mother exposed us to all things wordly and cultural in art, music, politics, science, nature, fashion, history, on and on. Yet I was very isolated and even went to boarding school. So again, taking those classes introduced a whole new thought provoking world, which I believe has helped my children as well, while raising them.  Especially right now with all the media, and shutting everything down....a time to THINK-not react, about what is really going on-we can see the forest through the trees. You cannot judge without understanding perspectives-you cannot understand perspectives without knowledge , and you must again understand where/who you are getting that knowledge from and even how it got there.      While discussing or commenting on this corona virus online, I find that people either understand the point I'm making, or they don't. When they don't, many people it seems , somehow feel it destroyed THEIR perspective, which is their reality-and thus, they ""attack"" me, which is an emotional reaction, rather than a counterpoint. When I do get a counterpoint, it's bringing up some single bit of information that doesn't address what I said at all; much like, showing me 1 piece of a 100 piece puzzle and expecting me to see the whole picture they are trying to piece together. I just take the pieces and add them to the puzzle I started which already has about 80 pieces-not sure if that makes sense. Overall, I am seeing how easily people's persectives are formed/influenced through propaganda, which then makes me worried about what's going to become of the U.S. simply because too many people no longer think for themselves or know any other ways of thinking......",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@janiceparks7742,"Haven’t finished listening but I’m almost sixty and my daughter, thirty, sitting here next to me just heard him say, in a nutshell, males drawing on their female side equals: sad, feel bad. And women drawing on their male side equals: powerful purposeful. Can any woman hear that without laughing? Cuz we couldn’t. Smile, guys. You look so much more attractive when you smile. If men want to find a purpose so bad they need to find one where they don’t always feel the need to establish dominance. That’s one reason why supporting the ideals behind our justice system used to be such a golden ring. It was filled with great equal rules until the dark forces began to muddy them. Conservatives stand for stepping on necks. They rarely decide in favor of the commoner. Liberals make people treat each other equally... and no, they’re not asking nicely because equality is the basis of our law. The Red Religion must hate everything about Jesus... otherwise their behavior is too hard to explain. That the Blue Church is ‘chaotic’ and that somehow ‘openness’ translates into chaos and “eating their young” and will cause the Blue Church to disappear... I don’t see it unless you think the church is the building and not the spirit of God housed within the individual Christian? If you don’t mind a nudge in a needed direction I would say look for meaning in the job God gave us to do which is to be good stewards of the Earth and take care of/ dominate animals/create food (since the Getting Kicked Out of Eden thing) and act as if God is watching you live your lives. Scripturally speaking God PAIRED Adam and Eve but it was man’s decision to dominate her. Being more godly does not include dominating women... (Think: Jesus/human partner within everyone blending vs. All Powerful God dominates controls His tribe and impresses the other tribes). Perhaps if one wanted to draw on their female side and feel less forlorn one might stop feeling as if they are required to dominate women. The sooner you feel you can stop dominating women maybe the sooner you can stop whining and pretending you’re drawing on your feminine side.",5년 전,2,

@TheGunnCat,"I want to say this even though I am only four minutes into the video. There's several ways to enlightenment, but western culture has historically never embraced the idea of it. The closest it gets is the idea of salvation, which of course is a viable method since it's an achievable goal subjectively. Rather, we have replaced enlightenment with cultural idealism, specifically Manifest Destiny. Clearly the masterminds behind this paradigm shift understood the benefits of a collective goal which enforced the idea of totalitarianism and wage slavery.   Gurdjieff realized the western mind could reach an enlightened state, thus leading to recognizing collective existence within the Matrix. However, one would need a classical western education to achieve this state. And clearly the educational system in place does not tackle more sophisticated ideas like the Collective Unconscious or archetypes. As Alan Watts said, it's all a Game.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

Peterson's thinking is a stringent limitation on what, when and how humans can achieve their goals, using historical and meta information (most of it defunct in a modern world) to define life. He uses logic to define humans when it is ideologically flawed to do. Humans got to where they are through ingenuity and use of the creative side of the brain.

In her own words she describes the role as, ""Ambassador Delenn is an extraordinary character. She combines so many different traits. She's tough, but vulnerable... She's strong, but feminine... She's a pacifist, but can be militaristic... She has depth and spirituality, but can be funny and light at times... So yes, I think she's a great role model - not only for women - but for everyone."" I also found the love affair between John Sheridan and Delenn to be the best representation of true love that has ever been expressed by any TV or movie. Mira's portrayal was simple, yet absolutely brilliant.  I highly recommend this series, in Mira's words, ""Babylon 5 is definitely not a fantasy.

@ElvenWisdom,"I believe Jordan Peterson rubs people the wrong way because he talks in ""definitives"" meaning he defines people and things, and almost does not allow the freedom of exceptions to the rules. His view of political leanings is very narrow minded. He does not lead with his intuition, but rather only his logical mind which sometimes makes preemptive judgements and assumptions about other souls. Yet, the intuition will tell you all is One and we must strive to find these commonalities rather than differences. I do like him though, and what he is trying to do for men of today's age, but sometimes he goes off topics and it becomes very opinion based with his biases.

There is no point in being with a man if you refuse to have sex with him you feel your life it at stake. There is no point in being with a man who hurts his children. There is no point in being with a man who doesn't provide for his family and lives off the wife's savings. There is no point being with a man who has no respect for his wife, constantly putting her down, expecting her to be someone she is not. There is no point being with a man that speaks highly of other women and how sexy other woman are and how better they perform in the bedroom. There is no point being with a man if he wants to be with someone else and constantly reminds his wife regularly. There is no point in being with a man who hurts, physically and emotionally damages the woman/his wife mother of his children constantly, because of his frustrations and shortcomings and irrational intent to over power that woman/his wife, the mother of his children.  This is why woman now are wanting a career, earning good money, providing for their children, having savings in their account to spare, not being put down, overcome with abuse being a slave to sex, consequently being hit, bones broken, bruised, emotionally shattered or even killed. It's gone on for years relentlessly and woman have had to step up. Girls mothers and good father's have had to teach their daughters to be strong, protect themselves and be independent.  It's time men stepped up and took responsibility as a man of rationality, mutuality, forthcoming, a leader for the greater good, supportive, capable, honest, sincere, loyal, encouraging and good at whatever they are capable of doing as a man and not be porn obsessed. Life does not evolve around your penis, stop wasting your time in that limited, rediculous sense of selfish existence. It's a waste of time and unproductive.

@ronaldgreene5733,"Ideologies handicap and divide while politics is the art of division. Always we must look to have a group of people in mind standing behind us before we feel legitimate for any point of view to claim as our own. This is the illusion provided by ideology, in order to sell out our inherent abilities to think and act for ourselves, in the illusion that we cannot be trusted to do so. Once lines have been established, no dialogue of a realistic and effective manner can take place between groups -- and in fact within one party or group, a greatly reduced effective communication is often the case because one must constantly support and justify oneself within the group and the accepted ideology always in sight of the opposing group. This creates the assumption of right, which needs someone else to be wrong and a constant sense of conflict and justification necessary under which few new ideas can be easily introduced or entertained. Particularly dangerous is the fact that during this process, we lose and no longer recognize the concept of initiative involved. Always it is attributed somewhere else in a sense of vagary at best and most often no need at all to acknowledge the very concept of initiative for information, where it originates as well as the decision making in government and elsewhere, and in originating any philosophical narrative, any ideological perspective and the concept of responsibility for establishing any point of view.    Lost is the ability to communicate in real terms. Exceptions are the break away from specific institutions of consensual behavior that remains unacknowledged in its compulsive nature and often cult like. As an exception in opening up a form of true discourse between individuals, the walkaway movement is a good example, while although it focuses upon leaving the democratic party to join the conservative movement and perhaps the republican party, it impresses no requirements at all upon people other than to share a sincere acknowledgement in the value of leaving a party that is corrupt in its expression and mindset while openly accepting libertarians and independents. Parties such as republican and democrat are inherently born of corruption that through normalization becomes unrecognized as we sell out our ability to think and communicate in real terms. We don't need a group of people to stand behind us, rendering us hostage to ourselves and our perceived opponents. We need ourselves first and foremost as individuals, able to think and communicate without fear each moment to do so. The meaning of the word ""individual"" means undivided. Only when one is divided within oneself does one then need to look elsewhere and judge based upon any other perspective than our own.. Initiative by its very meaning must come from within the individual. Only when one is divided within oneself through false concepts of guilt conditioned into the individual, can one then be engaged through distraction to look outside oneself for another to lead the way and to choose various of the forms of division to justify oneself -- that one must be wrong for another to be right, that one must be bad for another to be good and to be forever compulsively involved in playing the role on one side provided through various ideologies that are inherently engaged in such purposes for those it can benefit through influence.    One who is not divided within and retains a true sense of initiative cannot be set against another. This is the divine birthright of each individual, that only through distraction can then be engaged in unnecessary forms of division and to judge unnecessarily with outside notions of what is right and wrong because we no long trust in our true nature.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@bamadixiedelightlucyq777,Any one person that speaks the truth especially the truth that comes from Christianity they are heavily targeted. This is why Christianity is and always will be under persecution. When people become so confused and hopeless is when people will begin asking for help. When this happens is when the conversation truly begins and those that have the answers like Jordan Peterson and Christian pastors will be appreciated once again. I believe the time is coming for a Christian Revival. The Satanist in power knows this which is why they will use fear to halt people's movement and speech. However their deception and manipulation of the forked tongues you hear and see will become under fire because no power shall hold down Gods children. Every empire has fallen when Gods people has been enslaved. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire or Ancient Egypt. This is exactly what you see taking place in America today. The devils bondages of using the magic and sorcery of msm movies music and gov't is being broken. The breakdown of power of principalities over everyone is on display for those with eyes to see and ears to hear. Jesus Christ died for our sins and whoever shall believe in him shall have everlasting life. Through seeking his face and his guidance in all that we do is how one has a relationship with him. You don't get to heaven by just your works and good deeds. Its truly having a relationship with him. And to do that you must have self discipline and constant seeking of him to guide you. He will answer your prayers when you least expect it and trusting that he will provide for you. If you are broke and struggling seek him and trust in him that he will bring you through it. He never fails to answer your call. God Bless.,5년 전,0,

@lluc-e2n,"As a Christian, I was taught that men and women both lived under the curse of Genesis 3.  In Jesus, the curse is broken and men and women are reconciled and find their true identity again.  No longer do men ""lord it over women"" or live to work, rather than work in order to live. and, no longer do women ""desire to please man at the cost of compromising herself.""  It is time to find our identity as redemned, beautiful human beings, and stop living in the curse. Pope John Paul explains this wonderfully in the Theology of the Body.  The answer to what ills you is Jesus.  In choosing to become a man, a part of family, He shows the Way for all of us.    ""To the woman he said, “I will make your pains in childbearing very severe;      with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband,     and he will rule over you.” 17 To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’    “Cursed is the ground because of you;     through painful toil you will eat food from it     all the days of your life. 18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you,     and you will eat the plants of the field. 19 By the sweat of your brow     you will eat your food until you return to the ground,     since from it you were taken; for dust you are     and to dust you will return.”",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@danielkennedy4518,"Capitalism mainly benefits the customer and should be called Customerism.  No one is forced to buy from or work for anyone – all transactions are voluntary. The customer freely chooses to enter any transaction and does so for his/her benefit. If the capitalist doesn’t serve the customer he/she will fail. It is truly “Power to the People”. It incentivizes work, innovation and progress. It decentralizes wealth and therefore power.  It has raised more people out of poverty than any other system in human history. It has done more to improve the quality of life for everyone on the planet than any other system in human history. Ask yourself - would you rather live in China under Mao or in China today now that it has accepted private property and markets? This doesn’t mean there is no role for government - prevention of monopoly and abuse of workers apply.   Turning over control of all the money to the same people who control all the guns is not a really good idea. Fascism/Socialism/Marxism is “Power to the State”.  It incentivizes centralization of control. It has given the world Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Castro, Chavez, Maduro, the Kim family etc. etc. etc. Marxists have murdered well over 100 million of their own citizens – a number only exceeded in murders by Muslims.   It's all about incentives. While the private sector is rewarded for efficiently satisfying customers, the public sector is rewarded by loyalty to superiors and amassing and centralizing power. Public sector bureaucrats are in fact punished for efficiency and problem solving - they lose funding and therefore status and power. Every page, every sentence, every word of legislation and regulation is fertilizer that enables public sector bureaucrats to grow the bureaucracy and the power of the state. Consider for example: • Today the US federal government debt is over $23 trillion yet come the end of the fiscal year every federal government bureaucracy will do everything it can to spend every last dollar of its budget.  • What has the Environmental Protection Agency accomplished other than insuring “dirty” jobs and processes move to such ecological wonderlands as China, India, Bangladesh, etc.? • Why is American education poorer but vastly more expensive today than before the creation of the Department of Education? • What has the Department of Energy accomplished re energy independence - the ethanol lunacy which is depleting the Ogallala Aquifer?  • Look at Income Tax law. Why is the cost of compliance (time wasted, litigation, record keeping, mal-investment, fraud, 100K+ IRS workforce, preparer fees, etc.) with our 75,000+ page Income Tax Code approaching half a trillion dollars a year?   From Chinese economist Zhang Weiying: ""We human beings always seek happiness. Now there are two ways. You make yourself happy by making other people unhappy - I call that the logic of robbery. The other way, you make yourself happy by making other people happy - that's the logic of the market.” Which way do you prefer?",5년 전,0,

@SimonWorlds,"""If you want to know who reigns control over you, look to who you are not allowed to criticise"".   I Don't mean this to be racist, but Antisemitism is at the heart of lots of it in our world. I am not talking about Jews per-say, but Zionist Jews who control our world.   Feminism is a Zionist creation and when i say Feminism, I mean the toxic version of it, referring to toxic feminists who are a product of this agenda, which started a long time ago by the Rockefeller's themselves. It was first started to get women into the workplace because only half the population was being taxed. Now if we want to play the ""blame game"" we should be blaming powerful men for what has happened to women, because in a nutshell, this is exactly what has happened. Zionists playing ""god"" over us all and looking at the human race as nothing more than a large paddock of livestock, from which money can be extracted. So many people will laugh at what i have said here, but one only needs to understand how much power Israel has over even the American political system and many more things will become apparent. DHS, FBI, the CIA are all governed by Jewish interests.   The ADL is another powerful group which keeps the agenda moving in their favor.  The Jewish agenda is to break up the family unit now, to get everyone as a number and not have an identity anymore, hence the sudden attempted indoctrination towards children, with transgender stuff being pushed down their throats.  This doco is a breath of fresh air, especially with what Louise Mazanti had to say, Louise has a great view IMO and as a woman, she should hold herself high with pride.  Her openness and vulnerability is her strength and power.    I love what Jordan Peterson has done, it has been a lifeline I think for men and women and with people seeing who and why this has all happened can allow a shift into unification between men and women again.   Humans naturally band together to fight a common threat and when humanity can see this threat, the power will be back with the people, which i believe is already beginning to happen, such an interesting time to be alive.",5년 전,0,

He just offers up commonly held ideas said a few different ways and asks hypothetical questions to which he says the answer is ""insert pointless diatribe"" and trails off to another thing that has nothing to do with the actual topic at hand. Rinse and repeat. When he does get called out on being factually wrong and misleading he lies and says he didn't say it or that you just don't understand.

Which focuses more on the biological sexes and you must have everything in the convesation for it to be a healthy conversation for everyone.

@Harry-qh5rt," @disorganizedclutter5513  Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, is a silver spoon socialist (SSS). The SSS generally has so much money they are out of touch with the reality most people live with. They don't understand that $100 a month for some people can be the difference between eating or not eating. So, they tend to spend other people's money with little regard for the damage they're doing. In their version of reality, everyone should get everything for free. This is because they grew up with rich parents that gave them everything for free. They think there should be no borders. This is because they grew up protected and have no clue of how bad people can be. Because they are so out of touch, they have a hard time convincing others of their ideas. If you were to talk with a SSS, you would most likely reject their idea. This frustrates the SSS, so they tend toward dictatorships where people are forced to accept their ideas. Justin Trudeau is so much like an SSS it would be comical if he weren't in charge of a country (which only happened because of his father).",5년 전,11,
@Harry-qh5rt,"Your country is 80% Catholic, about 92% Christian in total. The religion comes with it's own order for society. Where there are well defined roles that all participants agree with, you will get harmony, or at least the perception of harmony. As with all power, it can be abused. When the religion goes too far to control and/or subjugate a group, the oppressed will fight back. It has been the rejection of religion in the Americas that has lead to a lack of defined roles. In the absence of order, chaos will thrive. This is where we are in the west. There are ideologies all jockeying for that position of societal order. In too many cases, we get ideas that are not accepted by most people, so the groups that support those ideas turn violent as a backlash to being rejected by society (eg: antifa). For a while, we had nationalism as the lead ideology, but again once that power was gained, it got abused. Then we had consumerism for a while, but people grew up and realized how vacuous it was and ultimately it did not fully take hold as the lead. The current US president is trying to bring back nationalism with decent success, but time will tell. In my opinion, nationalism has been the most successful but you have to have leaders who are worthy of trust. Trust is in short supply lately due to the abuse of power in the past.",5년 전,6,

He continually attacks and insults Steven, and when Steven protests, Rogan claims it's all in good fun because they are 'good friends', but it's obvious that Steven doesn't feel the same way, and besides myself, I haven't heard anybody talking about Rogan's behavior during this interview. It seems to me that it's just been accepted or ignored because it's Joe Rogan, who has the biggest podcast so far in YouTube history., or it's been 'written off' because Rogan was intoxicated. I often wonder what would have happened if Rogan would have badgered a female(good friend) guest, in the same fashion. I've seen many other similar interviews where it was very obvious that the interviewer was on the attack of the guest from the start of the interview, yet they played down and/or justified their behavior as if it was trivial, or the guest and every observer is simply delusional if they interpreted the behavior as being aggressive, negative, unruly, or inappropriate somehow. I would love to hear your opinion(s) on this and/or any similar cases.

@da1ved,"Covert hypnosis - Subliminal Programming - Mind Control Implants  Covert hypnosis:  When a person is the victim of covert hypnosis, he doesn't know that he is being hypnotized, this makes him more open to questions and commands. For example, if a person under covert hypnosis is asked, ""tell me all your secrets"", they will comply with little to no resistance. If a person under voluntary hypnosis is asked the same thing, they will refuse to answer. During the first session the victim is programmed with a trigger phrase so that he can be instantly hypnotized in subsequent sessions. Any victim can be covertly hypnotized numerous times over months or years. Every year in America and Canada thousands of people are victims of illegal covert hypnosis, and 99.9% will never know that they were covertly hypnotized. The premise is to steal private information from the victim. Only go to a psychologist recommended by someone you know, or don't go alone, and always take a hidden recording device. In 1970, only 20% of psychologists were women. Now in 2020, over 80% of psychologists are women. This is not a coincidence, it was by design. By favoring women students over male students applying to get a degree in psychology, women have slowly dominated the field.   Subliminal Programming:  The subconscious mind holds the essence of who we are, our character, personality, what we like, hate, fear, desire, etc. Subliminal programming using audio subliminal messages can reprogram any aspect of our minds. With enough time, it can influence or change our political or religious beliefs, change our sexual orientation, and even control our dreams, because our hearing and subconscious minds are awake 24/7. Audio subliminal programming can cure most neuroses like PTSD, OCD, phobias, mild depression, etc., in a few weeks or months. It can also temporarily alleviate the symptoms of most psychoses. Before the 1995 referendum in Quebec Canada, the people of Quebec were influenced on multiple radio and tv stations, with audio subliminal messages telling them to vote NO to separation from Canada.  Mind Control Implants:  The implant is a tiny radio receiver, less than 1/16th of an inch in size. At the victim's next dental appointment, the dentist puts the implant in the upper jaw in a cavity under the filling, or it is inserted behind the upper teeth and gums and glued to the jaw bone. Unless you get a good quality x-ray or scan, it's impossible to find. The sound with subliminal messages resonates through the jaw bone to the inner ear, similar to how conduction headphones work. The implant is powered by the radio signal, similar to how a crystal radio is powered. The implant is literally a remote control, some asshole speaks into a microphone, or plays pre-recorded audio file, connected to a transmitter, it could be miles away, the implant receives the radio signal, converts it to a subliminal message sound with a tiny piezoelectric ""speaker"" on the implant, it resonates thru the jaw bone to the inner ear, and the person will think, say, or do whatever the subliminal message tells him to do. The only way you can know if you have a mind-control implant in your tooth or jaw is by a constant high pitch noise in your head. It may change in volume and frequency. If you go to the doctor, they will tell you that it's tinnitus and there is no known cause or cure. If you suspect you have an implant, go to a country to a dentist and  try to find the implant and take it out. Some mass murderers committed their crimes because they were programmed by the government or other self-interest corrupt organizations. In Canada, the shooter Mark Lepine in the 1989 Ecole Polytechnic, and Dr. Valery I. Fabrikant in the 1992 Concordia university shootings were both victims of subliminal programming using mind control implants in their teeth/jaw. The reason for this was to influence the government to pass new laws banning larger guns, and it worked. Canada spent billions buying large guns from people, so there would be fewer mass shootings, but the main reason was to disarm the people so they would be defenseless. Some of the mass murders in America were also committed by shooters with mind control implants in their heads. The one that stands out is the Sandy Hook shootings because it was an extreme attempt by the government to try and pass laws restricting the sale of larger guns.  The mental health system is very corrupt. Power is always corrupt.",5년 전,0,

@Peace2all4vr,"Like a lot baby-boomers. I was raised in a household where the father had PTSD from WW2.  In this type of household the father screamed everyday, punished us by beating us, went out with his buddies every week-end & came home drunk,   never participated in our school activities,  nor in any work in the house (women's job).   I remember asking my mother why she puts up with that crap and her answer was ""what can I do?  Where can I go?  There are no jobs out there for women that pay enough to support me and you kids.""  The young women who grew up in those homes became adamant about NEVER putting up with that crap and saw their liberation from all that screaming and hitting by having a good paying job when married.  It was their back door exit to a peaceful existence and a sane life from an out-of-control man.  AND, these women also became adamant about never putting up with violent, tyrannical men ever again, including in the workplace and marriage. As time went on these women  became more strident, more vocal, more aggressive, and intolerant  of anything masculine.  The men who grew up in these homes were just as terrified of their fathers as were the women, so they understood what their sisters were saying, felt guilt and shame about being men and masculine as they identified with their masculine fathers.   So men, filled with guilt and shame,  caved when they came up against their sisters' outrage against the masculine.  They became passive and confused about what their role should be.  It was a logical outcome.  But now the pendulum has swung too far in one direction.  I'm 73 and in my family, most of the men are doormats and most of the women are bossy bitches.   It is sickening!   Somehow this needs to change, and I guess it will change when men rebel against being cast as a doormat or a tyrant.

WHEN you read the newspaper, watch television, or listen to the radio, you see and hear many stories of crime, war, and terrorism. Perhaps you personally are suffering because of an illness or because someone you love has died.  ￼  Ask yourself:  Is this what God wants for me and my family?  Where can I find help to cope with my problems?  Will there ever be real peace?  The Bible provides convincing answers to those questions.   THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT GOD WILL DO AMAZING THINGS ON THE EARTH.  People will no longer feel pain, grow old, or die.​—Revelation 21:4  “The lame will leap like the deer.”​—Isaiah 35:6  “The eyes of the blind will be opened.”​—Isaiah 35:5   The dead will be brought back to life.​—John 5:28, 29  No one will get sick.​—Isaiah 33:24  Everyone on earth will have plenty to eat.​—Psalm 72:16  ￼   BENEFIT FROM WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES  ￼  It would be easy to think that what you have read in the first few pages of this book is just a dream. But God has promised to make those changes on the earth very soon, and the Bible explains how he will do so. The Bible does more than that. It tells us what we need to know in order to be truly happy and enjoy life right now. Think for a moment about the things that make you worry. These may include money or family matters, bad health, or the death of someone you love. The Bible can help you to cope with these problems, and it can comfort you by answering such questions as these:  Why do we suffer?  How can we cope with our problems?  Can our family be happy?  What happens to us when we die?  Will we ever see our dead loved ones again?  Why can we be confident that God will do everything that he has promised?   The fact that you are reading this book shows that you want to know what the Bible teaches. This book will help you. There are questions for the paragraphs, which will help you understand the Bible better. Millions of people have enjoyed discussing the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. We hope you will too. May God bless you as you discover what the Bible can teach you!  GET TO KNOW YOUR BIBLE  THE Bible contains 66 books and letters. Each one is divided into chapters and verses. This makes it easy to find a verse. When this publication cites a scripture, the first number after the name of the Bible book indicates the chapter, and the following number refers to the verse. For example, if you see “2 Timothy 3:16,” it means the second letter to Timothy, chapter 3, verse 16. When you look up the scriptures cited, you will quickly become familiar with the Bible. You could also start reading the Bible each day. If you read three to five chapters a day, you can read the entire Bible in a year.

This is a system used alot to control what people think. The more people you think agree on a certain subject even if you do not the more chance you will see their side or even start to agree with it. People tend to not stand for something they believe in if they think they are standing alone. They will slander anyone who will try and disprove their ideals. That's why this is an age of insults not facts. They want you to think feelings are more important than facts and reason. The victim card is the most used. Who is going to argue with someone who has been wronged? That would make them a bad person right? That also allows these ""victims"" power to do and say whatever they want and have no repercussions or scrutiny. Here for a spot of honesty. I'm a Male and I was molested and raped at the age of 8 by a gay man who was a friend of the family. I was afraid my friends and family would find out and call me a coward or a wuss for letting that happen. That was my first thought. Now on the media's mindset I should be able to hate gay men and accuse them for all the wrongs in my life. What I did was blame the one person who is guilty and leave it at that. Another side is yes it happened to me but I dont have the right to cry I'm a victim for years and years about it. I get help if I want it and back then boys were not considered as potential rape victims so we were taught nothing. The people crying rape and using the term so loosely are trash in my eyes. These people who claim they were raped and then just stay in that status. They dont try and get help they dont try and get on with their lives they just want it as a status symbol. I do counseling for children who have been violated and it is not something to be used as a weapon to get your way. I've went home and cry from some of the stories.

@justsumname,"Paglia calls herself transgender but does not demand I subscribe.   Okay.   Example:   she is a classical liberal, someone I can live with and tolerate, quite easily in fact.   But personally, I do not subscribe to 'transgenderism'.  In my mind, that is not a real thing.   But that's okay.   Nor do I demand that she subscribe to my personal viewpoint.   We are both classical liberals, and on a personal as well as a political level, we can coexist peacefully.   BUT... what should govt do with her?   Is she male or female?   Can she bare children or not?  If arrested, where to put her?   With the men?   Or the women?   What public restroom does she use?  ...Let's keep going:   what do insurance companies do with her?   Will she be a client who consumes average much more than man?   Auto insurance, probably not.   Health insurance, I am certain she will need more than most men.   It seems to me that transgenderism is simply not compatible with the human race or a civil society.   I am open to ideas and solutions.   But I do not see how 'everything' can somehow be decreed equal to 'everything else' and the human race continue to perpetuate.   We will eventually kill ourselves off via outright stupidity... lack of reason and intelligence ... because 'equality' will drive everything DOWN.   ...Not to mention  moral boundaries, like the laws of nature, just cannot be ignored forever... without harsh consequence.",5년 전,0,

@cechanowicz,"As a researcher into the nature of, the essens of and the potential of awareness in humans, I have discovered a missing distinction concerning the differences between left and right brain hemisphere functions/rational and emotional intelligence/masculine and feminine energies - that resolve all of the conflicts that appear to be discussed at this time, and throughout all of the ages in our history.   Those distinctions is that all rational functions attributed to the left hemisphere of the brain MUST use the process of fragmentation in some way, shape or form to be rational. All right hemisphere attributes MUST use the principles of wholeness to be emotional. This means de-fragmentation, the fact that they cannot be divided and still function as intended. This means that we are created with the POTENTIAL for mastery if and only if we can take apart and put back together again - as any tradesman must be able to do. This is the process of continual improvement or evolution which demands the ability to take apart and put back together again better then before.   There is no conflict between rational, emotional, masculine or feminine energies - they are truly complementary and must be integrated in order to function at their highest potential.  This is also an integration of the material with the spiritual for all intentness and purposes. It must also be recognised that the feminine, emotional, spiritual is meta to the masculine, rational and material as it would not exist had it not been for its creator. Those that are lost in the ability to understand and utilise these distinctions are truly ""lost"" souls in their evolution. We see much of this in the media today.   The problem of polarisation which is a product of the perception of duality is resolved by discovering the neutral aspect, center from which both polarities were created.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@guardiandivll,"Anger is the correct response to injustice. One should enforce his/her beliefs and right to their peace, and dignity afforded distance the area necessary an allowance of their own personal space, and privacy at home base. Endeavor to be correct even if by being corrected. Defend what is rightfully yours. When you fight for what is right it does not matter if you win, loose, or die. How could you live with yourself if you are no longer able to be  yourself. If you are forced to take a stand to preserve what is yours, or what you believe is right, you have every reason to fight, and not one excuse not to. Do not fear evil, but resist it. Whatever form evil may take never discriminate, do always exterminate it with extreme prejudice. Evil is a conflict of interest to love, life, a person’s value, and our responsibilities to each other. We must hold ourselves accountable for the things we do, and say. We must keep our promises to ourself in order to keep our promises to others. We must each have a value equivalent of one,  or no one does. A person isn’t entitled to a turn, and their place in line because they are *one of us. Men, your wife is not your mother. Women, we need you. We need you to do your part, and to push us to do our part. You should not do our part for us unless it is by default. I will lead a group by default, but I am not a good leader. A good leader must be willing to loose people to win a war. I am a follower of Christ, and servant of God. Men are not able or called to govern mankind. We were meant to lead our families, but not mankind as a whole. Good men somewhat limit the rate at which evil is able to flourish among us all. Often we must step in to lend a conscious to one who let’s selfishness become a detriment to others. We have a responsibility as parents to compensate for what is lacking of the not fully developed mind of our children. It makes sense to do the same for other tribe members. We cant pass judgement on one another because we are equally guilty. Most of our laws/policies are attempts to protect us from our ourself, and/or each other. A majority is not necessarily always right or powerful enough to enforce what has been agreed upon/decided. It is wise to seek counsel in making important decisions. Despite the inadequacies of democratic or majority rule it’s our best line of defense in limiting the destructive potential of each individual case of selfishness. Opinions will vary, and unlike absolute truth, are subject to change. What is socially acceptable certainly can’t cause a guilty conscious, or shame for immorality. Disobedience to God does. He is the golden standard of good, the only way to know absolute truth, and the only path to peace or message of hope mankind kind is ever to know. Trust God to do his part. It is his moral law that is written on our hearts. You ask me how I know he lives? Eternity/Infinity. He lives within our soul.",5년 전(수정됨),0,
@ohshialabooof8958,"Whenever I hear someone or ppl talking about a ""correct"" way of thinking, I always ask myself, ""Is there anyone who would have anything to gain by getting ppl/the world to think this way/their way about stuff. And even though this could sound pretty convincing it seems like exactly the kind of thinking & ideology that would perfectly benefit the pieces of shit who run everything. If everyone thinks that there is a set way for guys and girls to be, what they should do and how they should act so they shouldn't stray from it then that would kinda make ppl be more like sheep, Less willing to think for themselves & easier to control, while also eliminating half the population from being legitimate threats to certain positions of power, maintaining the status quo & helping a lot of ppl in power more easily retain that power & be less likely to ever lose it.

@birdwithabrokenwing,"The word “Open” in this area of psychology has a very different meaning- the opposite is easier to think of as “protective” rather than “closed”. Think of it as- I’ll feed my family first, the rest doesn’t matter to me, I don’t trust you implicitly so I’ll stay private... that’s being “closed” in this context... there are positive and negative on both sides. For someone who myself is probably very much on the “closed” side, i imagine “Open” as “Open” to whatever whenever, go with the flow, take everything at face value and never look below or for verification, people are who they say they are, they are what you see, there nothing beneath, everything can have equal value because there is no TRUE facts and real concrete firm information, everything is just open thoughts and theories and one interpretation is valid regardless of truth... my sister is very much my opposite and see this characteristic, it has positive emphatic points, but they need to look below the surface and accept that the real world is not an ideal equal kind world, and it never will be. Being “closed”  is a protective mechanism. The world needs both sides to thrive.

There was a time when men simply would not have anything to do with a woman who did not respect him as a man. It wasn’t a matter of how to have discourse with such a woman it was a matter of simply ostracizing her from his life. Furthermore society in general would ostracize such a woman. In the modern times if a woman pursues a man to the point of harassment, The man will be obliged to involve other people and if necessary the police and or a restraining order against her.

Truth can not be a subjective experience or that would mean there are no such thing as facts and scary enough for the Atheist the building blocks of this religion are being chipped away at by the very thing they claim to represent aka science. 4. Post Modernism and NeoYungism are the same lame regurgitated ridiculous explanation trying to sound intellectual as they dismiss intelligent agency in life and the very real fact that is God but they will drown out this objection to their supposed understanding with fallacy and outstanding leaps of logic. 5.

@lukaskurtansky7180,"Exactly. As describen it to be the blue church controlling the media content, blue church is adaptable to anyfhing in very short time. Whilst still controling the media of any tipe, blue church realised long time ago the danger and potential of Youtube. Youtube is hugely censored nowadays and has been for some time,plus what is very important is, we have to still keep in mind, that all of this debates allowed on youtube such as the Channel 4 and Jordan Peterson is there also to keep us occupied,believe that there is someone to fight for ordenary man/woman’s right and distract us from what is really going on. So whilst we discuss Jordan Peterson or 9/11,  someone is doing something in Antartica that we can not see, someone is doing something in private tech/chemical laboratories we can not see,someone made us believe that space program has practically not moved since the cold war and someone is making sure that small inventors in their garages that discovered free energy or technology abailable for public is not going to be distributed to us. I think i like Jordan Peterson, but i am still on doubt wheter he is not just fals prophet since he said: the blue church (in television form)is loosing the power because of youtube. Which to me is very naive becUse Youtube is Blue church. Today’s Youtube for sure! Blue church is not one, but several steps ahead.

@edstuff1198,"Peterson is a pop psychologist.  Many of his ilk have come and gone in every generation.  Does anyone remember Thomas Harris, 'I'm OK, You're OK'?  The biggest problem with Peterson is he uses one of the oldest rhetoric tricks around.  He immediately frames the problem in a way that it appears to address some universal truth or problem, and then bases his argument within that frame.  What the gullible masses don't realize is how toxic and one sided his views really are.  The man is not exploring the minds of human society and thought, he is spreading his ideology couched in clinical language, that's all.  It all makes sense because he controls the discussion with the very biased opening statements of his subject.  Here is a simple example of the technique, albeit in much plainer language than Peterson employs.  Trump makes the statement  that ""I have done more than any other president in our history.  For example, I have rebuilt the military, it was completely depleted when I took office.  Now it's completely rebuilt"". Yeah, sure it was depleted.  We were so weak, I'm surprised Bulgaria didn't invade us.  When your opening statement is a lie, then it stands to reason that any argument built on that lie is also a lie.        Like Trump, Peterson is exploiting the weak, insecure, vulnerable, fragile psyche of a certain kind of male mind.   The man is popular with the 'alt right' for the simple reason that he is the embodiment of their ideals.  Sure, he is good with words, he sounds so knowledgeable with all of that pseudo intellectual, high falutin' clinical speak that he is so good at.  But to the critical, discerning ear, the message is clear.  Strong, white males were born to control the world.    Peterson will never gain a wider audience than a few million needy, insecure people on YouTube, very few of whom actually understand anything he is really talking about, thank goodness.  But my, how the alt right psuedo intellectuals eat up his BS.  He will soon fade into well deserved obscurity, like so many before him.    I'll give him credit, he's a clever bastard, but clever bastards come along all of the time and then disappear, because it takes more than being clever to last.  It takes real substance and a relatively unbiased viewpoint to be truly noticed and effective.  In other words, something much closer to truth than the Peterson propaganda.

@Daniwild1,"My Mother who is a Christian always taught me to not make decisions from fear.  I think getting fear down will help all of us. I read an article while in college that said that women being educated would destroy the world and only by us being oppressed again would things normalize...some Canadian magazine I think and a man wrote it but this was back in the late 1990s MacClean magazine maybe?  I realize that I became afraid then that men would use physical force even as the women in my family were raped to steal away anything I worked for.  I became afraid of being dominated by men, suffocated even though I was never raped myself.  That fear makes it hard to enjoy sexual relations and to enjoy very many men.  I do love men dearly but they have to be a particularly calm sort for me to feel very safe around them. I think that has affected me. I need freedom from fear and fear is so suffocating.  I think that women are scary too.  My first Mother was very unpredictable with her Schizophrenia and withheld food that my adopted Mother who still treats me like I am 8 years old even though I am 41 was a balm until it became suffocating so it is not like I really want to be with women.  It is more like I am alienated from humanity and really just want to be dead. I like the challenge at the end of this video to accept the raw feeling that one knows nothing.  I study up to 12 hours a day in order to feel less afraid and it is not making me feel less fearful or more prepared except I do write excellent essays for my own personal benefits a few times a week (not that all the writing is great I have to admit but it helps to write somehow). Just please stop calling women passive. My Mother did all the work.  And I mean all of it. My Father was crippled in an accident and was in a wheelchair. In spite of her hard work, my family disliked her and loved my Dad (who was a great guy...easy to be nice and agreeable when loaded on morphine 24-7 for 35 years).  They are not internet people and I am not on FB so no one is going to find my family in case anyone thinks I am being rude here. And the rapist in the family who raped all five of his daughters (well one of them) is long dead and the other one (who raped his own mother) ran off and no one knows where he went.  He changed his name and everything. I am tired of fear. Not very many with Schizophrenia are violent.  I do not want to perpetuate that stereotype.  No one gave her medicine. They let her live that way and that was scary for my brother and I.  She was awesome before she got sick so please don't stigmatize those with mental illness. It was wrong for the other adults to not help her and force her to care for children she did not know were her own anymore.  She did not know we were real.  It was not her fault. I love her dearly.

Economics is based on people and that is something that both men and women can understand. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th3KE_H27bs By the way, the majority of people that have overstated the lack of female power to me were male professors not females in general.

Dorothy in the Wizard of OZ became a hero by making friends. Make movies where both boys and girls are heros without killing and kicking ass. Tell other stories of being heros.  I was told to be strong, do sports and be tough.  The problem is that the female traits are fearsome if a male has them whereas it is praised and rewarded if I have male traits. We all need more variety in how to be human, how to be male and female and keep things open for both genders. without demeaning others. Males are getting demeaned because women were demeaned. I don't think taking turns to making each gender drinking poison is a solution. But really if it is so bad for boys to do feminine things and it is not bad for girls to do sports and such then that means male traits = success with the exception that beauty can marry money and not all women are beautiful so we need other ways to be successful. And not all men are aggressive or physically strong.  Men need to be rewarded for other strengths and some of them are. It really sucks to not be physically attractive and female in this culture I have to say since so much of what is considered female is considered about looks.  As for women being nicer I do not know...if that is even true biologically.  I would no more rather meet a female mountain lion than a male one and we have lots of them here in the mountains where I live.  I have seen three up close so far and many prints.  Can men please talk about men and own up to being passive (if they are) as they being passive as men not as if they have become female?  Females are not inherently passive.  A passive man is not feminized; he is just as much of a man just a passive one.  Women can be passive too but it is not in our nature to be that way.  Good God!",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@davidhunt7427,"Modern politics, to me, is almost entirely a war between the way https://keirsey.com/temperament/rational-overview/ (reality savants) Libertarians think versus the way https://keirsey.com/temperament/idealist-overview/ (social savants) Progressives think.  For more see Socialism and Human Nature at https://www.cato.org/events/socialism-human-nature .  The intellectual and social climate needed to allow entrepreneurship to thrive will not exist in advanced capitalism.  Capitalism Survive?  I have tried to show that a socialist form of society will inevitably emerge from an equally inevitable decomposition of capitalist society.  The capitalist process shapes things and souls for socialism. ~ Joseph A. Schumpeter  Consider the following set of Progressive Assertions that, in my opinion, follow fairly directly from Progressives being primarily NF Idealists:  1) Scarcity is NOT natural. Scarcity ONLY happens because of greed. Production isn't necessary; only sharing. At any time in the past, present, or future, universal prosperity is always possible, except for the greed of a few. 2) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism , as advocated by folks such as Noam Chomsky, is the way to go. No one needs prices to know what is worthwhile to do. Reason, and good will, are adequate to plan production. Labor is not a commodity. 3) Sovereignty should be based upon Good Intentions and not free moral agency. Corollary: Rule by Philosopher Kings!! 4) No one should ever have to suffer regardless of fault. 5) From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs (regardless of cost to everyone),... is still the best way to organize society,... but people are too greedy and selfish to make it work. It would be better for society to live as social insects, than as human beings. 6) Why be satisfied with trade-offs when solutions suggest themselves so obviously! 7) Wealth is consumption, not production. We have our cake, not because we bake it, but because we eat it. 8) Results flow from will, and will alone. If good results are not forthcoming, it is ONLY due to either a lack of good will or the presence of an opposing evil will. It is NEVER construed that results are lacking due to a lack of knowledge. Knowledge, science, technology, skills, prices, etc., are just incidental details. 9) Lifeboat ethics reign always.  All these suppositions follow very naturally from the FACT that people today are essentially the same as we were a hundred thousand years ago when EVERYONE lived in nomadic, and essentially egalitarian, tribes. Most people's ethical, moral, and economic intuitions are still the same as our ancient ancestors, so is it any real surprise that so many people feel alienated in today's world where, under modern markets, the relationship between cause and effect is so abstract. For many caring, empathetic, people, trusting in Capitalism and self interest and the invisible hand of the market place makes just as much sense as walking off a ten story building,... and expecting the outcome to be okay. Just like a computer, the market can not be argued with, or pleaded with, or persuaded to be different. To people who rely on their ability and skill to influence people, the cold logic of computers/markets is, of course, experienced as profoundly alienating. If reality offers little to them, then so much the worse for reality then!  Basically the ideology of the Regressive Left (thank you Dave Rubin!) comes down to, literally, that wishing should make it so,... and if you even question the efficacy of such beliefs,... you're evil, you've bad intentions, you only say that wishing alone can not make it so because you must not really want it to be true.  They are insane.  But they speak to something that is very deep in the human soul than tends to be experienced more as the world becomes ever more prosperous and free.  For more, read Nathaniel Branden's essay, Alienation in Capitalism, the unknown ideal.  The punch line is that those who want to experience liberty covet the ability and responsibility to think for ourselves,... yet, mostly being herd animals, the vast majority of humanity atavistically craves a time when a mere instinct for survival, automatic and understood, was sufficient to survive and prosper.  It isn't today.  It can't be.  But the Regressive Left would quite literally prefer the extinction of our species, rather than acknowledge as true the Pareto Principle as it applies to people; that roughly when any number of people are involved in most any activity, the square root of that number of people are providing half the value (out of 10,000, 100 create half the value, and then 10 create half the value again, or a quarter of the value of the original 10,000;  How could there not be billionaires then?).  We are not blank slates,... we are not all equal to each other, or even to ourselves on different days.  We differ in will, merit, and ability.  And we most likely always will.  But, as I noted above, much of the Regressive Left would prefer humanity lived as social insects do,... so as there would be nothing to envy at all.  Americans are so enamored of equality they would rather be equal in slavery than unequal in freedom. ~ Alexis de Tocqueville  The capitalist process shapes things and souls for socialism. ~ Joseph A. Schumpeter  Liberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread it. ~ George Bernard Shaw  [The average man] is not actually happy when free; he is uncomfortable, a bit alarmed, and intolerably lonely. Liberty is not a thing for the great masses of men. It is the exclusive possession of a small and disreputable minority, like knowledge, courage and honor. It takes a special sort of man to understand and enjoy liberty,... and he is usually an outlaw in democratic societies. ~ H.L. Mencken  Wonderful theory, wrong species. (On Marxism, which he considered more suited to ants than to humans) ~ Edward Osborne Wilson  Any cook should be able to run the country. ~ Vladimir Ilich Lenin   A free man is as jealous of his responsibilities as he is of his liberties. ~ Cyril James",5년 전(수정됨),0,

In this one interview transmutation was at the center and subconsciously it struck people so deeply because it's so surely necessary to come into balance collectively. Ironically, it's not so much that there's only a need for the rise of the feminine, but a intense need for representation and modeling of the the divine, balanced, mature male; one of which is embodied by JP and others like him.

@customsongmaker,"The destruction of the family has one cause: free money for women. They don't need a man, because they get every man's money without giving anything in return.  They are enabled to live without providing value to society, and their children have only these valueless women as role models.    The socialists offered women government rewards for raising fatherless children, and millions accepted those rewards at the expense of society and to the detriment of their own children's well-being.  Fatherless homes are the main source of crime, poverty, addiction, and sexual dysfunction.    Marxists wanted to destroy our society; whether they call it capitalism, patriarchy, imperialism, heteronormativity, white supremacy, or environmental pollution, it's all the same Marxism.  The goal is to create chaos, take away our freedoms, and then control what we're allowed to do.  If we don't have families, we can only rely on government.    But if we stop the free money, women will go back to staying with one man as they've done in every civilization in history.  They will have to be useful, just like men have to be useful if they want money.  Then everything else will follow naturally.  Stable marriages are the foundation of families, families are the foundation of communities, and communities are the foundation of societies.  Without marriage, we have nothing.    That is why Marxists legally redefined marriage so that it doesn't even require a man.  Or a woman.  Now everyone is unnecessary, you are unimportant no matter who you are, and you have no certain place in the world except to obey the government.  If you aren't even necessary to your own family, you're even more disposable to society.    Which is why feminists hate women.  If gender is a social construct, then women don't even exist.  We're all just men.  That's what feminism teaches: that women's work isn't important, and only men's jobs are valuable.  That's why women aren't even allowed their own locker rooms without naked penises next to them - to demoralize and dehumanize all of us.  To show women that they're just second-rate men, and that men are better even at being women.  But none of this could happen with a father in every home.  Fathers would generally protect their children from migrant rape gangs, or being trafficked across borders, or transgender chemical castration at the age of 9.  Yes, civilization is seeing the return of an underclass of eunuchs who are castrated for the pleasure of the adults who control them.  The same socialists who took the fathers away from millions of children are now able to exploit those unprotected children.  It began when the socialist Minimum Wage instantly made millions of men unemployed.  Then the government offered free housing to single women, so that men could only provide a home for their families by leaving.  Free housing for single mothers means entire communities where fathers aren't allowed, by design.  And now we're all sitting at home instead of working, ""because of corona virus"" which goes away by itself in 98% of people, while the socialists decide what they'll allow us to do with our lives and whether we'll have jobs.",5년 전,1,

I grew up in a house with   5 girls (Mom & 4 sisters) & 3 guys (Me, dad, brother) So I got to grow up seeing both sides which is Exactly why I know just how badly women are treated by men so there's no way to change My mind on this 1 dude. And like with anything in life there are bad ppl & good ppl on all sides, so to sit there & act like women are the problem & are responsible for so many bad things & men are just saints or victims is just backwards thinking, unfair, not true, & sad. Not to mention, considering the fact that historically women have always been the 1's being oppressed by men who have had all the power & not the other way around, so that should tell you something right there. The proofs in the pudding. So to act like ALL girls are bad or like they're always the problem just because we may have had some bad experiences with a few of them (out of BILLIONS) is just ridiculous, wrong, & not fair to them. It's not the fault of ALL women & all women aren't bad just because  our hearts broken once or twice or because maybe we weren't born super good looking & couldn't get with the girls we really liked and/or spent our childhoods getting rejected by hot girls. It's not their fault if a guy is socially awkward or bad at talking to girls or if he's unattractive. And unlike dudes, girls aren't only obsessed with just looks like we are, despite what we may think & they'll actually ignore looks & are capable of  liking/loving someone based on personality alone if  you're confident & kind and/or funny enough  & have a good enough personality, which is way more than I can say for most guys & we know it. Guys would be WAY more successful with girls if they would ever just get out of their own way & stop being their own worst enemy & actually tried working on themselves & treating women right instead of just blindly digging their feet in & blaming them for all of THEIR own problems.

More so than any government legislation, piece of technology or societal fed going on, the biggest damage to the family unit has been done by parants themselves.  • Neglect  ( Have them watch YouTube,Streaming or otherwise distract them so you can do your own things.)  • Emotional Abuse ( Scolding them for the negative results of your own bad paranting)  • Lack of Interest in what the Child Wants. ( Instead pushing your interest on them and largely dismissing and ignoring when they share their interests with you.)  • Overprotectiveness ( To the point they can get traumatized by mean words, at the age of 20.)  • Moral Confusion  ( You teach them one thing then do the other.)  • Forced Expression of Affection ( If your children don't like you, their grandparants or spending time with them. Perhaps instead of forcing it upon them as payment for their food and housing ( which mind you, they only need because you chose to conceive them ), the party that is actually interested in spending time with them ( The parants/grand parants) do their best to make it interesting for them. Actually interesting. You know, if you are on a date with a girl and she is always looking at her phone, it's most likely because she is not enjoying her time, is bored and feels it would be to rude to just get up and leave. If that woman would be financially dependant on you, would you force her to put away her phone, smile and engage the conversation? I hope not, because that is what posessive evil creeps do. But when we perform essentially the same behavior towards our children, it's suddenly fine? )  • Societal Co-Pressuring ( Too often my family would force me to adapt and step back as to not stump our families societal image.

@louvignali1455,"What Jordan Peterson speaks of is common sense. It’s astonishing to see so many people regard him as an enigma. This social situation may possibly be used as a gauge, or thermometer on social common sense, and what we are witnessing is a growing lack of common sense. Almost, “I dare say” to the point of society not recognizing common sense at all.  When I was a child, and faced with difficult decisions I would go to my elders, typically someone older than myself to test my decisions before applying them. It was a good way of testing my common sense, before implementing something that would get me into some sort of unforseeable trouble. It helped me in two ways; first it helped with keeping me out of trouble, secondly it helped me acquire common sense from other people’s point of view. My data base of common sense grew with input from other data bases of common sense from other people. Importantly, this common sense came from those that lived through the consequences of their actions.  I remember many times speaking with, parents, my grandparents, aunts, and uncles about decisions, and having a meaningful dialogue with them about their decision making. I believe common sense a can only be shaped this way. It can not be searched on the internet, it cannot be googled or YouTubed. With so many of our youth plugged in 24/7 and looking for answers on their devices, may be the reason why common sense has become so alien in such a short period of time.",5년 전,0,

Man has more physical strength so he is capable of creating and enduring greater physical fatigue. The woman has all other characteristics that the man does not have, the maternal sense, the delicacy and much more and from there emerged the consequent roles that belonged to him. And together they govern different spheres of their existence and coexistence. Some more visible, some less visible. All modern constructs are distorted because all the common roles are skipped, but getting out of the classic roles that have been genetically rooted in us for millennia makes us unstable ... Although we seemingly have an easier life in terms of material survival, we have big problems and they are serious on a spiritual level. I do not say that we should not evolve, but I say that we must take into account what we are genetically and take into account the modern world in which we live.

@Romanisipunctum,"Unloved Little Girls  (Gratia Cantantes) Lyrics by Gabriel Gherasim Unloved little girls grow up sometimes to love the wrong people, Unless they learn sooner or later to love themselves. It is easier to seek an outside solution, When loving and healing oneself seem far away.  When one wants love it seems that anger is still good attention, When in reality it is just a waste of time, Seeking internal healing is the solution, And it is in the control of the one’s time.  Unloved little girls grow up sometimes to love the wrong people, If they don’t change the perception of who they are, It is the mirror of their deformed images, Which they need to change from times long gone.  Instead of hating and wanting revenge for broken promises, Stop the abuse, move away and forgive, Life is too short to poison one’s self with so much anger, And expect futilely that somebody else will die from it.  Unloved little girls grow up sometimes to love the wrong people, And yet the solution is right there in their own hearts.  Being grateful consistently for one’s resilience to be alive and here, Is the solution of each day, bathed in love.  It is then when unloved girls are loved by their own spirit, And in so doing they will seek and recognize true love. Changing the frequency of perception to one’s consistent gratitude, Will be the new mirror of their lives.  About the book: The words Gratia Cantantes in Latin mean:  Singing About (Cant) Thankfulness (Gratia) Before (Antes).   Singing About Thankfulness Before, is a mind set and a way of living which acknowledges that Thankfulness is the fertile ground in which to plant one’s life.   The term recogniscience, particularly for therapeutic (from Greek therapeia ‘healing,’) purposes, uses the science of recognition of one’s inner reality to find, maintain, progress and create lovingly, in an environment of thankfulness.   Gabriel Gherasim MA, CASAC holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Sciences from Portland State University and a Master of Arts in Negotiation, Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding from California State University . He is a New York State certified alcoholism and substance abuse counselor (CASAC) with over 17 years in the fields of counseling, case management, faculty, journalism and supervision respectively.

@deek101,"Much of what is discussed in regard to the relationship of men and women is essentially a 1st World and Western phenomena.  Having spent much time in developing nations, predominantly; Thailand, Nigeria and Kazakhstan, the relationship between men and women is very different. In the work environment women are very much present and some are breaking through into areas that are typically male arenas, such as engineering and science.  On the streets level, small businesses, everyday life and interaction, women have the dominant presence.  The women enjoy their autonomy and interactions, with male family members only stepping in when there is some problem requiring a bit of physical reinforcement.  But in these countries and others that I have visited and worked in,  the majority of women I have discussed issues with do not feel limited by their sex, they understand themselves to be woman in the fullest sense of the definition. They are confused by ""feminism"" , if they have ever heard of it before and just don't recognised it as being anything to do with them.  They do not feel any more repressed than anyone else. They are just doing their best for themselves and their families and for the most part enjoying it.  The few woman that do know of and relate to feminism are those that have been well educated, particularly in western countries.  Funny that!  The women of the west and particularly the wealthy and well educated feel the oppression the most, even after some thirty years plus, of positive discrimination to encourage them into male dominated fields. Hundreds of millions of tax-payer pounds, dollars and euros to open doors at universities to promote female inclusion in such male fields and the social engineers have failed miserably, despite there typically never being any obstruction to their inclusion in the first place.  Yet, governments continue to pour more tax-payer money into to such schemes.  People and women of the west and of developed nations do not speak for the people of the rest of the world unless it is to leave them alone to do their own thing.  Their opinions may be broadcast on TV, Radio and News-Papers but their phobias and insecurities are not necessarily shared by those in other countries and in many cases are viewed with confusion and hilarity.  So when we in the west discuss male and female issues, maybe we should add in the prefix of ""western"" or ""American"", etc. The rest of the world think our news reports are comedy sketches.

Men who impregnate women and leave them, who don’t want to work, who physically and sexually abuse women and children do enrage women and engender a deep distrust that makes them not give men a chance to mistreat more women.

The pop psychology was saying men need to be more sensitive, BY getting in touch w their feminine side. Imo, very feminist. Because it took away by only demonizing the masculine. I think the radical feminism started there. The funny thing is, women were being like the worse traits of men. They were cutthroat in business and the bedroom scenarios. Much more so, imo, than men were. JBP's video from a classroom lecture he asks the  question ""we don't know what the outcome of the woman w male animus is"" (to society).

In the book ""The Quantum World"" written by the physicist Kenneth Ford, I found these words: 'magically bursting forth are quarks spinning billions of times a second as 3 points of light, forming what are called protons and neutrons'. This proves that nothing is solid or physical anywhere.  We are intense energy images. This is a light and energy dimension that is constantly being created. Each time one of those quarks burst forth and spin, we are being created with all the knowledge it takes to build the whole universe. That makes this existence a literal dream, or hologram within a holodeck.  And we are characters within it, that don't die. Sure we leave these bodies, but that is to find out that this has been a movie the whole time. Nobody dies in movies.",5년 전,0,

@DENEVENTER,"Often male birds are more brightly colored than female birds, but a social trend of our current times is to judge men who wear make up. Jordan Peterson will probably attest to evolutionary reasons being the intrinsic truth behind this anomaly, but as for myself I don't have an opinion on it, because inevitably it would sound too anthropocentric to be meaningful,  because when another evolutionary form stems from mankind, there will be the equivalent of a Jordan Peterson in the future comparing that evolutionary form to man, as he does now when he compares us with lobsters, and lobsters will be the equivalent of pre-trilobite forms which never left any fossil trace in that relative future, and given the rate of extinction of species, this will seem a feasible assumption that when someone mentions a lobster at that time there will be silence in the room as everyone stares out of the window, or something similar, because they don't quite relate to the idea of a lobster, much like this woman seems so off track as much as she is aggressive the whole conversation (if you could call it that) through, yet that all aside men who wear make up these days are often called transvestites, or clowns, yet in the days of Amadeus, it was considered very normal for men to wear makeup. So very clearly women are being more assertive, because Jordan Peterson looks like a vampire, and the woman is plastered and troweled with makeup, proving women have always aspired to be like men, and are winning the race on the make up front obviously. Not only do they wear more make up than men, but most make up companies are owned by women. Also men can give birth to babies these days, which makes them the perfect stay at home dads, while the women go bring home the bacon, much like the caveman days, except in reverse, but the men can eat GMO soya products from China and begin to lactate and they can now also breast feed, so it's way much more natural than formula.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@MrJustSomeGuy87,"I think the connection works like this:  If you think about the term “nation-state” you see it has two components. The nation and the state.  The state is the governmental apparatus whereas the “nation” refers to “a stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, history, ethnicity, or psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.” (This is from Wikipedia)  That said, “A nation is more overtly political than an ethnic group;[1][2] it has been described as ""a fully mobilized or institutionalized ethnic group"".[3] Some nations are ethnic groups (see ethnic nationalism) and some are not (see civic nationalism and multiculturalism).[3]”  So some people hear nationalism and think “ethnic nationalism” (which, in many countries could just as easily be read as racial nationalism”) and others think “civic nationalism”  I’m not saying who’s right or wrong, just where the connection lies.   Oh and there are always Hitler quotes saying things like: “We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our socialism is national. We demand the fulfilment of the just claims of the productive classes by the state on the basis of race solidarity. To us state and race are one.”  This also reinforces the idea that some people are using Nationalism as a proxy for racial solidarity",5년 전(수정됨),1,

At the core of it all are men and women, women who enjoy being feminine and like men and men who like feminine women and who are fed up to the back teeth about being told to think about their own feminine side, when in fact they are red blooded males. You see most ordinary people don't want to be analysed, they like to flirt with each other, to enjoy forming a relationship, to eventually marry or have a partner, to have kids and a home. Yet these are qualities that the Liberal Left treat with scorn, they want to make women feel that they are under-achievers if they don't put a career first and men? well the Liberal Left have a war on masculinity, especially white masculine men. Most ordinary woman don't want their male partners to have a feminine side, they want strong men who offer them protection and support and .....love.  The war is all about destroying men and women's roles and to stop family units and thus stop procreation.

I make a specific point to never watch mainstream media yet YouTube floods me with it. howbout we just start reporting every mainstream media video as the spam that it is? particularly when they give us an option to say not interested or do not reccomend, yet still force feed us, it's by definition spam. I dont want a single extra view going to these lunatic news organizations. not to mention search results.. remember when they use to have direct relevance to your search terms, chronological order, and performance? not what YouTube feels is a appropriate woke bought and paid for narrative to push to the top... and how are they still a platform? they hinder and curate content based on its ""commercial viability"" and context, alter search results and interfere with growth and performance on what's supposed to be a neutral platform for all ideas, how does this not literally, by definition, make them a publisher? mainstream media and corrupt government elites may as well be the same entity at this point and YouTube is pining away to be folded in with their ilk. it's a joke. they actively work against any small independent creators, particularly independent news channels not part of the mainstream cohort. if we wanted that bought and paid for mainstream hackery we could turn on the tv, but we come to YouTube for those qualities dissimilar from cable tv and awful mainstream media. the faster they die off the better the world will be for it.",5년 전,0,

@briangreen8033,"Schools should be teaching how to critically think about a issue, argue both sides effectively, and then reach a conclusion on where you stand on said issue. However, they teach how to regurgitate a predetermined perspective on a given issue, knowing that you will not be able to recall the information in the future, not only because it took little to no effort to learn, but you have no original thought, which is needed to create new neurological developments that solidify said knowledge. I understand that some subjects require this method of learning, but many do not. Furthermore, the lack of truly useful subjects in school is appalling, especially in today's world. Students should be thoroughly taught how money systems work, social interaction development, from the ability to truly take in other's perspective to job interviews, political structures at home and abroad, along with an understanding of one's rights and responsibilities under the law within said political structures, in-depth analysis on the country's history, and it's historical relationships with the world at large, morality and duty to one's society and themselves, literature that influenced and/or continues to influence the world, just to name a few. I sincerely believe that the education system is designed to limit detraction from the agenda of those ideologically possessed individuals seeking to control the minds of our youth. Perhaps I'm wrong, as God knows how limited my knowledge and wisdom is, but truth be told I would rather be wrong and proven little more than an overzealous fool, than to remain silent and awaken to a world without reason and critical thought.

I know a lot of people who could be described as 'nationalist' but rarely if ever have I met a ""white nationalist"", which conflates two separate meanings and is a desperately inaccurate term when used in this context.    Standing for nationhood and having racial bias based on notions of superiority are not the same thing and this is what appears to confuse the liberal left; it is far less prevalent than the apparently biased media would have us think it is.   Take for example the supporters of Tommy Robinson who are represented right across the board by people of all ethnicities and cultures. They all might be described as 'nationalist' but only a very small minority, if any, are 'white nationalist' in the sense that they might be racist bigots seeking to throw non-white and culturally non-English people out of the country.",5년 전,0,

There is absolutely an element of Stoicism .There are a lot of men in this country and many others that are tired of being told that they are toxic and responsible for all the evil in the world when we know that good men,real men are the protectors of women,children .anyone that is victimized and needs help.We know that white privilege is one of many lies the left uses to neutralize the largest and strongest opposition to them and their agenda.We havent always been perfect but just as we are told by the liberals that the majority of a group they’re pandering to are good and the bad ones are a small group the same is true with this group. Many in this group believe our country needs them to stand up and fight for our women and children as well as the future of this great nation.I doubt anyone in this group would argue with the word Patriot  to describe it because the majority are just that . We believe in God and a hard days work.Doing what it takes to provide a loving nurturing home for our children t grow up in and to make them good adults who will do the same and be someone that makes the world better . I talk to men in England,Ireland ,Australia ,Poland ,New Zealand and our fellow Patriots in Hong Kong  along with others I’ve probably missed and they all want the same thing.We want what God gave us and our Founding Fathers were wise enough to recognize that it was critical to protect them.For the good of the Man,His Family and his Country. If wanting to welcome anyone into our country who shares our values ,Who’s contributes their share by working hard ,  loves this country for what’ll it’s done for  them and what it’s done in the past  no as well as the desire to retain the important parts of their cultures but absorb enough  of the culture of the Country and it’s people who welcomed you and invited you  to share in the American Dream  Lastly we love this country as it is with minor corrections needed occasionally  and above all not ever allow to repel those who would have us become  a communist country full of feces and homeless people and overflowing with people we know nothing about in an age of terrorism  who speak  speak up for this country when it’s needed . If that Man is what you call a Nationalist then that’s exactly what we are, I spoke about the Men because it comes natural as  I am one but the Women we are so very blessed to have along our sides are strong capable loving women who value family and country as much as we do  Many of them work hard and still find the energy to keep her family and home healthy and would make God himself proud . Our women arent anyone’s victim and they’re rarely confused. Many can put in a hard days work then throw on a sexy dress on date night so that Mom and Dad stay happy and healthy enough to raise the kids then go to the range with their personal hand gun or AR and make their Men proud  with her ability to shoot them like a Champ . Our girls don’t stand around in the street wearing Pussy hats and screaming about how bad everything is but never do anything that makes this world or its inhabitants better. They lead by example and try to always live in a way that makes the World a better place and doesn’t do anything to hurt anyone or force them to conform to their standards .  I’m sorry but I believe that all of these things are universal because good people all have the most important things like love of Family and  pride in country  and love of Freedom in common  and everyone everywhere that believes in these tried and true things is a Patriot in my book and I’d fight along their side to help them get or keep that Freedom",5년 전,1,

@ethanelliot4559,"   the part of your comment which withdrawals fascists and racists from the ""alt-right"" is incorrect. It's actually a complete flip, the alt-right consists of fascism and racists while true thinkers are the center and conservatives make up the actual right. The republican party came about strictly because of how insane the democratic party was getting, to the point where they were spending more money than they were taking in, tearing up the constitution, and reorganizing the power structure that makes our democratic republic operate. It's those who fight against democrats without including the basic principles that make up the roots of the republican party that are deemed ""alt-right."" Part of this wide definition is why the news likes to lump anyone who says something they don't like as an ""alt-right."" People who believe in restoring order, balancing budgets, and not handing control of their personal lives to the government happen to believe that the right to bare arms is a necessity to accomplishing that. At the same time, racist bigot morons also desire the ability to purchase firearms, thus newscasters can call anyone who wants to have a gun for self protection an individual with an ""alt-right view.""",5년 전,0,

@grellguy,"Rarely have I seen a ""documentary"" which fails this hard to present a balanced view or (at least empirical) science behind a topic. It seems like someone (I assume white, cis, hetero, male) could not find a reason for his feelings and just went for anything/anyone who pretends to give an easy way out by telling him he is a victim and there's no need to change for him but the world should change back to when he felt comfortable in it. And now that ""truth seeker"" is going down the rabbit hole.

We should start dieing for each other like the slaves of old America that help us get through the impossible task of getting away from the Roman church which stole jesus's ideology and ruined what Jesus wanted it to really be which was to be free from a dictatorship communist type world who controls you through lies and propaganda like religion or government. The same thing happened to Buda he said to not worship false idols now the are millions of budas everywhere that don't even look like a real Buda and books have been wrote claiming to know what Buddhism and how to master something that they can't. Like the books wrote about Jesus by people who never met him or how Columbus found north America but never stepped foot on it. Probably to busy molesting the children he inslaved in the Bahamas. Blacks should be proud to have a family history of people that didn't live off the backs of other and actually carried the country away from the world of Kings which are dictatorships basically much like most religion.

@monique195,"Women are for the first time are getting in touch with their own personal power as a greater part of society. Women have suffered at hands of men more so than by the hands of women in general. We have also been protected and nurtured by men. We are also engaging new roles such as being a soldier. We are forging a new way of being feminine that our previous roles could not afford, because our society was too uninformed, and weak. Now women cannot afford not to take up these new roles. Previously our society had too much conflict and was too dangerous for women to safety explore their personal power. How is it that Israel being such a small country with women at the front line alongside with men protect their country so well? God’s Grace and maybe God’s design? Compatible help. We need to improve the line of communication between men and women. We wish to see men comfortable in there own masculine power, and not feel threatened as we take up our own power. Women will make mistakes “to error is human”. A gentle correction sometimes is all that is needed. Women alongside with men keep our society whole and healthy. Women do not typically go to war, engage in fisticuffs or  sue over a disagreement we usually respectfully verbally correct each other. Because we  care about the health of our society in which our children will grow we try to correct peacefully. We need men to be strong but we would like to give them the ability to see other ways of dealing with conflict as well. Women inherently watch out for the most vulnerable in our society.  Because we inherently know society is only as strong as it’s weakest members. We all need to look for some common ground where the feminine and the masculine can be celebrated and used to build an even stronger society. A society where no one is a victim. We are tired of not being in our own power because have allowed ourselves at times to be victims.  This part of our identity we are learning to change and overcome. It sometimes spills out and over into our best intentions. We also need to have real conversations on how to protect our most vulnerable. I sometimes feel that we are not forgiven as easily as men are when we screw up. Lately I have seen too many women being made examples of by sending them to jail or verbally assassinated. My hope and dream is someday we  can forge a society where all talents and skills can be fostered, developed, celebrated and used weather it’s considered masculine or feminine by society’s definition .

We need to rewrite our scripts and remove these destructive components. Most of such components causing problems came into our ancestry in the time of romanisation and christianization. Think of the high rates of abuse in the catholic priesthood, think of why Scandinavian countries are more gender equal. Its a collective trauma. Rome has gone too far in the suppression of females, especially the legions. Rome dictated religious change. But not only woman where abused. Rome terrorized, took slaves for pleasure and war, and has put every opponent on the cross until the world was changed for ever. Until our scripts where changed for ever. It was an horrible nightmare for the defeated. And Rome has defeated many. No wonder then, isn't it?  Feminists are fighting against this and mistake it for the male's principal essence. But it is Rome's heritage, not a male's nature. Males are suffering because of this, too. It is the romanisation of our scripts, languages, beliefs and legal systems since centuries that is causing female anger and male frustration in the western world today. It is the western world. The western world is very much the product of the collective trauma of romanisation. And that is because scripts can propagate through generations fairly unchanged.

There's so much wisdom he's missing out on through his ego and him thinking he knows better. I blame the school system for this, which he hits on, well the school system is a tool used by people like him to, and I'll put it bluntly, allow evil to spread. He is part of the problem even if he's trying to understand what he feels as gone wrong. He's only hitting one dimension of the problem.  The Newman interview and how that panned out demonstrated this with glaring clarity. He quotes Jungs philosophical teachings on the Animus and Anima spirit, which is correct, but this is learned understanding that is already taught in the Bible, that sadly through our school system and ignorant lefties like him has been tossed aside in the name of progress. And Animus spirit is described in the book of Kings.  We call it the Jezabel spirit. And the largess of the male ego, who Jung calls the ""Anima"" spirit is curtailed all through the Bible in Jesus's teachings. It's so sad watching programs like this, that so much learned wisdom that these ""liberals"" have tossed aside and for ""the good of society"" denied to so many through their agenda and the way they have pushed it is starting to dawn on them, and yet they don't have the intellect or humility to acknowledge they are wrong and seek other instruments to explain the failings of modernity and the doomed ideology they subscribe to..",6년 전,0,

The problem is finding someone mature enough at a young age who also wants a strong family. Women choose careers as a way to support themselves, not to feel successful. Just because you are an older woman who is unmarried, it does not make you a  man hater, a bad cook, unable to clean, or dislike children. That is a huge myth. Most of my single friends are healthy heterosexual woman, who love and respect men, great cooks, keep a clean home and love children. The dilemma is finding the right partner who is mature and compatible to raise a family with at a young age. not that they are dyeing for a career or money!!!!! That is usually men. Most Women prefer to marry, child bear and stay home to raise their children. I have rarely heard of a woman say, I would rather pursue a career than raise my family and invest in my household. Most times it is about money. If the man cannot support a household, the woman is forced to work outside of the home. Financial pressure is hard on a fam. The two people must be in agreement, on who will be the person to stay home and raise the children and who will be the moneymaker. Now a days, some young families decide to split both responsibilities, which can also be a healthy option. The main result you want to see is a successful  and healthy family!!!

We're traitors, counter-revolutionaries or whatever, if we suggest that the 2nd wave feminist juggernaut is flawed.  women have betrayed women.  When the women's movement first got off the ground it might have had the potential to make The Feminine of value and in the past, mothers have had value, in their own eyes or in those around them.  But no more.  Women hate women -- or rather, women are taught to hate femininity.

@PaulBennettPrescott,"Polarization is good when you are right and your opponent is wrong. But the New Media personalities (who are heavily promoted on Youtube) are obviously dancing with the devil. They all try and give the impression that the Internet is ""the true voice of the people"", immune to mass media hype and manipulation. But all this bluster about the New Media Revolution is pure mass media hype and manipulation. The only reason that the New Media doesn't sound like the Old Media is because the narrative is rephrased and repackaged to appeal to an online audience.   The war of words between the Dinosaur Media and the Pewdiepie Media is just a puppet show to add drama to another episode of Generation Gap. Yes, newspapers and TV are old and losing their audiences. Yes, the Internet is awesomely cool and trendy. The Rebel Alliance is defeating The Empire and New Hope is pouring in through the Wifi. What a bunch of crap. Fact is, the new talking heads are owned by the same media companies that owned the old talking heads, and the message morphs to please the listeners.  Blue Synagogue on Old Media is getting trounced by Red Faith on New Media. Unfortunately both Blue and Red are owned and operated by the Purple. The global aristocracy is always one or two steps ahead of us. We demand new media heroes to replace the disgraced corporate shills who used to be our media heroes, a cycle that relies on our short memories. But as this technological turnover spins faster and faster, more and more media junkies are leaping off the treadmill. The impasse becomes obvious after only one or two dalliances with New Media personalities: the old untouchable topics remain untouchable, no matter how cutting-edge the media outlet.   Turns out that Red Faith is being kept busy chasing a mirage while Blue Synagogue is writing up the history books and the national standardized tests that Red Faith's children will be bound to memorize. You don't think Oswald shot JFK? Your children will. You don't think a bunch of Arabs knocked down the Twin Towers? Your children will. But don't worry, all that chat you are listening to all day is really going to make a difference. It's keeping you entertained.

@krixxset2214,"Please understand that Jordan Peterson is the genuine the globalist approved talking head of the new right. He serves a very important role for those who wish to bring about the end of Western civilization as we know it.. HE IS THE BLUE PILL 2.0! The upgraded message for  those who have been pushed to far by the lefts over playing of their hand... The globalists are fearful of one thing in particular and want to avoid it at all costs which is the single driving factor in all the insanity we see taking place around us today... The TRULY awakened collective European man who is fully aware of who he is with a complete understanding of himself as part of a greater whole, eternally connected to those who came before and share his genetics. His ancestors who built the greatest civilization to ever have existed a people uniquely capable of untold wonders that have steadily guarded the gates of western civilization watchfully with the sole intent that he may receive his birth right and take his rightful place among these honoured European men. All you do in this life, the fruits of your individual genius can only be kept alive by your own people who have a clear understanding only possible among those who share the deepest of bonds which are those of genetic kinship of the VALUE of your work. Fundamentally the faculties expressed most frequently by Europeans that produce the genius capable of creating these great works are genetically inherited, the supreme gifts from our ancestors that contain within all of their struggles, victories and glory. So understand me when i say that the protection of OUR PEOPLE is the single most important factor facing us today..  Jordan petersons role  is to ensure you DO NOT see yourself as part of this greater whole, he wants to make you think that is somehow a bad thing to have an understanding and respect for those who came before and to who we owe so much...  He conflates the understanding of belonging with notions of evil and intentionally instils images of genocide and war to  ""remind"" you that this is all that comes from European group awareness. Do you see how group identity is only ever discouraged among European though?.. No  other groups are told to act as complete atomized individuals with no sense of pride in their history or connection to their people..  They dont bother to because they know no other group would ever buy into it the way we have..  I will sum up now for the sake of your time.. Jordan peterson is allowed to show up on mainstream Media and to sell his books which have made him a multi-millionaire, because he serves  the purpose of keeping European group identity from naturally re-emerging which was happening as a response to the dispossession of our own civilization we see taking place around us..  know that your civilizaton is being taken away from you and if nothing is done to stop this soon then your children will be a minority in their own homelands and eventually we might become an extinct people all together..  This is being done on purpose by the same faction that also stoke the fires of hatred against whites among the ever growing racially alien collectives being imported into our neighbourhoods by the truckload Ironic that we are displayed as a singular people group with a history of uniquely evil in all the world  to this hostiles.. But controlled opposition like Peterson are there to keep us atomized and weak so that when the time comes for us to learn what has become of our destiny we find no one there to turn to for support...

Marxism,  Communism and any other form of socialism will never work with fallen man running the show. As was mentioned to you by other posters, is that you will never have a working socialist system while greed can infiltrate its workings and that goes from the top to the bottom.   It is true, there are problems with capitalism and greed is a part of the problem there also, but what you fail to see or just intentionally refuse to see is that capitalism offers the chance for practically anyone to prosper if they apply themselves. It is the reason America is the country most sought after by immigrants. You don't see South Americans, Latin Americans or Mexicans trying to get into Cuba.   BTW, I used my phone and I don't have nearly the intellect you claim to possess, but I still found out a way to manipulate my fat American fingers across this tiny keyboard, to make what I want to say readable to anyone that takes the time to do so.

Like I asked you, why do you not stay there and live your life there, if you consider it such a wonderful system? What happened to Venezuela? It went the way of Cuba under Chavez? It was once a booming country with a very strong middle class much like the US, but tanked as soon as it got a socialist dictator.

@sydneyray3069,"not true. Common sense is not so common. We have lost the ability of independent thinking & we follow others to fit in. I have traveled a little and have seen a lot.   For centuries and until today, men have defined woman's roles in society and society has been enforcing those roles. If a woman dared to live her life she was and still is a whore. Rebellion has turned women into loud, intrusive and obnoxious beings. Depending on the geographical location, a woman's role can be burdensome. And it is through rebellion that women in turn have defined men's roles. Men called that de-masculinity. If you lose your balls then you never needed them in the first place. Women have endured a lot. And now is not the time to make women feel terrible for wanting to be treated fairly and equally. And to retreat now? Never. There are so many factors which contributed to the male/female polarization. We came a long way and turned back around. Single moms have pushed women over the edge. Being both the mother and father have taken a toll on women. They raised sons to be abusers or pussies - no middle ground. Fathers who were in their children's lives didn't know how to be fathers & that also created major frictions in many homes.   Another major issue that must be nipped, are feminists. They've pushed the notion of equality over the edge. Equality is not cutting off man's balls and wearing 'em as trophies. There are too many issues between men and women which have come to a loggerhead. It was inevitable. Men have been given too much freedom to be irresponsible. When challenged, they behave like victims. In and out of boardrooms across they world, men are a negative force to be recon with. Trust me. Their balls are always threatened. And there are women who are the hurdles. The world has created our issues which at some point have to be ironed out.",5년 전,0,

Upon what deeper premise could either statement be argued? They don't exist! So Left/Right reduce to pure warfare. The Left cannot be argued out of their stand, they can only be defeated by grabbing back the academy, the media, and political power. The process of the latter has begun.

Those still struggling at the base (and there should be  NO ONE there anymore) will never see this video let alone participate in such a conversation let alone live out its concepts. 2. The narrator says the top thinkers have identified polarization as a major problem. I suppose Jesus was a bit of a top thinker then, as he went ahead and presumed that as a given and was generous enough to provide the solution: love, of course, leading to UNITY. Not homogeneity or agreeableness or silent assent, nor hierarchy or responsible use of power and certainly not prosperity or generosity, but unity. I would guess such unity does not exclude healthy competition and achievement and continuous learning and even conflict: all done well, with the right intent. Anyway that is all so far.",6년 전,0,

You might as well try and give yourself a proper education by browsing the internet for a decade.  It requires wisdom to find wisdom, and wisdom in this day is getting harder to find over the social noise.  It doesn't help at all when social media like YouTube is growing hostile to non-leftist content.  We were warned about one party rule of thought, which is almost a monopoly now, by people like Orwell, a socialist who tried to raise the alarm of what his own side was capable of.  The right gets offended and write letters and hold town halls, and the left add to that protests and acts of violence by mobs.  When millions of kids start embracing socialism and even communism, you have to wonder which side is winning the culture war.  Truth is always the first casualty.

@SunRabbit,"The real problem is the FALSE left-right dichotomy that's getting more extreme on both sides. At the same time neither side will openly admit to being either left or right. If YouTube came right out and said ""OK we're left-wing and we intend to promote left-wing ideas, and suppress right-wing ideas,"" I think people would have less of a problem with it, partially because they'd have to SPELL OUT what exactly is left-wing and what is right-wing.   A subset of that problem is that the left wants everybody to be exactly the same, and SO DOES THE RIGHT. In that sense they share a key characteristic with all the big 3 desert religions which mutually hate each other. The American elections for the past century are a perfect example of this false dichotomy because it's always a limited choice between 2 parties and 2 candidates that are basically the same. The exception was 2016 where the 2 candidates were NOT the same.   Regardless of who is in power in the USA or any other country, the global trend is one-directional: MORE laws, MORE taxes, STRICTER laws, MORE surveillance, and LESS freedom for the individual (ist). It started out innocently enough, with curbside recycling where nowadays, it's a global phenomenon, despite the fact that it has never produced a profit. The lie we accepted was global warming, and the bigger lie about being able to do anything about it (if real).

Although circumstances and a sense of modernity might compel nontraditional organization in/of the family unit, I would draw more historical parallel, within the confines of recent Western History as understood, that a desire for affluence might mitigate changes of the maternal and paternal roles  and their posterity in the family to the detriment of the family unit (something I recall from Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire).

@TheAgentAaron,"I'm conservative, very pro Trump. I completely agree with this statement. It's no secret that far left groups have had some idea of what a ""better"" America would look like and are pushing this narrative very hard. What I see happening is left media taking words from POTUS, spinning the words out, redefining what Trump's statements were from his true intent and purpose, then marketing their repackaged definition of what Trump said  to the masses and leftists buy it up, no context, no follow up. In other words, they redefine what Trump says to align it with their agenda at which point leftists on the ground then stir up the dissention, activate Antifa and whomever else who allies with them, carry out their destruction and then turn and scream about it all being Trump's fault. It's not Trump's fault and ""personal responsibility"" is a concept that these people either do not or refuse to understand. This is truly a modern day culmination of the 60's-70's weather underground, communist & socialist  uprising. Add to these groups, despite their many very opposing ideas (ie rights of women & GLBT), the islamists & islamofascists. All working towards something that they believe to be better. To top it all, we have a 90% leftist media who happily report as they're told, not as things truly are all too often. Sadly, the characters of the original weather underground are now college professors, involved in powerful decision making positions, media and so much more. They literally took us over in so many ways. They grew up, cleaned up, put on shirts, ties, dresses & heels and quietly did what do. Look no further than the Obama administration.  No, Republicans & conservatives aren't out creating the many divides. We  scratch our heads in disbelief at what we see. Media, hammering division is largely to blame for our current state followed by far too many people who just accept what mainstream media tells them to believe. No research, no follow up.

@patrioticwarrior2345,"Louise Mazanti was spot on, it is interesting and also clear that not each and every woman is typical, however many times just as she pointed out are programmed to manipulate and programed to not take any responsibility and not listen to a single thing men say. It may very well be you are part of the exception to the rule , or you might just be in denial and deflecting any responsibility for past current or future female bias feminist fascist rage. Feminism indoctrinated females to manipulate by way of victim role deflection of accountability or responsibility and that on the entire whole is very clear is factual representation of today's society females mind set and also character or lack there of.   In general women are manipulators by DNA, sexuality, argument tactics, lack of accountability, refusal for interflection on actions or mistakes etc... Not all women are this toxic self indulgent irresponsible and entitled Nihilist and thank god for that, but in fact it is at the very least, more then 90% 24/7 that are this way, 8% that fight those traits and are bringing intelligence to bring to light the problems by the very societal ignoring female toxic traits, and 2% pretend to be enlightened to actual and are on the fence. This number can only be increased by more women becoming logically inspired and proactive against this feminist fascist control freak unaccountable OCD destructive female biased only female self important majority large group to begin balancing things to be equally heard on both genders.  Ironically a lot of the heavy lifting of the shift to balance will have to be done by responsible accountable and enlightened females rationalizing with the irrational out of control women as society has programmed these women to ignore all men at all cost. We can help as men of rational calm communicating men, but women need to step up to the plate and actually dedicate themselves to change.

@Cavethug,"First off the segment with the reporter, he couldn't be more incorrect. He says the way to save the liberals is ""responsibility"" but then goes on to define commitment as the definition of responsibility, which needless to say is humorous at best, and a glaring example of someone who knows not what they're talking about at its worst. Secondly he shows his idiocy in another way, when he literally states that the only way to affect change is through tribalism because ""as a group we can make a difference, as individuals we're meaningless"" which again is an utterly idiotic statement on multiple levels. Thirdly he continues by stating that tribalism is a conservative trait, which shows how little he knows. Tribalism is far more employed by liberals than by conservatives. Conservatives do not typically use terms such as ""people of color"" ""the lgbtq community"" ""the black community"" ""white privilege""  etc... these are tribalistic terms. Grouping people based on skin color or ethnicity. Collectivism on the other hand is something conservatives might be guilty of, but that's getting together based on ideology, but then the left is just as guilty of that. This guy has fully embraced tribalism, he thinks that grouping people into groups, then assuming that because there people are all one race, or all one color that they therefore think alike, and are more capable of enacting change, which is not only fundamentally flawed logically, but most likely ignorant and bigoted. It is based on the thought that all black people, or latino, or asian, or white fundamentally think alike. I don't know one black person who thinks exactly like the next black person. I know race has very little if nothing to do with thought process.    There aren't multiple layers here, this isn't a deep or profound issue. The reason people like Shapiro, Peterson, and before them Rush Limbaugh, and the most popular people on youtube are as popular and gaining in popularity is because they now have a way to speak. The past was ruled by Newspapers, then Radio, then TV, in each cases everything that was reported was chosen by someone. So when you sit and watch MSNBC or CNN, 30 years ago they could report something, completely input their own opinion into the story, downplay how bad it is, and there was no outlet to hear the other side of things. They could claim that they were straight news and there was no one to call them liars when they said it. Now there's an outlet where you can say almost what you want, where you can actually speak the truth, and report on things accurately, basically holding biased reporting accountable, and where conservatives actually have a voice, and you're seeing the death of liberal lies. This is the exact reason that conservative talk radio thrives, while the liberal attempt died a slow, horrible death. ""Air america"" I believe it was called, had the biggest names in liberalism, and it completely bombed.    When people are given a choice between logic, common sense, and reality, or absolutely false logic, a complete lack of common sense, and a denial of reality, which liberalism has become, they will chose the logical, common sense, real, and honest approach every single time, unless it's too late, and they've been completely brainwashed.    Dems, and liberals didn't always used to be bereft of logic. They're also strongly to blame for their inevitable demise. They weren't always so rabidly anti science / anti truth / anti common sense. They used to have good ideas. They've shift to good ideas, to absolutely horrible, terrifyingly bad ideas based on nothing but ""feelings"". For instance the ""green deal"" joke. Which in one move would cause a mass exodus of jobs to places that weren't run by lunatics who don't care about the impact of their policies on the exact people they're supposed to lead. Would create a massive tax increase, would create a massive increase in transportation costs, therefore a massive increase on the cost of food... I could go on and on with this, in short, it would destroy the economy, the job market, business, debt, in essence our way of life. Yet they don't care. They don't care about the impact it would have.    Conservatives are open minded. We are capable of rational discussion, and debate. We don't see people who don't agree with us as moral enemies. The left on the other hand sees those who do not agree with them as not only moral enemies, but evil people. The thing about that is, even though they claim to be open minded, you're actually the close minded ones, because when you see your opposition as evil, you close the possibility to actually listen to them, let alone change your opinion... because they are no longer rational people, they're evil, so it doesn't matter what they have to say. You see this behavior from the left ALL THE TIME! Just look to the people that they elect. They talk about things they know little about, then call the people who disagree with them evil, racist, sexist, etc.. It's no longer a debate on almost anything with these people, it's become simply ""if you disagree, you're evil"" What makes it worse, they lie, and they continue to lie even when the lie is exposed. Such as ""95% of scientists support global warming"" no... that's a proven lie. A guy came up with an algorithm that searched for any mention of global warming, despite the context it was written, and then said ""95% support it"" which is like saying any scientist that mentions ""car"" in a report thinks drunk driving is a good thing. No... no sane person would say that. Or the ""1 in 4 women are raped on college campus"" which is another proven lie. A study was done on a campus in which women were asked if they were ever ""sexually assaulted"" but no definition was ever given as to what sexual assault was. In fact some women who said ""yes"" did so because they considered sexual assault to range from a man asking them out whom they weren't interested in, or a man trying to kiss a woman who didn't want to.... trying - not actually kissing her, up to actual sexual assault. The media then got ahold of the study and changed ""sexual assault"" into ""rape"" and then claimed the number was 1 in 4... which is INSANE! There are 11,000,000 women in college, if that was actually true, that would be 2,750,000 rapes every year just in college alone, EVERY YEAR. Think about that. That's more people being shot, being hit by drunk drivers, more people being diagnosed with cancer (not just the deaths), more than all the soldiers that died in WWII, or WWI, or the Civil War. You honestly believe that this had been going on for decades, but no one actually reported on it until then? That's beyond ludicrous, it's idiotic.    When you give people the chance to chose sane, over insane, they're going to choose sane. Shapiro, Peterson, Crowder, Limbaugh.... even Fox News, they all absolutely crush the liberal opposition. It's not science to understand why. One group tells you that you're evil, because you don't believe in doing stupid things that hurt more people than they help, or which could have disastrous consequences, over making realistic decisions that might not help everyone, but are actually logical.",6년 전,0,

@escapedfromnewyork,"One of the main issues that's been completely overlooked, and intentionally so.  The government had been dumping money into the economy. Inflation is a hidden tax that robs people of purchasing power. Look at the average salary in 1970 and the average home price. They are completely out of whack. A car in 1973 was financed over 3 years. We're now at 6-8 years to finish making payments.  My father was a blue collar guy, with no inherited money and purchased a home in the 70s on ONE salary, raised three kids and mom stayed home for most of it. She didn't work more than a part time job ever when we were kids until we were in high school, and that was her choice. That can't happen today",5년 전,3,
@TomLongusa,"I-S-B-E It isn’t coming from the stars. It’s coming from right here and it’s been with us from the beginning...and it’s evil. We are actually dealing with the fallen angels of old and the disembodied spirits of their offspring that were the Nephilim and are now demons. As Bizarre as it sounds to some...the so called aliens are more accurately inter-dimensional entities. The occult and governmental groups that have been obtaining information from them through rituals involving child sacrifice, pedophilia, and other vile practices no longer feel the need to hide it as they once did. A war between, shall I say, the forces of light and dark has broken out into actual battles the entire world will be witnessing in the near future. Within this next year, 2020, the worldwide crack down on those trafficking and abusing children will drag this all out into the light. They will claim we are being visited and that they’ve come to save mankind. The deception will begin...  The Bible, not religion, is the key that unlocks it all and the only hope of the entire world’s salvation lies with... Jesus Christ, regardless of what religion(s) anyone has followed before. The religions of man can not save mankind. God offers eternal life through unmerited Grace by Faith alone. Faith that Jesus paid the sin price with his blood and by having faith in him your cover charge is paid. But the Faith option will be removed...your chance of salvation after that plummets to near impossible with what’s coming here on earth. We’re all given a choice... choose well. God Bless  PS: Suspend disbelief long enough to look into it for yourself. I had zero use for religion for 40+yrs of my life and only began digging into the Bible 9yrs ago. Not just casually reading it, but a deep dive into the Bible, original languages, word etymologies, commentaries, concordances, and contemporary works. The deeper I’ve been digging the more it’s opened to levels I couldn’t have believed. I’m sorry that I wasted so much of my life. If even one person takes heart from this the glory goes to God.

@Annika1107,"I fucking hate the attitude and opinion of victims inherently becoming the persecutors, it just isn't accurate. Saying a victim standing up for themself is aggressive or dominating is gaslighting in the extreme (this is literally gaslighting all women ever) and putting the responsibility of what men have done to women back on women. Women have been oppressed and still are and this softened dialogue about women having equal responsibility in the context of an abusive and oppresive system which ultimately serves men, where women are still fighting for any semblance of equal rights, comepletely invalidates most women's experiences in regards to patriachal systems and ""norms"". This speaks toxic red pill psychology to me.  Yes men and women have differences. And those should be considered and taken in to account. This seems like a classic example of lumping feminism (which is about equality) in with toxic feminine values and man- slamming, which is even more toxic. On one hand it seems like this is about celebrating and acknowledging gender differences but falls on it's face by saying women are perpetuating anti male propaganda when the majority of the entire world is literally built to suit men. Men take women standing up for themselves in the face of oppression as women being overly aggressive or over the top. As a woman your entire life is dictated by men and you do not get a choice. Saying women are ""crazy"" ""harpies"" who are ""undermining the masculine power of the culture"" spoken by a privileged rich white man - it speaks volumes of men's fear of female empowerment.  I expected this to be more insightful but just seems to be stealthily trying to perpetuate toxic masculine ideals by nitpicking feminism and women's rights. This is honestly really disappointing that thia guy is demanding women take more responsibility (as if women haven't been dumped with enough emotional responsibility and cognitive load) for things men have done and are doing.  Advice I would give to anyone trying to navigate this new world is empathise with your fellow humans and understand their perspectives and just try and be a good person instead of perpetuating toxic agendas and scaring people in to fearing fear itself.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@BStott,"A big suggestion:  Drop the quick salacious use of 'misogyny' when a male or ? Female say something derogatory about a woman or group of women or women in general. You are in fact, frequently portraying a 'misandric' bent, view or belief. Stop the 180° use of dangerous labels, which drive a hatred of gender. Communicate. This means - Understand the meaning of shared ideas, harsh or mild, and stop polarizing the hate of you or your attacker into disingenuous psycho-babble terms.  If a retort was, ""That is one very ignorant woman.""  It points out a particular woman is deemed ignorant. It is not a misogynistic comment.

@GoodBoyOskie,"I suppose as an older person, younger people might see us as stoic. But that's not really what it is. My wife is tougher than me--even with a disability. She doesn't let it stop her, and she focuses on what makes her happy. We don't see ourselves as stoic. We see these younger people on the left as behaving like they're butthurt over every little thing! They only make us look stoic by comparison. We don't hide our feelings--but we're old enough to know it's about more than what you're feeling at the moment. Feelings can be fleeting. It's also about commitment to what you want for your life and your family's lives. It's about setting goals.  We didn't have time for entitlement and being butthurt--it wouldn't have gotten us anywhere. Guess what? Nobody cares if you're butthurt! We had a family to raise and support. And we loved them and wanted to do that. Peterson is right--it's about accepting responsibility. But once you do and move forward, life is very fulfilling and even fun! It makes you feel good about yourself. I'm proud of our kids, too. They are not weinie-whiners. They're well-adjusted and happy. They're intelligent and successful, and a joy to be around. Our kids laughed at the absurdity of some of these butthurt kids in college. They didn't need a ""safe space."" Those spaces aren't for the bold who know what they want. There is some truth to the meme of ""first world problems"", after all.  One thing the young on the left need to do is chill a little, and live and let live. Stop trying to make everyone think and behave the way you do, and hating them when they don't. It's a waste of time. It'll only hold you back. Just learn to accept people and do what you need to do to move yourself forward. And for Pete's sake, create a plan for your life. Think about where you want to be and how to get there. Peterson's advice to ""clean your room"" is the advice a good father would give his kids. It's the beginning of taking responsibility for yourself, and kids should have learned that before they started school. A lot of these ""kids"" in their 20's and 30's should have learned that a long time ago. Until they do, they'll be stuck in a rut and waste their lives. They'll be a burden to the people around them.  I sometimes wonder how these ""kids"" will behave when they're my age.",6년 전,90,

A woman here who actually listens and I’ve never been more awake and aware as to what is happening in this country (or rather the world at this point) until I stumbled across this video. Absolutely marvelous documentary, you’re a wise man. Completely aware of the hard truths of the world. If more people understood that the world is not simply black, or white, things would move much more smoothly. You cannot achieve a greater society without some sort of creativity or chaos, but without some sort of order and sense of responsibility, the chance of actually seeing that greater society completely falls apart.   I was raised by parents who strictly stuck by the fact of being “independent”. Not to EVER vote based off of a party. Vote based off of your morals, your beliefs and ideals. But understand that there may not always be a perfect candidate. When the person you voted for does not win, you cannot change that. It’s how the people voted. Instead what can be done is to try to work WITH each other instead of against. To sit and cry and whine about it, gets you absolutely no where. You are acting like a child. I will raise my children to think the same way. Unless you are being harmed, or some incredible unjust action is being taken against you, always learn to work with others. Yes, we may be individuals, and think differently. But, it doesn’t any of make us any more or less important.

It is something I have experienced; being very good in my field has often created similar backlash in the corporate world.  It relates to the sociological concept of ‘society’s control of excellence’.  The reason, as I’m sure Mr. Peterson would agree (he touched upon this in one of his lectures), if a person is insecure, they feel a heightened sense of emotional pain in, or because of certain situations.  And if I am correct, emotional pain is the primary driver of negative, problematic behavior.  https://goo.gl/tTBbpU",6년 전,0,

@abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0,"Good point! Really!  Can I please just add something?! :) I remember being mesmerized by triangles early on in life. Back then I didn't watch any YouTube or didn't got to see so much tv as I did growing up, not being biased I just really thought triangles were super awesome and magical...  As an artist I love to draw and often use triangles in my work but I'm sometimes restricted by some comments like yours, which saddens me. And it shouldn't..  'Because it's just a f*cking triangle', should it not be 'impossible to connect it solely to one meaning only!' ? As it is also an ancient foundation of measurements, called trigonometry...   Geometry works in mysterious ways and in the end not so mysterious when you start to zoom in or perhaps even zoom out. Anyway just trying to say that certain shapes have an enormous power, which has been proven numerous times by scientists. So it is quite commonly used among those who dig deeper into the matter.  Best example might even be the swastika symbol... First documented use was that of peace and later on the symbol (but mirrored) used by the Nazis, in time of war. Doesn't mean both uses cannot exist at the same time. And let's be honest, very few people truly know which direction goes for peace and which goes for war....   Don't get me wrong I am not trying to imply anything. You could be right as much as you could be wrong.  Guessing we we'll never know for sure.  As to what goes for me, I just soak it in as information while not trying to be biased (other than looking at results being positive or negative). All while keeping it to a 50/50 rate of possiblity of being true/false.  Maybe just keep in mind that not all is from evil origin?!",6년 전,0,

It represents a satanic conspiracy. The symbol itself has no intrinsic meaning as far as I'm aware... it's just a shape. For the people who use it in elite/ occult circles, it's like a gang sign.

@stephaniecardenas9531,"What about operating from a soul level and stop playin into a gender script? I personally enjoy surrounding myself with two spirited gender people as I am one (someone who channels both female/male energy to navigate through life). I find those people are  much more in touch with a higher state of consciousness. In the spirit world there is no gender there is no race there is no competition — this is pure love, pure acceptance, and pure synchronicity — that is the world I want to live in. But maybe I’m living at the wrong time/dimension and my view point is weak in its argument. Something has to change as we are spiraling downward at an alarming rate as a species because we focus more on differences than similarities.

Especially when the woman can just leave and take the gentleman for all he’s got, or use him solely for the money. Now, that’s not to say divorce is not understandable in some cases, but I’ve seen social media influencers show marriage as a joke, prank or “silly fun thing to do”. As if marriage means almost nothing. For some people it may mean nothing, but to project these kinds of ideas onto the youth? Terrifying. For you men who feel entirely hopeless or angry, please do not, I assure you there are woman who actually think independently out there; women who aren’t selfish and unreasonable. And while you shouldn’t date or marry someone who is totally your opposite, remember that successful relationships have healthy comprises. Don’t rush into things, and treat her with the same respect you wish to receive. I may be young, but this is what I have learned.",6년 전,10,

You can’t dispel the conscious extremes of society while calling for rational balanced thinking while at the same time calling for getting back to traditional extremes. It’s paradoxical. This is what you get when you try to mask conservative tribalism in liberal intellectualism. Humanity is moving back to the balancing of the animus and anime’s. those that benefit from the old way are fighting this by using the tried and true method of “fight fire with fire.” The way you know that they do not literally seek balance in the force is that they continually point out the need for balanced reasoning but solely through the eye of the traditional tribalistic conservative. While I totally agree with 98 percent of what’ was said, it was what they did not say that I take issue with.

@ChaudhryRajinderNijjharJatt,"HOW THE DIRTY-HEARTED BRITISH IGNITED THE SECTARIAN CIVIL WAR IN INDIA? The British left India in 1947 but with a very dirty conscience. We Indians of the farming marshal tribes Jatt, Gujjar, Pathan, Arian, Saini, etc., the once-born simpletons served the British faithfully and made them win the two world wars but they colluded with the twice-born shrewd people of business tribes and hypocritically divided our Jatt tribal homeland, the Punjab plunging us into the sectarian civil war that could have been avoided. This is how they ignited this civil war:-  1. They knew that the people kill each other frantically in the name of religion as Catholics and Protestants did in Britain and so, they supported the heads of religious parties financially and paid them money secretly under the table. 2. There used to be elections held for the Parliament but no such election was held to hand over the Government into the hands of responsible political leaders in 1947. 3. They just colluded with the heads of religious Parties; all clever shopkeepers - Lala M.K. Gandhi, a Baniya, Lala Tara Singh Malhotra, a Khatri and Lala Mohd. Ali Jinnah, a Babla Bhatia. These Lalas least served in the British Army. 4. We Jatts of the Punjab served the British Army the best but we were divided into India and Pakistan like the deserted Christmas Puppy. 5. And our Governments were told that when you fight with each other, then we will sell you weapons of mass destruction to kill each other. What a business idea out of misery?  Politics is a dirty game of the psychic hypocrites whom Jesus condemned the most and he was killed by them. Look what the USA, U.K. and other European collaborators are doing in the world today?   End times are not far away – Matt. 13v24-30 and the TRIBULATIONS have already started from 14/05/2018 when the child-like USA President Donald Trump pressed the TRIBULATIONS BUTTON by declaring Jerusalem to be the Capital of Israel. These world-wide TRIBULATIONS will last for FIVE YEARS to ATOMIC WAR EXPECTED ON 14/05/2023.   So, let us join hands together to expose these hypocrites with the Gospel Truth of our Supernatural Father Elohim, Allah, Parbrahm, etc. In Jesus, we are Labourers working in the Royal Vineyard of our Father that has a Narrow Gate for the Solitary of discerning intellect called “holy spirit”, common sense or Surtti. Earn your Salvation by Preaching the Gospel.  Holy spirit, “common sense”, shatters the fetters of the dead Letters, the Holy Books and their Laws that have been corrupted. Remember that Law and Prophets were till John, the Baptist – Luke 16v16 and after that, the Narrow Gate to the Royal Kingdom of God has been opened by Christ Jesus and He has appointed St. Peter as the “Gatekeeper”. That is why Peter killed two hypocrites/Blasphemers Ananias and Sapphira for speaking against the Holy Spirit that rests in our own heart, the Treasury of the Gospel Truth Brewed through “Logical Reasoning”. Watch mine over 7000 Youtube Videos; channel nijjhar1 and my services are FREE. I have written two Books; one in English; “FIRST GNOSTIC PRINCIPLES OF ONE GOD ONE FAITH” and the other in Punjabi; “KAKHH OHLAE LAKHH”. Search them on internet. I need technical help to revise them for publication. FREELY RECEIVED; FREELY GIVEN IS OUR MOTTO IN GOD.  In “Agape”, our Father God blesses everyone alike and please do not miss your great opportunity to earn salvation by Preaching Gospel from the Rooftops. https://youtu.be/yTSYd_FujE4 Jatt Qom and not Hindu Jatt, Sikh Jatt, Muslim Jatt, etc. http://www.gnosticgospel.co.uk/jattparty.htm  Ch.

So, for example, preferring to do the work of staying at home and looking after children should be viewed as (at least) equally important as going out to work (whatever the gender of the person doing it happens to be).

@amyjkr,"I think people classify Peterson by those that are the loudest followers. It is typical sensationalization of a person who gains a voice in the culture. I believe he is hijacked by the radical right, and demonized by the radical left because of the social interaction online, which often creates herds of humans in certain ""camps"" the same way in which it is done by major media. It is like a virus.   Yet, when I share Peterson's videos with my mostly liberal friends, and I add in an urge to give it a chance, even if they don't like him, so many of them agree with him, and praise the video. Why? The same reason the Right seems to be racist and less flexible so have been manipulated to see any liberal idea as an attack. Yet, I grew up around all conservatives and I know these men considered ""good ol' boys"" would for the most part stop and help a black woman on the side of the road, or speak up if a woman or minority were being treated unfairly. Maybe it is just the Right-wing blue-collar people I was raised around. But I tend to see both sides as shades of each other. It is only the radical on both sides, which do seem to be gaining more power, that turn everything into a foot ball game style competition where the only goal is for your side to win.

Laundry List (14 Traits of an Adult Child)  These are characteristics we seem to have in common due to being brought up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional household.  * 1)  We became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures.   * 2)  We became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process.   * 3)  We are frightened by angry people and any personal criticism.   * 4)  We either become alcoholics, marry them or both, or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to full-fill our sick abandonment needs.   * 5)  We live life from the viewpoint of victims and are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships.   * 6)  We have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility, and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves; this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults, etc.   * 7)  We get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others.   * 8)  (((((We became addicted to excitement. ))))))  * 9)  We confuse love and pity and tend to “love” people we can “pity” and “rescue.”   * 10)  We have “studied” our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much (Denial).   * 11)  We judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of self-esteem.   * 12)  We are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings, which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us.   * 13)  Alcoholism is a family disease; we became para-alcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink.   * 14)  Para-alcoholics are reactors rather than actors.",6년 전,0,

Real Patriarchy is the answer because patriarchy is paternalism and it takes a harmoneous and loving union of masculinity and femininity to create patriarchy.  A patriarch isn't a man.

@lxdimension,"Even people with a proper mainstream media type accent/internation (David Fuller's!) are starting to wake up to the nonsense the mainstream brainwash people with now. This is very promising. The ultimate answer is libertarianism however, or something much closer to it than we have now, and the acceptance of it's values. That may be the only way society will survive. This simplifying of things in to left wing vs right wing is not helpful either. Also the interviewee who talked about red vs blue and order vs chaos was on the right lines but not quite right. Yes the forces of order vs chaos are in play here and need to be balanced correctly, but that is not a left wing vs right wing concept, is an upwing vs down wing concept (authoritarianism (order) vs anarchism (chaos)). Having said that the practical implementations of something close to anarchism do not need to equate to chaos, that was just a theoretical explanation.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@michaelalfrench,"Following on through the documentary it states 'the female representation of the male is the dominant hierarchy its the patriarchy... that's the unconscious archetype.... interesting say in the women's movement that's what's projected onto men',....  I must ask about what men project onto women ? Since men have historically controlled most hierarchal vestibules of power since the dawn of time …. Its only in our very recent history women have managed to get a 'toe' through the doors of societies power structures and in today's world there are still many countries where women have no access to any power at all, both in society and in the home. Would you not agree that this certainly is an example where men are projecting their male representations of the male as the dominant hierarchy, and that's the patriarchy and an unconscious archetype ?     I am not saying the following out of man hating as expressed in the documentary.... I think its all about the fact that men have been on top of this world since time began.... now women and the culture are finally standing up to that. And everyone is over analysing this. This may be construed as me (a woman) bashing men, however I say this - (so it works both ways about that too !!!) but here it is, men just can't take it that women have finally got some power in society and are fighting back. Its about time men picked themselves up and realised this is because of the hierarchal dominance trait of males over the centuries and women finally are standing up saying enough. No more wars and sabre rattling, we want love and peace, equality, compassion and kindness. Yes there is a rage which has caused women to stand up but that rage was caused by male tyrannical dominance over centuries.  Another point: Consciousness is human awareness and it itself has no gender, it runs through every living thing on this planet. How can you imply that consciousness has a gender ? Ultimately this is about men being unable to cope with the fact that women are finally moving into positions of power in societies throughout the world, its our turn now. I'm not a crazy harpy sister as you imply (and that's not a nice way to speak about someone !!), I don't hate men, I hate what men have done to women for centuries, surely this is just payback time and the real problem is men don't know how to handle that, its men that need to grown up and accept at some point in the future women will forgive them but for now they are in the wilderness and they need to learn to adapt and deal with that change ……    Gosh more in this documentary you have bashed women on and on throughout it - even saying the fact that we stand up to men is bringing disgrace on our gender …. how disgraceful is this ? After all the tyrannical hierarchal dominance of the male species over centuries and you just can't take it when women stand up and say its about time you got some of your own medicine and instead in response you use your masculinity to fire that these women are a disgrace to their gender … is that not a male put down... regardless of what women do some men just won't accept that women finally have some power.    Gosh I am very sad this documentary brought in the idea that jihadists are a passionate case of masculinity as a positive example of the masculinity that is missing from Western culture - Everyone knows jihadists degrade women and children very badly. Its a negative ideology. To express in this documentary that our society should use this type of 'passionate masculinity' is utterly abhorrent - thank goodness our Western society has gown to recognise this.  The most integral part of the documentary was in the last few minutes when it was said, its not the males job to know what is going on, to stop analysing and accept that women and institutions have been producing feminine culture in reaction to male tyrannical dominance, accept it, join the ride, women will forgive men eventually as they, (most women) love men.

@michaelalfrench,"Hi, I am just listening to the documentary a glitch in the matrix and was intrigued that JP said that now women in societies are changing the culture to more of a 'everyone gets enough' - have you heard of The Venus Project, in Florida, started in the 1970's before women had really moved in the circles of society that they move in today. This project ultimately describes a new world where everyone is equal, there is orderly management of the world's resources, there is food for everyone , no more money and no one has to work anymore. I wondered what you make of this future vision ? As I think that its not just a women's evolutionary programming that determines this equality and care for all, its a humanitarian ecology, about society caring for each other with a hard wired compassionate instinct. Also it has been shown on psychopath documentaries about humans with psychopathic tendencies that certain neurological connections are not connected in person's with a predetermined psychopathic brain if they have a happy, peaceful and positive childhood.  I would be interested in your opinion about this,  Many thanks, Michaela French (Scotland)",6년 전,0,

Men must show their masculinity and put an end to this, while women must cold-shower their ""sisters"" and tell them to regain normality. 5. women who choose to throw away their feminine being, power and strength, in order to step in and become like men (competition, violence, fighting...) must consciously make that decision, and be aware of the consequences. 6. rights don't come without RESPONSIBILITIES!!!

@Leitrims,"Largely a misconception of that the modern progressive is. Liberals were at one time characterized by openness to change, but the modern liberal is dogmatic, intolerant, inflexible and uncurious. They are the new Puritans. Easy to imagine an Elizabeth Warren of another time casting aspersions down on the faithless. When you argue with a liberal you won't find someone open to new ideas, or someone challenging their own assumptions, or someone even in the habit of looking for evidence. They have their set of first principles and everything flows from that. Even worse, these principles are usually the foundation for a complex psychological structure meant to support one idea: I am special.   Imagine the kids sitting in a high school cafeteria for lunch. There's a pecking order, the usual stuff...jocks and cheerleaders, stoners, etc. For anyone that is not on the top, there is a deep resentment about it. Many kids just deal with it. Those kids that are the smartest in the class focus on their grades and keep their eye on their future. But many of the kids right below that tier, smart but not super smart, struggle with accepting their positiion on a lower tier. So their mind begins to concoct a view of the world that tells them they're really on top. The chosen, the anointed, the beknighted. They do this by taking on a cause. Maybe they became activist environmentalists. In some settings, kids like this can become very religious, or even terrorists. As their mind bends reality, and they are filled with purpose or something that distinguishes them, they begin to perceive that in their way they are really superiour to those on the top of the pecking order. If Bernie Sanders had been a good looking kid who started on the basketball team he never becomes a socialist.    But this is why it's almost impossible to get a progressive to see any evidence which undercuts a belief. Because to threaten that belief is to threaten their very sense of self. I've seen this when liberals are confronted with uncomfortable evidence their mind filters it out an an unconscious level. The process goes on at such a deep level that the confronting evidence never even reaches their conscious minds. You'll talk to a liberal and you'll think they don't even hear you...it's because they don't. Their minds dismiss anything that challenges.   That's not openness. Liberals have merely adopted new dogmas of the modern age. A few centuries ago these same people would have been pious and judgmental stalwarts of the local church.",6년 전,0,
@wildmanfrost,"Red/Blue wrong. Rush Limbaugh nailed it over 20 years ago. Conservatives turn out to vote for candidates they believe are conservative. If a non conservative Republican had run, they would have lost. Most of us who voted for Trump, would not have voted for any of the Republican candidates present in the primaries.  This whole concept of Red/Blue, is limited in scope. Sometimes we are called the middle, but the reality is we are the majority, and the Red/Blue sides are the minority. If the Democrats actually could manage to put up a true conservative, they'd get the conservative vote. We like opposites, because it simplifies things, limits it to two.

@robhansen6745,"Multiculturalism, feminism, and Marxism that we now are seeing in the west shouldn't come as a surprise at all ..  The Kremlin has used this as a destabilizing tool for years infiltrating educational institutions with leftist propaganda by promoting these Marxist ideas into the western intelligentsia thinking and in the community with the help of labor unions.. The Kremlin has infected this into western society for generations and now we are seeing the effect of it !! The Russian call this form of attack for Active measures...   The point of this is not to make you believe in anything but to create enough doubt, distrust, and confusion within the populous of the western nations  that the Kremlin is attacking that  the people will start to distrust their own government and media, it is, in other words, the good old game of divide and conquer Kremlin style ..   Also now that they fare liberal left has gong totally bonkers and the West's educational institutions are all full of liberal professors (so job done ) the Kremlin is now shifting its focus so it can  maximize the effect of their divide and conquer evil game of the Active measures strategies,  by supporting right-wing element's all over the EU, UK , and the USA and every one from internet bloggers  to political parties, Milos Zeman, Viktor Orbán and Le Pen in France and other useful dimwits like   Pablo Iglesias Turrión from Spain's Podemos political party and Matteo Renzi Prime Minister of Italy and others in high offices in all EU nations;  All of them and their  political party are receiving indirectly and directly financial and funding from the Kremlin and have close business deals with Russian state companies... and they are all well known to bang the kremlin drums in the EU  JUST LIKE Pro-Kremlin Czech president Milos Zeman..  What those guys don't really understand is this all of this comes from the KGBs disinformation handbook from back in the day of the cold war and the Kremlin back then and today uses these conspiracies to discredit the US, and the west to the rest of the world and their own populous ...     Take a look her at the link (Russian: активные мероприятия / Aktivnyye Meropriyatiya) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_measures  Active measure is a Soviet term for the actions of political warfare conducted by the Soviet security services ( KGB )and now used by the Russian security services ( FSB) to influence the course of world events, in the Russian Kremlins favor, this includes but not limited to collecting intelligence and producing ""politically correct"" assessment of it,, and Active measures range ""from media manipulations to special actions involving various degrees of violence"".  They included disinformation, propaganda, counterfeiting official documents, assassinations, and political repression, such as penetration into churches, Active measures included the establishment and support of international front organizations (e.g. the World Peace Council); foreign communist, socialist and opposition parties; wars of national liberation in the Third World; and underground, revolutionary, insurgency, criminal, and terrorist groups subversion: active measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin   America, and thus to prepare the ground in case the war really occurs..  And how do we know that this was and still is run by the Russian Kremlin ???  We know this because we know who Vasili Mitrokhin was .....  And who was he you ask ...  He was a KGB cold war agent that became a defector to the west that took with him KGB files regarding the Active measures programs see link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Mitrokhin  Some of the active measures by the USSR against the United States were exposed in the Mitrokhin Archive: Well known Kremlin Active measures conspiracy theories put into the western minds ...  Starting rumors that the Jewish ""Control"" of the Federal Reserve for the new word order and anti-Semitic propaganda has demonized the Jew as a conspiratorial, manipulative outsider, often with powers and designs of world domination helped along by the USA government and the American banks run and owned by the Rothschild jews.  Starting rumors that fluoridated drinking water was, in fact, a plot by the US government to effect population control.]  Starting rumors that the moon landings were hoaxes and the money ostensibly used by NASA was in actuality used by the CIA.  Starting rumors that US, government at the top level let Pearl Harbor happen so the American industrial complex and Banks got the US public to join in and take part in ww2 . Use of sympathetic elements in the press to label the strategic defense initiative as an impractical ""star wars"" scheme.  Fabrication of the story that AIDS virus was manufactured by US scientists at Fort Detrick; the story was spread by Russian-born biologist Jakob Segal. Discrediting of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), using historian Philip Agee (codenamed PONT).  Attempts to discredit Martin Luther King, Jr. by placing publications portraying him as an ""Uncle Tom"" who was secretly receiving government subsidies[citation needed]  Stirring up racial tensions in the United States by mailing bogus letters from the Ku Klux Klan, placing an explosive package in ""the Negro section of New York"" (operation PANDORA), and spreading conspiracy theories that Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination had been planned by the US government  TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO AND THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND !!

@forestsoceansmusic,"I like a lot of what he says, but his assertion that  'liberals'  and  'conservatives'  have different biologies is merely an assertion, and tends to pigeon-hole people just like neo- or crypto-Stalinism and neo- or crypto-fascism does.  The truth is far more complex, mainly due to the social influences during one's youth (including one's teenage years).  For instance, I grew up in the 1960's strongly Left, but also with strong (non-denominational) Christian views, which morphed into Marxism-only (with its sub-sets of Khrushchevism, Brezhnevism, Stalinism, Trotskyism), due to influences I can trace from 7 years of age to 18 years.  But more than those influences, I've always had this drive to keep digging to get at...'the truth', which led me through all those sub-branches of Marxism, and then to Christianity-only from when I was about 30 to age 48.  I would dig so deep into these teachings I was honestly drawn to, that I would dig out through the other side, that is, I would start to see some big (some 'fatal') flaws in all those teachings.  After Christianity I started exploring alternate spiritualities.  (This YouTube spellcheck is hopeless.)  I gradually learned that I don't have to conform my thinking to any ORGANISATION, but am free to be 'eclectic' -- to borrow from different teachings to build up my own model of what best explains history (the facts of sociology) for me, and trying to stay open when debating with those of different views IF, they don't resort to personal attacks, emotional baiting, sophistry, changing-the-subject, etc.  Discussions should be about  EXPLORING  all the possibilities.",6년 전,0,

I served my youthful political toe dipping from 18 to 20 , during the collapse of british industry but after 2 yrs in the labour party i've become a political atheist, when it comes to party politics. I've also come to the conclusion that ' middle class ' liberalism is as dangerous to the working class as much as right wing conservatism is. Stupid ideas by middle class liberals are  1. Getting rid of grammar schools for working class kids 2. Attacking smoking culture simply because the taxes raised more than twice cover the cost to the national health service 3.the idea that the multi cultural society is successful and that racism was a thing of the past 4. That neo liberal economics, globalisation etc would be good for the working class 5. That if you voted brexit you were a moron  I can't remember if peterson points out the faults of the middle class but given that these ideas grew from them, it wouldn't surprise me. The rise of populism is a reaction to liberal middle class ideas simply because they never understood the working class. They were paternalistic at best and derisive at worst. These attitudes can be seen on brexit to the extent that they are willing to throw away democracy in their arrogance. As for the role of feminism most men of my age can accept and have accepted the fact that men and women are equal but did women actually think through how a feminist agenda would work through the various class structures. I was a beneficiary of the sexual revolution but were working class women and was society. I've seen, through my lifetime , how relationships have now become short term and how working class women are left holding the babies. In fact the rise in poverty, crime, poor education results, suicide rates can all be traced back to not having male role models in many working  class family's.

@darmok-hm6jx," @spartacusforlife1508  The industrial age and now the information age, men have lost their manhood rights. In our past, men and women had their defined rolls. The older women would teach the younger how to please their man and rear the children; while boys would learn the value of being a man. The the mental and physical endurance challenges that all civilizations in the past, espoused.    Mowing the lawn is not the same. There is no tribe or clan cheering you on. No, we are sacrificed as cannon fodder through 12 + years. I was designated to follow orders without question. I was a dim wit, mediocre at best. The fire drills and duck and cover under our desks were random.    I was a sophomore in high school when JFK was assassinated. Shortly after that, the world began to change. The Beatles wanted to hold your hand and the nation became divided. I was caught up in the British invasion. There was a long range plan to enslave our minds. Things happen for a reason.     People will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think' - Aldous Huxley (1894-1963)   It accelerated with making the CREDIT CARD the same size as a pack of cigarettes. Shortly afterward the no deposit, no return policy began, along with the unisex clothing worn by gaunt models. History is repeating itself. As a young man without the advantage of man hood rights, I leaned left toward corruption.     The boob tube was filled with excitement, the music, the sex, drugs, and rock and roll. The propaganda worked. Before I was drafted, I marched in protests, spoke up about fairness. Little did I know that the only fair I could find is where PIGS get blue ribbons. Oh yes, I did keep my long hair and the Army lowered my ears for me.    I was in Plato's Cave, and was comfortable with the shadows on the wall. Fortunately, I was able to brave the Sunlight. A whole world of wonder. As the pendulum finds it's rest I found mine at the fulcrum. Like Goldie Locks, life is more pleasing when it's neither too hot or too cold, nor too left or too right.    ""Life can only be understood backwards, but it can only be lived forward"" - Søren Kierkegaard    “People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.”  Yuval Noah Harari, Homo Deus   The world is quickly going through changes, the ELITES have their long range plan of complete domination of the labor in this world near completion. Combined they claim to hold the greatest share of the world's wealth. They have always been the ruling class, and they have always been myopic. They all have one thing in common, 98% have overt NPD; they are restless souls filled with heinous plans of manipulation and sorcery. With an immature spirit, they will always play King of the hill.     “Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.”  George Orwell, 1984    “Corrupt politicians make the other ten percent look bad.” - Heinz Alfred  Kissinger    Whether one believes in evolution, intelligent design, or Divine Creation, one thing is certain. Since the beginning of history, human beings have been at war with each other, under the pretext of religion, ideology, ethnicity and other reasons. And no civilization has ever willingly given up its most powerful weapons. We seem to agree today that we can share modern technology, but we still refuse to acknowledge that our values — at their very core — are shared values. ~ Mohamed ElBaradei",6년 전,0,

@jimf1964,"Interesting how the female psychologist, in different words, said the exact same thing Jordan did.  Women need responsibility just as much as men.  Also Media should also stop making them feel like it's a bad thing to be a traditional woman/mother.  It's the most important role in society, and should be revered, not looked down upon.  I don't believe it's men that started that, and perhaps I'm wrong, but I think it was a relatively small group of disgruntled women. Either way, it's nice to see a show that tries to bring us together, and not apart.  I think many people, on both sides, don't feel like they truly belong there, but are forced into one extreme or the other by all this polarization.",6년 전,0,

@tbb4023,"He is right in talking about integrating women and power in a way that has never been done. I have said for a little while that if women are claiming equality and overt power then we will face a female style of exercising overt authority that differs from the old style expression of the power women traditionally had. We will also see the rise of a female style of tyranny that we do not have 100,000 years of practice identifying. We really know what a male style tyrant looks like and how to react and how to attempt to prevent the rise of it. I suspect that just as male tyrants look like grown versions of male schoolyard bullies, female tyrants may look like grown versions of female schoolyard bullies. So instead of having overt power that physically threatens and assaults, you have overt power than scolds, shames, scorns, and shuns people savagely. People can be totally unpersoned, shadow banned, ostracised, silenced, and closed down socially and it might be that nobody ever admits to it. Now that we have big tech and ubiquitous social media this feminine style tyranny might have many victims very soon.",6년 전,0,

@robertocalledecresta2312,"So what’s going on in the country at the moment?  There are two tribes fighting each other motivated by their own biases.  Why?   Because we have been manipulated into this position from our competitive past which is based on the very nature of life on this planet. Even plants compete for sunlight but the difference with plants is if they get less light then they adapt to lower light conditions and this is something we are just not doing at the moment.  Two sets of people trading insults and abusing each other for this stupid reason and all of the while the media pretending to be our friend in the background but actually throwing more logs on the fire to watch us all burn each other to bits.  Does anyone think that a man or woman who is a billionaire (funny that just about all of them are men) cares about us? No. They see all of us as things that they manipulate to make money. They don’t care about us or our families, they don’t care about our stresses and strains as we labour away day by day making them richer and richer.  If we think that fighting each other along lines of culture, the EU versus the UK, the US versus the world, or class, the middle versus the working class, or politics, the left versus the right then we are all polarised into little groups and whilst we are insulting each other they always win going home with masses of money in their pockets for doing nothing except paying very devious advertising companies to confuse us all the more so we keep on fighting and insulting each other.  So if we are divided by our beliefs then we are that much easier to rule.  We think we live in a democracy that gives us the freedom to choose who to vote for but that too is a rigged game because it doesn’t matter who we vote for as money comes along and threats to leaders from dangerous parts of the state to fuck the whole thing up again. Obama killed people with drones and Donald Trump has 'concentration camps'. They are all liars and the only reason they are there is to confuse us so we battle each other all the more. Politics, it just doesn’t work for the people and if you can remember a time when it was better then remember it because the only way politics is going now is down the toilet.  How can we call it a democracy when we give these people 4 years to abuse us before we get to stop them by having another vote to control the damage they are doing behind the scenes ripping the heart out of our lives and destroying our futures. There should be a national election once every year so we the people, all of us, get to control our country all the more. If traditions don’t work then they need to be changed. As monkeys way back in the past our tradition used to be swinging in the tree  s but now we’ve got cars. If you wanted to talk to someone who wasn’t next to you and a few miles away a few years ago you would have to find a pay phone on the street but now we’ve all got phones in our pockets. That is what changing a tradition is about and it is just the same for a society that’s rules don’t work for its people. If it’s broke then fix it. Simples.  So they the banks, the corporations who own every business you or I use in order to live our lives, buy our food or clothes, buy a car or go on a holiday are abusing us. They employ us under rules we don’t like and when they have used us all up they throw us out and get someone else to do it for them. Pensions, contracts that made an employer obligated to their employee are pretty much a thing of the past now as the employer is the king and the king has a bigger king to answer to and this whole system is held together by a religion that is international and respects no cultural barriers, no national barriers or religious ones and that international religion is called MONEY. Let’s not even get into that now as that is another topic and saying money is a bad idea scares the shit out of people for some reason. Anybody know why?  So we, us tribes still believe in our respective leaders and trust they will lead us into a better world that we look forwards to living in. One where there will be healthcare for the sick, education for everyone, food for everyone and so on but one thing I know for sure is if we don’t stop competing, all of us, and start cooperating then there is no future for any of us because all of our dreams of what the future could hold for us will get eaten up by the fire that our anger feeds. So we need to start understanding each other instead of throwing insults at each other, stop scuffling and fighting in the streets over something that means nothing and treat each other with some respect and our whole political system needs changing if we are ever going to get anywhere near doing that because it has become so corrupted by money and the billionaires that are the bosses of these massive companies. The whole thing needs changing and we the people of every country around the world are the only ones that can make this happen and there is just one way that we can change it and that is together. All of us together stop fighting each other. Stop looking for perfection because that doesn’t exist anywhere in the universe its just an idea which is something we can walk towards but never achieve. It’s a good idea though and so we as a collective society need to be heading that way right now.  The next time you are going to argue with someone and loose control of your emotions then get a hold of them and use your head because if you let your emotions control it then there will be a bloody battle full of fear and anger which will do no one any good at all so Muslims and Christians, whites and blacks, one football team against another stop competing and start helping each other out as it is the only way forwards. By the way those rules about everybody coming together apply to politics and the control of our society because if we look at any and all of them then we shall see that they don’t know what to do, either left or right.  Money is the boss on this planet and it feeds on conflict. We shouldn’t be buying things we should be giving them, we shouldn’t be destroying the environment for it we should be respecting it and we should forget about money and all help each other out and if you need anyone to join the dots of this complicated idea for you then just ask yourselves what is the best thing that ever happened to you in your life and you will all see other people there helping it happen. People are the solution in any and every problem and people united are the most powerful thing in this international society.  We need a new beginning and we need it now because otherwise we might as well crap on our children’s plates and tell them to eat it for breakfast because that is what will be doing until things have changed for the better. Please don't tell me this comment has nothing to do with everything in life because when we fight we aren't helping any social situation. Healthcare in our society and everybody else's society at the moment should be an international human right and it is a sign of how tribal and backwards society has been kept by all of the money junkies out there that it is not available to all of us for nothing.  If you read this and then go back to your tribe whichever side that may be and keep on fighting then you may as well kill your families and then kill yourselves because that is all you will be doing effectively all over the country because if we don’t get ourselves together then they are going to kill us all and don’t forget that because they just don’t care about us and when I say they I guess you’ve worked out by now I mean the wealthiest people on this planet.

@Quanuck,"After WWII Russia wanted to spread communism around the world but knew they couldn't win countries over like Hitler tried to do, but they knew how to brainwash people. They knew they could change the minds of people from within the countries, so they sent moles throughout the USA, Europe, SE Asia and the Middle East to brainwash the populace. He recommended two books which I got, The Naked Communist by Cleon Skousen and Radical Son by David Horowitz. Radical Son scared the crap out of me. David's parents were communists who emigrated to NY City where David's dad became a NYC school teacher. They held Communist Party meetings in their apartment and most who attended were other NYC school teachers, what better way to brainwash our kids then right trough academia? When David graduated high school, he went on to study journalism at USC Berkeley where he met up with Tom Hayden (Jane Fonda's 2nd husband)and started the publication Ramparts, a communist magazine... and also was involved in all the anti-war protests regarding Vietnam. After graduating they both moved on to Chicago to carry on more work in the Communist Party USA. That's when the Communist Party started to combine works with the Black Panther movement but also started to form ties with e Democratic Party. This was around the time Jane Fonda's ties to N Vietnam got the Black Panthers to try to kill Russ Perot when the y found out he financed a US Army mission to cross the border into N Vietnam to save POW's being held at a base there. The base intel was right but they went to the wrong building and ended up killing about 200 NV troops/ guards there. Another book I had read a few years later (On the Wings of Eagles, about Perot's business in Iran that was later made into a movie) confirmed all of this to be true. THAT was an awesome book too! Anyways, the democratic party no longer exists as we once knew it. They are all communist and socialists and today they don't even try to hide that FACT. I recommend all three books.

It is not an uncommon thing for passengers to notice, when in, and for a considerable distance beyond the centre of the Channel, the Light on Holyhead Pier, and the Poolbeg Light in Dublin Bay. The Lighthouse on Holyhead Pier shows a red light at an elevation of 44 feet above high water; and the Poolbeg Lighthouse exhibits two bright lights at an altitude of 68 feet; so that a vessel in the middle of the Channel would be 30 miles from each light; and allowing the observer to be on deck, and 24 feet above the water, the horizon on a globe would be 6 miles away. Deducting 6 miles from 30, the distance from the horizon to Holyhead, on the one hand, and to Dublin Bay on the other, would be 24 miles. The square of 24, multiplied by 8 inches, shows a declination of 384 feet. The altitude of the lights in Poolbeg Lighthouse is 68 feet; and of the red light on Holyhead Pier, 44 feet. Hence, if the earth were a globe, the former would always be 316 feet and the latter 340 feet below the horizon!” -- Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, ~ Earth Not a Globe!",6년 전,0,

Your own perception is all you have and all there is to interpret your reality.  Im listening because I want to hear his perception, not my own and definitely not the majorities perception or a certain groups perception.  That's a dangerous mindset that only gives validity to the perception of the majority or a group.  That is a very limiting concept that guarantees we never hear anything that challenges the way we think.  Why does this one mans opinion create such fear among the left and bring out the virtue signaling men to heroically stand up for women?  I can't speak for women.  My wife likes porn,  I don't care about it.  Those two views are not included in the standard discussion on gender, yet everyone thinks they know what men and women like.  There is so much diversity of opinion that any generalization is impossible.  Listen to his actual words without running them thru a bias filter.  He is not demeaning any women. He is not calling for violence,  he just has opinions and theories.  If you want to hear the same information that agrees with all of your virtues,  just watch CNN all day.  When will people realize that we all have different perceptions and realities?  Every single one of us.  Nobody can change that fact no matter how PC they become. All we should care about is the intent of the speech.  Is it meant to help or harm?  This intense focus on outside factors like our identity is causing an intellectual de evolution. He is not speaking for you and he is not speaking for women.  He is just speaking his own mind and poses no threat to anyone.  If you stop running everything thru a filter of judgment,  you might come to respect or maybe even understand opinions that differ from what you were taught to believe.  Belief is the enemy of knowledge.   Did you even listen to this video?  He addresses our perception differences in the last few minutes.   At least you sound like you care about women.  You've got that going for you. It's the only reason I'm not demeaning you right now with creative new obscenities.

Everytime the police would refuse to arrest him and then social services would spend weeks telling me i didnt try hard enough with the police . So 15 years went by . I got out myself and within a year the social services knocked on my door for an account of it all . They emmediately informed my ex to which he kicked off with us . We then spent months being 'analised' by social services and in turn i was informed that choosing to be beaten for 15 years is deliberate child neglet . I finally broke and knew we were never going to be allowed to move on . Its like we were on a list . The conclusion of social services was i was crazy . They stated i had either made up the entire abuse claim or it was true and i hadnt come forward properly for my kids . They managed to insist on a mental evaluation that i couldnt get out of while also stating , kids cant be with family members because of violence . Foster care . I went to hospital for an evaluation , kids were in care within an hour . I was released from hospital later that day because i was fine . It took 4.5 months to get them back . They also kept my housekeys for 2 weeks so i had no choice but to stay in hospital ( homeless) . Anyways the courts heard everything , thanks to the hospital and the kids .

@versag3776," @klondike99  this is a similar problem with some ""racial equality"" movements that want to see the destruction of the white man rather than see equality. I am an Irish man whose family was here before the country was founded my 8th great grandfather came here as an indentured servant to an Englishman and my family faced racial discrimination that's been forgotten. I am by label a white man but do not see myself fitting that category comfortably. I feel attacked by the liberal society. I really want equality between all genders and races, but fear that the equality some minorities want is destructive rather than constructive and can see it meeting conflict with the actual goals they plead in their mission statements. I think rather than seeing division with activism we should see HUMAN RIGHTS as the goal, a general group that looks at the overall problems facing each group and come to a mutual decision that benefits everyone in society. So rather than have feminists who as an example want equal pay as men and MRA which want equal custody of their children in a divorce, black lives matter which want to end police brutality and the kkk, which want immigrants to stop taking their jobs, we could have a HUMAN RIGHTS group which hashes out the issues facing each group WITHOUT HATE.

@bossybill7437,"Most of today's political or popular 'leaders' are so polarized that they are Solid Blue or Red (with Extreme further out).    Blue have the media, academia and entertainment, as well as deep state, etc. So in large measure they control the narrative.  To their Solid Blue views, even Purple appears Red. This is why Purples like Peterson AND yes, even Trump, are described by them as Solid Red, even Extreme Red....    and 'yes', Trump is Purple. He is drawing together Red and Blue. (If you don't understand this, re-read previous).   At about 13:00 for 3 minutes, this guy is STRUGGLING to simply put his finger on Purple. Back to my first line... ""Most of today's .... 'leaders' are so polarized... they are Solid...""  Yes, it's a Struggle to recognize Purple if you're so Solidly one or other.   In my view it is usually best to take the Middle Way (not always). Almost ALL Blue/Red policy debates contain a mix of Pros and Cons. A Solidity or Extremity of either is almost always 'wrong' and a Blue or Red tinted Middle Way is usually best. But beware of the Purple drift and understand the Solid Purple (the 'natural' Purple, as it were).        It's actually not difficult... at all.

@LuggyBro,"There are many people in this comment section claiming they get this documentary, and then say its ""the left's"" fault for the battle we're in right now. Those people have missed the point. The point is both perspectives of red and blue (which doesn't mean republican and democrat) are terrible on their own. Purely either one of them would surely lead to humanity's downfall. The point is, both sides have to concede to a rough integration with one another through discourse and an understanding behind each other's perspectives. So when people point at the supposed ""left"" and see so called ""crazy"" SJW's, they're looking at what too much blue can do to one person as it were. And when people point at the supposed ""right"" and see so called ""fascist"" type people marching in charlottesville, they're looking at what too much of what the red can do to a person as it were. Truly, we are not one people but truly two. And it is with this knowledge that we must thus act in harmony rather than in wars. And this is why I believe that freedom of speech is the most important value we should all share. For whoever controls speech, controls which side humanity will inevitably fall to; that being the blue or the red. Incredibly interesting documentary with very clear points. It's a shame a selection of both right and left (but more so right) leaning people see this as an attack on the other side. This is a clear indication of what happens should either side gain control fully, not the advocation of your objective opinion.",6년 전(수정됨),2,

Men have generally always strove to make women's lives (1) safer, and (2) easier, and have succeeded tremendously. Now, a lot of female instincts are actually obsolete, and in fact damaging to cultural and familial stability. This is very confusing and frustrating for women. Some of this is true for men as well, for example that life is so much safer and easier than it used to be, men's hyper-aggressiveness and competitiveness is not nearly as valuable to society as it used to be, and is often damaging and dangerous. A very large proportion of women are still very attracted to the hyper aggressive male, which means their genes are generally still propagated. Again, oddly its the feminist female who strives to boost the attractiveness of the non masculine male, which could help, although I don't subscribe to this, but then that instinct that women have for powerful men is then replaced by them voting in powerful governments. I could go on, but the point is that this is all divine logic, its shocking how predictable a lot of these cultural trends are.",6년 전,0,

No western governments have made any plans to draft females if the Russians should come over the hill and governments are paying only lip service to any notion of equal a of men and women in the military. Most women are still content to let men do the overwhelming number of dirty and dangerous, jobs which are essential to keeping our society safe and going.

@soakedbearrd,"18:22 This is exactly what I was thinking of myself. I consider myself progressive, in fact far left in many ways, but what I have been noticing with liberals and leftists (faux leftists really) is that the MSM has supported this view as a way to censor and direct thought into acceptable and unacceptable ways which they choose as they please. Even though I consider myself a progressive I am well aware of the nefarious actions of our ""leaders"" at the beck and call of the elites that run this world and set agendas. Conspiratorial, sure but anyone that takes the time to research with an open mind will come to the same conclusion. But that's another story entirely, my point being that we have been conditioned to become polarized.   They have us at each other's throat and convince us there is no middle ground. I believe in the 2nd amendment, I believe in a strong nuclear family even though I live in NYC (hard gun laws) and am childless. I can't stand identity politics and fake concern/outrage. I hate the fact that real activists are pitted together with superficial SJW's.  I voted for Ron Paul twice over Obama because I saw him as a fraud. I voted for Bernie until I realized he's just a DNC stooge. I supported both the tea party and the occupy movement even though I didn't agree with everything they stood for. This election I will support Andrew Yang because hes the only one with real solutions and is not divisive like most people running.   We all have aspects of purple in us, our true power lies in unity. They are dividing us because of that, pitting us against one another that way they can rule. How are they?

Good and evil should never mix or the evil will corrupt the good.  In order for polarization to cease, the love of the truth would have to be destroyed; and a tolerance of lies and evil would need to become stronger.  As for the mainstream media, it has become corrupted by liberals who enforce their lies on the people, so the people have been moving to social media like Youtube, and this has not gone unnoticed as now they are targeting social media like Facebook, Twitter and Youtube are all starting to be heavily censored in favor of  the liberal lies.

@nathanhankes8361,"I'd like to offer a bit of nuance here regarding the ""personal responsibility"" ethos. After a tour in Iraq I began exploring leftist ideology because I realized that while personal responsibility is a great ethos to live by, it's not necessarily a great ethos in which to govern men and nations. There are technological, economic, and cultural forces at play that affect the individual, communities, and even the nation as a whole--but have nothing to do with the individual's actions. While you can easily make a case that it is the individual's responsibility to adapt to these changes, there are instances where governmental intervention can reduce some of that burden and disruption in the life of the individual. Should the government work to alleviate the suffering of its people? That's up for debate. I think the political left (not to be confused with the social left) hopes conservatives begin to see the need to take personal responsibility for things the left perceives as societal threats, things like over-consumption, climate change, a bloating health insurance industry, corrupted campaign finance incentives, egregious prescription drug price gouging, and predatory corporatism. Many of these cases run counter to the neoconservative pro-business, pro-economic growth ideology, so the right remains blind to these flaws in the system. Personally, I'm sympathetic to the over-consumption narrative after having fought in a war for natural resources. That makes sense to me at a visceral level.  In the absence of this change in perception from the right, I fear the only recourse for people concerned about these particular social issues will be massive governmental legislation. Should a society tell the senior citizen to pull themselves up by the bootstraps after a pharmaceutical drug company increases a prescription drug price by 1,300% in order to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits for its share holders? Or is it the individual's responsibility to enter into government and take on the pharmaceutical lobby and install legislation to bar that type of corporate behavior in the future? Or build a fortune so they can create their own benevolent pharmaceutical empire?  Should a society ignore predictable outcomes and hold the individual responsible to change their entire livelihood and even where they live as a result of climate change (a force which is out of their personal control)? Staring at that hard realization, an act of feverish activism to push forward something like the Green New Deal is an act of personal responsibility for that individual.  I'm also sensitive to Dr. Peterson's influence on American politics when he lives in a country with socialized medicine. People in the United States, working full time and contributing to society, are having to file bankruptcy for medical bills at an alarming rate. Filing bankruptcy hinders their potential to participate in economic life. These people are engaged in a political battle Dr. Peterson is naive to and may have a hard time empathizing with.

Facts be damned i.e. the Russian Dossier preached on main stream media for 2 years, censoring by social networks, government over regulation,  Britain's exit out of the European Union 's slow integration in the British society in the aftermath of their valid election.   I was an Licensed Occupational Therapist, therefore dealt in the processes of brain recovery and function for an interwoven portion of my career in the medical model of hospitals and functional model of public school systems.   One of the differences between male and female stroke victims- in their recovery- hi-lit a variance in the recovery statistics at that time 1980-90's. It was statistically noted that the women tended to recover in ways varied from men. At that time it was thought that this might be varied due to the larger band of nerve fibers (called the Corpus Callosam) in women.  This wider bridge in women was referred to as the possible reason for a speedier and or often more functional stroke recovery statistics.  The wider bridge over time allowed enabled more the development of communication lines (and alternate detours for recovery activity in the two hemispheres of the brain).  This  also was contributed  to the ""women's intuition"" -which men also possess -but was socially tagged as a female trait.   In 1993-2015 my career focused in the public school system.  The majority of my work was with boys for 21 years, determined by scores on standardized test and fine and visual function in our education system.  Among my special ed students, there were some very bright boys who struggled with some form of fine motor performance required in schools.  When the emphasis on academic performance testing scores became high, I saw how the school system was not favorable to the needs and tendencies pronounced in boys such as gross motor movement (recess) outlets.

The Left took over and dominates most all of our institutions, yet with the internet, that may not be enough. The left has also exposed a dark, sick side that repels a majority of the people. The US is a grand experiment that has survived so far, and may struggle past current cancers within it, or it may split without bloodshed, but if there is a civil war, it will be a significant swing to the right, but not alt-right.  You could say California has already split off, yet if it were fully separated today, it would become Venezuela next month. And the Leftists running it DO NOT want to split off. Rather, they see it as the linch pin of regaining full and irrevocable control of the US government.  And should that happen, there WILL be the civil war that the Right will easily win. Easily, and quickly. But how the US shakes out after that is unknown. Splits, or Right-wing changes to the election process to exclude illegal immigration votes, removal of Leftist-loyalists from the bureaucracy, etc, would all create a more center-right nation.  But because it would be fairly quick, there would not be a great deal of losses of life, and plenty of the Left would be around. Depends on whether one side or the other commits atrocities, and how that swings opinion.

@mbrsart,"I think it's dangerous to have such a broad definition of the alt-right. The term was coined by Richard Spencer to describe his own ideology. The media has irresponsibly broadened that definition to include the entire red counterculture, and they have done so deliberately to produce a sense of guilt by association. It's really sad, too, because alt-right is the perfect term to describe the red counterculture, and I think that's why Spencer chose it. He wants the so-called Blue Church to hate the alt-right, thus driving the red counterculture to identify as alt-right in a sense of rebellion, which causes the legacy Blue Church media to fearmonger about the rise of white nationalism, which gives Spencer's movement legitimacy that it doesn't deserve.

A man 'has to win' through violence or else risk being destroyed by violence. A woman 'has to win' through psychological submission or else risk being destroyed by violence. I actually see this a lot in my daily life too, and men struggle with it a LOT. It's also where the 'manipulative woman' trope comes from. It's the only way women have to sort out disagreements, because violence is rarely used nor necessary nor probable. If two women get in an argument, it's very unlikely that things WOULD escalate to violence, largely because women seek to avoid it (biological imperative here). But with men, there's always that threat, so the sexes treat disagreements very differently.    women being more 'valuable' alive than men, historically, put pressures on us that greatly discourages violence towards women. but this has a side effect of women not RESPECTING violence as much as they probably should, and therefore don't respect AVOIDANCE of violence as much (since they're far less likely to get punched in the face by a slighted ego). very interesting. makes you wonder if that's part of the reason old traditions would actually encourage violence against women to maintain order. not that i think it's the right way to handle it, but i can better understand it now.    thank you for uploading this",6년 전(수정됨),0,

And the answer is very simple: The high percentage of Black Americans in those respective states. Now on the face if it, this sounds rather Racist, but it is not meant to be. The facts are that there is still a large Black American underclass associated with poverty. For example, while Black Americans represent 13% of the population, they are disproportionately represented in much of these Southern States and this in part accounts for the perception that Blue States are much more socially upwardly mobile. For example, The States of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, North and South Carolina, have disproportionately large numbers of Black Americans in their states, (relative to their percentile in the general population) which accounts for most of the levels of poverty and poor health.

It's difficult to say given the history, at what point the (mobs and gangs) of early America who were ran by local politics _ turned into Marxist communist_ because of the mobster 20s_40s didnt look much different. And the some ideas go back to Darwinist with fuzzy science or even philosophy.  The 60s is the most (above ground) flash point, the phamplets and community centers, lodges, even churches, turned into the ground armies for everything from pro welfare,  to birth control from eugenics standpoint, to anti goverment_ which actually added more goverment. Many sections of the US were over run, the outsiders came into unions to steer them towards mostly Democrat voting blocks.. I was around then, and it wasn't in any way subtle. It took advantage of rural and inner city as well as industrial laborers. Some haven't mentally separated the (rights) from the manipulation _   it is still very powerful.  Community organizing is very much a communist tactic_ that means churches and places of influence on the community adopt the language_ favors, money, position, politics.  This generation hardly knows their community history_ they tend to think these communist/ socialist ideas come from a greater aweness of moral responsibility. They never read the early manifestos so they don't see any planned out infiltration. The curruption that is innate to communism/ is masked by the promises that never actually come to fruition. 😏 meantime the money and influence runs the local goverments and policies  We had a president for 2 terms who ran & trained Acorn _ was influenced by radicals_ and is still seen as the messiah despite scandals and death by drones. That says a lot about the NGOs and think tanks that are largely globalist _ and the power they have to not only shape the narrative but sell a fictional reality to millions. There is a kind of insanity that is pathological to these types, it is a group think_ but its also a fear based manipulation _ fear of exclusion and ostracism because of the viciousness of the pack mentality. What those caught up never see is the leaders never actually do anything but grow their power & wealth. As long as our society confuses education for wisdom_ we will be impressed by lies and therefore vulnerable to manipulation. Local unions before the 60s had benefits_ but it's now so splintered because of the billions it makes for the powerful to play with_ and how to explain their hand in devastating the industrial cities and investing in globalism for personal gain😏 that a citizen would be hard pressed to find where their dues went. 99% backs anti American investments.",6년 전(수정됨),2,

@bda2444," @littlebcally1  My GF fought in the mine union wars, so I can assure you that today's union is not (that) union.  I still have family in various unions_ but they have to depend on it for retirement and medical. It's a fact that communist org came to local community centers in the 60s and 70s and trained as well as took over many unions. You can look up the history, but we lived in that era. It was common to see them get off greyhound busses and filter out. The fact of the matter was, locals had strikes long before Chicago sent people and money down to start greasing palms. The mob became heavily involved as was drugs. In my rural town which was thriving with mixed races all living and working together ethnic restaurants and businesses_ it became a virtual rat line of communist, drugs, everything that stripped people of healthy farm living and put them on welfare and commodities.   One should never confuse the locals fighting for rights with the infusion of northern / mostly Chicago groups that took them over _ for the most part laborers were trusting. And they did get better work and fair wages_ their blood literally earned that. The marxist communist flocked to insert themselves.  In time union doctors were as bad as non union, and union fees were mandatory_ people habe to work x amt of years for that union card to even pay medical bills. Union doctors are loyal to the union_ not the worker. The dues and fees go to union bosses, usually wealthy and with political influence_ in turn its invested in whatever the democrats are pushing_ it's also used and abused and no worker wants to go against the boss to vote other than what the union demands.  It is also true that at election time the money, booze and drugs flows down to the union plants_ those votes make a large difference in democrat states. Other aspects of the unions are so manipulated that down to maids and janitors _ nurses are unionized _ it isnt about wages, safety_it's a voting block, a powerful lobby. Non union states pay competitive wages. I know, I live in one.  But my family knows their people fought the near slave conditions long before the modern idea of unions formed__ and those still paying into unions have no choice if they want retirement and health benifits. Some were put back in the mines by union doctors after strokes _ so....some died because the union doc said they didn't need a second opinion .  So I'll disagree with your summation lol. I have been on the inside and it is nothing like the propaganda and revised history _ because screwed up Marxist called itself the workers party_ the intellectuals saw an oppertunity to make the workers (cause) their platform_ but you cannot tell me those states that kept democrats in power arent devastated. The communist talked farmers out of land, onto subsidies_ which the state sold for gas wells, and made a fortune from_ they made people dependant instead of independent.  No worker ever thought the union dues would go to investments in china & places that their jobs were shipped to_ most mines are owned by Japan and China_ the towns are boarded up and opoid addicted. Used to heroine in the 60s. The only wealth went to union bosses and democrat politicians.  So_ lets keep union history firmly grounded in reality. (Wink) There is a vast difference in today's union and what the locals fought and died for_  I don't fault my family still working union jobs_ everything they have paid in depends on it.    I'll come back and edit any errors_ it was a long post.",6년 전(수정됨),2,
@bda2444,"Just as an aside__ it was the same from dock workers to steel mills_ I've seen the old town flyers for strikes and know how many died in which town long before the communist came in_ The problem is, they have an idology that uses people to gain their political ends, and they need those dues and voters _ Just as any communist country became currupt_ the union bosses also did because of their political ties _ the workers assume the dues are invested in this country__ not so. The democrats are globalist_ most communist are, and you'll find that far from protecting the worker, they invested in what facilitated the loss of manufacturing. You see its a top down manipulative approach _ yes, like identity politics_ they leech onto a platform and use it for votes and $_ because their goals are to enslave everyone to the (nanny state.) Which means they decide what you need.  I think the current condition of rural towns and inner cities proves this_",6년 전,1,

Women have been hormonally manipulated by birth control pills which though once were progestin heavy then became testosterone heavy instead to make up for the sex drive- killing progesterone excess of the earlier pills. At the same time we a wash in environmental estrogen in plastics and other chemicals which I think  is lowering the testosterone in men and feminizing them while the pills masculizes women. I think without  this hormonal  shifts , these ideologies would not be played out as we are seeing them do so to such an extent. I think  men and women are under the influence which is why this so unreal and unexplainably  incoherent and why logic and reason have no effect  on it.  i can't help feeling that this a fever or a madness that they can't think out of . Low testosterone in  men would make them passive and depressed & introverted. They seem to cry more than women these days and are overtly emotional. The women essentially are displaying roid rage and are just angry and unhappy because they feel disoriented . I see no confidence and ease in either gender. Something has taken them over.  Neither these pills or these chemicals were here  before.

@robhansen6745,"EVERYTHING IS A CONSPIRACY BY SOME NEW WORLD ORDER ... BUT WHERE DID THIS SO CALLED NEW WORLD ORDER COME FROM???  The truth is all of this new world order crap is nothing but a conspiracy theory, that was invented by USSR and the KGB back in the day, as part of the disinformation war against the west.. Russia calls this form of disinformation war for "" Active measures "" (Russian: активные мероприятия / Aktivnyye Meropriyatiya) https://www.  youtube.   com/watch?v=5gnpCqsXE8g&app=desktop  The objective of Russian conspiracy theories is NOT to convince everyone that there were such things as a new world order, but to create enough doubt, distrust, and confusion within the populous of the western nations that it will make people distrust their own government and media, it is, in other words, the good old game of divide and conquer KGB   Putin style !!!  So let's take a look at those people like Alex Jones on the right and this dimwit Mr Randy Credico on the fare left they are in-fact the same coin just different side of that same coin...They both accuse the Gov. agencies and corporate, banks of an evil conspiracy,,,,, They both like claiming that there is an emerging clandestine totalitarian world government by various conspiracy theories and the common is always about a New World Order, run by banks and business and backed up by the NSA and CIA ect ect .....  They say it is that secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian regime..  But then at the same time, they both will when it is convenient for their conspiracy agenda, uses the CIA FBI and government to back up their claims and theories if and when it fits into the there ideas, theories and agenda ...  But her is a thing —— I am sure that they personally believe what they are saying and even some of it sometimes, can be found to have some small truths as well in fact maybe even more than a little..  But like all good conspiracies you will find some truth in it but the prob. with conspiracy theories is that those guys let their wild fantasy run-amok like saying there are non humans in power and those non humans are trying to use WIFI, microchips and electric to turn us into cyborgs ect ect then they will say things like the governments in the west are poisoning our food with, G,.M,Os and neurotoxins and using the food and water to help to dum us as a people down ..  What those guys don't really understand is this all of this comes from the KGBs disinformation handbook from back in the day of the cold war and the Kremlin back then and today uses these conspiracies to discredit the US, and the west to the rest of the world and their own populous ...  The truth is this is really a form of Marxism propaganda as the fare right and the far left are seeing anything corporate and banks business ect ect is out to get the working man the little guy,,,  Yes, they will say that the so-called New World Order is run by banks and business is working to bring down the human races backed up by the federal government ... But the Alex Jones, Randy Credico, and even the Glenn Beck of this world don't really understand they are nothing but useful idiots for the Kremlin propaganda machine ...  That told.... NOT ALL and everything that Alex Jones and/ or the Randy Credico of this world come with are from looney tune town... like all good lies and conspiracies, some of it has some truth in it, as any good conspiracies must have some truth in it to make it look credible..  What is really going on with the Alex Jones and Glenn Becks of this world is nothing more or less than that they have become victims of god old Kremlin propaganda and have become the useful idiots for the Kremlin propaganda machine..  Yes nothing more or nothing less than victims of KGBs Putin's propaganda deception and Marxist brainwashing techniques all of this conspiracies theories are helped along by anti-western leftists and right wing nut jobs by the ex KGBs like Putin himself and today's FSB to bring down the west the EU and America,,,, So what is this Kremlin, Putin's propaganda thing you ask ... Well, it is called Active measures and the Alex Jones and the Glenn Becks in conspiracies theory world don't even know it...  Take a look here at the link (Russian: активные мероприятия / Aktivnyye Meropriyatiya) https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Active_measures  Active measure is a Soviet term for the actions of political warfare conducted by the Soviet security services ( KGB )and now used by the Russian security services ( FSB) to influence the course of world events, in the Russian Kremlins favor, this includes but not limited to collecting intelligence and producing ""politically correct"" assessment of it,, and Active measures range ""from media manipulations to special actions involving various degrees of violence"".  They included disinformation, propaganda, counterfeiting official documents, assassinations, and political repression, such as penetration into churches, Active measures included the establishment and support of international front organizations (e.g. the World Peace Council); foreign communist, socialist and opposition parties; wars of national liberation in the Third World; and underground, revolutionary, insurgency, criminal, and terrorist groups subversion: active measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare the ground in case the war really occurs..  And how do we know that this was and still is run by the Russian Kremlin ???  We know this because we know who Vasili Mitrokhin was .....  And who was he you ask ...  He was a KGB cold war agent that became a defector to the west that took with him KGB files regarding the Active measures programs see link https://en.  wikipedia.  org/wiki/Vasili_Mitrokhin  Some of the active measures by the USSR against the United States were exposed in the Mitrokhin Archive: Well known Kremlin Active measures conspiracy theories put into the western minds ...  Starting rumors that the Jewish ""Control"" of the Federal Reserve for the new word order and anti-Semitic propaganda has demonized the Jew as a conspiratorial, manipulative outsider, often with powers and designs of world domination helped along by the USA government and the American banks run and owned by the Rothschild jews.  Starting rumors that fluoridated drinking water was, in fact, a plot by the US government to effect population control.]  Starting rumors that the moon landings were hoaxes and the money ostensibly used by NASA was in actuality used by the CIA.  Starting rumors that US, government at the top level let Pearl Harbor happen so the American industrial complex and Banks got the US public to join in and take part in ww2 .

@donnypodcast,"Around 8:35 the speaker talks about how conservatives are conscientious. Then he goes on to emit a string of falsehoods.  If conservatives paid any attention to detail Trump would have never been elected. Clearly ""conscientious"" is not an adjective to describe people so careless that they fail to do simple research on claims which are so false that they don't need to be investigated in the first place. Trumps claims at his rallies are so incredibly false that nobody should even think there is any truth to what comes out of his Nazi mouth.  Yet, Trumpers just stand there and nod and cheer without even hesitating when he makes wildly inaccurate, racist, xenophobic claims.   Another fun fact: I'm a liberal, yet my ""conscientious"" Trumper co-workers get annoyed with me for making sure that things are done right and that I am on time for all of my clients. Meanwhile, my ""conscientious"" conservative coworkers are chronically late for most of their clients and even their shifts, in the first place.    To rephrase what this less-than-diligent man is saying so as to make it accurate: Liberals pay attention to details and facts and won't be persuaded by bullshit.

They are propagandist. The label ""alt right"" is further evidence of the attempted deception. It's often followed up in mentioning with white nationalism. That narrow streamed aspiration ""white nationalism""....is fundamentally opposed to ""Liberty and Justice for all"". I don't believe you don't know that. Dr. JP is flame throwering Truth. Capital letter T truth. That is why he is popular. Classic Liberal is another giant clue boss. ""Classic"" really means ""actual""...""real"".... ""truly""... Modern Liberals are in fact just water downed socialist at best. Or a full blown communist at worst. They've even convinced our nation that the party of Lincoln. Has become the racist party. Not one Democrat signed the woman's right to vote, few signed the Civil Rights Act and as a result of Civil Rights...The party split. Did they call the racist Democrats racist? No they called them conservative? They followed that up by telling everyone. Since the south voted red.. those Dixiecrats joined the GOP. Guess what? Not a single one did until the 1970s and only 3 of 30+ did over all. One to fight a fellow Democrat for governorship and the last one switched 1979. The Democratic Party is and has always been the party of racism and identity politics. They even tried to teach my kids that Hitler was an alt right political leader. SMH... because he killed Communist...Who did Stalin kill? Who did Mao kill? There was nothing but communist in those countries...the top Communist always kills the competition. There is no misunderstanding. The Blue Church is the modern Socialist Joseph Goebbels. It is absolutely intentionally. ""We hold these truths to be self evident. That all men are created equal"". We didn't even need a new amendment. We just need to adhere truthfully to the ideals already laid out. Those amendments have been the pocket knives. These socialist bastards have been using to whittle away our rights. A simple Google search and you will see. No Dixiecrat became a republican during civil rights act. The propaganda never stops too. Aaron Swartz....poor guy killed himself. Just as you claim. A similarly ""truth"" seeking news organization did a documentary on his life and death. The Obama administration and Eric Holder harassed him....but they always cut to Bush Jr signing the Patriot Act. In a pathetic attempt. To make it seem as though the government used it. To pursue a case against Aaron. They charged him under the computer missuse act of 1954 and virtually never mention Obama or Holder. It had 0 to do with the Patriot act. That's not the lack of ""red"" traits. That's due to a bunch of Joseph Goebbels traits and it is not accident. It's not out of ignorance. The shit is intentional and your claim that it's a blind spot or misreading of the tea leaves. Is a cop out and it's obviously BS.

You’re mentioning your experience because you allegedly grow up in the 50s, that’s just your anecdotal opinion!!  As for IQ I can assure you mine is more than adequate to deal with the likes of you and since you’re the one trying to debunk my assertion why don’t you present some data trends to back up your claims or to disprove what I’ve asserted, rather than resorting to petty condescending insults, if you considered yourself to be the older and wiser in this situation then act like it!!",6년 전,0,

You’re making a straw man to attack you didn’t ask me what caused millennials to be this way which just shows your ignorance, you made an assumption that I don’t know that Marxist ideology has been infiltrating and spreading through the universities for decades!!

But I can make assumptions of my own and I think you’re jealous of Dr. Peterson’s notoriety I think you’ve failed to do what you wanted in life and you’re now just old, bitter and lashing out a people who are better off than you!  As for age giving you more knowledge and skills, well that depends entirely what kind of life you’ve lived, I know men who are 30 years older than me who have done nothing with their lives who have sat on the welfare for most of their lives drinking and taking drugs, I have friends who haven’t had a job and been on welfare since they were 18 they never got a trade or an education greater than second level!!   The reality is you could be in you 60s and dumb as a brick or you could be an intelligent young man with multiples trades or degrees, I had to leave my country when I was younger during the recession because the construction industry collapsed I moved to Australia and worked in construction there, I met a young man who already had multiple trades as an electrician, plasterer, welder etc.. his family had been in the industry for generations and he had been thought from a young age these different trades, after living abroad for three years I move back home and went back to college where I got my degree part time while working full time first in a warehouse as a forklift driver then during my second year I got an apprenticeship working for Accenture Digital as a data analyst I’ve since completed both my degree and the apprenticeship program I now have a bachelors in computer science and a diploma in ICT, on top of the trades I have in interior construction and welding in Stick, MIG and TIG, so I’m 29 I have a diploma, a degree, certifications in Java and Android and two trades I can fall back on!!  In contrast my father was a criminal has multiple convictions, no formal education, no trades and has been on welfare for decades he’s 50 years old, this is why I’m saying it’s anecdotal your experience isn’t the same as mine and older doesn’t always mean more skilled, knowledgeable and wiser!!   By the way I didn’t do all of that because of Jordan Peterson or any other influential figures, I did it because it was necessary for me to not end up in the same cycle as many people in the area I grow up in, I didn’t want to be another person living in social housing leaching off the welfare, I haven’t read 12 rules for life because I didn’t feel the need to but if other young men who grow up in similar situations to what I did find inspiration and the motivation to get their life in order from what Dr. Peterson talks about then that can only be a good thing!!",6년 전,0,

You seem to be arguing that because he was part of the same areas of the education system that much of the current problems are coming from that he’s guilty by association, are you not willing to acknowledge that he has been speaking out against political correctness and the problems with cultural Marxism within the universities, you seem to be allowing your issues with Dr. Peterson to blind you and then you go off in these massive tirades where you’re making massive assumptions about who I am or what I think, you think that I’ve been indoctrinated but when would that of happened?   I’ve told you my history I come from low income I’m not from the US or Canada so I wasn’t in those education systems I went to a rough public school that trust me didn’t care about any of that Diversity or feminist nonsense and I didn’t go to university till I was already in my twenties after working since I was 16 and when I did go to university it was a part time evening course that wasn’t in the social sciences or humanities subjects and finally I only heard about Jordan Peterson about a year ago when I already had my shit together you don’t know me!!  You’re talking out your arse because you have this preconception of what someone who likes Jordan Peterson is 🤦🏻‍♂️, you’re being collectivist grouping people by this arbitrary connection and making sweeping generalizations and assumptions based on your own interpretation of what this group of people are like.

No, we should ""offer"" jobs to those who are fit for it, regardless of being a man, a woman, black or white. Wouldn't be fair any other way.

The truth is that there are tasks that no man can do as good as women, like taking care of children for example [only women can deliever that special tenderness and motherly comfort] but if they just can't feel proud of that and instead feel the need to prove the world they can out muscle men in physically demanding jobs, then they will fail, because the testosterone just ins't there, and will have nobody else to blame but themselves.",6년 전,0,

@Anomynous,"Extremely complex. But it seems that the internet, mass communication, is both the revealer of the problem and the tool to cure the problem. Although some see the internet, social media, as being the problem or fueling the problem which it definately is not. It is easier for to attack it without proper investigation and identification of the problem. The way people act on the internet is a symptom of underlying problems. First step is to identify the problem before you can even begin to understand it to then see, evaluate, if there is a possible solution. And even then you cannot just go about implementing a solution, because the outcome would be in almost every case more detrimental. This video really goes in depth and only scratches the surface; anima and animus. There's a thousand layers to it and it can only be properly identified when all the great minds work together which is possible thanks to the mass communication, internet. Communication! Freedom of speech! Both the left and right leaning people know there is an issue and most of them skip all of the steps between surfacting problem and origin. You can say that only the great thinkers don't fit in the left and right perspective, they want to get to the root cause of the problem. Coming up with a solution, I would say, without infringing on a natural positive evolution of human kind, thus leaving them in liberty within the boundaries of our moral accepted standards, is to teach, inform, educate them, by means of example: the liberty to see uncontaminated (truthful in essence) information, speech, video's , vlogs, blogs. We have the inate ability to recognize archetypical stories, which speak to us more when it's real people in our time and world, hence the popularity of reality tv. However with the internet we have the ability to choose for ourselves what stories we listen to and hopefully learn from for the better. To go back to jumping to solutions, one example is censoring online... It will not cure the problem. Doxing, will not solve anything. The problem is still there and we know it! The underlying origin of the problem is also causing the implementation of the so called solutions, which in term would be a downward spiral and nullify the advancement of humankind that the internet would provide us with.",6년 전,3,

The only thing you were ever truly able to take pride in was your academic accomplishments, which are largely meaningless if you're not actually learning anything. I endlessly heard teachers talk about my freedoms, any lofty goal you could possibly think of. How I could be rich, famous or even an astronaut. But I still felt hollow, none of those things ever rung true as something to truly strive for. Responsibilities are the way to go. It grounds you in reality and keeps you from living in a fantasy world. It makes you categorize the world around you and force you to prioritize everything in your life. And most of all you do this not because you WANT to, but because you MUST. That it will give you meaning in purpose in life is all I ever wanted from the school system. Instead I felt more and more depressed year after year. My academics got worse over time as I slowly realized all of these 'freedoms' the teachers preached to their classes weren't even achievable by 1% of the class. They endlessly preached a hollow, untouchable god.  In the end hitting this realization made me not materialistic in any form, and as a byproduct, it's harder than ever to relate to many other people. I think it was worth it though, because of ideas like what Jordan Peterson says I actually feel happy and I feel as if my actions have meaning. That's something I have never felt in my entire life.

The thing is, they just slowly censor and ban their enemy which are: free thinkers, conservatives, right wing and libertarians.

This is why you've seen multiple events that try to sway people into giving up their rights. They want you to give them an inch.

@slitheringsoundcat7996," @Medietos  tl;dr at the bottom.   Seriously(I am as sincere as sincere can be), the more we learn about timespace(the unified field) collective consciousness, etc. The more apparent it becomes that what we focus on/lend our energy to grows in relevance/power.  Of course, there are a lot of YouTubers who don't actually understand the physics/science behind it and are misrepresenting it, but once you DO understand the physics, it becomes readily apparent.  It's too involved to explain in one YouTube comment or conversation, but you can start by looking into the holographic field theory, and the effects collective consciousness has on future outcomes.   You might think of these frightening things as monsters that feed on our fear/the energy we give them via our attention.  Conversely we can give things we WANT to grow our attention and they will not only free up our consciousness, but be more likely to result in a positive outcome.  Have you found evidence that chemtrails are real? Find an organization that's DOING something about it and move in a positive direction.  Think the illuminate is out to getcha?  Build a strong network of locals who will undoubtedly strengthen the collective against anything you perceive to be evil.   The thing about these positive actions is that they are very likely to result in harmful outcomes, even if the illuminate is a farce and chemtrails a fabrication.  Here's to good will.

Years of listening to people who think they know a great deal more than you becomes frustrating. Especially when they shut boys down for the way that we express ourselves, which is through deep communication. We can't sit still, and work and responsibility suits us well because of that. Especially if physical labor is a piece of it. Movement keeps our minds sharp. I believe girls are better listeners and can sit still longer, and the reason boys feel unsatisfied and get in trouble more in school is simply because of our basic biology. I felt depressed from my eleventh grade year until my second year in college. I couldn't listen anymore. It was also driven by my mom being very sick, but the lack of distraction in school made it worse. It simply took me eating slightly healthier and working out and hiking much more to become happy again for the first time in four years. We have to find what makes US happy.

@Texas75023," Cody Levinson  As a rational human being, it is easy and reasonable to assume every other human being wants exactly what you want.   Not so with Leftists.  They are motivated by jealousy and hatred of those who have any more than them.  They ultimately seek destruction of any system that does not place them at the top, or equal with every else at the bottom.   The ""modern American Leftists"" are Stalin's useful idiots, Marx's land-mine hand-grenade that his regime lobbed into Western Culture to ultimately destroy it.  He did not care if he lived to see it.  But he willingly sowed the seeds of America's destruction.   Murdering Babies is only one part of destroying America.  Dividing the sexes with Feminism is another.  Collapsing citizenship with open borders, globalism, and ""sanctuary Lawlessness"" is another.  Advancing Sodomy is another way to destroy the population's foundation - the Family.  Child mutilation for ""Gender Reassignment"" is another.  The acceleration of the demise is happening as we watch and we are PAST the tipping point.  Europe is gone as a civilization and will surrender to Mohammedism and Sharia.  America is next.    There is only one world-view that is truly tolerant and benevolent, patient, forgiving and forbearing.  That is the biggest threat to Leftism, and that is why they hate and demonize Christians and Jews.

My tweet: My suppressed book shows the Democrats (Fake liberals) v.lgly follows UN agenda which seeks decline of western civilization. I am a strong supporter of Trump but why is he protecting them by saying nothing about it (see Anthony Ravlich Google+).  I am sending the following to academics, particularly in Europe:  Dear  I am a human rights author (two books), activist and outsider (26yrs) from Auckland, New Zealand. Can you advise me what I should do? My recent book (see below) while selling on Google Books and Amazon is being suppressed – libraries will not take it, it is too expensive for bookshops to sell and because I am persona non grata I am extremely intellectually isolated.   The book contains vitally important information for humanity. It describes major decisions made by the United Nation which the mainstream media did not report. It shows how the UN on 10 Dec 2008 has determined western civilization for a decline while promoting the rise of totalitarian and repressed States. It describes a major rebalance of global ideological and economic power from the West to the Rest which I consider was the real cause of the global financial crisis 2008 which impacted very largely on the European Union.  My book is not a conspiracy theory – it is based on fact i.e. human rights omissions, not opinion, and is verifiable. Unlike virtually all academics I am not captured by neoliberalism and/or globalization so being based on universal truth I consider I am much more likely to arrive at the truth. My book has chapters on the United Nations, New Zealand and Bangladesh so do not deal with Europe. However, the following are some ideas concerning Europe which would require further research (also see Anthony Ravlich Google+):  SOVEREIGNTY. The ethical human rights I promote are universal, secular and firmly based on the Universal Declaration so would replace neoliberalism and globalization which require human rights omissions. I discovered that ethical human rights although intrinsic to the Universal Declaration had been overlooked by the global human rights establishment.  Ethical human rights require that everyone should have, at least, the core minimum of all the human rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consequently, ethical human rights would ensure a human rights bottom-line which protects against extreme violence and extreme poverty. If adopted by the EU the latter could hold States to account for their ethical human rights but leave States with considerable sovereignty as higher levels of human rights will be determined by the State including political parties reflecting the will of the people.  TERRORISM. I also show how who I regard as fake liberals drive the UN agenda to undermine global freedom e.g. promoting Islam, with its baggage of Islamic terrorism, in the West to engage in cultural warfare to undermine western values. In my view, if western civilization goes into decline so will global freedom. In the chapter on Bangladesh I show how the Awami League government executed a secular plan for the country not long after the UN had extended the domain of secularism to cover the whole Universal Declaration when on 10 Dec 2008 it had given equal status to the two sets of rights, civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, which make up the UDHR. This certainly appeared to lead to an enormous eruption of violence by Muslims who are anti-secular. The ethical approach I promote would enable the poor to have a voice of their own in the mainstream media so they can influence the democratic majority. My hypothesis is that ethical human rights could enable Muslims to replace violent jihad with a greater voice in the public domain. Ethical human rights, although secular is based on universal human rights truth rather than ideology so, can be seen as reflective of the nature of the soul and also reflective of God’s absolute truth (I regard myself as a spiritual mystic).

@chrism4247,"Mainstream media is complicit in covering up the most disgusting, downright evil and foul crimes and deceptions being committed by media, government, entertainment, culture, religion , big tech, big pharma and society as a whole. It is all overseen ultimately by people who believe that the world would be a better place if government, religion, money and society as a whole was ruled by one entity. An entity that believes that Satan is their god and that their entitlement is based on Babylonian heritage and the acquisition of wealth through illicit means such as war and faux ideologies such as progressiveness, communism, socialism, diversity and freedom of movement. The depths of how low these elites will go cannot be underestimated. Think of a group of people who think they can play god on earth and manipulate society into social chaos, conflict and ultimately war where they take sides and see people and countries as toy soldiers. Who wins? Both parties win as the agenda is to acquire wealth illegally from sovereign states this is why you have the UN the EU etc. Collectives of Nations under one administrative vehicle is the precursor to the new world order. Their ultimate goal is to destroy the population by over 92% as they believe Satan has told them its their pathway to immortality and eternal rule over the earth. Those that remain are enslaved in every aspect of their being. No freedom of thought, opinion is allowed, you are told. Satan is the religion and paedophilia is their vice along with satanic ritual abuse. Why do you think they push lgbtq? Diversity? That’s what you’re meant to believe but it’s to encourage depopulation over time. Destroy the concept of procreation and the nuclear family. Why do you think planned parenthood is so lauded? Let me make it clear I’m not against people being gay I have gay friends but the movement is being exploited and being pitched as the new norm rather than be considered acceptable along with heterosexuality. This mass deception is global and is being influenced and driven by sick people, evil people, greedy people and compromised people. All play their part and it’s happening before your very eyes. You are not being told the truth because the truth will turn global society on its head. Acts and crimes so wicked and foul it will be difficult for the average person to comprehend and digest. Logic, common sense and rational thinking are being thrown out in favour of faux ideologies with illogical theories and factual inaccuracies in frightening abundance. The message is simple, if you believe in life, if you believe in humanity, if you believe in love and respect for your fellow human being, if you believe in common decency then what colour you are, what religion you believe in, what political opinion you may have, what sexual orientation you are doesn’t matter!!!! We are all human!!! Let’s get together and stop this!! Now!!!!",6년 전,0,
@davidsharrock9536,"It all reminds me of the Divergent books. No coincidence these kind of stories float to the top of the creative consciousness. I would say The Hunger Games is also a topical commentary on the red/blue conflagration. Both stories replace the standard patriarchal hero with gender ambiguous females who look like women but hold traditionally male principles. Divergent highlights the need for a mixture of chaos/order in the manifestation of the Divergents themselves. Jordan Peterson is a real life Divergent. Hunger Games focuses on the morality of the human soul vs post modernist ideas about humans as machines, tribes defined and celebrated but simultaneously used for mass production in order to support a shallow, meaningless society of waste, greed and sin.",6년 전,1,

The only people who are happy leading that kinda of a life are people who are made for that (wether that be a leader , power maniac , work maniac etc.)I think we can all agree that women are the best choice at being at home raising children , instead of men (there might be exceptions, tough not many in my opinion).Men have an advantage at being in high positions in that ,  they can still get married and have a familly with ALLMOST no repercusions . Women do not have that advantage for various obvious or obscure reason wich you will have to find out for yourselves.That is why most people in high positions are men .You are happy doing the kind of job you are MADE to do , ofc society MIGHT make you feel otherwise and make you feel bad that your doing the job you are made to do instead of the job that gets you a million dolars a year even tough youd be miserable doing that kinda of a job.

I feel it's because we fight nature trying to be men when we choose to have a career while having children. It costs so much to live now that men can't get jobs at 18 to afford a family. In this modern world they need to have an established career and settled, which won't happen until 25-30. What else can women do other than focus on a career? Then by the time they want kids they have to maintain their lifestyle and their ""normal"" way of life in the workforce. Feminism has done harm to both women and men. My husband and I chose to raise our family different and we sacrifice so that I can raise my children. I always feel sad when other mother's hear that I stay home and they respond that I am lucky to do this. It's crazy the way people choose to follow mainstream, as opposed to plan a life that will make them uniquely happy.

@ericcolvin3546,"​ @Tekkker123  I had completely forgotten the above comment. I wasn't even remotely angry then (perhaps petulant that so many put-upon man-children see Jordan Peterson as an anti-Marxist messiah, come to earth to raise them to the exalted career heights to which they always knew they were destined; but that's equal to my irritation at women who bang on about glass ceilings and ""patricarchy"" in every second paragraph; it's not that I think any of these concepts are wrong — just that I'm a gen X-er with little remaining hope who finds all this scapegoating to be somewhat over-egging the pudding). So I find your touchy-feely suggestion of seeking ""help"" plain embarrassing.  Nope. I'm not ""trying"" to ""push"" any issues on anyone (and certainly not with the passion of ""Journalist David Fuller""). What do you mean by ""personal issues,"" anyway? You could certainly ""help"" me by elaborating on the meaning of ""personal issues"" in general — and explaining what, in particular, you suppose my ""personal issues"" to be.   Cathy Newman didn't ""let him onto her platform."" She did the job for which she is paid far more than ""Journalist David Fuller"" — which was to interview Peterson on the news channel for which she works. She did this because C4 News's programming team and editors (for whom ""Journalist David Fuller"" claims to have worked) are generally interested in people who speak truth to power — and it was they who decided that an interview with controversial Jordan Peterson might garner good audiences for their news programme. Clearly, they were right. Apparently, Newman's interview garnered far wider audiences than Peterson could have hoped for — since idiots from the other side of the world, who had never heard of Channel 4 News, now think Cathy Newman runs the network (or even, God help us, the BBC); and devotes her energy to destroying the last few real men willing to stand up to transexuals with personal pronoun ""issues."" (Mind you, America is also overstuffed with people who believe Birmingham to be a ""no-go Moslem area"" devoted to fomenting the Islamofascist overthrow of European civilisation; so much for the ""New Media."")  It's nice that you like ""Journalist David Fuller's"" ""intelligent use of words.""  I prefer the intelligent use of words, music and film generated by every Adam Curtis documentary since 1987 — some of which, I think, may have been influential on ""Journalist David Fuller's"" choice of style here. You may not have heard of him. If you like this long-winded, self-referential piece by ""Journalist David Fuller,"" you may also like Curtis's work. I suggest you start with ""The Power of Nightmares,"" and move on to something like ""Hypernormalisation"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fny99f8amM  Interestingly, Cathy Newman does not have to bill herself as ""Journalist Cathy Newman""; her job is self-evident . Since this particular interview, her employability and potential salary will have been doubling as fast as Peterson's worldwide reputation as an intelligent reactionary has octupled — no doubt why every ""self-proclaimed journalist"" feels the need to allude to him.​ She is laughing all the way to the bank.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

@brianblades6177,"Ive been feeling this for a while. Glad to see someone put it into film. I've thought a lot about this, and while i agree that we need to have open dialogue between both sides, there is an aspect to this that i cannot reconcile. i have trouble with some of the thoughts that peterson justifies. Often they are thoughts/ideas that are dying relics of a more conservative or religious past version of our culture. A few off the top of my head being 'there is a large percentage of the population that cannot contribute to society' + 'the mental stability of any woman the age of thirty not expressing an extreme desire for kids should be questioned' + His general comments on Marx/philosophers which misrepresent their writing to argue in favor of his ideology.  Its these aspects to his position that make me uncomfortable for a few reasons. One, he often speaks in over generalizations, often to excite a base into agreement, often against an argument that doesnt really exist or misrepresents the other side. Two, the insistence that by pointing out faults with society he is somehow providing solutions, even though its often defeatist in that it only once again excites his base with no real productive dialogue. And lastly, he is often pandering to a base that is often pushing dying ideologies. for example, the ideas that IQ and race are somehow relevant to a modern competitive society. More clearly, that somehow skirting the line of obviously dysfunctional race relations is in any way healthy, with the blanket counter argument that 'well since its not PC i must be on a higher intellectual ground because im braver than you'.   Now im not blind. I know the left is equally guilty of this. But i think in order to have functional dialogue in the first place, we need to redraw the lines of rational dialogue. What are facts, and what are opinions? What is productive and what is defeatists? What is biased cultural assumptions, and what is reality? These distinctions no longer exists. And yes i mean on both sides. Its for this fact that I am truly skeptical of our cultures ability to have real dialogue. You see this in our modern debates. They are simply saying things that their base agrees with, with some strange illusion that if their side yells the loudest in affirmation to them then they must have won...?   In conclusion, i think for me, the most disappointing aspect to all of this is that there are truly things that we all agree on. Everyone deserves freedom, everyone deserves compensation for hard work, and everyone (i hope) agrees that money should not be involved in politics. But heres the thing. We arent having that dialogue. Even this video isnt really even hinting at it. We are all collectively distracted by separatists political ideologies ( the core of this debate). Instead of having real dialogue, we are arguing about gender, race, and sex, when in reality these are fundamentally non-issues. These are historically mechanisms that those in power use to separate those without. So...unfortunately im a pessimist in this regard, and i have very little hope of our ability to see our way out of this intellectual/cultural mess. Only because, apparently, as far as i can tell, we have yet to ever officially get out of it as it is just as alive today as it was 100 years ago.

@lf9233,"Hi i'm a politologist, with experience also in politicals psychology. I found this video interesting as representative of a political trend that is symbolical to phenomena like trumpism. This video resume the political conflict among democrats (the blue) and the republicans ( the red) as a conseguence of a gender conflict. The current system, according to this video, is trying to demasculizing, or more generally, desexualising the people. The vector of this desexualisation is what they call a basis of the ""western culture or civilization"" perpetrated mainly by the left, or the democrats in US. Peterson made an interesting assumption based on a research made in political psychology about political orientation through traits. He explained the political orientation of an individual according to traits, i.e. degree of openness etc. He doesn't tell that this research was based on explaining the political choice of individual who are political unsophisticated, i.e. doesn't have the knowledge to understand the conseguence set in motion by the political choice, not because they are stupid... but because is objectively difficult. Through the representation of Peterson seems that the world of politics is only perceptive, and there is nothing empirical. In other words he completely ignore in his analysis the institutional mechanism that regulate the political framework, like the rule of law, the separation of power and so on, or the unpersonal forces of politic such as economy. And so do the author of the video. Another critic of the Peterson approach to individual political orientation is that the research is only based in US. This is especially important due to its bipartisan system. It is argued that this approach of analysing the political attitude of people is fitted only in bipartisan system and not in multiparty system, because also if you find traits that goes to left or right you will not be able to explaine the orientation inside the left or the right. Indeed my argument is that the US system, the bipartisan system, is the reason for polarisation, and as follow this gender discourse is coded from this system, because this partisan institutional system is fitted to represent gender concerns, for the same logic we have two genders, man and woman, as US has two parties, democrats and republicans. As a proof of that is representative how in NO other countries the gender discourse is so salient. In NO other countries we speak about metrosexuality, fluid gender or other things. By the way this are topics more fitted for anthropologists than for political scientists. Me as a politologist, i found it conerning that this people, apparently intelligent and well educated, shorts the western civilization as demasculazisation, or the left as a bunch of angry femminists. This message has really the shadow of the propaganda, where the author search to give a political representation based only on human primordial instinct, rather on rational discourses of economics and institutional problems and solution. Than again this is probably do to bipartisanship, because the democrats, as representative of the ""left"" (in US doesn't exists a true socialist party) take up the sexual minority or disadvantage as their constituency. This is propagandistic because it ignores completely what politic is about, i.e. the administration of the states through the right institutional choices. According to the video Trump won because he represent the vengeance of masculinity and of sexual difference and proud. But what about other more Serious things. Things that should be really topic of politics. Climate Change, the increasing gap between rich and poor, the fact US is maybe the only country in West that doesn't have public medical care, and people die or get broke for that problem. This problems are not discussed in this video, and seems that weren't discussed by the trump administration either.... oh yes, China invented climate change.... I want to conlcude this comment referring to the gay woman that say how jihadism is a counter response to desexualisation and how barbarism was a response to a sexual deprivation of the roman empire. It was scary. According to this people the social and historical problems we are facing are mainly sexual, but they ignore the structural reason for it. Yes maybe the thousands of white foreign fighters that went to Syria to fight side by side with ISIS were repressed in their manhood and sexually ( i can bet they were #ISISsucks), but if we want to explain this phenomena macroscopically, guys you have a ton of work to do, This is the problem when psychologism try to explain politics completely ignoring economic, history, sociology and political science. Maybe you are right, the last elections and Trump election were just a counterresponse to aggressive genderism and femminism, but if it so we are in deep trouble. Last sentence: every dictatorship, like Mussolini and Hitler, were based on machisms. I'm not saying that manhood is tyrannical, democracy WERE invented by man, but we should be carefull that the political discourse is not based only on this prerogatives, i.e. how is a true man. Political discourse should be ever about the materialistic and structural well being of the states, its economy and the society in it.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@josboersema1352,"Hello Dan, thank you for your reply. I do not accept your statements for the most part, because while people generally can appear to be somewhat confused about things that matter, at the same time they can be quite clever when it comes to evading taxes, organising their own vacation or finding out where to get the cheapest (slave made) goods. People can understand more then this self-righteous snobbery coming out of what this video was about. On that topic: self-righteous is a word about putting our own character out as being the new benchmark, without making much or any sort of general claim or reasoning thereto. If you notice these ' rules '  it starts out with something in the area of putting yourself out strongly. IS that what we need in this world full of war and greed ? If we need soundbite rules for people, the commonly known "" love your neighbor as yourself"" is just as easy to understand, and a lot better. I don't accept either that Peterson is a good guy, I have yet to see proof of it. I think he has written a vacuous book which promotes sefishness and other bad vices. People love it (if they do), either because they do have dented self esteem (which of course is bad), or they love the ego mania that comes ouf ot this, because now they can present their vices as good.  Did I put my character out as to be emulated, did I not objectively argue my points ? Hence I reject your claim that I am being self-righteous. This is a case of accusing the other side of the vice thisl group is itself engaging in. I accept however that I was a bit snobbish, sorry about that. Thank you for correcting my behavior.  After commenting I thought a little further, and concluded that the essence of what this video and book is about was contained in the word "" perfect"" in the rule about having your house in order. By saying "" perfect"" - which was unnecessary to the point - he has stressed that double, and when you want your house in "" perfect'  order, you will always have to be busy with it. Then comes the issue of what "" perfect"" is, of course, but without any hint of this being a moral stance (such has: stop ruining the world with your pollution, and give as much back as you get, or more), this can easily boil down to a self obssesed kind of life style, where morality and criticism of society in general or politics, etc, will be the last point on any agenda, a point rarely reached.

@josboersema1352,"P.S. On second thought, it appears I have been too forgiving. By making it so that only people who have their house in ""perfect order"" (which by the general norms of this society are about being wealthy) can criticize this society, people who are poor or otherwise being victimized are being muted. ""You have debt ? Shut up, you don't have your house in order, you may not participate in the political process."" ""You are wealthy, have two housekeepers, 5 cars and an estate ? We worship you, tell us how we can get our 'house in order' just like you.""   I did of course not read this book, however the argument also boils down to what the summary of it will be, because - as you point out - people do not care to read much either. It is the short version which has the most influence. When I see a society where only people who ""have their house in order"" may speak, I see a Fascist dictatorship.",6년 전,0,

Disturbing... I am left wondering what they are hearing in his speeches that I am not that encourages their hateful and thuggish comments. He isn't spewing hate or mistreatment of women, but way too many of his followers go there and it scares me.

@dieselheart1,"I've heard is said many times that Peterson is the worlds most influential public thinker. It may be true, but I think he is one of the rare instances of a none libetarian thinker allowed to speak publically. It is as thought they have waited and waited for the pressure of dissenting thought to build up to such a head of steam that anybody who has dared to articulate critisizm of the left has immediately become a symbol of that denied reality. Peterson is a brilliant individual in my opinion, but it seems as though the timing and orchestration of his emergence is not accidental, considering he has come to the fore in the Days of Trump.",6년 전,0,
@extolzebulon9831,"But what is the glitch ? Name the glitch. Is Trump a glitch ? I think so. Is Putin a glitch? deffinetly. Is truth a glitch? For sure Who runs the matrix ? I believe the glitch is a vibrational  level brought on by artificial digital wireless exposure  Our souls are rejecting this negative vibrational tune of man made artificuallity to control . We are spirit by nature not by science. The matrix is meantioned 6 times in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament the matrix is a Woman's cervix opening for Her First born Son to come into the world could this be when We receive Our Soul or do We receive Our Soul upon conception. WW2 has always intreeged me AS a Girl to what would posess anyone to stoop so low to commit such atrocities My Family were there in Europe in WW2  untill I found out through physical evidence and fact that what I was (told) was one of the greatest fables ever told which is now written into law. I don't believe anything I hear but half of what I see and all of what I feel. We have been using our senses all wrong . The gut feeling of instinct is the larger brain of the body the will mind proceses that gut feeling of the body and once the coast is clear the heart can then open.  It is dangerous if we can only think with our heart or feel with our mind. Balance is key. The fear of God brings You into reality. Re examining the movie the matrix I see the matrix was the coditioning / lie of the mind going feep into a maze of lies but at the end of the movie was sion but with a female head. Women or Men in power ?  Women and Men are not created equal. Both sexes have male and female and balance is key is this why when making love We are one  ? I Freed my mind for the rest to follow. Steer clear from the deceptive religions especially those who call them selves Christians but are not Steer clear from the deceptive roman catholic religion Steer clear from all organized religions who have a hierarchy.

It's PASTA for heaven's sake... it IS what it IS.  I'm sorry...the oligarchs in Russia and the bastards in the Chinese PLA government must laughing themselves silly seeing the west slowly picking itself apart in this manner.  It's this sort of claptrap that deflects from the two main realities in life and politics.  You either live in a relatively free society with rights AND responsibilities or you live in a authoritarian regime with lots of responsibilities but no rights. It's true that those who vaunt social justice seem to have the upper hand in western society these days.  Well and good.  As long as there is some balance with the need to act responsibly and in a manner that does not detract from the rights of others that's fine.  It's only been 79 years since one country used jingoism, nationalism and legally-entrenched racism to plunge the world into a conflict which ended up killing millions and gave us the atomic bomb!  79 years is peanuts in the historical run of the human race.  On the other side of the coin it's only been 49 years since the purest form of human endeavour...exploration... gave us the miracle of a man stepping down off an aluminium ladder onto the surface of a different world.  The twentieth century, the the west, was all about finding that balance between rigid dictatorship and far too much open freedom without responsibilities (the ""tune in, drop out"" types). It's all about BALANCE.  There needs to be voices at both ends of the spectrum.  This is the basis of true democracy BUT as soon as you start promoting one side of the argument to the detriment of the other you throw away those democratic principles which have kept the west relatively free, safe and prosperous for the last half century or so.  My worry is that whilst we engage in this collective navel gazing in the west the Chinese and Russians are carefully manoeuvring political thought in western politics to create chaos.  Election rigging and influence pedalling are de riguer for China and Russia.  China is buying influence in Africa and the Pacific by building infrastructure for cash-strapped nations...those nations not realising that they then become beholding to China to repay huge loans.

@genevievefosa6815,"I have been thinking about this. for a  long time. The societal forces that we see right now; the direction that society is taking, has been in the making for more than 50 years. The introduction of the Common Core teaching methods has a lot to do with the mindset of students coming out of school. It emphasizes students cooperating, working together in groups, at the expense of individual thought, and taking responsibility for how they interpret what they learn. This is reinforced by the media, which does portray men as primarily destructive and women as primarily nurturing. My question is, who controls the educational system - who promoted the Common Core methodology, and who controls what the media says about the status quo and the needs of our society?   It wasn't women who started this, though many women did jump on the bandwagon, believing that these values are the culmination of the Women's Liberation movement. Anyone with any sense should be able to see that these so-called feminist issues being promoted by our politicians are something else altogether. What they are doing is dividing our society from within, in ways that have seldom been seen, historically.   We must remember that simply because these movements towards bringing in all the undesirable elements from other countries, and attempting to destroy masculinity and femininity as we know them to be, along with all racial differences, pander to feminine instincts, does not mean that they were inaugurated by women.    I believe that in order to achieve true justice, both on a political and a familial level, one must seek to balance both the masculine and feminine principles. This is why Justice is portrayed as a scales.",6년 전,0,

Having said that I can see a crossover. both jordan and germaine hold the view that women need to be women, not men, but unfortunately living in a mans world (as the feminine was stamped on by many western male dominated religions) women feel they need to exhibit masculine tendencies to challenge and compete in that masculine world – which is a shame as we loose balance as a result. so, in the end both men and women lose through their own i guess unconscious action/inaction. I can’t help think that jordan blames women for the mess as men essentially are unable to punch a woman (strange thought for an intellectual) – I must watch again to confirm that but that is the view I was left with on my initial viewing.",6년 전,0,

@earthwizz,"The right/left political divide is a construct made possible by the dualist philosophical base of the patriarchy and perfect for manipulation of the population. The wealthy  and influential run all society's operating systems and have done for millennia. Cumulatively they are extremely practised at it, creating all manner of seemingly reasonable scenarios that suggest they don't. History teaches us that our evolving social operating systems modified the effects of the wealthy and influential, with democracy gifting the people with self-determination. Legal systems gave the people fairness and justice, political systems gave the people a voice, a free press gave freedom of speech etc. A study of history itself teaches us that the establishment always writes the history. An even closer inspection shows social operating systems created and modified by the wealthy and influential to suit an ever more educated population, by providing the illusion of systems catering to their evolving expectations. In reality our legal and political systems etc are the finest such institutions money can buy. Therefore they are not remotely what they claim to be, nothing like what's described on the wrapper.

@SamSam-xx6dv,"I’m getting the feeling that because Kathy ‘acted’ the same way aggressive men have acted in the past, is evidence of this ‘matrix glitch.’ Is she acting or is she ‘possessed? It’s been hypothesised Jordan has a religious agenda; certainly with his use of religious metaphor, this is so. Why pick on Kathy? Why pick on Serena Williams? As the lines between what we are used to seeing female and males roles gets blurred, those that are addicted to order are panicking, is this evidence of the rise of the alt-right? It seems the power gap that has formed as people drift away from organised religion, is being fought between those that want to homogenise society for equality and that that want to structure it to battle against chaos. It seems to me, we are also in a phase where some are seeing the folly of both sides;  a) equality via homogenisation where we all think the same, dress the same, kills off the very essence of individuality and the loss of the self. Whether the self is real or not, “I believe in free-will because I have no choice.” PH b) anti-chaos via control and organisation, pecking-order, celebrating the individual leads to narcissism, selfishness and greed. Blue church, red region. It’s all language of the binary. Them versus us.Rightly or wrongly, women have a lot to be enraged about; is this just overt sexism? How dare a woman argue like a man? As men historically have largely been in touch with their shadow side and are now panicking because, women are learning the same. As the PhD women desperately defends her femininity and thereby expects ALL women to think the same and men to defend their masculinity. This is about roles, architypes and those that can’t cope with how fluid gender is becoming. This is about putting women back in the feminine box, so men can keep the power. As Jordan admits; he wants to re-establish the ‘masculine power culture’, which I assume he thinks has been stolen by feminists and a new world order. Which he defines as a decline, but is it really? Perhaps it’s really just the same old chaos, different circumstances, different players but still the same man-made chaos. In other words, if it’s in decline. When was it in incline? At what time is the golden age we are slipping away from? Whilst some men become feminised homogenised under this pressure and other men become polarised alpha, none are really looking at the solution. As Jordan said, it’s forbidden to get violent against women in argument. Actually it’s also forbidden for a man to be violent against another man. This is all about lack of emotional intelligence, on both sides and from all points of view. As one contributor on the above video advises, “learn how NOT to let fear drive the choices you make.” Of course forgetting, fear also keeps us safe from danger. He also advises “turning inward”; as though we are the arbiters of wise self-knowledge. Truth is; humanity is not because there are humans on the planet but because of interactions between humans. He wrongly assumes chaos is to be avoided rather than what is really is. “We get order from chaos” Read James Geick’s book Chaos. Sapolski’s book, Behaviour, covers all of this; “humans are both a tournament pecking order species AND a team cohesive species. ”And also, is the rage actually the hole left by religion, now we see the appalling abuses religion has done in the name of organisation and order? Is this rage a symptom of the holes that we are now seeing as ALL our corrupt politicians are selling us new cloths, that we are now seeing as invisible? Or more likely; is this rage really just us throwing our toys out of our pram, as the new era is forcing a lot of us to grow up? As we fail to grow up and accept, we are the problem, we will continue to battle over which side is to blame, not quite realising, it’s us; not the matrix, we are the matrix. The parasite that consumes more than it needs. We are the plague species, the glitch is not in the matrix, we are the glitch and we made the matrix.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

As we have seen that for a long time now we have been ""totally brainwashed"" on even the root concept that all men are NOT born noble,  and many of our live experiences has re-enforces that.  Resulting to even demand peace, unity, prosperity and equal justice for all becomes just an utopian dream! Which has enabled us to  even start  formulating ideas in creating such a utopian world ? The alchemical admixture we are actually experiencing  of order and chaos is due to the systematic and directed MIS-CONCEPTUALISATION  of words in our languages ;   such as the ""concept of  freedom"" , without understanding the truth meaning of it. Freedom for a person to choose is the basic rights NO ONE  can take from you. If you choose to debase you nobility as a human being ,  its your right, and if you choose to fulfil the nobility we have in our self, that also is definitely our right. But there are CONSEQUENCES to each of those. As a society we want to live in freedom, that also requires sacrifices, rules and guidelines AND the continues vigilance that it stays so. Freedom is now taught to be and do whatever you want. And that creates chaos in your own live and for the society. President Trump is more then anyone today reinforcing to us all that we are all born noble, we need to sacrifice for the good of others, that serving others as rewarding and fulfilling, having virtues and being good is noble, to be fully aware of your rights and freedom to choose and the need to actively be part of it all.

@Telcontar1962,"1. David Fuller (understandably) tried desperately to protect Cathy Newman in this piece, but she is either a journalist with integrity or she is not. She is not and people like her are killing journalism. I don't care how ""warm and friendly"" she is. C4 News is partly supported by public money, they should hire journalists with integrity. Since she isn't one they should have sacked her for incompetence. In fact they should never have hired her in the first place.  2. The psycho-babble towards the end was nauseating. I don't know what planet Rafia Morgan is visiting us from but feminism is a top down movement. Its coming from University educated people, largely but not exclusively women, and has spread outward. I can guarantee Rafia they were very much cherished and encouraged etc as individuals as well as their femininity. That's to a large degree the problem. Its about time men started hitting back (intellectually) and rejecting the rubbish we're being force-fed. Its about time we made these feminist advocates earn the right to have a voice rather than handing the platform over to them uncritically.     As for Louise Mazanti I feel sorry for anyone who is relying on her expertise in the field. She feels the ""female collective rage"" needs to be expressed? Why does it? In the west, where this rage is predominantly being expressed, women haven't experienced any of the injustices of that past in fact they are THE most privileged section of society in human history.  Where as men as a group have suffered to a far greater extent in the past, and are still suffering today because they generally put women first. If anyone should be full of rage it should be men. They usually don't because, well, rage in women is something we are so very used to.  The only thing this piece raised that should be hammered home is the responsibility, and the living up to your word angle. What being done in the west is smashing those principles to smithereens. In the UK at least where this reporter comes from he might take up that up and ask:  How is this country in the EU?  Why is the country fighting so hard to extricate itself from something it collectively never agreed to join in the first place? Why are there so many immigrants in the country? How have we got so many millions when collectively we would have NEVER agreed for so many to gain entry.  Our politicians, whether they were bought and paid for to do these things or not, have smashed any notion they are either responsible or trustworthy. Since democracy is the name of the game and the methods by which the country can be consulted is at least as easy as being able to slaughter them by the million to defend it I think its very reasonable for these questions to be asked. They really are fundamental to our evolution as a society rather than this sort of froth. So why don't ""reporters"" like David Fuller ever ask them?    What sparked Jordan Peterson off was governmental/legislative control over an aspect of his life he felt was an over-reach. If democracy is the way we are to control/mediate what government does then we had better start asking more pertinent and soluble questions such as those I asked that can and should be be addressed in that domain rather than asking esoteric questions about male/female interaction.",6년 전,1,

@TiempoNuevo-ew7ty,"I think the ""anti-male"" is a backlash of against Roman/Greek/religious/ traditional treatment of women.  Women are angry, and confused. Many are abused:  physically, emotionally, economically, mentally. Women do not feel safe. The continuously have to be cautious morning to night and even when they are sleeping they are alert to potential intruders. The reason women have found it not good enough to be a stay at home mother any longer is because they dependent not independent.  I remember very clearly how much of a big joke the wife, the mother, the mother - in- law ..the woman was depicted a stupid, frumpy, As a teen I found it appalling and at the time I did not ever want to be a wife or a mother. Then there were all those scared women running from the bad man, being choked, being raped, being gossipy, petty.  Women have had nothing but negative images of what it is to be a mother.  They were rarely shown as real living beings.  One would believe that they never exerted a muscle except to remove something from the fridg, or vacuum.  Women were pretty much portrayed as nothing.  I fully understand where the man bashing came from. During second wave feminism women were angry and hurt.  They knew women who had been raped by family members, brothers, fathers, uncles, oppressed by employers, There were tight rules for most females about everything about why to apply make-up so that you appeared to have an easy day. how to sit, stand, talk, walk, even where and what to look at, the social rules were overwhelming.  And it appeared that men had no rules at all.  Males could do as they pleased.   So, perhaps men should be looking inward about how they treat their wives, girl friends, co workers, clerks, nurses....females are first human and expect to be treated as human first. We have a generation of girls now who think making fish lips photos is sexy I guess...they copy what they see, have seen in media, within their families, friends.  These kids are very confused. They are looking for respect but do not have a clue of how to obtain that.  These arguments are not old at all Plato, Aristotle, and many philosophies determined that women were not developed human beings. They were not even attractive. Women were to be like the Spartan women who were considered as nothing of value and their ""only"" value was to give birth to sons.   The Greeks philosophers go into detail on justifying misogyny. ( Read Plato and Aristotle you might be very shocked. )  Women were the vessels for men's sperm to give him sons.  If daughters were born it was ok to place the infant girls out side to die or to be taken by anyone who wanted them.  It was just fine if she became a slave.  Females were not in the social structure of Social Hierarchy but out side of society as were slaves. Females were to be taken care like their animals.  Then there is the father in the bible (Daniel): Two men (strangers) are walking down a street and a horde of men want to attack them.  The horde bangs on Daniels door demanding he send the two men out.  He sends his two daughters out in exchange.    The daughters were raped the entire night and went home the next morning.  (What the H)…  Even God Hates Women?  I turned my back on all organized religions at that point.  Even the Great Buddha left his wife to go tramp about the world leaving his young wife without a husband and his son without a father.  That is what men do. Rich or poor.  What is a poor woman supposed to do?  Probably back then a poor woman would have to become a slave or a prostitute.  Perhaps the reasons are different but the bottom line is the same. Men are self absorbed and their perpetual disengagement with women, except for sex, food, and the work that goes into maintaining their homes, raising the children,  doesn't cut It when there is no respect.  Men almost always have held the fact that they earn the money or even more money over women's heads...like a threat.   So just considering these things is enough to anger women. And men wonder why their wives or girlfriends gradually creep into not wanting to ""perform"" in bed. And that is an entirely new topic.       Well that is my end of this discussion..my partial input.",6년 전,8,

@zeeski7454,"There's a balance between men and women, that's the sole reason why humanity has gotten to this point. The demonstration of this paranoia is part of the reason why women aren't taken seriously either, you claim women have it harder and have no choice and aren't respected, where exactly? Looking at bottom line numbers more men are incarcerated, men are greater number of work fatalities, war fatalities, suicide, greater chance to be homeless, men are the victims of violent assaults in greater numbers, so on and so on...   I think the plight between the sexes has evened out.. How many female school teachers fuck their students and don't get the proper justice they deserve for taking advantage of a younger immature victim, but we are supposed to believe that women are the real victims of sexual abuse... Women abuse men as well, but it's not physically beating, it's emotional playing on men's nature to protect women and using it for their advantage. Women also control 80% of the spending in this society...  Peterson makes a great point in this documentary when he's spreading with Camila, it's practically forbidden for men to stand up to women because the rules aren't defined, it's up to the same women to stand up to their crazy sisters, which this series of contents just proves that's what's needed. Anytime in public if you ever see a men potentially attacking a women people will always come to the defense of the woman, when it's the other way around nobody stands up for the man... Engaging in some firm of party back believing men owe you because of what you've precieved to be abuse will get you actually abused because men colltively are coming to the conclusion that women are getting out of hand and we will not stand for it anymore.

In the first case the cities were wiped out (sodom and Gomorrah).   In the second case, because of what they had done to the man’s wife, Israel decided to make war against the men of Gibeah, stating to the tribe of Benjamin “Now therefore give up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and purge evil from Israel.”  Gibeah was in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, and the men of the tribe chose to oppose the rest of Israel. God directed the rest of Israel in the battle and Benjamin paid for this by almost being completely wiped out (only 600 men from the entire tribe of Benjamin lived).",6년 전,0,

They refuse commitment. Marriage. Family. Societal responsibility. Birth rates plunge, and the ground we believe as stable buckles under the tectonic strain. We are in trouble if we do nothing to repair the divide between the sexes. The immediate future is going to be female -but the long term forecast is collapse and ruin. Civilizations run in cycles after all, and we are at the cusp of a great unraveling.  The culture and institutions  we evolved no longer hold true. Religion no longer binds us, neither does culture, family nor country. If men have nothing to live for, and nothing to defend, they abandon their normative frame. They ghost, reduce both production and consumption and leave the burdens of society increasingly on women. Look around. See who's going to school. Who is making progress in society. It's not men. But in turn, who is increasingly unhappy? Who is depressed at ever increasing rates? Who is left to raise every generation, now more and more single handedly? It's women.

@bademoxy,"37:00 ""collective rage"" of women is being acted out irresponsibility as toxic femininity-goaded,aided and abetted by marxists controlling media and schools. since no man-particularly white straight males (who invent, create and maintain virtually ALL the infrastructures which makes civilization possible)is deemed innocent of ""guilt and shame"",they are given no recourse other than giving up on supporting society or actively seeking mutual destruction. the MGTOW movement  is a Kamakazi genetic suicide strategy aimed at outing what remains of western feminine women by isolating themselves off spiritually from them, although many higher status successful women are acheiving that resulting misery  all by themselves. they utilize freedom of disassociation as passive resistance. a for a more proactive counter revolution , all men have to do is withdraw the constant support our infrastructure requires -again another form of passive antifeminist  resistance comprised of say 10 million critical service  workers all taking 3 sick days off at the same time, which would paralyze north america -possibly causing casualties - for weeks ,driving the point of man's importance home to women's physical survival. discontinue the inherited genetic identity and you discontinue the civilizational culture. if i'm wrong, then find a culture which outlived the males of that culture.   feminists seek to destroy the patriarchy but reap destruction of themselves.",7년 전,1,

Where does happiness lie?  He answers with the first law, the first principle: ""Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man."" (ch12v13)  This is what Peterson is talking about, perhaps without the religious connotation, when he talks about the idea of personal responsibility lighting up the eyes of the young. However saying so without including God, the One to be responsible to, he risks letting the vanity of the atheist, who claims the negative to be proof, into the realm of responsibility, and that means responsibility to ones SELF which is just another form of vanity. And that is the worst, for it is the vanity of the dictator. From such an idea came Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot.  Responsibility can only be TO a higher power, something greater than oneself.

The western culture, as part of a concert of world cultures is changing, partly to accomodate globalism and partly because of it's own ""dying"" spasms. It's all going to just gather speed until the entire process reaches critical mass. At that point it will consume many people like a tornado. Sure, sounds like a sad prophecy.  BUT.

They repeatedly and vigorously coerce people with biases (that they're probably profiting from significantly) every single night to the millions that are still paying attention to it. I empathise with those people ofcourse because I've been there. Too many people have their self-structure invested in very long working hours, and coming home to watch TV, never seeing beyond that because ""that's just what people do!"". You tell someone who's structure lies within this sterotype while telling them that the news they watch is full of lies and bias,  they will often take that as you saying ""You're too stupid to see what's in front of you!""

@billf9129,"Men and women have been doing a specific task in society for 20,000+ years, longer in you involve the ancestors of humans.  Women bear the children, this won't change in the foreseeable future.  Men, for almost all of history, have provided the shelter/food/safety for the family so the female can bear and raise the children without having to worry about it.  This is standard thru a large majority of nature, females nurture and help develop the offspring while males provide food/shelter/safety for the family.  There's nothing wrong with a woman who desires to raise the children, she is probably the most important person in a child's development and not one woman who has the choice to do that should feel ashamed, instead she should be admired and praised for putting her children's welfare 1st.  It's not impossible or wrong to change the internal desire/need to continue those tasks, but to think it will change in 40 years of women being part of the male culture of being the ""hunter"" instead of the ""gatherer/mother"" you are sadly mistaken.      Dr. Peterson said he is not sure if men and women can work together in peace, a 40 year experiment in the grand scheme is not a very large sample and he is 100% right.  To demonize ALL men for being masculine and saying masculinity is THE REASON women are being sexually assaulted in the workplace is asinine.  Bad men doing a bad thing is the reason.  Just like any other situation in society, the fringes are the reason for the deviant behavior.  Call a spade a spade.  A bad person is a bad person.  Sorry for the rant.

@tschr979,"Openness - do anything and everything you can to feed the poor.  Conscientiousness - make sure that in feeding the poor you don't help their population grow such that the world is overwhelmed with people who can do no better than poverty level existence. This means to acknowledge the DNA component of IQ. Which is considered quite ugly to a person high in openness but quite practical to a person high in conscientiousness because those high in conscientiousness know that they will bear the burden of the unintended consequences of the unsustainable growth of low IQ DNA people.  So it's okay to alleviate the suffering of the poor but not so much that you sacrifice your own family's well-being. And in general only highly intelligent people  would even consider these things issues. People high in openness would say it doesn't matter the long-term consequences , help them anyway. People high in conscientiousness would say it's okay to help them but they must use birth control so they don't breed out of control.  Poverty sometimes is a result of circumstance but mostly it's a result of low IQ which is mostly genetic.

@jassondea5510,"Watching this video as a single 42 yr old male with two daughters, the eldest 13 and the youngest 8 with a string of failed relationships behind me I saw so much of myself and my family in what was being discussed.  I want my girls to be confident, successful, to be fair and to be treat fairly, to be able to build good solid relationships with people, both male and female but not fall into the traps outlined in this video in regards of being angry at men and masculinity. But at the same time not become that angry masculine themselves and use it wrongly but at the same time not become a victim of being over feminine., if that makes sense?? I feel all of my failed relationships with women have made me feel very uncomfortable in myself, feeling a failure, that I aren’t good enough to build the kind of relationships I want for my girls for myself so I feel as though I can’t guide them properly because I have failed in these ways more than once, so what do I know....  I think for me personally I have always felt powerless to assert myself because of the very things that are talked about, I identified with the masculine side, not being allowed to be  angry at the way I have been treat by women, and I don’t mean being violent in any way although I have had relationships where violence has being directed at me by my partners and not being able to do anything about it.  And at the other end of the spectrum becoming introverted and moody, that I fully understand, I don’t mean this to sound whiny and I have played my part and take responsibility for why my relationships have failed.  I think what I’m trying to say is I get what is being discussed, much of it really hit home. My problem now is how do I guide my girls not to be the type of women talked about in this video.? Their mother is a good mum but she does kind of fall into this category of women outlined here. She does have the very traits talked about so I just hope and pray that I can give the confidence to eventually be the women I’d like them to be as I’ve noted above.  For me though and I think for many men they feel this and it takes away their platform to be the men they want to be. Maybe we just don’t know how to be what we should, I know I feel that in many ways and I have completely taken myself out of the relationship thing as it just hurts to much, but then as a male I’m not supposed to or allowed to say that, it shows weakness then. I don’t know if any of this makes any sense at all but I’d interested if anyone else, men feel this way or get the same feelings I got from watching this. Thank you for posting this video, it’s really made me think about these things in a way I’ve never really understood or thought about before. Jordan Peterson for me really makes sense in what he says about men and how many of us feel. This guy needs to be listened to.",7년 전,0,

@malaikamillions,"So as not to take huge offense by these seemingly denigrating, & broadly generalizing statements on classes attached to belief systems I value, I need to remember that I never really belonged because I cogitate in multiplicity, and am likely ignorant to these alien invaders to a whole system turned dark.  I'm a recluse by choice, in rejection of simple dualistic thinking, & avoidance of idiocracy state of projection.... I have to admit that the swaths of people now assigned such belief system identities, or having it seems usurped these titles of a formerly sacred ideology, are likely a whole new beast: obvious by the tracks they leave on the path, & the wrath spewing from an ever widening social rift. I'm loathe to hold back this vomit in my mouth at hearing liberals cast as lazy, lacking responsibility, personal sacrifice, or lacking accountability? That strikes me as Insane since the Unionist movement comes from the Left, the civil rights fight of the sixties, as well as the Hippie commune I was born on; all define these characteristics of hard labor, responsibility, personal sacrifice, & accountability. (Still cupping the vomit in my mouth). So, who's the Witch what took over the socialist movements of responsibility & autonomy that I was raised on? Has every Ism angle & far corner formed their own ISIS, & the Left version is this ""social justice movement""? I do know that all hearts can corrupt with a taste of power, or more realistically ""the delusional sense of increased value via group cohesion"" turned mob justice, while they chew on the cud of drunken group think. I believe in autonomy, & tangible contribution to community instead of external assignments of value. my motto: ""I don't need to belong. I just want to participate."". There are many actors this so called women's movement who are more driven & hungry for attention than they are for a prepared educated & enlightened approach to seeking change. These ""harpies"" instantly encourage the ridicule & invalidation of the true need behind the millennia old wound of oppression & rape culture. I find it most egregious when an Academic would be so lazy to choose these fools to base their destructive instead of deconstructionist & otherwise potentially viable theories on.

@bbwolf26,"I'm really tired and confused by the seemingly widespread acceptance of this concept of ""Alt Right"".  I believe this is a completely deliberate and very deceptive misnomer.  We generally accept that conservatives are on the right and Liberals are on the left. Conservatives are trying to conserve or limit the power and control of government in order to preserve individual freedoms and prevent corruption; sometimes at the cost of providing services that might seem on the surface to be humanitarian.  And that liberals are willing to use the power and control of government liberally in order to provide and facilitate causes or services that they think are ""right"".    Then you should be able to easily see that the far extreme of the conservative right is anarchy or no government control, and that the far extreme of the liberal left is totalitarianism or complete government control.  Its a clever slight of hand to name the famous totalitarian dictatorships of the past ""Alt Right"", such as the National Socialist Workers Party (NAZI/Hitler), or the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks/Stalin), or the Communist Party of China (Mao Zedong).  These dictators were not right wing, they had the same Marxist, Communist, Socialist ideology as the American left is claiming today as they protest in the street.

Naked Consciousness, that which is Self-Radiant, and prior to the quiet witness behind all of our eyes Is who we fundamentally are, but to abide as what we arise in there must be true ego reflection and that has nothing to do with left or right philosophy, but rather the truth.  The truth is women and men are different in their experience and expression and the fact that Consciousness is One prior to the patterns of our small selves and biological psycho-physical constructs is no justification to force the patterns to be one as the SJW's try to do.  You can only get past the patterns into enlightenment by acknowledging the truth.  This is why it is so detrimental to beings who happen to be ""transgender"" in their minds, to cater to that mental construct to the point of bodily mutilation rather than deep consideration of who they really are and not fixating on gender,  the former path leading to eventual suicide the latter to self understanding and abiding as what is prior to the construct of gender... as most most people all do in moments of contemplation, moments of love, moments of joy...  how often during the day do you identify yourself as merely a gender rather than the infinite depth of Consciousness Itself.",7년 전,0,

Since broadcast news and discussion has become increasingly  our government's mouthpiece, increasingly under the control of political ideology, and as a deep state agenda has been forced upon what used to be organic dynamic medias, the gulf between healthy thought processes and ideological agendas has become wider - the Kathy Newman interview was the most beautiful conscious eruption of that reality.   Many of us already saw it, but this clash between the organic evolving consciousness (which is expressed online, but has been around since humanity) and the forced moulding of politically correct language and its attempt at state control of our mindsets, for me exposes the fact that EVERY western media is being moulded by the same force- no matter if you are canada, us, uk or anywhere in europe or oz - it is all the same unstoppable force meeting the immovable object.

I am sure that if both Hitchens and Peterson could have been in a room together they wouldn't agree on almost anything, in an honest conversation. All the people that you mentioned value actual truth, empirical evidence and objective thinking except for Jordan Peterson. Peterson has a nack for saying what you want to hear but in such a way that he muddles the truth, and if he wants to lie, he will change the meaning of truth to suit his argument and come out on top, but that is far from rational. The first arguments between the rest and Jordan Peterson would be religion, since he is a religious (possibly deistic, but definitely not irreligious) person, the rest are atheists, or otherwise opponents of any god if a god existed.",6년 전,6,

What I like most about Peterson is that he doesn't come easy, same with the others, each one in their own perspective. I will always find points to agree and disagree with all of them. I don't see any of them as infallible. There are subjects in which they are really good and others that is better not to mention but the only way to get there is by listening to them.

It's a crisis for us all that he is now held up as a ""thinker""... nothing he has to say is novel or thought-provoking. His misconstruing of Marcus Aurelius, Jung, etc is either the sign of a puny mind or of an deliberste obfuscator. I think so often how much we are all in need of Hitchens at this moment.

@sizzlepants8525,"Eliza Veretilo horrible events lead to radical changes and while they are never ‘good’ slavery is solely responsible for the mass integrations of cultures we enjoy today. We also cannot solely focus on specific events otherwise we’re just being dishonest. The Chinese that built the railways of America were every bit slaves, white people have been enslaved many times you realize? Societies have been egalitarian before, societies have heralded the LBGTQ+ community before (Ancient Rome and Greece spring to mind) and societies of all cultures have been a hub for inclusion, 1100 Middle East no less is a good example.  I’m not trying to rant forever I’m just pointing out that there are so many considerations to such things that only a narrative and point a finger. We as a free society measure the individual regardless of their race, sex and physical appearance, social standing or political affiliation etc etc etc that’s the ideal right? That means no ‘all blacks *insert racism*’ but ALSO *all whites *insert racism*’ and any other variant. Slavery exists TODAY, across the globe and in many cultures of many cultures why isn’t this the focus? As a society we’re seemingly all on the same page across the spectrum barring the extremes which represent a minuscule number anyhow but you cannot expect people over 50 to act in a way they weren’t forged. Before a massive surge in information and integration people in the 60s-70s still lived in the very segmented communities and people exchanged information in the form of old wife’s tales, truths and knowledge people had no meaningful way to refute. Today though it’s nothing like that and no one should be treated as such unless they are actually inciting violence and hatred which unfortunately is happening but not at the entire race level, at a small specific demographic of people that have ridiculous prejudices, exact same situation in many Muslim countries also I’m afraid and far worse. Your right ultimately about the reality of the world we live in but all this bullshit right now is because of a collective willingness to change and the counterpart resistance to change which is rarely defined by a particular race and is often liberal right?

@elizaveretilo3672," @sizzlepants8525  the mistreatment, torture and killing of innocent people cannot justify any advancements in culture. This is what you are claiming, that slavery and the genocide of the native people is okay because it gave birth to America and 'the culture we enjoy'. The killing of 35 million people in the Soviet Union was at one point justified because it was done under the banner of the 'people's revolution'. Once yous tart justifying violence, you side with the dictators and Nazis. And why? Because you like hip hop? I'm not denying that white people have been slaved too. The working class in the UK live in true modern day poverty, but that doesn't mean that we turn our backs to systemic racism and sexism.  There are countless of examples of cultures integrating without enslavement and extermination. Have you read about the Basque sailors? They bothered to learn the language of the cultures that they traded with, right before the conquest. We justify violence because it is impossible for our conditioned minds to imagine any other way. Please stop deluding yourself and calling the USA a free society. The 13th amendment, your health sector, the muslim fear, immigrant children separated from parents in forced camps, school shootings, ruled by coorporations, having to swear allegiance to the flag every morning... it doesn't sounds too free to the rest of the world, mind you. Fine, we are working towards universal human rights, but we cannot do it without acknowledging our mistakes and rectifying this behaviour.",6년 전,1,
@sizzlepants8525,"Eliza Veretilo detach a tad because I think you misunderstand where I’m coming from on this.  Slavery is never good yet all races have been slaves. Why focus on one? Regarding American slavery, without it it would be England 2.0 before our own mass integration post the EU agreement in the 70s. Again, something terrible that became something good because where would we be without the likes of MLK sociologically speaking.   Horrible events in the past that never should have occurred did still occur and they will again regardless what I think of them.  I’m not justifying violence, of course not, that’s exactly what Nazis, communists and many others have done in pursuit of their utopia. It’s also what the alt left/antifa are doing against republicans as well as groups against men and white people lol. What is white privilege if not a racial stereotype designed to dismiss?   We are apes, violence is in all our natures and it most certainly has its place. The only place it doesn’t is the Utopia and I’m sure you’re aware what happens when we chase that.   I agree about America, I’m not American btw, it’s owned by corporations, the wealth divide is a fucking joke and it’s corrupt at every measurable level but the ideals western societies pretend to uphold are still the greatest we’ve ever come up with and they still hold the most promise in the event we can one day ‘fix’ or more accurately unfix the economy to work for a greater majority.   We aren’t making the same mistakes as best to my knowledge and I refuse to be held to the actions of people whom happen to share my skin colour that I’ve never met, the way we all should. Identity politics is the enemy and much of these modern narratives are predicated on acceptance of ones group identity and the subsequent racial stereotypes they incorporate.   The biggest mistakes I see made in RL, in my time that I’ve witnessed are liberals assuming someone is more like them because they are liberals. Awful logic.

Too much to really address on YT lol",6년 전(수정됨),4,
@elizaveretilo3672," @sizzlepants8525   you are right that this is too much to address on a YT comment. However, I'm not focusing on just one. I think when people hear the term 'racism' they tend to immediately think about the US and it's recent slavery using African people, but I mentioned other examples of racism too. I talked about the native people of the Americas which were and are being exterminated. I think the whole colonisation of the US was a racist enterprise. What was done to the Ameri-Indians is sadistic. Maybe people focus on the recent slavery in the US because of the fact that it was a recent thing, it shaped culture, and it's still prevalent albeit in more subtle ways. Have you read 'To Kill a Mockingbird'? Aboriginal Australians, the people of Bangladesh, South Africa and it's post-Apartheid racist country, Maymar, the Middle East (even though now we are going to step on the Religious freedom territory). Racism is the fact that a person who isn't white never sees themselves represented in media and advertising, unless they are a stereotypical character. Racism is the 'stop and search' policy in the UK. Racism is people of India and the Caribbean using skin bleachers because culture has told them that they can't accept themselves.   If you are white you haven't gone through that, but had empathise with people who have.   Men empathise with the sexism women experience, and yeah sometimes you might get falsely blamed if you happen to belong to the general group of the oppressor.   As apes that are evolving we are moving away from violence towards reason, community and compassion. The most advanced we can be is cooperative, not competitive.   When we realise that we are in this together that is when we are going to finally begin to grow and evolve. Would you say that we spend more money in war than in health and education because we are ape who tend towards violence? That's maybe so, but it doesn't need to be that way for ever. I should hope not.",6년 전,0,
@sizzlepants8525,"Eliza Veretilo media, business, enterprise and the ‘rat race’ are white culture lol and while it may seem disproportionate it’s ever changing and most likely proportionate to the populations it resides in.   This racism thing has gone way past common sense. It was propaganda to begin with, on all sides at various times spreading misinformation, stereotype and fear. This naturally dissipated when integration and communications developed. Racism is also a subcategory of prejudice and serves no good purpose remaining detached, all it does is allow the grading of various forms of the same offense which in itself is bias.  Of course racism/prejudice exists but of course freedom of speech is paramount. Let people have their opinions, let them have their say even if it’s retarded because the VAST majority when educated, integrated and given the freedom to think for themselves will never choose to be so closed minded, and they don’t.   I refuse to even acknowledge the notion of ‘sensitivity training’ outside an unacceptable verbal incident occurring in the workplace, given that this is solely for white people it’s a modern form of racism currently accepted much like white privilege and the male patriarchy. Ultimately it involves attacking a group of people by people whom feel justified doing it and we’ve already covered how that goes.  Individualism is the answer like it is for the ideal of our free society.  While there are certainly scumbags and plenty of idiots they are individuals not representatives of all those who share their melanin levels.   I’ve read to kill a mockingbird and I’ve certainly done research into issues like these that helped shape my opinions but the matter isn’t a perspective in a book it’s an efficient perspective founded on truth that moulds the public consciousness across time and doesn’t perpetuate further tension and segmentation and this just comes from living in 2018.  Maybe a look into the media practices and their constant hysteria regarding racial issues and clickbait etc   Again I’m not arguing that racism doesn’t exist I’m just saying there are many factors surrounding it and many narratives and incentives rolled into it that the obvious can be hard to see but it’s there and it’s true. I don’t give a fuck and neither does anyone else who isn’t juiced up on social justice or some ‘gurus’ koolaid.  No sane individual today believes they are superior because of the interpreted colour of their skin and if they do it’s because they were isolated and misinformed/abused for years. This goes for other interpreted colours being inferior also obv.  Also a big thing is the ability to do this shit unfiltered and in writing in a manner we would rarely emulate in real life and people go nuts with shit like that, I’m sure I have.   Drop group identity’s, they’re the essence of prejudice, stereotype and segmentation, that ones a given.",6년 전,4,
@elizaveretilo3672,"I did know that. I wrote above about the fact that there are countless examples of slavery across different cultures and no, it is NEVER justified. I know that Africans sold Africans, and there's still tension between the Caribbean and some West African nations regarding this issue. Unfortunately no race is united, and as a human race we aren't unified either. I am not condoning the actions of any race enslaving another. I know the Irish have been enslaved; the Belarusian, the Polish, the Welsh, the Jews of course, etc. However yes, I do believe that white Americans and europeans, particularly the upper classes, must eventually acknowledge the damage they've done, especially the damage they did with violent colonisation whose main weapon of division was racism. Do you know what they did to the Australian aboriginal people for example? I don't think every white person must feel guilty, but we must acknowledge that some of the advantages we enjoy were built with violence and systematic racism, and yes, there should be education about these issues, acknowledgement of the damage and compensation.@Anon Ymous , I hope this is not too much a stretch for you to comprehend.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

How ever much intelligent people might say ""we don't expect or want women to do these 9 million different things"", there will unfortunately still be overwhelming numbers of loud mouthed feminists saying that women should do those things.

@MauBast777,"Very interesting and it's funny how this ""brushes"" the essence, without being able to define it, while the answer should be obvious : Fuse Your Brain.  Blue : Overly Dominant Right-Hemisphere of human neo-cortex (Yin).  No ratio, rigid group focus, no true sense of Individuality, no emotional self-control whatsoever, emotions controled by the group - ""I Feel Therefore I Am"" identities,  psychotic.  The Right Hemisphere is the Emotional (neo-cortex) Hemisphere and the main source of Group-identity.  If that Hemisphere is overly dominant, you get sectarian people with low individuality/low ratio levels and a very lousy capacity for emotional self-control (since they are emotionally defined by their group.....).  If the OTHER  (Left) Hemisphere is overly Dominant, the subject will overfocus on ego & ratio and lack empathic capacity & sense of  ""group-cohesion"" .  High drive towards individuality (!),  ""I think therefore I am"" identities,  but emotionally disconnected. Hyper-rational on a superficial level, but no true sense of Reality either.  The human brain has two moduses which need to be balanced out & fully connected  - this brain ""set-up"" does indeed manifest a Yin/Yang Polarity and so do the thoughtforms & cultures (!) which come forward out of its manifestations.

My mother died when I was 7 of cancer... and less than 2 years later my dad remarried and I gained a highly tyrannical step-mother, and 3 loud, overwhelming step-sisters. And I've felt with the female teachers I've had... the female bosses I've had... the relationships I've had trying to land a decent relationship with women (which I suck at, even though I'm attractive) -- I have simply learned by experience that I am at the mercy of women. I have none of the manly confidence I should have developed. I'm actually terrified by the rejection of everyone from my parents, family, friends, and employers that I am shrivelled up and I ACKNOWLEDGE that it's a seriously bad problem. I just have no idea how to fix myself. I want to be a useful man to society, but I feel like nothing has or will work at all to help me be what a man should be. I read and learn about the issues we're facing, but in my heart I don't know how to change ME. How I intuitively react to life and people. So I just fail at it. Perhaps I'm not alone??? I know I have a problem. I just don't know how to fix myself. What's the answer? People like Peterson who I could listen to and read from for days on end, to which they clearly state the issues (which I am partially to blame for).

@Megan_Roberts,"Wtf! Feminists don't hate men we aren't even angry. We just want men to stop raping and murdering us. Stop trying to own our space! How is saying can you not rape me, murder me or treat public space as a male owned zone where I have to dress and act in a way that is acceptable to males to be accepted an aggressive thing? People who are in power are only frightened by feminism because they IMAGINE it key word there is IMAGINE that feminism would result in women having the power over them they have over us now! That isn't even close to what we want we want true equality that means we are safe to walk the streets, dress as we please, enjoy life and habe the same expectations of both sexes, the same responsibilities and the same rights! Bunch of frightened men thinking they are going to lose something out of equality...if you dislike women so much you cannot handle them being equal to you and feel you have to tell us to sit down and shut up just go be gay and keep your woman hating opinions to yourself! All I see is these men letting fear create their opinions. No feminist sees herself as a victim we see ourselves as human beings who deserve to be treated that way, beautiful and individual don't run your mouth because you are pissing your pants because you might have to give a shit and be responsible for your actions as a male! Women have had to be too responsible for too long time for men to take some responsibility for once! Feminists hear this all the time this assumption we are angry or man hating its so rediculous especially for those of us who are straight! We love men we love men so much we want the fact women are capable of abuse towards men to be acknowledged and men that come forward about that abuse not to be belittled and made fun of. We love men so much we want the role of father to be acknowledged as just as important as mother and see men given as much time off after a baby is born as women, given the freedom to be the main caregiver for that child if he wishes as men are just as capable of caring for babies as women in a truly equal society and with truly equal thought processes. Don't let the propaganda fool you feminists aren't angry and we don't want to take over and make a matriarchal society we want to see a good balance of both! We want to see men having choices and freedoms they don't currently have too. The suicide rate among young men is so high and honestly I put it down to the very toxic phrase ""big boys don't cry"" men aren't encouraged to seek comfort or help when they are distressed from a very young age. In a feminist society you just wouldn't have that crap! I am annoyed this was just turned into a rant against feminism. If you are anti feminist you are anti woman. If you are anti woman go be gay! What I really want to see is men no longer allowed to make political decisions about women's health because its leading to some really uneducated policies that are dangerous and wrong for women. I am sorry guys but you are all too worried about having access to those blue pills to keep your dick hard to make any fair decisions about women's health and even sometimes GPs that are male don't have enough understanding of it.",7년 전,0,

He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, 10 and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing.

All of the things are eschatological realities that were predicted thousands of years ago in the Bible, for instance. As he essentially repeats what it says regarding the direction of society, he cannot be incorrect. Exactly what was forecasted is exactly what we see occurring in greater society.

Whereas helping those who wont help themself even if they can has very little reward behind it and thus no motivation to be more than those who do nothing even if they can.  If you have a good and comfortable life you are grateful for how willing are you to give it up and live at bare minimum standards because the equity of your good life could allow 10 other willingly useless and ungrateful others to live the same miserable bare minimal life as you now?         How hard are you going to work if you know that no matter what you do you will never get anything better in life for it than what those who do nothing and no gratitude for your efforts have?     That's the crux of the problem.

That means that the leftist mindset is characterized by a fundamental totalitarian logic. On the other hand, conservatives are not at all of the controlling type, quite the opposite: they typically insist on respecting the natural diversity of individuals and behaviours in the society, instead of willing to impose ideological schemes.

@martyrobinson3566,"I take issue with what Jordan Greenhall said about it being “essential” that the “Red” and “Blue” “Churches” should meet in the middle. It seems that he is trying to co opt Peterson’s view to match his own. True, the idea goal is to form a conversation, a free and healthy exchange of ideas and and understanding between the two “churches” but that only works with people who are willing to do so.  It is apparent to me that Peterson is also of the mind that the Blue church has to be fought, very strenuously.  Jordan Peterson has already risked his career, livelihood, fines and imprisonment in doing so.    Frankly, it is darn near foolhardy to try to have a normal healthy conversation with someone who has cut off dialogue altogether and declared “war” on you.  Those who know the Left know that listening to any conservative views is “taboo” and agreeing with any is an offense worthy of Excommunication.   What is need is needed in response is not gentile dialogue but courageous  and sacrificial effort from individuals on the *Red side to act as a counterbalance to the effects of the Blue*.    The problem with “moderates” like Mr. Greenhall is that they believe so strongly that the Moderate way is the ONLY way that they will spend most of their time fighting their own side to try to get them to conform to their way of approaching the problem. This makes them into, not only a waste, but a hindrance to anything that their side wants to do.",7년 전,0,

This was the reason why people went elsewhere, because people could see things with their own eyes yet it was not being talked about in the blue church. A recent example here in the UK was massive scale grooming/abuse in the Telford area. The BBC hardly mentioned it, and this is where the real power of the  media lies-if it isn't reported then you won't know about it. The so called alt-media informed us about it instead.

For example the Communists want to be involved in every aspect of your life and they want to take over everything similar to Italian mobsters. Where is the fascist don't care so much about what you do as long as you let them from the government and you stay out of it as they make themselves rich. The Democrats use stealth by appealing to your heart and your wants though they are heartless and they really want all you have. In slightly varying ways they each want to be the authority over you and remove as much of your freedom as possible. They may disguise themselves as beneficial to you but really they're really just beneficial to themselves. America is the only country that was designed this way. The More leftism Creeps into the Republican Party and they move into a progressive mindset, they to want all power but they're not as good at it as the Democrats in the US. In the US our constitution gives us remedies but those remedies are hidden from the general public as they remove history and Civics from the classroom. Like all other totalitarian governments the only way they can have power is if the public is naive and or stupid. Be less informed you are the more they get away with everything. Even when our government officials are put into power the party backs their favorite tool candidate. As an example, very few congressman know that Congress created the Judiciary and that the Judiciary is usurping power it never should have had and Congress has the power to reduce the power of the Judiciary. In the founding of this country there is only one court that is mandated and that's the Supreme Court. Even then the Supreme Courts makeup, how it functions, what subjects it is mandated to listen to, and where is Authority ends and how many judges are supposed to be on the Supreme Court and all rules therein are completely created by Congress. Every Court in existence below the Supreme Court is a complete fabrication of Congress. And yet they relinquish their Authority to the courts that they have authority over because they created them. so if our government officials are blind and stupid about how government should run what chance do we have to live to the ideals of our constitution, our Bill of Rights, and all the founding documents and writings of our founding fathers? stupidity and ignorance are the power of the left. the more ignorant you are about government the less you should complain because the information is available and if you'd rather go fishing or boating rather than understanding how your rights to be able to go fishing and boating will be taken away. Don't complain when the left says it's cruel to go fishing as they are now saying it's cruel to defend yourself from terrible people. I'm able to counter left this extremely easily because I know their past I know history enough and typically leftist resort to either violence or they scream away crying like little girls. The other Advantage I have is that I can defend myself against wimpifide leftist.",7년 전,0,
@melenedezssss,"I was very disappointed that this reporter admitted that he is part of the liberal-left and seems shocked and surprised that the left behaves the way it does. He seems like a grown up, and I would have hoped you would have known better. I wonder if he realizes that he has been living in an echo chamber of leftism for far too long and was incapable of noticing the facts that he knows today about how terrible the left is. I'm sure though his utopian view of leftism hasn't been erased. I think he probably still believes that that is a strong part of leftism when in fact the Horrors of leftism are its purest form. For example the left in America likes to point at Trump as having been aligned with Putin. But go back as far or as near as you want, the left in America has always aligned itself in part or in whole the Communists and all the words that Society has to offer. There idealism is not the worst part though it is like an idiot child who doesn't understand the limitations of life. The problem with the left is that it will lie to everyone including itself notary to push an agenda in order to push their false belief system. And when they don't get an easy when they're not interested in the hard work of true evidence. The left is very happy to win under any circumstances. They are the true bastard children of Nazi Germany when you think of Hitler's believe in the ends justifies the means. Or, is propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels who proudly said that if you repeat a lie often enough the people will come to believe the lie. And yet I've seen what I just said the left will take its crooked little dirty fingers and make that claim against people on the right no matter how false it is. With the left evidence and facts be damned when they've been taught that they can falsify and fabric their own evidence and proudly falsely claimed that it's true. Win at all costs, when in any way possible. This is what happens when you have a party built on atheism. They believe there are no consequences. It said that character isn't what you do when people are looking but rather what you do when no one else would know what you actually did. the left doesn't care about character, truth, honesty for any virtue. They've been raised to believe that there are no consequences.. and as long as they see none in this world, they don't see any consequence in the next world because to them there will be no next world.. then they wonder why children are driven to kill each other. it's because the left has removed honor love of God and therefore love of each other out of the equation. their new scapegoat is begun when the problem is really themselves and their ideas.",7년 전,0,
@melenedezssss,"I love this interview. But, one line did cause me to want to comment and that was that online is forever meaning that if something is put on the Internet it's there forever. The left doesn't like to argue ideas they like to force everything down your throat because they can't defend their positions. In the real world the left in the United States is removing the past of the Democrat Party under the guise that it's offencive to have Confederate statues when it's really just a destruction of the history of the democratic party that they want to hide from the new Democrats who haven't been taught history, which is another means with which the left wants to hide its horrific past as they Point their sins on the people of the right. But to say in the internet world that they can't hide from the truth that's not really true anymore is it used to be. As an example Barack Obama has been successful in eliminating all videos where in he use the phrase if they bring a knife you bring a gun. There been a couple of other videos in which Barack Obama could be accused of all the nonsense that the left blames on the right. Only Barack Obama's is a lot more distinct and clear but on the left they have to reach pretty far to fabricate violence and offensiveness on people on the right. For example when Al Sharpton falsely claimed that the tea party was racist. In any other context he might have gotten away with it. And he did for a long time. But he was offered Rewards from $10,000 to $100,000 if he could provide even a single video or recording in which anyone at Auntie party did anything racist. He could not and so he silently disappeared with that comment. Sadly there too many ignorant and ignorance of enablers who still perpetuate that the tea party was racist when they themselves could never prove it. I left is still trying to delete its history and all evidence of its lies.",7년 전,0,

@TheJohnCooper,"What we're seeing on a base level is the friction point between the masculine and feminine. The masculine is about boundaries and transmission and the feminine is about internalisation and reception.  You need to have a healthy synergy of both for their to be growth.  Modern day western women are being weaponised again men.  They have been lied to and whipped up into a frenzy, and they have in turn, flipped into their masculine edifice that lies at the heart of their feminine.  Cathy Newman and feminists at large, are actually embodying the real Patriachy which is fascistic, dominant and untempered.  Because the feminine is predicated on internalisation; it's masculine point is hidden within. (Much like when babies are in faetal stage, the balls are internalised to form ovaries, as opposed to externalised to form testes for men.)  That's why you see this dynamic played out in many different dimensions:  such as the antifa mob hidden underneath a balaclava/ the internal trojan horse tactics of left wing theory into academia / the hiding behind the image of victim identity to attack and gain power over others. And they impose the power of the collective, or mob that encases their raging masculine edifice, to do the dirty work.

Transgender person A, if “they” were driven to find meaning internally would work to come to terms with how their identity informs shapes perceptions, and then how their identity informs their behavior. Taking responsibility would mean accepting oneself. But what Leftists insist on, taking up the cause of the transgender person, is that this individual, in order to find meaning (and “safety”) must be afforded acceptance from the world around them. They can never be fully human unless they are fully accepted. And if the power of the state must be called in to ensure that said transgender person never feels unaccepted so be it. I have heard trans people say that rejecting “preferred pronoun” usage negates their existence! Insert any other identity group and it would be the same story. Ben Shapiro addresses this very well.

Absent a good measure of self-love, we have no love to give so no relationship will satisfy for long.  The work Dr. Peterson points to needs to be done, not on others, but on the self.

The specific case of self ownership by sovereign entities but the general base covers the specific.  Serious discussion of ownership, however, tends to expose the commonality of an underling desire to take what is not owned, by combination of force and fluid definitions of convenience. A desire rooted in the very same seduction of theft and coerced servitude (up through abject slavery)  Following that primary exposure, the propaganda and rot in the current system becomes exposed and may* lead to those currently in power losing their pyramid scam.  *(In reality most citizens either don't have the particular cognitive aptitude to have the discussion or won't allow themselves to accept that they have been brainwashed and scammed their whole lives and would rather have the psychological comfort of protecting the illusion.)",7년 전,1,

Blinders come with every belief we take on, making us unable to entertain perspectives divergent from ours.   Life is actually more perfect than our beliefs allow.  Everything that comes our way is a gift, a blessing of whatever kind.  Pain & disappointment are inevitable in life, but suffering is a choice.  A great Perspective Shift is occurring now, creating the chaos with our different rates of shifting.   Life is what we make of it.  Our perspectives are the critical fulcrum, potentially enabling us to look at things in multiple ways, empathic, if you will.  Things are not right or wrong, they are desirable or undesirable.  When 2 ppl do the same exact thing, they get judged differently, they are seen differently - can't be helped.  Depending on the values & beliefs they hold, one could be ""right"" in what they're doing, the other ""wrong"" for violating their particular beliefs - yet they're doing the same thing.  Everything is relative in 3D, not black & white.  Just as we all have both testosterone & estrogen running, we're also a complex mixture that includes everything, both light & dark.  It's time to allow ourselves to just Be, & to allow others the same grace.  If we don't like them, we move on.  We don't blame them, just make the best choice for ourselves & go.  No one has the right to judge that just so we do no harm.  We don't truly know what freedom is like - we don't have it.  Sorry for going on so long, but Jordan gets to ya, ya know?  :D ~♥~",7년 전,1,
@messenjah71,"Sita Rainbow very thoughtful, just like Mr. Peterson.  The perception of synchronicities is a matter of awareness, yes. Once you become aware, you begin to see that they occur quite frequently. What they are is an entirely different question. Obviously, they are highly personalized experiences. I surmise that they point to an underlying spiritual structure to our experience, one that operates according to cause and effect principles above and beyond the physical cause and effect rules studied by scientists.  As for belief: there is a danger to belief primarily because when we believe something, by definition it is true to us. We reverse cause and effect I.e ""I believe it, therefore it must be true"" as opposed to ""It is true, therefore I believe it"". This is why people with conflicting beliefs will go to war. Not believing what I believe becomes an existential threat. This is why the only harmless belief would be in Love itself because the potential to experience and therefore realize love is available to everyone.

@DavidThomas-ku7ls,"Maybe the best way forward is for men to go along to feminist meetings and peacefully demonstrate and demand that feminists stop demonizing all men and demand respect.  We have to get over the idea that men have no moral right to challenge women.  And feminists need to learn that they have to enter into dialogue with men, and not just have a conversation with themselves.  Both sides need to listen.  Feminists have been unchallenged for too long.  For too long, feminists have exploited the guilt of men to silence critics and demonize all men.   As women want respect from men then it is only right that they respect men in return.   At the moment, the Establishment and mainstream media is persecuting males and expect that men just be quiet and agree to accept their punishment.    But they are provoking trouble.  Reasonable modern men are happy to share wealth and power with women.  But we are not prepared to become a persecuted group who is always mocked, hated and otherized by Feminists... and the new liberal establishment as a whole.  We will not happily wear the chains that Feminists want to shackle us with.  We will not be their whipping boys.

I'm not saying that the earth is only six thousand years old either, for I know of histographical problems that make the young earth chronology untenable. Evolution and its theory is untenable for cause, that natural selection is unnecessary.  The macro molecule known as DNA for short, does not contain the information that produces higher levels of organs and systems in body plans. Even epigenetic information does not account for it, though the research shows that it provides some.  So mutations in the DNA and epigenetic information during early development of an embryo can never produce a novel body plan. See Christiane Nusslein-Volhard. and Eric F. Wieschaus experiments with fruit flies. It is time for this lie to have a public wake and burial.  P.S.  Have you ever pondered how much information is required to build three-dimensional structures, like say for instance, a thirteen trillion connection neural network or sixty-thousand miles of blood vessels, capillaries and arteries delivering nutrients to 37.2 trillion cells according to the Smithsonian on Google search.

In classical Islamic civilisation, the Blue and Red (or Purple, Red, Blue?) memes predominate; whereas in secular Western civilisation, the Green and Orange (or Blue, Orange, Green?) predominate.

So many experiments on public violence have shown time and again that strangers will almost always defend a woman from a man, but not the reverse. This myth of unvalued femeninity is tiresome.

@josephvictory9536,"I do the same thing every now and then in intimate conversation. Generally saying 'what did you think' is no different to 'what was your reaction' or 'express what went on in your head'. For her clearly there were emotions, which she expresses as such, and then afterwards articulates their form in relation to archetype. Which if you take as is, expresses what she thought as a result of it.  You can argue that in finer nuance, 'what do you think' asks for more of a judgement. But if she did not form a judgement in that way, but instead experienced an emotion which she then properly analyzed. Then her form of response is both normal and correct to her experience. Properly answering the question with a soft implied ""i did not think but rather i felt and later thought""  Its how people who are very intuitively honest and emotional talk, and its how smart and honest non-masculine women talk and express their ideas. My girlfriend is the same thing. Usually i have to ask her a few times for a judgement since while she does form them, for her, what is more important is the complex nuance of the feelings, which reflect in part some aspect of her, and others reality. Revealing information.  The judgement is useless to her and perhaps puts her reactively into a box which she rejects.  Many times i am the opposite, expressing my judgements clearly as thoughts in relation to ideas and observations. Feeling as if my emotional reactions are sort of on the wayside.",7년 전(수정됨),19,

@LittleKitty22,"It's frightening to see what has become of women. I'm in the process of getting dismissed from my job of 17 years for not joining in with political correctness - I've had hysterical and deranged feminists from the HR department scream at me, shrieking that I ""must be mentally ill"" because I'm not like them and because I, unlike them, look like a woman and don't try to look like a man.   I have been denied support from rape crisis centers by WOMEN who instead support my RAPISTS!!!!!   These ""women"" claim it was me that ""raped my rapists""!!!!!  Seems basic biological facts, such as the basic fact that a woman cannot rape anyone, is out the window...   I haven't always been treated fairly by men, in fact I have suffered some horrendous abuse from men - BUT: only because crazed feminists allowed the men to do so and to get away with it!!!   These same crazed and unhinged feminists are driven by uncontrollable fury and envy because I actually look like a woman and because I am neither obese nor do I have blue or green hair. So they take their own - serious - issues out on me by allowing violent men to do what they want to do to me. They - the feminists that is - enjoy my suffering, it gives them a kick, and I have lost count how many times I have seen a demonic glint in their eyes as they were watching with glee whilst I was being abused/raped/beaten/falsely accused and threatened with prison/stoned (as in having stones thrown at me, not as in being doped up) - whilst encouraging the people committing these acts of extreme violence towards me!   What does all this say about feminists???   I'm making a clear distinction here between feminists and women. Because most WOMEN  are like us - decent, nurturing, empathetic.   Feminists are the unhinged and dangerous creatures that in a more normal time would have been locked up, put in a straightjacket and a rubber cell, and sedated.

@amelajay,"32 year old mother of 2 young boys here. i agree with you. i am thinking hard on the dynamics of our family and my boys' lives... they will be home schooled. women want men so much to think and act like women... then the result is having weak, self-lacking, unmotivated, and unstable men. or, for other reasons, they are weakened to this end. many men are saying they do not know what it means to be a man- how to put that to action without penalty. if a man isn't weakened, he then overcompensates and is ""too strong,"" usually resulting in a real jerk. critical thought is so needed. true intelligence and a genuine education is only going to be available to those who step outside of the framework society is setting up, with its new pronouns and acceptability of all things... you're not alone among women. i value my career goals (i'm a grad student of art therapy), but i have always made priority of my children. that's my first and most important place in the home. women are becoming as aimless as men as they try to do and have it all... i fear for my kids, too. i think the best i can do is be sure there are great role models and an exceptional education made available to them.",5년 전,0,

@Uncarnaled,"jamela carnes i have found that as a man the best power you have is the power of to never concern yourself with other people’s issues and what they say about you and remain a stoic. That way even in environments of great pressure it’s what is within you that drives you not what is around you. And I’m a believer in Jesus Christ and I’ve found myself having absolutely no fear for anyone except God. That way, where people respond to changes and stress through what they fear on the outside(conflict, failure, death,hell) I respond to what I fear in the inside (God) thus, my responses are according to his will. Teach your boys to not fear anyone and though it’s very controversial to say this they must stand their ground if threatened. First by issuing a threat and if the attack persists, fight back. I was a mommas boy for a long time and I learned this lesson the hard way but it is one of the most important lessons a men must learn, to know when to unsheathe their sword. And thus with all that power men must be slow to come to anger if provoked creating leeway for logical deciphering of any escalating situation. Your considerations will be helpful for your sons but I’m telling you shielding your boys by sending them to home school makes it worse because the above values are not imparted onto a person by mere premeditation and deciding to adopt them, they are molded into someone’s character by experience and practical usage. Real life situations encountering real deluded individuals and homeschooling accomplishes none of that. Your boys should go through the cycle on their own and decide what kind of men they want to be because eventually they are going to leave the nest and momma bird won’t be around to care for them. So I advise you to let them learn at a normal school and provide guidance but only they can decide if they want to handle themselves because I can assure you one thing, ultimately we don’t have power over who our children decide to be",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@torhockers1482,"I couldn’t agree more. I don’t have children but my friends do & I’m astonished at how quickly they turn into recluses with their screens. Believing everything they read in their brain ms that haven’t developed yet & with schools added to this I’m terrified at how every single person has a “right” be it right or wrong. I’m 43 & I know we all this this type of behaviour when we were growing up but our parents taught us right from wrong. Nowadays parents don’t have any rights over how they raise their children. We are losing parental rights to raise our children with common decency, solid social behaviours & respect for others & other peoples values & property. I am astounded how rude children are & how socially inept & gullible they are. I put this down to never being out & about, mingling outside with others having social interaction person to person. Eyeballs to eyeballs. They can’t read other peoples body language & majority can’t even take a joke! Being ribbed by friends was a form of bonding & fantastic for brain function & ability to read a persons behaviour that could so easily be lost when messaging each other or speaking through online games.  I’ve never been a demerits however, I do feel that as a woman myself working in a semi female environment with horses & ponies to which I had to leave due to the politics & stress of the bitching & toxic nature of competitive yards that I was on eggshells everyday to working in a male environment of hard landscape, where I flourished due to being a hard worker, getting my head down, NEVER, excusing myself for being a young lass but compromising certain work that I knew would hold the team back to doing something else just as valuable, like mixing the muck, loading the wheelbarrow for the next person for brick, slabs or muck. I never complained & I EARNED their respect. Women that scream at men, assault them & degrade them I find absolutely abhorrent!!!!! How dare they! We are all in this together. We may both not able to do the same work but we sure as hell can work as a team.  I feel that back in the Neanderthal times where women did their job in foraging, preparing food, raising children, which, I may add, was a village effort, the gifted women that could help with the hunt would go with the men, can never have too many reliable hints people & the men that would spend days out working & bringing back food I feel is the reason we are all here now. That! Was teamwork. Now, we are all fighting for what exactly? To all get to the top? Oh great! The new Gen are going to be lost amongst a virtual reality & with no compromise as they don’t know how too.  I always thought women were meant to be the strong silent type that gets stuff done. Why scream when you can silently work hard & gain respect waiting the long game. We all need to work together & also stand up for each other instead of being the petulant hold that never grew up.  If you shout & use your fists you will be ignored. Speak quietly & people will have to lean in to listen.  I feel for every parent out there that sees what their children are being brainwashed into. They are almost robots heading for self destruction. The level of violence, the amount of meds & the suicide rate is petrifying. I dread to be a teacher in these times as it seems that kids nowadays don’t want to be taught, they see & hear everything they think they need to know via the internet.

They said that it would have been better if communism had taken root in THE WEST first OR IN BRITAIN . It seems that these people worked in media - and finally they all vowed that they would continue to 'use propaganda for race and gender issues - without apology'.

Let me start with, I'm not sure if it's sad-haha funny or just sad-damn that's not funny, that comments and responses to videos like these are as f#cked up as they are. I mean people literally just put, ""...came for the comments."" I don't blame them! Comments are far more entertaining but should they always be? I don't know...what I do know is that a good majority of them have missed the point. Peterson himself refers to his astonishment at the prospect that men being told how to become men is a new idea for young men.  Let's get that straight, men being taught how to become men. The Rebel Wisdom therapist also references this notion. That's why I bring the bible up: In a scripture it talks about boys having to be taught to be men.  This is not a new notion, a manuscript from approx. 2000 years ago references this same idea. So old it's radically new! #dickbutt..... cause it wouldn't be YouTube without it. Cheers!",7년 전,0,

If anything, Peterson represents a traditional, rational, Enlightenment approach, whereas Newman is steeped in the feelings-and-narrative-over-facts-and-reality mindset of the postmodernists and their subsequent bastardized interpretations.  Peterson is not a new invention, or really part of any form of intellectual counterculture, but is simply letting truth itself, conveyed by his superior intellectual training, correct the derailed media establishment.  If anything, and hopefully, Peterson and his ""Intellectual Dark Web"" (really?) compatriots will bring about a restoration of epistemology; to raise the values of truth, correct descriptions of reality, and honesty over emotion, subjective interpretation and personally lived experience.

That belief alone, in my opinion, is what is breeding the rampant cynicism and distrust in ourselves- and ultimately in others- that is so painfully present in our current culture. Once we take responsibility for ourselves, we will realize that we are our own controllers. We are doing the steering. We can achieve true greatness on both an individual and superorganismal level.

@cman011,"Hello. What is this greater whole? Is it the human collective, or is it an immutable system that we are part of? How does one separate themselves from the collective that they are inherently part of? I am having a hard time understanding this.  I agree that the adoption of a utilitarian mindset (and other ideologies like it) will most likely lead us to the muting of compassion, which is arguably one of the most integral aspects of humanity, resulting in a 'uncaring and uninvolved reality' and probably eventual 'degeneracy'. This is why its important that we maintain other important principles like 'take care of others as you would take care of yourself'. The bleak outcome that you describe is one of the possiblities that I believe we can easily anticipate and avoid by realizing our own potential.  It seems that your perspective is more metaphysical. Is my understanding correct that you believe we are already fated for a specific outcome? While I do agree with that, I believe that any conversation of metaphysical kind is moot (if that is indeed what you're saying. Otherwise, please help me understand). That mindset just spawns nihilism, which will undoubtedly lead to the degenerate and immoral behavior that you describe. This can be avoided simply by realizing it.

@XypherMage94,"Sergiu Popovici you say you are in pursuit of the ""truth,"" but nihilism abolishes any prospect of finding it. It is born from a realization that nothing ultimately matters and anything we do is pointless. I used to believe that, but my life wasn't improved by pursuing that narrative. Human beings have a need to find meaning and self actualization. I don't think that anyone was saying we need to control the human race by some tyrannical hierarchy to force it into what we want. But I also don't think we are on a one-way rail out and having that perception isnt helpful to the individual or the collective. I don't know what the ""Truth"" is, and you are fooling yourself if you think you do. Postmodern thought is a protest to pursuit of that ""Truth,"" where we throw our hands in the air in defeat, and even if postmodernists/existentialists are right, what sort of life is that. Once you have kids and a family, I promise that nihilism will be replaced with a sense of purpose, even if that purpose seems trivial to you now. I'm sure the other commentor was saying that by adopting a sense of individual responsibility, we will be able to captain our own individual destinies. Of course we will all die, but that is life, it is bigger than us and the most we can do is to hope to leave this place better than when we found it. How much good can you do with your time here?

@XypherMage94,"Sergiu Popovici interesting perspective on the nature of morality. On that particular point, I would have to agree to an extent. I would agree that morality (typically with judeo/Christian roots) confers a certain fitness benefit that would drive evolution in terms of implementing a strong familial structure and creating a society were interpersonal interactions are relatively predictable (I know with relative confidence that I will not likely be killed without provocation and most people will predict that I will not kill them based on common morality in most modern societies).  Why do we have on average 2-3 children if we can pump out 8? Because you cannot nurture 8 children to become as fit individuals as a well-nurtured 2 in today's society where technology ensures a higher likelihood of survival, thus negating the previous necessity to have many children.   Morality is subjective, but still widely universal. I agree that things we consider to be moral typically confer some sort of fitness benefit to the individual (even altruism in social animals confers fitness to the individual, even if it comes at an initial cost). We have a drive, like all animals, to reproduce and not only survive but thrive. Doing good in the world increases the fitness and chance of survival for our offspring. But we do not want to create a social society with equal outcome but rather one with equal opportunity. In a society with equal opportunity, the best get rewarded. In a way, a perfect meritocracy has darwinistic principles in which the highest quality offspring succeed and the lowest quality perish. Ironically, such social Darwinism is considered immoral even though it confers an evolutionary advantage...so there must be another component to the evolution/morality argument.",7년 전,1,
@XypherMage94,"Sergiu Popovici morality confers an implicit benefit to survival though, even if at a cost to the individual survival. Look at social creatures such as ants, monkeys, vampire bats, etc. All of these species exhibit altrusism, a benefit to the group at a cost to the individual. A vampire bat will regurgitate blood to feed an individual that has failed to feed and is starving. Monkeys will screech to alert the group that a predator is nearby at a cost of making it's presence known to the predator. From a darwinistic perspective, this is puzzling. Imagine that some members of a group of monkeys give alarm calls but others do not.  By selfishly refusing to give an alarm call, the monkeys that remain silent have an advantage while benefiting from others. So we should expect natural selection to favor monkeys that do not give alarm calls over those that do. If that is the case, how did the behavior evolve in the first place and why does it persist?  The same can be said for human morality and our current social structures. Take communism/socialism for example. In the context of human nature or Darwinism, it is a total failure of an idea. Imagine if every monkey let out an alarm call instead of just one, the chance of survival of the group is no different, but the cost is shared among the group which should be good. The problem is that it is easily subverted. What if one monkey decides not to make itself known, now its chances of survival are exponentially higher than any one member of the group. To keep that from happening, you need an enforcer to maintain group behavior which is why communist regimes fail miserably.  In most Western societies, we exhibit altruism, but not equally between individuals. The result is a non-perfect but overall high fitness environment where the group, in general is successfully able to survive.   Interestingly, biologists describe monkeys who remain silent as ""selfish"" and those who give the alarm call as ""altruistic"". Selfishness is seen as being immoral and being altruistic is typically seen as ""good."" Maybe we think we ought to be good, even though we benefit from being selfish. Maybe teaching ""goodness"" is itself selfish, because we know we confer a benefit from the goodness of others. Group selection is more powerful than individual selection in social creatures, thus these ""values"" persist and will probably not go away. They existed thousands of years ago and exist today.",7년 전,1,

The adverse effect however being that online content similarly feeds cognitive bias and reinforces it into an immutable mental construct that people shape their identity around.

However, as boys do, they are often distracted/infatuated by women. Now this wouldn't usually be an issue but there was an unsavory blog(outside of the schools power to control) that arose rating some of the schools female teachers. There were many lewd and well misogynistic comments, but it is the internet so it's not an accurate representation of these students. But my question is that: Why wouldn't you want to censor something like that which has no productive value and creates an uncomfortable situation for teachers? Also these students were all anonymous so this is hypothetical, but would there be an issue with punishing these students if they were to be found out?",7년 전,0,

@keyfeatures,"Peterson presents a simplistic argument of 'no blank slate' to support the notion of clear-cut binary gender distinctions.  Well, yes, blank slate outlook has been discredited, read Pinker's excellent and accessible book on the topic.  However, individuals are not a Bell curve.  Bell curves represent populations.  To pick the tips of the Bell curves and call them 'Woman' and 'Man' is to horribly misrepresent the science of gender and behaviour.  It also ignore the correlation and causation problem.  As for the categories of 'male' and 'female', biologists cannot agree on the must-have attributes for these, hence the issue of Caster Semenya, along with many other problems for sex and gender, including hermaphroditism, intersex, XXY and other variants.  Of course, Bell curves are useful, but Peterson offers his particularly biased valuation of their use as 'fact'.  His framing of 'women' ignores the significant variation within that Bell curve, and its overlap with the attributes held by 'men'.  Indeed, his position is merely conservative-thinking, nothing original about it.  Conservative attitudes have historically dominated our lives, legislated against gay sex, against female suffrage, against married women having rights to property etc. etc.  In many places, conservative thinking still holds people back, and yet Peterson's issue is with calling a very small number of people by a gendered pronoun of their choosing, rather than one chosen by the appearance of their genitalia at birth.  This seems extremely petulant.  Perhaps he has been eating too much broccoli and chicken, and not taking enough SSRIs, because this 'new' Peterson has a touch of irrational mania about him, not to mention a few Bannon-style dollars.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

Forming a well, put together, understanding of ourselves and the world in which we live, by freeing our minds from the bonds of chaos and illogical arguments that influence the way we think, feel, and act, will help us find true meaning and happiness and escape from the shadow within ourselves. But we can't escape from these bonds without humility, hunger for absolute truths, and valuing the ideas, words, and thoughts of our neighbor, or spouse, or friend. We all need eachother to live free and progress to a better humanity which means we must treasure and practice listening, protecting the rights of free speech, and speaking up in public our ideas of right and wrong. It's not enough to hold it in. Each of us must share it with the world. Anyway, these thoughts of action to navigate today's society seems like a great way forward to me. Well done, David Fuller. I will watch this over and over and read everything I can from Jordan Peterson and all the brilliant people who shared truth in this video. Best of luck forward to each one.

@candiceblack86,"The part about men/boys in school is really interesting. I have a son, I'm a young mum and I was a single parent for several of his younger years (I mention this as I believe it feeds into the way I was hounded by the teachers) I dreaded parents evenings with a passion because every time I was badgered to medicate my son for ADHD. Different tactics were used to try to encourage me, it'll improve his grades, he'll be happier etc. I asked why and The problems were; he talks too much, disrupts lessons and had a lack of concentration for things which he's not interested in (bore him). I refused to medicate him as he wasn't hurting anyone or himself and he was a happy child. I knew he was a handful when he was bored, anytime we had to queue he would run around me in circles, it was annoying but I just let him. Medicating him to stop running in circles should be criminal. Shouting at him to stand still seems unnecessary to me. He's now 14 and was frustrated when a teacher said to him ""you're being much better lately, have you been medicated"". I didn't realize how sensitive he was to this statement so after years of being asked to medicate him I replied ""well that's great you must be doing great"" but I saw the look on his face and that what I said wasn't what he was looking for. He explained how rude that was for him to have said that to him and then I thought about how that would feel and what it implied.",7년 전,2,

@Eternal_Tech,"Do you really want to punish boys because they express attraction for women and state their preferences when it comes to this attraction?  It is generally considered acceptable when females express their preferences for males. For example, women can, and do, state their preferences for wealthy men, muscular men, and tall men. Should women be punished if they discuss their preferences?  There may be short men who are ""uncomfortable"" when many women express their desires for tall men. Should these short men's sense of discomfort get to decide what women can communicate about?  Maybe boys discussing their romantic preferences may have ""no productive value"" for you, but some boys may obtain benefit in discussing their sexuality. After all, sexuality is part of being human and there is no reason to make it a taboo topic.  Who gets to decide what harmless speech has ""no productive value""? Dangerous speech can be punished, such as shouting ""fire"" in a crowded theater when there is no fire, or inciting a riot, but why should ""uncomfortable"" speech be censored or punished?

Trump and Brexit were primarily economic reactions to unfettered globalisation and not necessarily aligned with the 'alt right'. It was especially the weak 'appeasement' of islamic terrorism in the face of the Charlie Hebdo and other attacks that was a lot of the reasons that the alt right felt the need to fight back with cartoons of the prophet and then pepe memes to troll those telling them not to.   That we just let them stifle free speech and satire and agree to never mention Mohamed is what riled the Alt right. It is also what the SJWs latched onto when it indicated that, oh if you are violent enough, then you can have force others to not say anything that you find offensive.

Many of them are not even debatable, because they don't know, care about, or understand the ground rules of debate and can't or won't abide by them. Worse, some of their methods of disputation, (NOT argument) WORK, for spreading their ideological contagion, getting their way, achieving and maintaining power, extracting benefits, bullying, manipulating, deceiving, defrauding and cowing others.

And the ultimate causes for it are fundamental human faults, which are some of our fundamental natural features turned bad, - because they slipped into extremes. The same fundamental faults drive the whole media and the problems that creates. 1. Tendency to strongly focus on any negativity, 2. Tendency to think in binary extremes. 3. Ego which slipped into extremes, or out of balance. We have a few more but these three are the strongest causes of this kind of thinking and behavior - AND EVERYONE SUFFER FROM THEM. No exceptions.   The difference is only in degrees which is mostly based on how much any individual is actively aware of these fundamental faults and their influence.  The nature of communication on the internet only exacerbates these faults because it obfuscates or completely removes the usual natural balances that work against them. Like personal responsibility and requirements to think reasonably and based on actual facts, instead of screaming and simplistic dumb logical fallacies.

@RD-lt3ht,"Had an alcoholic father who eventually became withdrawn and nihilistic, a ""damsel in distress"" mother who projected and protected but also neglected; they were both unlettered peasant stock from the poorest region of Portugal, both  attempting to flee from themselves without realizing that.  Generally speaking, most poverty row European migrants born in the 1920's or '30's were traditional ""manly"" men and ""damsel"" women; I swear such men wore their masculinity on the outside (often overstressed) but could be quite womanishly neurotic inside, while the women were  often emotionally ""martyrs"" externally yet ruled the family like queens, wielding their sacred martyrdom like Excalibur. Generalizations aside, my parents were the UBER-damaged versions of the  ""Catholic peasants from a one-goat village"" stock that I detailed above, their psychopathology was considerably more damaged than poverty can account for; after all, alot of 1st generation children of poor migrant parents from the above time period, ended up doing well in life (mostly in trade jobs and the like), but my 2 brothers and me DIDN'T.  My dad's dad had abandoned him and his illiterate mother, making dad the man of the house at 9 yrs old, at which age he was forced to apprentice as a carpenter; mama had it worse because she was rented out as a servant girl at 6yrs old, her mama was an embittered tyrannical  bitch, and while mama's dad was almost a saint to her he died when she was 10, leaving mum with a lifelong terror that she would be abandoned. Dad ended up, with booze's help, abdicating from the role of homeowner/husband/father and sold the family home out from under us then died when I was 13, and mum ended up clinging to her sons especially me the youngest, and I ended up the home-bound spinster/proxy husband/daddy figure/Norman Bates (without the matricide and transvestism though LOL).

I'm afraid that YouTube will eventually kill off the content that made them unique to begin with just for the sake of impersonating the dying tv channel model and to shut down opposing view points.

@mkrump9403,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSONVCsaYZqGXaqkEAEBrxw There is so little about the subject I believe is because women are naturally taking responsibility stuff around them before thinking for top power and best performance to win the competition or a next war or next scenario. Men are taking the fight and being readiness for the hunting instead of family and houses responsibilities. To think philosophy you must be away of distraction such of family and kids. I based my comment on time/energy management and it takes lot of time to think philosophy. But responsibilities are forced to someone who received it and men can avoid it by pretending going to hunt.  When men hear... (take home responsibility) from another man from social level -media-. It's like ((A we are allowed to stay at home and no one is going to hunt us? Really?)) Ya wake up we are in 2018 and terrorists are spotted before any actions.

@teerexness,"The reason that the Peterson/Newman interview was such a ""sensation"" was because of the high quality nature of what thousands of video creators have already done. And it captured a great number of people who were still parking their brains in TV land.   The deep and abiding nature of the mainstream media's adopted role as a purveyor of state propaganda has gotten so powerful over the last century, that the people shoveling it genuinely believe it. And they therefore get belligerent at anyone or anything that pushes back against their narrative. Because it is THE narrative. Wash, rinse, repeat. This explains the Newman behavior.   The Peterson end of this is just as simple. Philosophy, critical thinking and a desire to find the truth are so easily accessible in today's information age. And if you look at the view counts on these videos, there is obviously a large audience hungry for it. And I would submit that there is a certain ""high"" gained from waking up and exercising our ancient skills of critical thinking and curiosity. This is the realm in which a sharp, healthy mind like Peterson's thrives.  Any debate between a person who spends their time trying to find the truth, and a person pedaling a ""known"" truth is not going to end well for the person relying on dogma and filled with the hubris of past dominance. The curtain has been pulled back. The future of the heavily controlled mainstream media could not be more bleak.

It is a huge factor for women not to want to marry and have children, when her partner can run away anytime. I mean women's responsibility. 1. Be honest with yourself, and stop playing a victim. A woman can go out half naked, have countless partners, and demand that society would accept her freedom of choice, but when it comes to family she can't be a housewife and mother because she will be shamed for it, she is now so sensitive to public opinion? Really? If you consider yourself a free agent, then act like it. By that, I'm not judging here anyone for their lifestyle and choices, I just spot a light hypocrisy in such mindset.  2.

The common center where we share the same ideas must be the starting point but can only be achieved when people free themselves from the constant enforced narratives from the media, institutions and government. Otherwise a meeting anywhere near the middle feels like a forced conceding. Its a place where not submitting and surrendering to the other side  completely is a crime.

@HerkenhoffOfficial,"Oh boy, now people outside of Germany start spouting this nonsense as well? Let me tell you something from the perspective of a native German who is still living in this awesome country:   1) there is no ""systematic gutting of Germany"" going on. We are the strongest economical force and the biggest country populationwise in Europe. We have a good social security system and actually don't lose money. In 2017 we had about 200.000 refugess coming, which is less than 0,5% of our total population. Not exactly a systematic gutting, is it?  2) The humanitarian crisis in Syria is a very complex one and shows a deeper problem that we have to face today. Most of the refugees we granted shelter are from Syria, then Iraq and Afghanistan. I wonder what a humanitarian society should do: Deny war refugees entry to a safe haven and let them rot? There are problems for sure, but what is the alternative? Letting more people drown or starve in front of our doors? I absolutely agree that there is a cultural clash going on as a western democratic society that is mostly secular and focusses on freedom and equality is certainly the antithesis to most of the countries we get refugees from, but that doesn't mean that a) refugees cannot appreciate our culture and b) that we can leave them to die. It's a complex problem, but in my view, letting people just die is not an option. Should we go blind about that? No, certainly not, and there are people that just won't fit here. But believe me when I say - and I say this from a personal AND professional perspective - that the number of these people isn't as high as everyone would like them to be.

@artemiasalina1860,"My view has always been that authority and responsibility are inseparable. You can't give someone authority if they don't also take responsibility for the outcome, and you can't have someone be responsible for something if they don't have the authority to effect it. This is equally true for responsibility for yourself; if you don't have authority over yourself and your life then you can't be expected to be responsible for your life's outcome. When I realized that this is what libertarian philosophy advocates for I adopted it. You should be free to do whatever you want with your life and your body, but remember that you are also responsible for the outcome of your decisions. The world and everyone else in it doesn't owe you or me anything, and forcing them to pretend otherwise will only lead to unhappiness and dissatisfaction for everyone. This is not an argument against kindness and charity when they are warranted, because they are not forced pretenses; they come naturally, are sincere, and are a part of your personal authority.

@evanreakes,"From this video, I gained an insight of gun violence in the USSA. There seems to be a pattern in the massacres. Western society's power tribes(white & male) are starting to be challenged and changed. In roughly the last 50 years, new tribes(ethnic & female) have gained power and influence. This effects the individual, home, community, and country. Dare I say the world.   I believe the vast majority of killers share these same power tribe's traits, white and male. This seems to fit the bill for what Mr.Peterson and this documentary describe as the male and female psychological differences and evolutionary survival balance. More specifically into the anima and animus. Or the unconscious male or female of an individual's mind. Anima as a female in a male and vice versa.  Also, the gunman usually carry a label of some type of mental issue and I believe it is exactly what is being discussed here in this video. These murderers on the surface can have simple reasons for violence, such as, being called names or not being accepted into groups.

Each generation has become increasingly infantilised expecting the world to deliver everything to them with none of the trade offs. Nobody knows the role they should play anymore. It’s all school and work and no responsibility for our fellow man! We’ve been told to work hard and we get what we want without consideration for if others obstruct our efforts including our own family. When the reality of life hit us in the face we resent the responsibilities because they are stopping the work we need to do to have it all. Nobody told us of the sacrifices we face when children come. Women resent the partner because they are juggling family and a job men feel inferior because they’re attacked by frustrated women. Children are neglected because both parents need to work and the guidance of a parent is patchy and tired. The more this continues the more broken this will become because there are no parental role models left.

@BigSmartArmed,"All of this is a lot more simple and has been happening in other cultures for as long as humans lived in social orders.  When degeneracy spreads to the point when sociopaths organize into dominant groups, be they clans, hierarchies, political parties, etc, that's when oppression and genocide take place.  It really is as simple as that.  There can be no conversation or negotiation with degenerate sociopaths, just as there can be no behavioral training with a rabid dog that's infected with rabies.    Sociopath only comprehend PAIN, be it physical or social exposure for what they are.  Social exposure is the CIVILIZED procedure of CIVIL LAW, which is outlined by the Rule of Law, which in turn is the foundation of the Social Contract.  In the case of USA that social contract is represented by Constitution.    When there is no Rule of Law, words are not only stripped of their true meaning, on the contrary, words are perverted into weapons of the sociopaths, becasue the primary Modus Operandi of the sociopath is lying, manipulation and slander.  In the environment of Rule of Law lies and slander are easily dealt with by REASON, by establishing facts through investigative process, but in the Rule of Sociopaths only their words have any meaning, while facts and evidence hold no meaning what so ever as they are simply discarded and not acknowledged in any way.  Now ask yourselves, do we exist in the Rule of Law or the Rule of the Sociopaths?   I know for a fact, on the daily bases, that I exist in the reality which is controlled by organized sociopaths, the CULT of the ""blue church"", and that NO WORDS are able to penetrate their psychopathy, just as no amount of good will towards a rabid dog will cure it of rabies.    I know this as a matter of documented legal facts, not conjecture or subjective perception of personal experience.    While am I experiencing this reality, the true origin of the hysterical behind the ""blue church"" demands for American disarmament becomes so painfully clear, that it truly horrifying.   Just as habitual gamblers or a drug addicts that have passed the apex of their binge, these so called ""liberals"" are not just doubling down on their corruption spree, they are placing EVERYTHING they got on it.    They absolutely NEED to disarm the population becasue they know that it is only a matter of time before the populous becomes aware of the true, massive scope of systemic corruption, and in the complete absence of the Rule of Law, the only solution will be a massive purge, just as it happened many times before, but this time, in the age of Globalism - THERE IS NO PLACE TO RUN, only to hide.",7년 전,0,

Humans have been on the wrong path since they started breeding and eating meat. Neither concluding the other. But the one (breeding) continuing the burden of life, which if the human  🐰soul🐰 was right, wouldn't do. The problem with the education system is trying to have a popular opinion which gains acknowledgement for standing. And the putrid fact of going against everything while using acedemia in a subliminal way to persue slights of or to popularity. Never will breeding or eating meat be proven right, correct or factual. Being humans, if they had a soul, would have chosen not to eat, kill or use animals in any way. Thus their claims for health should be false. But humans have no soul being the combined uncensored thoughts and actions of humans is Satan. Therefore they have no soul, nor a path. They are whores to all life. And they eat god which is the animals. In their own words this would be the highest blasphemy.  People differ in productivity? Or they compromise, to allow productivity to the point that they produce less. If horses are rode, so are humans. Maybe not physically, but mentally, but also physically with detrimental effects at all stages of life.  And now that abortion has claimed that life doesn't start until a breath is drawn. (Which in all actuality is falling in line with the race) What about realization, if people are just following until realization, which commends patience and individualism with the  ability to react consciously instead of unconsciously or verbatim with pathed reactions of the populace. Then are they yet alive. Animals are more conscious then humans. It's just that humans judge them on human pursuits instead of how life should be lived. Not taking in the omnivores or carnivores as a way. Humans can't judge after seeing a crime on video. They haggle in the courts that consequences are what bring all actions about. Not realizing that stereotyped consequences can lead while truth of the instance hides. But are they talking about crime. Conversation is always about anything.

@acultural_,"After watching this to me it becomes almost blaringly obvious the instantiations of anima possessed men and animus possessed women happen through daily encounters with what similar-minded people are thinking through social media like Tumblr, YouTube, and Facebook, etc., Because of the nature of social media you can customize certain aspects in order to filter content and promote others, additionally the people you surround yourself with online or otherwise are more likely to have similar views as yourself and produce/share content that you more or less agree upon. When this happens, you and your immediate friends and consequently your reaching network become an echo chamber for the ideology to which you subscribe. The ideology becomes more heavily ingrained in your psyche as this happens daily for hours on end. Eventually it becomes the nature of your being and you become a mouthpiece for a collective set of ideas. You’re induction into a tribe has been set and you’ll cover any point of weakness in the group which becomes exposed. And you will do anything to defend it lest you risk losing the security you get from being a part of that tribe. That security is what people need to be more accepting of being broken. Because the world isn’t going to let up when it finds a weak point in your framework, and it will hammer the nail in the coffin of your existence if you can’t protect yourself. I think that is why Jordan Peterson insists on “getting your act together” because strength of character and stability is what will ground you in a world where your ideas are constantly being challenged.

Rafia Morgan made some great points.  I have seen a lot of Peter Pans (man-boys)  in my life. It can be very frustrating. They would not grow up and pull their weight. One of the things that I did not want in a marriage was me being the mother to my husband.  I saw that with my parents as a kid.  I just thought it was very weird. Stefan Molyneux talks about the rise of the social justice warriors is probably due to a generation raised in daycare. They didn't have daycare when I was a kid.  I thought it was a strange concept and thought that our values and our economic system was completely corrupt at that point. (Why would you have a stranger take care of your child so you can go off to work? There is a problem with the economy.) We also have millions of people who are also on antidepressants.  Are these people asking themselves why they are depressed? A lot of times they do not want to face that their personal life is a mess, their workplace is dysfunctional, and the world needs a big positive change. Just numb it with a big pharma pill!

I myself probably fall somewhere to the right of Peterson on the political scale yet my personality traits array themselves in utter defiance of the general parameters of the Big Five paradigm. Trait openness may push one toward liberalism and even progressivism, but I believe the more open you are, the more you realize just how little you know.

@socaltop10,"The scale of the problem is far greater than a negative psychological impact on boys' development or the threat of compelled speach: Since the 1960s women are increasing using the  government as a weapon to destroy traditional conservative culture in general and men in particular. This is most evident in the Family Courts. Even when the laws are written in gender neutral language adjudications are invariably made in women's favor. And the situation continues to worsen.   I agree that taking personal responsibility is important, and am happy this message of JPs is having a positive impact on millions of men. Still it largly boils down to, ""Man up."" That may help an individual man on a psychological level, but there is no amount of manning up that will fix this lopsided system and restore traditional curture. The real demon that cannot be let out of Pandora's box is an acknowledgement that these societal problems were caused by women's lack of responsibility. And that's why manning up is not a cultural fix. Those familiar with the best thinkers of mgtow understand this.   I don't say this as a criticism of JP. I praise him for his work and understand the psychological sacrifice he's making by choosing to participate in this battle. My hope is that he may strategize more effectively by considering the massive body of data showing culpability of women. Men did not destroy traditional culture and men cannot restore it. No matter how many men Man Up and get married and have 2.4 kids, women are still, legally, in a position of absolute power. Women's sexuality and their relationship with men has been liberated in every possible way since 1960. Yet with each new freedom we see one less risk or responsibility for women. Women are not even responsible to have to say yes or no to sex. And now with kangaroo courts on University campuses and #metoo women can use mob justice to ruin a man with nothing more than her devine word.",7년 전,81,

Many are now focusing on the current state of affairs which is an excellent step.  We need to stop the immediate bleeding of the current movements that are causing feminization of our boys and masculinization of our girls, destruction of the nuclear family etc..    What I think may be even more interesting though is to look at why this is all happening.  I don't think it's an accident.  Look to Europe and the otherwise inexplicable import of immigrants en masse that are largely societally incompatible (in such large volume and short time) with the existing cultures despite a huge surplus of more compatible would-be citizens from other parts of the world that would long to relocate to places with such rich culture and history.  Look to the incredible controversy when it comes to something as simple as a border wall so we can know and control who enters our country to keep out opportunists, criminals, drugs etc.  Theory: elites are attempting to bring chaos via destruction of the family, destruction of all national identity, forced ignorance of natural law and evolutionary psychology, infringement of rights not granted by government and by destruction of virtue itself.  It's a plan.  It's not  some accident of society. It's a ploy by elitist central planners and central bankers to destabilize the pillars of individualism to replace it with totalitarianism.  If we don't look beyond the symptoms to the poison that's causing them we risk losing the beautiful little brief Heaven on Earth that our founders and all great thinkers who's shoulders they stood on, carved at great expense from millennia of chaos and suffering.

The last thing the United States political climate needs is an influx of individuals eager to sacrifice themselves for their collectives, in an era that begins to approach the sort of authoritarianism which would offer them just such an opportunity. Individuals who accept themselves as sacrificial animals are in a poor ideological position to demand freedom and individual rights. This is not something that needs to be balanced against a supposedly more left-wing, individualist approach... any more than freedom itself has to be balanced against tyranny. What really needs to be understood is that the degree to which societies offer individuals MORE freedom than they could have without the society is the degree to which fighting to uphold society is NOT a sacrifice, it is just an investment in their OWN future values. The word ""sacrifice"" conflates rational, selfish, freedom-loving investment in higher values with voluntary loss that has no expected upside, in the name of some arbitrary, superstitious, collectivistic ""duty"" - the exact cultural basis for self-subjugation and tyranny.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@bing____0_0_____bong,"I think a crucial lens that Jordan and many similar thinkers don't use is economic.  Its easy to see things like Trump and Brexit as just a reaction to 'SJWs' but this ignores how people have been disenfranchised and kept down by an economic system that funnels wealth upwards.  Similarly I understand and appreciate messages to emphasise personal responsibility,  (as people can always sort themselves out and do better) but this ignores that we live in a society that as a part of its design puts people in poverty and debt.  I'm very suspicious of how things reinforce and complement the economic status quo. On one hand obviously Identity Politics has been easily incorporated into big business (particularly Silicon Valley and media) while leaving Capitalism unchanged and distracting people from class divisions. It can be used as a pleasant veneer to keep people purchasing products. But similarly thinkers like Peterson and certainly Shapiro, in insisting that we live in a meritocracy and your failures are all your fault, act to keep people compliantly working and hustling within the system.

@The2tlc,"Since I've started to watch Peterson's lecture's, which I'm shocked that I would even sit through hours of lectures on my own free time says a lot about how good this man is at explaining things that even a layman can understand and follow, I've come to see how much ""Responsibility and especially personal responsibility"" has been lost from our society. Other things I've noticed is the loss of ""Personal freedoms and liberties"" when it comes to ""Hurt feelings"" of another being treated like an actual physical assault, which I find very disturbing and worrisome. The most worrisome thing I see coming about with the ""New media"" is mob rule. That I think is something that is very very dangerous. Simply going on social media to accuse someone of something and having the mob tear that person's life apart without charges, without a trial, without evidence, without a verdict of guilt. That accused person's life can be forever destroyed and the person who accused them, if found out to be lying faces no backlash, no consequences, faces no repercussions from the harm they did to their victim. They are still the victim and the innocent person is still the bad person and that is so wrong on so many levels. Our justice system has never been perfect, but over the years it has really shown not all people are subject to the same laws or punishments. I think it is very dangerous and wrong to have such a system when someone becomes so big in the corporate world or political world, they can openly admit to breaking the laws and face absolutely no charges, no consequences for their actions they willfully made and keep making. Or consequences change due to race, religion, gender, or age for the same crimes instead of the same punishment for everyone for the same crimes committed. It shouldn't matter what race, or color, or gender, or religion you are. If you commit a crime, the punishment for that crime should be the same for everyone across the board.",7년 전,0,
@persephonel2117,"This is so interesting!  I have been playing around with these Jungian theories for like a year now.  His work is a great lens to analyze what we are currently undergoing in the west right now.  It does seem like a tug of war between the masculine and the feminine. And I do absolutely see the toxic feminine rising up to be reconciled with on a macrocosmic scale.  The biggest flaw of the feminine is it's difficulty in taking responsibility. So it is projecting its own flaws on to men because it is incapable of confronting itself. I have always seen feminism as women shaming and rejecting femininity and allowing themselves to embody their animus, which must be rooted in responsibility or it becomes an incredibly destructive force.   Maybe this explains this cycle we see in great civilizations. The feminization that takes place right before the fall. Like this is a great test, can women face their own nature and integrate their animus in a way that doesn't swallow us whole?   I think Jung has a lot to say on what society is facing at this very moment. This is an archetypal battle.  One that has the ability to bring us to our knees. We have to confront these realities and women have to embrace who they are and discover the power in that, but before they can do that, they have to accept their own shadow.",7년 전,18,

@visavou,"It seems to me that a lot of problem women are facing is because of how children are doing in their life. Children are centrestone of life of every parent. in families where both men and women take equal roles as father and mother show better success as family and as individuals. where these roles are not played out properly, the dysfunctional family, the childrens development blame is usually thrown on women. that irks a lot of issues at home. plus a feminine not playing a proper feminine role also does end up in a dysfunctional family.  so the question i ask is does a woman need to spend all her time at home to take care of kids and husband? do men need to understand that doing a lot of work in the society does take a toll on women especially knowing that she goes through a lot of emotional stress as a women while working at the same time and they need to be more engaging in family? there are also many other cases to think of in both questions as in i am just talking about families where things are going wrong. or where men and women are loosing grip of what is going on between men and women.   plus is the freedom from patriachy for women and availability of a lot of women for men at workplace causing the problem or the fact that both men and women have forgotten to just focus on their families instead of letting the choas of current work culture overwhelm their personalities? this is assuming many things.   i wonder about the traditions in india about men are asked to just earn money while women are asked to just take care of home. to the extremes yes that does create problem. boredom for women (too much order at home and same routine) and to much excitation for men ( too many women and too much choas) . but this also means that mostly men work while women are at home. is that the solution of the future? no but if both men and women focus on families, this gender issue can be solved. so are liberals at fault? or the fact both the groups are putting too much pressure on each other?   what cannot be solved is the idea of hierarchies? human need is sustainable but not the human greed. do well all need to become stoics? if we let just evolution decide then we are going to end up with just rich getting richer and poor getting poorer. it seems to me  ok. all of this. i just wrote of nowhere and i maybe wrong. let's have an open conversation. i will keep editing as i get comments and i reflect on what i said just to be clear. don't overdo it pls.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

@gk2677,"Just wanted to summarize:  The documentary starts by analyzing the current cultural rift as reflected in mass media vs. new media opposition Then it tries to dive deeper psychologically -   33:50' Peterson talking about women's subconscious animus projecting on men is the key to the second part. Women's animus rages and men retreat into their anima, which only increases women's rage over the immature men shirking responsibilities. And this vanishing of non-pathological masculinity might eventually bring the Western civilization down as there is masculinity out there in the ""other"" culture biding its time. Eventually we need to recognize we live in the tumultuous time and chaos is upon us, which is deeply unsettling but on the other end it is an archetypal opportunity to emerge from the chaos as a hero with the new knowledge and power",7년 전,0,

In other words, if you think there is a difference I am asking you to clarify what that is. Funny that you misquote me in order to make a point about being misquoted.  On Jung's Collective Unconscious, I don't think you understand the concept. The Collective Unconscious manifests itself in reality all the time, it's just that people are not conscious of the drives that are motivating them as they manifest it. Just because the drives are unconscious, does not mean people do not act them out. The Archetypes that are a huge part of Jungian psychology come from the Collective Unconscious. Peterson talks about archetypes clearly in this video- he refers to the Devouring Mother, the Tyrannical Father, the Benevolent King, etc. He also discusses how he perceives that the archetype of the Devouring Mother is being played out through radical feminism. These are all references to people acting out archetypes from the Collective Unconscious.  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to be saying that the collective rage of women doesn't exist because it is being generated consciously by feminists. But if feminists are women, then isn't the act of generating that rage, along with other women who share that ideology by definition an act of ""women's collective rage""?

@timothykuring3016,"There is a failure to perceive what is going on at a deeper level, and men seem to be falling into the same trap women have fallen into.       In the most ancient societies, order was created by choosing scapegoats and initiating violence against them.       The mechanism became very sophisticated and smart people knew how to gain power through out it.       For instance when a city was struck by plague, a traveller, who had seen the course of the plague in other cities, knew how to choose the time when the plague had killed off most of the week people and it would begin to recede in severity.   He would claim that he could find the evil spirit causing the plague and dispose of it.   He would pick out some crazy, ugly, dirty, disreputable person and convince the city to stone him to death.   When the plague receded as he knew it would, the whole city was grateful and rewarded the outsider with wealth and power.       Rulers specialized in selecting people to blame for one problem or another and resolving problems by scapegoating.        Jesus put an end to the process as people learned to identify with the scapegoat and question the whole process.   But it was possible to twist the process, and that is what we see now.   People elbow one another aside vying for the position of victim and scapegoat,  and they attempt to make a scapegoat out of the straw man of a victimizer.   Now men are claiming victim (scapegoat) status.         It becomes a world full of crying victims, debating about who is the most victimized, so they can victimize someone else.       The deep problem is the failure to make a distinction between scapegoat violence and righteous violence.   Violent suppression of the guilty is not the same as violence against the innocent.        We are too damned prissy about punishing criminals who claim to be scapegoats, that is, members of an oppressed class, and we give them too many unearned and undeserved rewards.  We are also too savage about punishing members of a perceived privileged class, mainly white males.         It is social justice gone mad, neurotic, and destructive of all order and lawfulness.   The law needs to be blindfolded again, making no distinction between any classification of people.   Perhaps it is possible to describe a crime as a person doing a thing to x, y, and z persons without reference to sex, race, religion, or social position,  and to determine guilt and punishment anonymously, by juries who don't even see one another.",7년 전,0,

Kind of like how justice and mercy can coexist at the same moment in a person depending on the perception of an event. The relative strength of either (justice or mercy) is dependent on the person's ability to perceive the event. Like why the yin yang symbol isn't a straight line bisecting the circle but a curved line ebbing and flowing. There's no total good guy or bad guy, both are just a non-existant ideal.

Our conception of motherhood isn't necessarily derived from 'nature', either.  Humans are social animals and throughout history there are examples of different systems of child-rearing.  For example, in Korea, grandparents care for the children.  In Israeli kibbutzim, children were raised by the whole commune, not just the mother.  There's an incredible variety to how life can be lived, and many examples that demonstrate successful variations.  Nothing wrong with being a stay-at-home mom.  Nothing wrong with being a career woman, either.  It's even possible to be a woman with a career and a family, if you have the resources.

@cmichelle9986,"Sheldon - I read your first post and understand where you’re coming from. But you’re veering off course with the second. For some reason you’re assuming I will only accept the qualities in a man you listed, as if they’re as equally necessary in a husband. Since you’re specifically asking me to be honest - which was an unnecessary request since it would be a waste of my time to write inconsequential lies, especially for strangers - wanting a husband to make more than than $30k/yr isn’t unreasonable in your 30s, especially if a man is intending to be a husband and father. Don’t take the illogical leap and assume I then must mean he make $200k. While that would be a very comfortable salary, money alone doesn’t make a husband or father, and nor would I automatically expect him to the the sole provider. However not considering income vs. cost of living isn’t a life i lead or would bring children into.   Is college a prerequisite? It depends. Many degrees are useless and at least half of college students shouldn’t be there. However, the job market rewards degrees regardless of what they are or ones intellect. Assuming a man with a degree is intelligent, shares common interests, or would be a good provider is as stupid as choosing a guy just for his muscles...  And speaking of women who are looking only or primarily for muscles and big dick aren’t interested in the type of relationship I am. I’m not sure what your motivation is for your question. It was asked as if I’ve never considered what you asked, which is actually so basic one doesn’t even need to explicitly ask oneself to consider it.

@SamanthaTollstam,"Michael Clark you misunderstand... Women also have groups that are interactive.  So you have those who resent motherhood, because they (like young men) see no responsibility or reward in it. This conditioning is occuring in schools and as a result of the hijacking of the feminist movement by pro abortion propagandists and self hating women who project their self hate onto men.  Then you have women who find motherhood rewarding but cannot embrace it due to both parents having to work... Which is crushing and further destroys the family.  But both sets of women (as well as other groups) are basically screaming about how they want to be heard.  Instead of being taken seriously in an intellectual forum... They are pacified or pretended to be respected on that mental and spiritual level. The meek well mannered women then retreat (in majority, there are some exceptions such as myself) and replacing them are those that don't think at depth and are louder and more emotionally challenging.

@Low_commotion,"gytfunke This. People are different, and some women will choose career as the thing that individually makes them most happy. For that matter, most men will choose career as the central domain of their life, but some will choose family and children instead.  That's fine, and to be expected if the big 5 traits Peterson talks about apply to those kinds of life choices, and there's no reason to thimk they aren't part of the engine behind that difference. The thing about, say, the agreeableness difference between women and men is that the distributions really are different, but also overlapping. That means the 30% of most disagreeable women are more hard-nosed and blunt (and perhaps also ambitious) than the most agreeable (and perhaps homebody-ish) 30% of men. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the case for all the other differences Peterson talks about; there might not be much difference in personality between the most orderly progressive and the most open conservative.   This is why capitalism and classical liberalism both predicate on individual choice and work well because of that; because individuals even within a gender or political orientation will be much more different than intuition would suggest, and differences between groups the opposite. Hence no social role applies categorically (sexual orientation as role, for example). That doesn't mean the aggregate differences don't exist, as the Left tries to make it seem like, they certainly do exist. But they aren't categorical. Because of this the two systems allow for people to specialize to their own individual talents and propensities, because most people are an edge case in something or another, and liberal capitalism unlocks that potential that more rigid roles based on innate category (which is low-resolution compared to looking at each individual separately) forsakes.   Edit: A good analogy is handedness. The rule ""People are more skillful with their right hand"" is true. But not categorically (can confirm as a lefty). Some conservatives like surprises, some progressives crave routine. Some women are loud and contrarian by nature. Some men are soft-spoken and gentle. It's simply that the opposite preference is much more common, and that fact should be (but isn't) acknowledged in our current society despite it being able to explain differences in outcome between groups.",7년 전(수정됨),3,

Some so much so that they kill themselves. The expectation that motherhood is this wonderful thing that is every womans destiny, is as pernicious as any radical feminist idea.  It is a big ask for anyone to expect them to abandon all sense of self and exist only to serve.  Women tend to be natural entrepreneurs as they are more likely to be open minded and have good organisational and multi tasking skills. An awful lot of small businesses are operated by women.  Having a family can be great, but not everyone is right for it. And thats ok. Also the pressure to be the best mother possible drives women to overthink and helicopter their kids. Kids need to learn some kind of practical independence through consequence as soon as possible. I knew a slightly narcissistic single mother who always put herself first and raised a wonderful, good natured overachieving daughter. There are no hard and fast rules as every person, child and adult, has slightly different needs that need to be met in order to be functional. Some women find the role of mother to be totally rewarding and a persona that they can happily inhabit, while others find it constricting and not helpful to their mental well being.

Men have become just as bad for externalising their problems as women.  I agree, women don't get how it is to be a man. It doesn't really matter though does it?  Its not their business. Its ours and there are no roadblocks preventing us from handling our business. Bitching about feminists is pointless. We have the power to shape our own realities, and we can chose not to have radical feminists as part of that reality. They are a minority, even most women think that shit is crazy.",7년 전,1,
@tonedowne,"Ok so how is the matriarchy oppressing you? What life choices are being denied? What decisions are being made for you? Don't get carried away with dystopian slippery slopes. !st wave feminism was about a woman's right to make her own decisions, as that wasn't allowed. That is the legacy that goes back over 100 years. This 2nd wave stuff is something else and is a minority. You go down the high street and ask women what they think about intersectional feminism, and you will get a lot of blank looks. Its just self indulgent waffle that can be easily countered.  The problems you face are nothing to do with the women's movement. Stop engaging in identity politics, the personal is not the political. For gods sake don't get into a game of who is more oppressed with feminists.  If you want a successful relationship and a happy life, you have to make a partnership with a woman. No one wants a partner who is complaining about how hard they have it and how unfair the world is and how they would be doing so much better if it wasn't for X group getting in the way.  If I were you I would be more worried about navigating a lifetime in the gig economy. Governments come and go, ideologies change. I already lived through an ideological and economic revolution, and it looks like another one could be on the way.  People in power get carried away with fanciful ideas, you don't have to shut up and take it, but you can't let it consume you and use it to externalise your problems. I have a massive problem with the economic ideology of the past 30 years, but I had to learn how to get paid in it.  I have friends who are in atypical situations regarding gender power. I know two guys who have had the worst kind of lies slung at them by psycho ex spouses, denying them access to their kids while squeezing them for money and threatening them with the law. And One guy who chose to raise his kids while his wife works full time in a very high paying job.  Oh, and one guy who had his ho wife walk out on him and their two infant girls, to go and be a glamour model or some shit. So he is a single dad. Life can get messy.  But you know what, even though the guys who had the bad stuff happen to them at the hands of women didn't deserve what happened to them, it didn't come from nowhere.  One was an addict for 10 years another was having some kind of open relationship with an idiotic hippy woman, and the last one (serial womaniser) knocked up his hot cleaner who was 20 years younger than him. Choices. Give yourself the freedom to make good ones.  In regards to young men being the boogyman, I think that (apart from the unfounded bitching about millennials in general), it is self perception. Some guys are super sensitive about history and take people pointing out what happened in the past as a personal attack, while others are flagellating themselves over any injustice done by people who look(ed) like them.  Lastly, young people are always going to full of fire, and the big tragedy for today is that all that fire has been funnelled into identity politics, which is a divisive distraction from challenging the real power.  While you fight amongst yourselves about who is the most discriminated against in the least discriminatory parts of the world, the real game goes on uninterrupted.",7년 전,1,

@tonedowne,"Luka, I am aware of most of what you mentioned. You gloss over the fact that women used to be property. You paint women as irrational beings who will do terrible things for no reason. This is no more true for women as it is for men.  You have to be able to spot players and manipulators in both sexes. If you don't suss this out you will keep being hurt and losing money.  Western society has been devaluing teachers for decades, both financially and culturally. So the number of male teachers has been in decline for a long time. This is not a patriarchal conspiracy, this is a result of governments with an ideological opposition to the idea of state education. They defund it and make it dysfunctional in order to push people into the private system.   You miss directed what I said about being easily countered. I was talking about new wave feminism.  It is riddled with contradictions. Like promoting a type of ""empowerment"" that fuels the very objectification and commodification of women that is one of the core feminist complaints.  I have been married for 10 years and have 2 kids. It requires constant effort from both parties. Its not easy and having kids with someone is the most significant thing you will ever do in terms of your personal life.  You have to partner up with someone with whom you can have mutual respect and trust. That means an intelligent motivated person, who is not a doormat.   Women are not special princesses that need to be put on a pedestal, neither are they all untrustworthy harpies waiting for the opportunity to fuck you over. Being a single parent sucks. I know plenty of them, you basically forfeit your independence and freedom, and seem to be perpetually short of money.   A lot of the societal bias exists because the perception is that men can't take care of their kids on their own. I dont agree with that, but it is going to take more men choosing to be the primary career for their kids to change that perception.  I don't know where you live, but down here, mens mental health has been a big public issue.  The brotherhood is shit. Men (particularly young men) are so busy projecting some macho ideal, that they either hide their problems or self medicate or ridicule emotional distress as a sign of weakness.  It does get better as you get older. IME the friends you make in your late 20s are more likely to really have your back as they will see you as an adult rather than a pack member.  If you want to make a difference, raging about the matriarchy isn't going to do anything other than bring you misery.

@LDavis-qt8gr,Hugo Lindum  I too am old enough to remember that world. It wasn’t as long ago as the fifties and it didn’t disappear overnight. Yes there was a strong strand of thought that valued women as mothers - but equally many women were expected to be the servants of men and indeed prioritise their partners/husbands over the children. That was very common - and covertly still is now. The fact that third wave feminism is dreadful should not blind us to the downsides of living in a world where individual men are given too much power over individual women. The outcry against providing refuges for women fleeing domestic violence was huge and very angry - and not just from violent men. I am happy to be a mother and like most women have made compromises with my career to prioritise motherhood at times. Does it fill my whole life? No. Do I want to be my husbands servant? No.,7년 전,2,

Also many women had to ask for household money. That was a big stress in many families. There is always more to the story that meets the eye. It does not matter if a man or a woman stays home but it is important that people  bring up their own children or let the grandparents do it if they want.

@bda2444,"Just to settle some of the BS psudo philosophy here_ I am female, married 40 years, 2 kids 6 gkids worked on and off. I also don't distinguish between man and woman's work, since I've worn suits and steel toe boots_ my generation was self sufficient and  self motivated.  There is no real way to put things in boxes like roles and choices since circumstance and ability factors in that_ hard admirable, home or otherwise. some women are full time moms_ some are moms who also mow, fix the sink, change tires... some single moms must work. I worked 2 jobs without a babysitter_ hubby and I worked different shifts so I didn't need one . I did not go to work until both kids were in school. they got out of school_ we moved, I've organic farmed, built decks, done HVAC, you name it. I'm also a researcher. point is_ people are arguing over points that take in other considerations. it's all very common sense. If both parents have to work, you have to. if you want to you should. If a parent stays home, then it still should be 100% each_ I mean you do not have to follow anyone's handbook but whatever the two of you decide.  As to the generalizations that is just BS_ yes, I do believe my husband can do chemistry and rebuild motors better than I_he's also ex military so he also folds laundry better  but then he cant do a lot things I can, so who cares?  when I worked I worked hard and I came home to a dinner he cooked and sometimes a bath and iced soda. 😃 once a week he took the kids to the arcade_ once a week I did crafts and we put on plays_ we went parks played ball_ went all over the place.   I never cared about what anyone thought of me. simply because I had integrity and values and the only mirror I looked in was my own. Feminist have set women back 100 years to _ hysterical self absorbed idiots. my mother worked during ww2 then raised 9 children, took in laundry_ we all farmed. I seriously laughed at women when I worked in DC__ could not believe they were less well read, completely helpless, and always in serial relationships.   The ideal role of parenting is 50/50 or 100/100 neither has an excuse to cop out because of work or anything else. couples form the relationship that suits them. And approval from the outside is not necessary.  People are people and each sex has strengths _ it works out no matter what you have to adjust to as long as you grow and mature. someone with hang ups and issues has to work through them_ no one can fix you_ no one can define you.  your past is past. you can't go forward dragging baggage. there are maturity issues that only resolve If the person has a sense of self responsibility.   Every relationship you're in, you choose it. you shouldn't be in a relationship if you don't know what you want and why_ and realize the other person is not there to complete you in some way. you complete yourself based on your values and priorities. your contentment shouldn't depend on what others think.  male and female roles have always been dependant upon circumstances __ it was irrelevant what someone assigned them__ people adapt, and mature people make choices. some choices were limited but we all survived and don't whine about it. you can build your life going forward_ this is most free society ever, so you can t blame anyone for being stuck. Disdain for woman is a personal issue_ envy and bitterness often shows itself in that reaction. so too does arrogance and ego. it isn't your job to make the world like you or bend it to your will. it's your job to be a responsible person and leave your children a legacy_ not just money, but a sense of safety and confidence.  It's only a few who perpetuate the myth of perfect life_ career or not_ we all work in some sense for our idea of contentment or success..  some days success to me is remembering to get groceries or making an appointment. If I'm productive, I Am content. if I read a good book, I'm pleased.... I could seriously care less how anyone evaluates my life. ☺ The fact that I'm female is irrelevant to most of my situations. I absolutely loved being a mom. g mom. and my kids survived whatever the fluid situation was_ because there was no on and off mom switch. you have kids, be a mom. your work schedule has no bearing on that. of you stay home, teach them to be self sufficient _ self motivated. your rear end shouldn't be nailed to the sofa.

@thumbprint7150,"Cristi Neagu - People hear what they want to hear, see what they want to see. You are setting up a strawman to knock down. One rarely even hears working women even discussing this issue. The people who discuss it are mainly so-called 'traditionalist' men and women who want  women to stay at home - for whatever reason. But people in the west at least are free to do what they wish to do - or what they are able to do. Many women wish to work and are able to do so. Some wish to stay at home and are able to do so because they are independently wealthy or have partners who can support them doing so. Many women HAVE to work because the household income of one person is insufficient to support a family. Women have in reality always worked outside the home. Grandparents and extended family, members of the tribe,  often brought up children; or in the case of the wealthy of some periods, nannies brought up the children. Being at home alone with children in these days of the small nuclear family can be incredibly isolating and bad for mental health; and children themselves often long to play with other children outside the home. Women often want to be intellectually stimulated, to contribute to broader society and to use their skills just as men do. You ask 'Why can't women just be women?' as though the category Woman is a fixed in stone - an asinine proposition. All over the world, women live differently from country to country just as men do. Of course, there is absolutely nothing demeaning about bringing up children; but it is best for all involved if it is a family affair. Everyone benefits this way. Fathers are discovering this although many do still feel somewhat demeaned by it because of societal sneering at men who stay at home to raise children.

@CristiNeagu," @thumbprint7150   ""You are setting up a strawman to knock down."" It is, in fact, you that are setting up a strawman, as i shall show.   ""The people who discuss it are mainly so-called 'traditionalist' men and women who want  women to stay at home"" And there's the strawman. This isn't about women having to stay at home. This is about how women that do choose to stay at home should not be ridiculed and demeaned for making that choice. I challenge you to quote me where i said otherwise.   ""Some wish to stay at home and are able to do so"" Except the progressive gang comes along, demeaning them for ""internalizing the patriarchy"" and submitting to oppressive men. So if we have to feature women in STEM field adverts cause if women see only men in those adverts they will think they can't join those fields, then how can you assume that women are perfectly free to choose to be stay at home moms when there is so much negative connotations associated with the term?   ""Being at home alone with children in these days of the small nuclear family can be incredibly isolating and bad for mental health"" For some women, being at work, away from their families, is just as isolating and bad for mental health. But you don't seem to care about that.   ""Women often want to be intellectually stimulated, to contribute to broader society and to use their skills just as men do."" Yes. And there's plenty of programs, and courses, and jobs, and adverts, and organizations aimed at doing just that. But how many such programs, adverts, organizations are promoting stay at home moms?   ""You ask 'Why can't women just be women?' as though the category Woman is a fixed in stone"" Another strawman. On the contrary. I ask why can't women just be women simply because ""woman"" is such a broad term. Because women can't just be women, they have to be working women, or successful women, or CEO women, or top 100 FTSE women.   ""Of course, there is absolutely nothing demeaning about bringing up children"" So why are you complaining about me saying that there is nothing demeaning about bringing up children, and that the people suggesting that there is should stop?   ""but it is best for all involved if it is a family affair. Everyone benefits this way. Fathers are discovering this although many do still feel somewhat demeaned by it because of societal sneering at men who stay at home to raise children"" Except fathers are encouraged to be stay at home fathers and let women be successful. The other way around is condemned.   ""just understand that none of what you believe is in the least bit accurate!"" So, what isn't accurate? That women should be able to do whatever they want to do, without being judged by others? That we should stop demonising stay at home mothers as ""internalizing their misogyny""? What exactly isn't accurate?   ""Be happy with what you do and leave other people alone to their choices."" Strange to hear that coming from you, considering you are criticizing me for condemning people who are trying to prevent women from being stay at home moms. Seems like people should be left alone with their choices, unless that choice is being a stay at home mom. In that case, propaganda against it is ok with you.

@kaisentou,"Mistah Susan - That way of speaking is pretty common for establishment fake news journalists who try and paint themselves as ""trustworthy and reliable,"" ""intellectual"" or ""experts"" without having anything of substance to say. This entire documentary is dancing around the fact that those establishment ideas are destroying western civilization, and they can't bring themselves to admit that they are the ones in the wrong and that they are the ones enabling all of this damage and pain. They are desperate to paint themselves as ""empathetic.""  The establishment are trying and failing to make inroads into the ""new media"" world of independent journalism, but even then they are still failing hard and have to resort to pressuring social media platforms into censorship/economic censorship and ridiculous fake/manufactured scandals. Even if they try to underhandedly co-opt popular vloggers, the way they stifle freedom of thought and expression is toxic and pushes people away. People don't want it anymore.

@kaisentou,"Steve Wall - I'm talking specifically about globalist corporations and people like George Soros etc. You can debate over what's really ""capitalism"" or not, but if people starving in the millions is down to something fundamental about communism, then the destruction of culture, forced mass immigration, mental health epidemics and demographic displacement of whites in their own countries etc. is something that is fundamentally an outcome of the current system.  We still have to make fundamental changes to establish the value of national identity, borders, moral boundaries, culture and heritage over what's ""good for the economy."" I support an end to fiat currencies, central banking, fractal reserve banking, usury, excessively large governments and the destruction of borders and so on, but we should move towards something closer to what you could call ""resource based economics.""  When economies collapse we print new money and play all sorts of games to keep the establishment in power instead of going through tough times and letting a new order establish itself. We shouldn't be able to just print new money and bail out the establishment in those times. A small group of people in a central bank shouldn't be able to have complete hegemony and control over the economy and financial system.  The ideal of capitalism is something that has worked until now, but we have to assert that there are things more important than the economy. It's not worth propping up a sick economy by replacing the entire population with third world economic migrants. It makes out countries worse, and even when we take the best of their people we make THEIR countries worse. We can work out a better system for managing economies than this.",7년 전,2,

The idea that the game is rigged and that the system isn't perfect is fundamentally in conflict with his entire philosophy, yet he backs away from it like a coward as he sells out his core audience to make headway with the establishment.

@YayGrr1,"Such as, and I'll just use an example from a couple of his claims from this video. First, his claim that the only way to find knowledge is through conversation between left/right dynamic. That is markedly false. The only way to find truth and knowledge is from God and the entire story of the bible is kicked off with man trying to find knowledge apart from God, and it's the pervasive theme throughout the rest of the Bible. People rebelling, trying to do things their own way, fucking up, and God having to forgive them again. Those two beliefs are fundamentally opposed and you can't believe both at the same time. Second, he tangentially mentioned 3.5 billion years of evolution. Evolution and Genesis are fundamentally opposed and if the only way to find true knowledge is from God, you should trust God's account of creation over the 3.5b years of evolution account every time. Anyone who can have intellectual dishonestly to claim he's a Christian, but state those is either not very knowledgeable about the fundamentals of Christianity, or is doing mental gymnastics to convince himself that they are compatible... that makes me weary of everything else he says.",7년 전,0,

The core reason I believe behind this is that Leftist ideology is fundamentally external locus of control. It makes them think that their ability to control/ improve their lives is very limited, but ironically,  it simultaneously makes them think that they are collectively competent enough to reshape social systems.  This gets compounded by the fact that the people who have external locus of control (probably correlated with low conscientiousness in the personality dimension) are the ones who are most likely to get attracted to the Left. I.e. the very people who need to focus on improving their own and their families situation are the ones who get sidetracked by Leftist academia.

@timothykuring3016,"I like the direction this video is taking at the 13 minute point.   I argued my way through college when I was young.   I don't seem to fit neatly into either of the high conscientious or high agreeableness camp.   I tended to make people in both camps furiously angry, and the professors would shut down the arguments before I could complete them because they were on the point of starting riots.      I wished there were a disinterested moderator who could declare points won in the debate, and declare the advertisers homonym  attacks invalid.        The problem was that dialogue and debate was always shut down when the majority of mostly liberals became violent.   I couldn't make any progress in arguments without anyone willing to acknowledge when any point had been made indisputable with logic, or at least when logic was not used to challenge any given premise.   Discussion and debate always degenerated into screaming, insults, and threats of violence.       The internet challenges what they call the blue church because it allows arguments to be carried on to conclusions, and it allows bystanders to chime in with their comments and their sometimes rational objections,  so that people can respond.       A rational thread of argument can be picked up by anyone, and expressed in different terms, or whatever.   Bad arguments become quickly apparent.   They can be exposed and picked apart by a small army of volunteers.        People who have relied upon name calling and threats of violence are quickly exposed to ridicule.

@christopherrivera1673,"I'd start with all of Nietzsche, Heraclitus (Kahn translation), Schopenhauer (Hollingdale), Dostoevsky, Stirner, Lichtenberg, La Rochefoucauld, and Eric Hoffer.  I haven't read Jung, just ordered some books such as Modern Man In Search Of A Soul which sounds complementary to Nietzsche proclaiming the death of God (loss of faith because of morality, the cultivation of truthfulness, along with the philosophizing inherited from the ancient Greeks, leading to science). Which is why I would recommend Alex Kierkegaard, quote: 241. There's always a single concept to be found at the bottom of every philosopher's philosophy. With Heraclitus it's flux, with Schopenhauer will, with Stirner the ego, with Kierkegaard faith, with Nietzsche power, while with Baudrillard it's seduction and with me immersion. But what is the quest for power if not the way in which the immersed ego maximizes its influence in the flux by having faith in itself while following its seduced will? And I could easily add Plato's forms, Spinoza's Nature, Hegel's spirit, and all the rest. Hell, even Wittgenstein's silence (via way, perhaps, of Shakespeare) will have a place in my elaboration of the ultimate form of thinking by the time I am done. My masterstroke will be the inclusion of even all the abortive half-concepts and pseudo-concepts floating around in the swamp of the subhuman brain — they too will have a place in the grand scheme of things (though as befits the ideas of small, tiny creatures, theirs will naturally be a very small, very tiny place) — and all the rest, beyond that point, will be silence. 813. Once more on Leibniz vs. Newton. Leibniz's God is supremely rational, but Newton's is the common Christian God whose will is ""unknowable"", and that's why on all the deepest issues Newton has nothing to say, but simply attributes them all to ""God"" — i.e. to his own ignorance. Lichtenberg: ""Are all our conceptions of God, after all, anything more than personified incomprehensibility?"" So, for Lichtenberg, God is a catch-all term for everything one doesn't understand. So the more one comes to understand, the smaller this sphere becomes — and therefore this God — while at the same time the ego grows at the exact same rate, and begins to demand ""its own"" (Stirner). Finally, right past the tipping point, where the amount of one's insight surpasses the amount of one's ignorance, calling the ignorance ""God"" ceases to make much sense, and using it for the insight instead — i.e. for the ego, for oneself — is the only logical thing to do. And that's how the God concept shifts from designating ""personified incomprehensibility"" to personified comprehensibility, and God transforms from a ""holy"" ghost and spirit... to flesh and blood (and metal, and circuits): to an ""evil"" man and superman; to me and my descendants.",7년 전,1,

But by receiving backlash (and rightly so) and moving to new forms of media I believe there is potential for journalism in general to regain its integrity.

Millions of people throughout the west are becoming aware of his philosophy, wither you like or not. And he's ideas are directly opposed to the fundamental presumptions that are culture lies on currently. People are beginning to challenge, not snowflake feminist, but the cultural norms and beliefs itself.  One of these is on atheism, because now there seems to be argument for traditional values now. Also the right wing is being more accepted. People aren't regarding religion and mythology as just some idiots idea. They are now thinking about the benefits of masculinity.

I have no problem with the merits of meritocratic hierarchies but lobsters have nothing to do with it.   - Our brain doesn't ""run on serotonin"", it is merely a neurotransmitter.   - He strongly suggested that women and men couldn't really work in the same environment, almost exclusively on the basis that men are sexually attracted to women (even going so far as to blame women's attire). Regardless of whether or not you agree with him (and I strongly disagree) this is the wrong way to go about bringing up this problem and will not contribute to the debate in a healthy way.  I could go on... I guess his crusade against leftism in universities has its merit and I share his views when it comes to abolishing any attempt at trying to obtain equality of outcome.

@bisque6448,"Fark   - wrong. Postmodernism in its core is predicated on certain assumptions, and it is those core assumptions that Jordan criticizes. - wrong. Both communism and Marxism involve collectivism, and that's the crucial part of any ideology, not just communism and Marxism, that Jordan criticizes.  - you obviously miss his point with lobsters. His argument is that those same hierarchies that are observable in human societies exist in creatures with which we split our evolutionary paths very, very long time ago. In his book he also mentions examples from primates, which are evolutionarily speaking much closer to us. Since hierarchies continued for such a long time in a number of disparate species, regardless of their evolutionary proximity, this means that hierarchies are something critical to evolution. And it won't go away just because you decide that it's bad for one reason or another.  - are you aware of something called metaphor? Useful things. And inescapable in language. In this case, 'runs' stands for 'is allowed to function in a society/hierarchy in a healthy, success-promoting manner'.  - strawman. He posited a question. He himself said ""we don't know what to do with that."" He didn't attempt to provide an answer, he just stated a question that is relevant in the light of comparatively small amount of time that women and men existed together in the workplace. Those questions are meant to start a conversation, that in turn is meant to discover what are the conditions that allow women and men to work in environments that give them the ability to fulfill themselves the most with as little negative consequences as possible. It's meant to start a serious discussion Oh how it's best to pragmatically approach the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace, rather than just virtue signaling, like ""Sexual harassment training"", and pretending we're doing something helpful.

The most useful feminine traits come from the fact that the female body is organized based on the possibility that someday it might give birth and nurse.  This influences me to care more about connections between people, and these connections have a positive impact on the world that can’t be measured easily but is still vital to society.

Their strategy is to take care of themselves, and to be in the best possible shape when society incinerates itself.  MRAs still believe they can negotiate with terrorists.

@joshuacornelius25,"Paul Manning i think a great amount of pressure is exerted on women by women to oppose the message that Peterson and others are proffesing because of post modern ideology guilt tripping and ostracization.  The irony is that this forum of feminism espouses that women should exercise their strength and stand up for what they believe in, but beats down any woman with a counter perspective.  They do the same thing to women that disagree with them that they are attempting to do with males in general.",7년 전,2,

@joshuacornelius25,"Astor Bennett i agree that it is necessary for honest intellectuals like Dr. Peterson to have a platform for educating the masses and to articulate the issues, but in my opinion it's more important for the true feminist such as you seem to be to rise up and be champions for both feminism and masculinity and to be voices for the self responsibility counter culture.  Strangly enough, we are in desperate need for some gender equality in this movement in that we need some female versions of Jordan Peterson. How wonderful would it be if Cathy Newman was as passionate about the truth and honest conversation as she is about propelling her sjw ideology?",7년 전(수정됨),2,

I think we all do, and we get stuck in a loop with technology and immediate gratification. He’s majorly changed my life. It’s always weird to me that everyone talks about his primary audience being male; I understand why that is but at the same time, feel that his views/ideas/explanations are really needed for women. Maybe men are just more desperate than women right now. We are, after all, hell bent in western culture on the empowered woman trope at the expense of caring about men. Jordan is right - women are the ones who really have to stand up and stop the bullshit before it’s too late. I hope more will wake up soon.",7년 전,3,
