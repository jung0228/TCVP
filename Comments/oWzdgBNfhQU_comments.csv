Because I was just 2 months old, I don't remember what happened but my parents did say that it was a tragic event to remember. while me, my sister, and my mom escaped to Korea for a few months, my dad had to stay back because he was in the USAF at the time and had to protect the town. Although, we still have old footage and news of the aftermath in my old ps3. I never knew any of this until I was about 6.

Watching the tsunami unfold is both heartbreaking and humbling; it shows us just how vulnerable we are in the face of such disasters. The devastation, loss, and chaos captured in this footage are difficult to fully comprehend, but it’s also a testament to the strength of the Japanese people. Their response to this tragedy—through unity, discipline, and determination—is truly inspiring. Japan’s recovery process exemplifies the incredible resilience and resilience of a nation coming together to rebuild, honor those lost, and move forward. This tragedy serves as a reminder for all of us to appreciate our lives, support one another, and be prepared for natural events that may be beyond our control. My heart goes out to everyone who was affected, and much respect to the people of Japan for their courage and strength in the aftermath. This video is a stark lesson about the power of nature, but also about the power of human resilience.",10개월 전,0,

@GypsyEncounters,"Japan was Instrumental in the recovery efforts for the 2004 Boxing day Tsunami, (the death tolle reaching upwards of 235,000 souls lost). They responded with millions in donations, and helicopters, and food, and teams of ground-searchers to help with the disaster. 7 years after this horrific event, they too would experience a disaster on a scale similar to the boxing day Tsunami. Thankfully, they were equipped with warning systems, and had previous experience with smaller quakes. Sadly, the sea walls provided a false sense of security. Many of the deaths were people inland, who didnt believe the Tsunami would breach the wall, and destroy their villages.  Japanese are strong, resilient people.

Tapi tuhan benar adanya dan tidak buta, 11 maret 2011 Gempa berskala 9,0 magnitudo yang menyebabkan tsunami semoga  memberi ganjaran terhadap kalian.  Sekarang keberadaan kalian terancam punah karena menurunya indeks kelahiran dan meningkatnya para pensiunan, jujur kepunahan dan kehancuran kalian akan lumayan menarik untuk di saksikan, seperti series anime.  Pada 6 dan 9 Agustus 1945, Hiroshima dan Nagasaki mendapat ganjaran dari langit, tragedi ini sangat memuaskan bagi saya sebagai individu yang menaruh dendam terhadap kalian.  Pengeboman yang terjadi di Hiroshima dan Nagasaki melepaskan Hasrat dan harapan saya, yang ingin melihat kalian menerima konsekuensi sadis dan brutal terhadap kalian, bagaikan Do'a di kabulkan tuhan, kalian menerima karma yang memuaskan bagi saya secara pribadi.

One that is sort of chilling to watch shows the water rise up and spilling over a wall, crossing a road, then spilling into a large gutter. But it wasn't a tsunami like a high wave, but simply a huge rise in the water level at the coast. So the spill was continuous. And the water continued to rise well above the wall. It was almost as if global sea levels rose like 30 ft in 2 seconds. It was like a high waterfall along 400 ft of coastline. But the clip in the episode is only like 3 seconds long. But the dark polluted water and the bright shore make the quality of every second of the clip clear. There is a 3 minute clip of the episode on YouTube.",2년 전,20,

@JETZcorp,"What seems crazy to me is Seattle will absolutely get an earthquake of this size at some point, and for the same geologic reasons (which is also why Mt Rainier looks like Mt Fuji, but I digress).  Difference being, Japan has an extremely long written history documenting their earthquakes and were thus extremely well prepared.  Whereas in Seattle, the culture that built the city sprang up in the short time since the last 9.0 and therefore had no idea this could happen until like last Tuesday.  They're not prepared AT ALL for the whole metro area to slide 2 meters towards Hawaii.  Fortunately tsunamis are unlikely to make it all the way into Puget Sound.  Ironically, the best record known of the last Cascadia full-rip quake comes from... Japan!  In 1700 they were quite surprised to see a tsunami come in with no earthquake.  Only recently did some Americans come poking around talking about how the mud in Washington indicated a big earthquake around 1690-1710, and did the Japanese by chance notice any big waves in those years?  Yes.  Yes indeed.",2년 전(수정됨),0,

The fault is 80 miles offshore and the waves took 1/2 hour to reach shore....  160 mph but a lot slower when they actually hit...  just watch the numerous videos of the event.  In some areas it was a slow motion disaster.  Also 5 miles per second is the speed of the seismic wave through the crust not the speed of the fluid wave(s).,2년 전,1,

It gave me a flashback to the time I woke up as a child in the morning to hear the news that a tsunami hit India on 26th December 2004 and I saw my grandmother terrified and watching the news with my parents. I was so happy she was here, but that was short-lived when I learnt why she had come and why my grandpa wasn't there. The tsunami was to hit thier village and my grandpa stayed back to calm the cows in their farm. Thankfully, he was safe, it didn't come as close to their farm but it was hardly a km away.",3년 전,3,

The first was an older Japanese woman coming up to me with a silver bag she found on the beach covered in mostly English writing; it was a blood pack presumably from a hospital or ship, I went cold and thought of all the people in hospitals who would have had nowhere to go. I didn't know what to say so just said 'medical.' The second was just the sheer amount of tatami floor everywhere, water logged floors from countless houses. Lastly shipping containers were all over the beach sticking straight up into the air, like crooked monoliths. It felt wrong to even talk during the cleanup. As a foreigner I felt I was undeserving to be on such sacred ground. It changed me as a person and how I viewed humanity and the world.",3년 전,0,

Good rule of thumb, if something unusual happens, especially on a scale like a massive amount of water leaving the beach, more times than not it means somethings not right. I just watched the video before anyone saw the wave thinking those people are dead because there's no way they will be able to get off the beach in time, let alone to higher ground, because they were out so far.",3년 전,0,

I could see the shadow the chandelier in my living room swinging back and forth, and my Sheltie was barking quite excitedly.  At the same time, I could hear a deep roar.  I think it registered about a one on the Richter Scale.  I then checked the faults that run through Kansas, a state not associated with quakes, but there is a town west of Ft. Riley that experiences several small quakes a year.  That town happens to be right on the fault line that goes south through the foothills of the Kansas Flint Hills into Oklahoma and is the same fault that has rocked Oklahoma City a few times.

Кто же не верит, тот уже осужден, потому что он не поверил во имя единственного Сына Бога.  Суд заключается в том, что в мир пришел Свет, но люди полюбили тьму больше, чем Свет, потому что их дела были злы.  Ведь каждый, кто делает зло, ненавидит Свет и не идет к Свету, чтобы не обнаружились его дела.  Но кто живет по истине, тот, наоборот, идет к Свету, чтобы было ясно видно, что его дела совершены в Боге.",3년 전,0,
@Edrumachine,使徒行傳 2:38   彼得對他們說：「你們應當悔改，每個人都當奉耶穌基督的名受洗，使你們的罪得赦免，就會領受所賜的聖靈。,3년 전,0,
@Edrumachine,"John 3:16-21   For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.  Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.  This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.   Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.  But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.",3년 전,0,

While i actually do recognize the horrible and disgusting acts they've performed over the years (Nanking, U-731, Comfort sisters, etc.); but acting as if Japan's food isn't a good thing for some people would belile someone saying ""why are burgers such a great thing?"": because people appreciate the good, while  acknowledging the wrongdoings and the atrocities.  Whatever reasons you have for hating on a place this much (especially since the Japanese people of today had absolutely nothing to do with what happened years and years ago, as woth every individual on this planet)is yours to have, however telling people that what they deem as great about a particular place isn't good doesn't change the fact that all countries have things to offer; the good, the bad, the hidden, and everything in between.

@ellaarmstrong216, @danayy2066 The reason you can surf normal waves on the coast is because energy is being transferred forward instead of water. So water is more moving up and down instead of forward and back. A tsunami is in impressively massive amounts of water moving forward so instead of being able to control your movement inside the wave like you usually could you’d be helpless in a tsunami. Not even boats can remain on control on a tsunami.,1년 전(수정됨),1,

@agneteht,"What you should learn (since water doesn't always recede) is that after major earthquakes (anything that topples furniture makes cracks walls and paintings fall down or go askew) you evacuate to high ground first then wait for the news or alarm. You help only those right around you.  (Kids,old, and handicapped). You evacuate as soon as you can stand or the earthquake is stopping.  This gives you enough time (15-20 minutes to get 2-3 km inland running or to the nearest hilltops or highrises). Also as far as possible you go on foot. Cars create gridlock.",7개월 전,1,

@agneteht,@EleazarZayas  not really. If there are evacuation into highrise options you still have options. And in many coastal areas you can still leave.,6개월 전,0,
@agneteht," @StevieC65  yes. But but but, it really is: ""as soon as shaking is beginning to drop I leave"". From the shaking ends to impact close to the epicentre it is between 10-30 minutes. You don't waste time, you don't wait for tsunami alarms, you don't pick anyone up. You evacuate helping those unable or complicated in your immediate vicinity (a neighbours child, an elderly neighbour). Others will do the same for your kids and elderly. And you go as far in and/or up as you can following the tsunami signs or if none exist according to you knowledge seeking always higher ground. It is called preventive self evacuation and should be immediately applied in any earthquake situation near coasts. If the earthquake was VI or above on the Mercalli intensity scale you don't wait for anything.",6개월 전,1,

@Patriot_Steve,only a fraction of that.   500 mph was a theoretical exaggeration by Nat Geo.  The fault where the earthquake occurred was 81 miles offshore and took approx 30 minutes to hit shore.  that comes out to 160 mph average.  You can clearly see that the waves slowed significantly before reaching the shore in the numerous videos of the event.  In some places it was almost a slow motion disaster...in others it was fairly quick... depending on the geography.  Some places had a 10m wave and several had 30m+ wave.,2년 전,0,

@lisam5932,"Hi, I’m Japanese and I was 4 years old when this happened.  I guess I’m fluent in English because I lived in America before. I decided to write this because recent reports say that there’s going to be a very big earthquake coming up in Japan in the next 10 to 30 years. By the way I’m copying and pasting this to most of the Great East Japan Earthquake videos I can find, so that many people can read it :)  4 years old is the age when I was in preschool (or kindergarten?), and I was on my mom’s bicycle (in japan, there are these kinds of bicycles called mamachari that most moms with kids have, and they have seats where kids can sit at the back or the front). Anyways, I don’t remember what I saw or felt at that time because I was so young plus I was sleeping... but my mom recently told me that the utility poles were shaking sideways, even though we lived in a place that was about 400km (248.55 miles) away from where the earthquake occurred.  and I think you guys know, but Japan suffers from A LOT of earthquakes. Earthquakes with the magnitude of 1 to 5 are quite normal for us because they happen all the time. But that doesn’t mean that we’re not scared of them. We definitely get scared and worried because we know big, tragic earthquakes can happen. Some people have traumas, because their mom, dad, sister, brother, grandma, grandpa, friend, or pet passed away from an earthquake. or maybe because they witnessed big earthquakes or tsunamis before.  In this 3.11.2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, more than 22,000 people have been reported dead or missing.  Every Japanese citizen pray and mourn the loss of the victims on March 11th.  Humans actually lose their lives from natural disasters like this, and in this case of earthquakes, people can die from 1)drowning from tsunamis 2)hit/squashed by furniture that fell to the ground (suffocation) 3)burned to death (by fire) 4)other diseases caused when a person spends their time at the evacuation shelter too much (this especially happens to old people/ the elderly, because they often have chronic illnesses/diseases.)  I don’t know where you’re from, but some of you might think “wow this is so scary, but big earthquakes won’t happen in my country. we’re totally fine.”. I know, I really know- that earthquakes are rare in some countries. But I feel like it’s still better to prepare for them. In Japan, buildings have become stronger than ever, and citizens have prepared things just in case. Most of us have emergency kits/bags to bring outside when disasters happen. In Tokyo Disneyland, all employees participate in evacuation drills that are held about once in two days.  What I’m trying to say is, preparation is necessary.. but even if we prepare a lot, sometimes we can’t win against nature.  Sorry for writing this long. Thank you for all of the support — with money, materials, or words — people all around the world have given us. STAY SAFE FROM COVID!!",4년 전,7.8천,

In the following months, a video surfaced about a UCLA student who made a racist rant against her fellow Asian students and family tradition, with one small mention of the 2011 tsunami.   In light of the the racist attacks on the Asian American community recently in March 2021, that rant video resurfaced, as if to echo the prejudice that has always been lying hidden in the United States, but it also led me personally to find out about the 2011 tsunami now that I'm in my 20s. I looked up the documentaries and videos of the tsunami for myself,  and so, for that UCLA student to make light of such a tragedy and gloss over that feeling of overwhelming despair that Japanese international students must have felt while they were rushing to contact their families, it broke my heart, and I hoped that this student really understood the gravity of what had happened by the time she took down her rant from YouTube.",4년 전,144,

Then came June 5th 2015...an earthquake happened with a magnitude of 6.0, and the hardest hit was Mount Kinabalu...there were many climbers that day, and many died on the mountain, most of them schoolchildren from Singapore and the mountain guides that tried to save their climbers...I live about 70km from the epicenter, and we clearly felt the quake...we had never experienced earthquake before, we didn't really know what to do...you're supposed to run outside to a safe area, preferably a clearing, but me and my mom just stayed inside our house, panicking...luckily we were very far inland and our district is surrounded by two mountain ranges so there was never a tsunami threat...  The earthquake lasted about 30 seconds, and a few more aftershocks happened after the first big earthquake....our house had a few cracks on the wall due to the earthquake, but other than that, nothing else was damaged..houses at the epicenter were badly damaged, though...houses here in North Borneo were never built to withstand earthquake because there was never the need, but after that, buildings have been re-evaluated and buildings built after the earthquake that are taller than two-stories need to be earthquake-proof...  That incident served as a wake-up call for us...all these times, we thought we were safe from earthquakes and tsunamis because we're not located within The Ring of Fire, but recently, offshore earthquakes are happening more frequently, and small tremors that happen are no longer treated carelessly....every time small shocks are detected, we are warned to be ready to evacuate immediately because it might be a sign that a bigger earthquake might happen...",4년 전,50,

@Haduken-Shoryuken," @jocelynyes799  For the most part, you shouldnt worry. A lot of tsunami occurs at certain locations when conditions are usually met. Japan for instance. Because  of their location near the tectonic plates that exist around the pacific ocean called the ring of fire, they are prone to having Tsunami. The word Tsunami itself is a Japanese word meaning harbor wave.   Where you live, tsunami should be really rare. In fact the last one occured 35 million years ago. But its not because of tectonic plates movements eithrr, rather because of a very large asteroid or comet hitting the ocean. Which within itself is pretty rare.",4년 전,0,

@김영권-d1r,여러분 지금 시대가 달라지고 있는것을 깨달아야 한다고 하나님께서 말씀해주셨습니다 지금 이시대가 노아때처럼 음란과탐욕으로 타락되어 전세계적으로 하나님의 재앙이 들어가고 있지만 사람들이 깨닫지 못하고 있다고 말씀해주셨습니다 그래서 성경에 너희가 천기는 분별할줄 알면서 어찌하여 시대의 표적은 분별치못하느냐 라고 말씀하신것이 지금 이시대라고 하나님께서 말씀해주셨습니다 여러분 성경에 때가되면 예수님께서 이땅에 다시 오신다고 말씀하셨는데 그 예수님께서 대한민국에 오셔서 예수님을위해 순교한 영들을 구원하여 그들이 주의 군사가되어 지금 전세계로 다니며 코로나등 갖가지 재앙을 뿌리고 있다고 하나님께서 말씀해주셨습니다 성경대로 전세계의 3분의2가 심판을 받아 지옥불로 들어가게 될것이라고 말씀해주셨습니다 그렇지만 때가되어 다시오신 예수님의 하늘의 이름인 와이솔 라이팅 능력을 진심으로 믿고 회개하는 사람들은 전세계 어디에 있든지 죽어도 구원을받고 살아서도 질병과 하나님의 재앙가운데서 지켜주실것이라고 말씀해주셨습니다 오늘날은 예수님의 이름을 와이솔 라이팅 능력으로 부르라하신 이유는 초림때 예수님을 죽인 마귀들이 또 이땅에 내려와  예수님을 대적하므로 그마귀를 이기기위해 예수님의 하늘의 이름인 와이솔 라이팅 능력을 가르쳐주셨습니다  와이솔 라이팅 능력의 뜻은 예수님은 승리하신다는 뜻이라고 말씀해주셨습니다 이 복음의 소식이 성령의 음성임을 깨달아 믿고 회개하는 사람들은 다 구원을받을 것이라고 말씀해주셨습니다 꼭 믿고 회개하여 구원받으십시요,4년 전,0,

@kidus_1010,"To all the people saying Attack on Titan is too much for a 9 year old: Every kid is different and has different levels of maturity. Some 9 year olds couldn’t handle it while some others could. I started watching the AOT anime when I was 9 because other 9 year olds told me about the premise and I was extremely intrigued and although it freaked me out a bit, I was too interested  with the plot and the story for it to really scare me. After the first 8 episodes or so, the Titans didn’t really bother me anymore. However just because I could handle it at 9 doesn’t mean everybody else could and I think many people in this thread are a lot older and may have been more protected and sensitive as children due to the time they grew up in. Kids nowadays are desensitized to a lot of things. Anyway this is pretty irrelevant to the comment and the video.",4년 전,34,

Attack on Titan is PG-13, a child in elementary or primary school shouldn't be watching a show for 8th grade teenagers about to graduate for high or secondary school. It doesn't matter if (s)he mature is enough. Fourth graders should watch Disney movies or Cartoon Network and learn about their state's, province's or countries' history, increasing vocabulary and sentences, and learning about rocks such as igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Not AOT whoch shows about where humanity is almost driven to extinction and where it's shows constant gore and violence.

Also, not letting kids see people being eaten alive on camera on Attack on Titan and having good parenting is sheltering them?!!? Furthermore, cartoon violence is Willie Coyote's shenanigans when the Roadrunner drops an anvil him or throws him a piece of dynamite. AOT on another hand shows people being mauled on camera.

She later saw him lying in the middle platform of the stairway with a few inches of rising dirty water with painful wound over his forehead. She contacted his mother and family member later when they were able to receive rescue from local people. Presumably, he wasn't sure whether he should go up stair or down stair because he didn't seem to know that outside was already flooding when he was rushing through long corridor at his 4th floor apartment complex; there were no windows in corridor because the apartment complex had rooms for both sides.  A week later, my friend and I reached to the location and volunteered to clean the aftermath for a few days and saw how terribly bad was when sludge accumulated a few feet deeper in the basement of his apartment.",4년 전(수정됨),86,

@joeyscerbo7776,Rest In Peace🙏🏻,4년 전,1,
@Kuma40," @krimorant  I don't know you, and you don't know me. I was looking back through footage of this massive incidence when my memory recalled my long known friend when I met him in Japanese school in California 30 years ago. I still value him with my deepest heart.   I was born in the US while my parents are migrant Japanese from Kansai region. I hated attending Japanese school every Saturday because my parents forced us to maintain Japanese literacy, and many Japanese American students, including myself, were socially considered outsiders and were bullied by many Japanese immigrant students because their parents came to the US for business purposes, and they didn't want to move out from their country, affecting typical hatred toward American born Japanese at that time. This friend, Ogawa, was different; he was super friendly and approachable Japanese student at that time, and he lived in San Jose for over a decade until he decided to move back to his hometown in Sendai after he made proposal to his fiance.   Everyone dies someday, and pretty sure these footage remind us how we could prepare better and mitigate the number of deaths from such natural disasters. Now, we are in pandemic, which I'm sure a lot of your relatives or friends may have died of COVID-19. I understand you don't know from random online person's comments here, yet I miss Ogawa leaving this world at his early 20s a few months later when he married his fiance.  And again, thank you, random youtube viewers for compassion, empathy, and reading my long posts in this thread. If you are living in active plate tectonic boundaries, always prepare for major earthquakes. Japan is located in active subduction zone (which is also the same for the Philippines, Taiwan, and Indonesia for Asian regions; Northwestern US coast as well). To look for subduction zones, any volcanic features are the biggest hint (except Hawaii or Iceland or Yellowstone National Park because those are volcanic hotspots from intraplate rising magma toward surface). From Washington State to Humboldt / Mendocino CA, subduction zone is present because you'll see active volcanism in coastal inland areas. Landslides and floods are devastating as well. I live in CA, and we may not have major source for tsunami because vertical displacement under deep coastal water in subduction zone region is the biggest cause for tsunami. But, rising sea level from global warming will affect coastal communities. In CA, from the Bay Area to SoCal, we have the San Andreas fault system, with Hayward fault and minor faults where earthquakes occur and can cause massive disaster. Preparedness is the key to survival.",4년 전(수정됨),70,

It was the youngest of the victim, here's another weird thing that happened after the Tsunami years or sometime after: There was a lady that when she was young she could see spirits which were deceased or victims of the Tsunami, she was making a meal at one night, then heard a knock on the shoji (thin door) and she found a girl wet and lost and she asked for dry clothes, she got her dry clothes, then sometime after...

So, when we turned the tv on the tsunami hadn’t hit Japan and the news was reporting one was on the way.   When she explained a tsunami. I thought of people surfing, but when it hit my jaw hit the floor.",4년 전,39,

@exogenesus6841,"Yeah same. I’m American and was also a third grade student at that time. I remember watching a video like this in my class the day after the disaster and feeling too shocked to fully comprehend what just happened. I didn’t fully comprehend how disastrous this was at the time because I’ve learned about so many earthquakes in California, so I didn’t think much of it. It wasn’t until later that I realized that this was an extremely tragic event that was definitely not like any normal disaster. Respect to those who experienced this🙏🏻",4년 전,0,

@bombuniverse1578,I remember hearing about this earthquake and tsunami in first grade. Because of our specific location in the United states we were worried that we would take some of the effects that happened in Japan.

If you provide these floating pontoons with a standing 'prism', with the sharp side facing the ocean. Higher than the highest wave ever recorded. And 50 or 100 of these floating pontoons with the standing prism, located somewhere within the EEZ, the ocean waves on the beaches will be less ferocious. You thereby split, the total energy of the ocean wave, which is on its way to your beach.  Moving energy starts at the 'hypocenter'. From the seabed.

@therealhellkitty5388,"I am American and believe that we are all human. Divisions wrought by geography are irrelevant when one group of humans needs help from another group of humans. I have watched nearly every video of the Great Tohoku Earthquake I could find. It is a search for understanding and knowledge intermingled with sadness, regret and compassion for those lost in the devastation. On the practical side, I hope every town can build defenses that will protect people. On the other hand, I also know that there will be wild cards that drop the landmass 10 feet and nullify human defenses. It will always be a fight against time and nature. I sincerely hope our beautiful Japanese brethren are able to create a flexible, suitable and sustainable system of defenses against Nature and all her perils.",6개월 전,0,

What creates the earthquakes are energy after tension is released, like a rubberband being stretched before releasing (except the energy building up is from external/outward friction of two independent elements). Edit: That's also why the quakes have different magnitudes, and some areas experience larger than others in general - because of the shapes on the tectonic plates.

I think it's very interesting how someone quite literally on the other side of the globe can be so similar when it comes to cultural heritage.  When it comes to whaling, you're right, Norway has done that since year 800 AD or before that. However, you should be aware of harsh quotas, and new restriction updates throughout recent decades. Only in newer times have there even been something called a ""biologist"", let alone research on complex physiology in sea animals and so forth...   Not perfect at all. Shaming < -1800- 1950 AD whalers is kind of arbitrary, though...

Heck we can't even gain citizenship in your country or get government aid at all 😂 but if an ozzy come over here to nz it only takes 3 months to get government aid etc. It's fxckd how everything is one sided to benefit you ozzys and yet ozzys still complain about us New Zealanders 😂",4년 전,7,

The Japanese sent a team of search and rescue but they went straight to the location Where several Japanese students and a teacher where missing they found them all but two where not found (possibly found deceased from memory) so yes Japan went there (after Australia, Singapore and Taiwan btw) but the main reason they even turned up was because they had Japanese citizens involved.

@RadioGaGago," @officialmai  Light travels way faster, at 186 000 miles/second. A shock wave of energy, here from two tectonic plates moving against each other, can travel through the ground at way higher speeds than energy moving through the air such as sound. It's just a fact in physics: energy waves in form of vibrations travels better through solid objects than they do through gases such as air. That's why sound travels faster through water than air. 5 miles/second is dang fast, roughly 23 times faster than the speed of sound through air which is 0,21 miles/second, but still just a tiny fraction of the speed of light.

Not only that but building a strong concrete wall that is high will cost hundreds and thousands of dollars to cover that one huge stretch of land,  also the fact that the affected area was already below sea level makes it harder to build walls.",5년 전,0,

@troyhayder6986,Could you build a high wall around the country of very thick cement.. . Then install vents at a certain height into the wall and build several huge underground reservoirs that are always kept empty... Then when the tsunami hits the wall above a certain height water will be drained into empty reservoirs... Which can be pumped back into the ocean after the event..... Like a massive dam... That vents to an internal underground reservoir...  The cement wall doesn't have to be enormous... Just big enough to ensure its actually a tsunami... The water that flows over gets drained off into the reservoir...  Or could you potentially create a system around Japan on a wall structure that evaporates water incredibly quickly using scientific methods? But probably expensive to build...  You could create a wall a certain height around the country that uses a double approach... Using massive military grade lasers to evaporate water almost instantly and drain the rest...  Like laser kettles... But expensive...  Or you could move coastal towns more inland and only have a towns with necessary coastal services like industrial ports and fishing ports and then you would only have to worry about those towns...  Which is probably much more viable and less expensive and kinda makes sense in a country prone to tsunamis to be honest...,5년 전(수정됨),0,

Their wall against tsunami is ten meter high that can not protect for 30 meter high  waves. They need to construct 40meter tall dam that can stop waves and flooding. Construction of dam cost to Japanese gov... It suppose to be costly. Special solution for the problem is construction high raise buildings. Let say 20 floors building stand on 40 meters tall legs. Thus flooding sea can flow between legs and can not reach houses. It is cheaper than construction of a dam. So the rest of the living areas on coast are park farm etc...,5년 전,0,

@flyingdutchman6984," @danielmoses6626  - I had to watch it again, and while he was discussing GPS sensors he said ""the waves of displacement that you see traveled as fast as five miles per second"". He is talking about how fast the earthquake wave transferred through the ground as recorded by GPS sensors.   At the epicentre of the earthquake the tsunami wave may have been traveling up to 500mph, but had slowed significantly to around 20-30mph once it hit land. This all happened in the course of approximately 80 miles, so it was slowing down very fast. This is the fastest tsunami wave ever recorded. 500mph is obviously a far cry from 23 times the speed of sound. 😁  Most waves on the ocean are created by wind and always move slower than the wind because some energy is lost during transfer of energy from the wind to the water while creating the wave. I think it is obvious waves created by wind cannot travel 23 times the speed of sound. 😁",5년 전,0,

@deegan727, @arii5493  Japan didn’t “create” COVID-19. If you’re referring to Wuhan than that is in China. It also wasn’t created in Wuhan China or originate from bats at a market in Wuhan China. Wuhan China was a super spreader event of a virus that was already going around. All these myths and rumors that everyone reads from various types of media’s and believing everyone else is how bad info spreads worse than the virus it’s self. Please don’t believe anything I’ve just said until you do your own research and don’t believe the first article you read on everything until you find the info is consistent with other fact based information. Doing your own research is important for many of life’s issues. Most info that comes from the news and FB is out of control opinions that is spread enough that it seems to be facts when it is not. Don’t take anything I’ve said as offensive I’m just suggesting to do your own research so you can dismiss a lot of inaccurate BS that people spread so you’ll know the truth when others choose to not know. If you told people that it is proven that Covid started because it was placed in a popular brand of bottled water most would believe it instead of researching it themselves LOL.,4년 전,1,

@장원대-c6d,"When the Japanese earthquake struck, Korean citizens raised the donation and collected about 600 billion dollars, making it the world's fifth-largest donation country.  However, the Japanese government presented it to the news, leaving Korea alone from the list of top donations to Japan.  Korea donated 600 billion won for Japan, but Japan is nothing more than missing it, and Japanese citizens are almost sure to think, ""Korea is a bad country that didn't help our country when it was in danger.""  There are many reasons why Korea hates Japan.  I hope Japan realizes its fault.",5년 전,0,

And at the last moment, the girl chose to leave her mother away. The mother cried “Don’t leave me away”, but she had no choice but to ignore her cries. The girl saw her mother being swept away by the waves. The broadcast was several years after her mothers death.

@thesleepycookie1381," @TabathaGaines1   The way I see it, no matter where you live you'll be subject to a force of nature. Lots of people live where wildfires occur in California, and yet we still hear about rich people like celebrities' homes being affected. Florida, Texas, Louisiana and a bunch other southern states are hit hard by hurricanes each year. Central US has tornadoes, northern states have snowstorms, mountainous regions have avalanches, areas with soft ground are subject to mudslides, not to mention all the earthquakes that occur around plate lines..... And if not problems with the natural environment, then there's problems with the people, like in the city where there's high crime rates and crowding issues and pollution. My point is it's hard to find an affordable place to live which isn't subject to some type of natural disasters, environmental issues, etc  Plus these people probably rely on the water for economy, if they're a fishing community or something. The problem isn't them living there, it's not having sustainably structured buildings to either withstand natural disasters or be easily rebuildable in case of one",5년 전,3,

@Highhook1818,"The magnitude scale is logarithmic. That just means that if you add 1 to an earthquake's magnitude, you multiply the shaking by 10. An earthquake of magnitude 5 shakes 10 times as violently as an earthquake of magnitude 4; a magnitude-6 quake shakes 10 times as hard as a magnitude-5 quake; and so on.   To compare two earthquakes in terms of shaking, you subtract one magnitude from the other and raise 10 to that power: 10^(M1-M2).   For example, if the magnitude of one quake is 6 and another is 4, than the difference in magnitudes is 2, so the stronger earthquake shakes 10^2 or 100 times as hard as the milder one.",5년 전,0,

At that time, we were really sad and disappointed cause many people passed away and we lost a lot of things... family, friends, house, school and many precious memories, too. And also we have understood that we can't win disasters. We’re always worried about what next disaster is and when it will come...I’m also really scared of them. Sometimes I can’t sleep well when I realize this earthquake or another disasters. But we always try to live strongly instead of people who passed away. I think they’re really important things to help and encourage each other. We are not alone. We’re always together. I wish for peace in the world.

@Luca48882,"Dankrupt I had something alike in my city. It wasn't that catastrophic in terms of lives or structures, but I can try to explain. I had the luck of living in the highest zone, suddenly power goes off. Being a nerd I go out on the balcony, swearing, and the first thing I see is cars and scraps being carried away by brownish water. The garages are exploding under the water pressure resulting in suffering metal roars. People are screaming everywhere. Always seen such things only on tv, moments between panic and realization, and Plinius the Elder in me ventures outside to admire the ruthless power of nature. Plan was basically running back at the smallest sign of water rising,  but I had to see it. I stuck around until night, the water level stabilized, and saw how the city reacted. The saving boats trying to evacuate blocked citizens hiding on higher floors in the case the building crumbled puzzled me. Where once was landscape now was water. I would lie if I said I remember everything. The memory consists of scattered moments, with unexplainable, unmeasurable curiosity and excitement. I cannot say for sure, but the water level arose minimum 20-22 meters and lasted minimum 7/8 hours (I used one bridge as reference). This was caused by a voluntary, desperate but necessary dam opening after many days of red alarm. Most of my city was built ignoring security measures along the river, as a result of corruption and laziness. I lost nothing, but many people I know lost their house and car. The victim count should be less than 10, 'cause luckily the water didn't really manage to make bigger building crumble. The community reunited itself after the tragedy and rebuilt anew. My point of view was, obviously, a lucky one, and therefore I cannot describe you how does it feel to be fighting for life, but once I realized I was safe, I was mesmerized by such power.",5년 전(수정됨),3,

I'd imagine every one of those people sitting on the roofs and watching their city get washed away pretty scared too, but instead having already experienced (a way smaller version of) it, what I wanted to say is that some may just watch with big children eyes not caring at all what's happening in the exact moment.

Fortunately my region wasn’t really affected, but even so it was terrifying experience to watch the news of tsunami and the disaster of nuclear power plant that occurred because of tsunami. TV was only broadcasting those news over and over for a good week or more. (Literally no entertaining shows or commercials, just news).  It was honestly increasing our anxiety and fear of natural disasters.  Tsunami left nothing in many cities and towns so people were forced to stay in shelters after the disaster in cold winter days, waiting for help.  Imagine their pain of losing families, friends, and homes altogether. Pray for the victims. I’ll never forget this.",5년 전,0,

So now let's keep the earth getting bad N more bad from humans inventions...why I said that??..coz all the things that humans created 95% only ended as polution or poison for this earth! !!...like garbage M toxic that even humans can't recycled it any more...then..  Humans threw all the toxic N garbage into the sea then now we can see what the sea can bring back to humans!!!   Yeap only DISASTER! !  IF HUMANS ARE SMART THEY SHOULD STOP TO CREATE NUKE N ALL OF THE WAR MACHINES TO FIND SOLUTIONS N PROTEC THIS EARTH! !!  INSTEAD now each countries are race to create more nuke...special booms...special  war jet machines! !!  Does anyone know that all of us already have our own independence? ?!!  So why we keep making many war machines? ?...why we just not all of us gather N share our knowledge N inventions that we got to protect this earth. ..instead to destroy this earth.   Did you know humans are virus to this earth? ??  We took so many from Earth!!!..oil...wood..waters..land. ..everything. . But none of our efforts are to trying bring back the things that we took from nature!!!  Sorry for the things that I wrote above...  Who care about nature....humans only cares about them selves..they never cares about from where they live N survive.  Have a great disaster on Earth :),5년 전,0,

@bldrtom,"Chaise LaBrie respectfully, I am not a scientist but a lay person. My understanding is that waves in the deep ocean are essentially sound waves traveling through water. The speed of 5 miles per second refers to the speed attained as the shock wave ‘sound wave’ travels through the deep ocean. As the energy begins to hit shallower water, the wave speed slows down but then that energy it converted to wave size. You may now see that the speed of a solid bullet traveling through air is perhaps not an accurate comparison to energy waves passing through air or water. You may have experienced that given calm wind conditions, the ‘sound’ of a rifle will arrive faster than the actual bullet. Again, not claiming to be an authority or trying to be a smarty pants, just giving my understanding of tsunamis. Do a google on speed of sound. Quite interesting. It varies depending on the medium of transfer (air or water and densities).",5년 전,1,

@MegaMikeylikes,"The Cascadia subduction zone fault along the west coast of the U.S. and Canada would be North Americas largest disaster IF a full rupture of that fault occurs. It has been locked for 319 years and science have a 3d visual of what that looks like today.Until all of the infrastructure gets built up to standard a full rupture may take some cities so a 9.0 displaces 120,000 square miles a 9.2 180-188-000 square miles like the alaskan event in Prince William Sound.Nothing in California can match the energy released not even San Andreas. For the backside of that tsunami then involves a large portion of the Pacific Ocean Hawaii, Alaska its Islands Korea Russia Japan around 16 feet there at a 9.0 Cascadia event similar to the 1700 orphan tsunami. It finishes in the Sumatra Papa New Guinea before gravity can lessen these columns of water. Usually Cascadia ruptures south to north along the 620 mile long fault Japans Tokohu fault ruptured 500 kilometers at a momentum magnitude of 9.1 NHK/USGS. It picked up a column of water approximately 6 billion cubic meters worth and ejected it outward in all directions at a great rate of speed. These columns of water can go up and over land masses or what they call refract off a landmass and combine with another column of water. Usually the main wave or high wave will be found within the first 4 columns of water but they persist for many hours and with 2 tide cycles its gradual. So my advice if you shake for 5 minutes or more program the brain to get your legs to 150 to 200 feet don't focus on the height of the waves its the high water marks that matter with that much water volume. Lets hope this doesn't slip but its 80 years past the small event and that being in the 8.0's to low as 7.9, some partial ruptures can still involve 40-70% of that 620 mile long fault. I hope this helps and this issue needs to be disgust probably at the U.N. level because it involves many countries.",6년 전,0,

It is the tsunami that suffered more damage than the earthquake. Both the house and the school lost everything due to the massive tsunami brought by the huge earthquake The 15-meter tsunami was black and swallowed a lot of rubble.

@SenjaDeandra,"Lot of people gonna call me names after this, but im just stating the cold hard fact. 2 countries, one have 120+ mil population the other have 220+ mil, both are no strangers to tsunami and eartquake, both are sitting on top of active tectonic plate. Both were hit with powerful quake (9.0 vs 9.1) and tsunami. The difference is, 1 is prepared.  Japan quake+tsunami, roughly 28,000 dead/missing. Most of the infrastructure, except for the wooden traditional houses survives.   Indonesian quake+tsunami, roughly 160,000 dead/missing and all major infrastructure are either collapsed by the quake or swept away by the tidal wave.  One country knew its only a matter of time before another disaster is coming, the other barely prepared for it. One country have active early warning system and train its citizen for things to do during quake and tsunamis, the other have none.   One country learn from the previous disaster, implementing changes to better equipped its infrastructure and shoreline from the next coming disaster, the other cant even properly maintain its warning system.   The result is clear, nearly 6x the total deathtoll/missing simply because one government took things seriously while the other are too busy playing politics.",6년 전,3,

@winarttee,"The tectonic plates are unstable due to minings, tunneling, transfering large amount of earth ,  destroying its equilibrium can cause earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, volcanic eruptions, etc.. Why? Let's consider a single plate(tectonic plate) that is in equilibrium meaning at rest.If you remove some of its weight and transfer them somewhere, you're making it unbalanced. The result is earthquake or volcanic eruptions. If some of the plate's boundaries are located under the sea, possibilities are tsunamis and typhoons . Why? When the sea bed have cracked the melting earth (lava ) will be exposed directly to the water  causing heavy water vapor to create typhoons and tsunami is caused by quaking seabed. All objects have its boundaries and center of gravity (point of balance) or we can call it  focal point, so when a plate's gradual unbalancement( continue), byfar, earthquake will occur. If the boundary lines are nearer to the focal point the earthquake intensity is lower as compared to the farder boundary lines, the fardest boundary lines will suffer much more earthquake intensity .  Somewhere ,near  or above the focal point earthquake movement  is horizontal,  while in every boundaries vertical movement will be sensed. After shocks earthquaking is cause by the changing point of gravity and we sense the grinding of every boundaries first before the shaking of the earth.",7년 전,0,

I had it about 15 minutes after this earthquake went off—I was California—and the sickness actually woke me up, and got me checking the news. I had it also with the great Chilean Bio-Bio quake (and aftershocks) and by that point was beginning to be wise to it—I had an app on my phone for quakes and actually checked that app and saw the 8.9 estimated temblor there before it was reported on TV.  I know labs can simulate these things, but the LAST thing I will ever do is volunteer for some study to see what vestigial cells I carry. The sensation doesn’t make me want to run uphill.

Since you gave nothing for your life, why don't you figure out Who did give you life and then came down to this lower reality in the form of one of us to give HIS Life for us!  There is only ONE Way, Truth and Life, Jesus Christ, by whom all things were created, seen and unseen for His Own purpose and pleasure.  YOU are a part of His Purpose or else you wouldn't be here!

@Centrioless,"Er PaBlEtOr yes we are capable of storing them underground for thousands of years.  Chernobyl was mainly caused of human mistake and its faulty design.

We are giving our cancerous shit waste to our very distant generations, so we could watch fucking youtube. In a desert it doesn't matter if it is winter there will be plenty of sun, and there are other clean energies in case of not having sun. I don't why people argue about this, do you prefer an energy that does nothing harmful to us? or something that produces waste for thousands of years and give fucking cancer?

Let me enlighten you in a few simple sentences so you'd understand :   Americans built such houses on purpose, because if they are hit, they are much easier to replace. The insurance covers almost everything.   Tornadoes CAN destroy concrete buildings as well.   Lastly and maybe the most important, the chances of being hit by a tornado are VERY slim. Most people live their entire lives in tornado alley without having their houses hit by one, so they don't need to invest too much in their houses",6년 전,0,

@Khono,"Mmm, yes that's a very interesting idea.  It could be made so that the non-loadbearing walls would break under pressure and allow the water to flow through.  The loadbearing walls naturally being built along the direction the water will flow, so the water presses the edge rather than the face.  Yet debris would pose a problem as you said.  If house A is built like this but house B isn't and gets pushed into house A...  And this might make them more vulnerable to earthquake damage.  Interesting.",12년 전,0,
