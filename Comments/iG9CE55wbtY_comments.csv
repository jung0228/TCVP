@giovannaargon9010,"This hit me more than I thought it would I was an undiagnosed adhd child, filled with creativity all the time. I wrote fictions and poems very early, I had such a vivid imagination, capable of living so many thrilling adventures in my head. Once I was 10, I started to write a sci-fi work. It wasn't good, of course, and some concepts were not believable. But I think that's OK at 10, I didn't plan on getting published or anything. One of my parents read my text, pointed every detail, reworking my ideas under their scope, even suggested a change of name. I was disowned and belittled, and this kind of pattern kept on happening throughout the years. The thing is, my school teachers were on their end pleased with my creativity and my passion for imagining stories   I could felt my imagination and my creativity fading away.  Now as an adult I'm devoid of it and it hurts. I used to write pretty badass poems too. Feeling drained out of something as magical as imagination and creativity feels dreading s",1개월 전,0,

@rizmacadillac,"I don't know if I am naturally creative or not.  To some extent I favored Math and Science but I enjoy reading History and Historical fiction.  Education was my life so if I criticize education at all it is sort of like committing suicide.  The only friends I ever had valued public education and were active in class discussions and such.  But I have to complain when teachers encouraged the topic like ""changing the Economy"" which I consider something approaching creativity in Economics, Math and Statistics.  No business, government agency or political candidate wants my ""creative"" opinion on the Economy.  If they want a projection or information they want something realistic, substantive and real.  When I rejected ""creative economics""  I was basically criticized by Education and laughed at by some Professors or maybe worse.  So I guess I have to ask the question as to whether education was trying to kill me.  I simply did not know what changing thee Economic system meant without learning the rules.  I'm glad I started out learning the rules of Economics and sticking to the rules of Math and Statistics and I don't look back at this despite my rejection.  Sure, you can talk about creativity in English or Art but I knew a woman who taught Home Economics and I did not notice Creativity from her even in a recipe or a meal.  With all respect, I've had a lot of anxiety since graduation over creative Economics and this should not be the problem.  When I rejected creativity in Economics some teachers did encourage me to study English. And if I eventually decide to return to University and study English as ordered by my teachers, I will be glad that Creative Economics no longer gives me a headache and I can finally move forward with my life.",5개월 전,0,

You can't be very creative in an area if you know nothing about it (source: I'm a mathematician, history of math is plaged with examples of this) 3. It is a very bold assumption to say ""schools kill creativity"" without taking into account the several differences amongs educational systems, or even schools in the same region, for that matter.

Once they had done this their attitude toward school in general improved and their joy in learning rose. It was wonderful to   be their teacher.,7개월 전,0,

He excels at any sport he tries, he’s an incredibly fast runner, amazing coordination. He’s only 6 years old but he has very toned calves, quads, and even abs. This kid is a natural athlete. But instead he’s been put on medication and made to sit at a desk all day. I think it’s so sad.   My kid also has ADHD but she’s clumsy and uncoordinated and her hyperactivity usually manifests as rolling around on the ground.   But in this other’s kid’s situation his energy is an asset. He loves sports, he has the stamina and the physical ability, why not nurture it? Besides, there are sports scholarships if academics is a concern. I know I shouldn’t judge someone else’s situation.

I wanted to be a more educated person, i wanted to be more intelligent but after watching sir ken. it made me understand that the hierarchical system of education led me here and not myself. this ted talk made me understand alot of new things and more than that to do what I love. it deeply saddens be that it's been 17 years and nothing has changed and it's discouraging to a  lot of people. i hope the next generation or the kids these days don't get educated out of their creativity.",11개월 전,0,

@itsdinonuggies,"watching this for a course in late 2024 (first having an existential crisis that this was posted 17 years ago) and reading comments spanning years between then and now, where people have observed the passage of time, and how little has changed - I think its safe to say that we're probably worse now than ever. When he says ""we are raising university professors"" - I believe we've gone one step further; we're now only testing the university graduates who have become professors to see if can they train 30+ children at once to regurgitate their state's curriculum on a standardized test to prove that the schools are doing their job.  I think in an ideal world, students would work on individually selected, special interest projects to work on throughout a school year, and then spend time as a group learning concepts to apply within those projects. In an age where all knowledge (and disinformation) is readily available at our fingertips, teaching children to self educate through sourcing accurate information, thinking critically about a problem, applying research and skills they've learned in an imaginative, novel, pragmatic or effective way successfully helps creates adults who can thrive in any environment.   There is a great Star Trek: Next Gen episode about an alien society who has (essentially) a pre-smart phone device that connects them to everyone from their home planet as well as a massive super computer knowledge base - they originally board the Enterprise under the guise of upgrading their computer systems, but are actually there to upgrade their own. Despite having all the necessary information the Bynars run into issues that bottleneck them and cause problems - the Enterprise crew eventually realizes what is happening and devises a solution to their problem that the Bynars' overlooked, having missed the forest for the trees. Learning only a set of solutions, learning only to pass a test doesn't teach you how to THINK, only how to repeat answers or procedures that you've already been taught.   Until we teach the skills necessary to search, self educate, think critically and creatively, and apply those principles and techniques to problems that interest the student, those without a natural capacity for those skills will be struggling as adults. Running into people who have never learned those skills in the wild is always painful and leaves me questioning how those types have survived (or gone unnoticed as ... ""ineffective"" in their workplaces...) because for me, running into a problem I don't immediately know the answer to is an exciting chance to deep dive and hoard some more knowledge, and maybe even learn something unexpected that could help me improve other processes or solutions in unrelated parts of my life.",1년 전,0,

And me, i never made an art school, so i may not have a lot of technical abilities, but i have more spontanteity and creativity. So art school are great, but it shouldn't enclose in too much technics, but also encourage pure creativity. And second, i do think that in french school, art aren't taken seriously. We had only 1 hour of artistic course and 1 h of music per week, and no one really worked during them, everyone was talking and the teacher weren't involved too. It was really boring. Not motivating (while i'm an artist myself). And the others class were about history, geography, mathematics, french....all that was boring for me, and in french school, the only thing you do, it's to sit down, listen during hours, and have homework to do. Nothing that encourage individuality or creativity. I say that, because i saw that in usa, music and arts + groups/club school, did encourage projects, creativity, and art is from a higher level. So yes, in france, arts aren't major at school, and if you want to became an artist, they say to you that it wouldn't work, and they put you in secretary school, instead to give you a chance to express your individuality. I deeply believe that school don't always work, and that finally we don't need to go in school, but to learn what we really WANT to learn. For me i would have love to learn more poetry, philosophy, art, music. I think that school shouldn't program us, but that we should program things that correspond to what we really need.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

@ThatTimeTheThingHappened,"Define creativity - establish criteria for measuring it and establish a protocol for producing more of it systemically.  Unfortunately to this argument there are a lot of creative people coming out schools yet we are saying that schools don’t encourage creativity. You could say that maybe there’s still less as a results of coming out of the education system. But I gotta say-as we’ve taken away the rigor of grades in school kids are not becoming more creative.  In fact, I’d say counter intuitively kids that learn more crave using that more and more creatively. SSOOOO, learning more actually encourages more creativity.   Maaaaaybeeeee we just look back at school with filters like “boo I’m sad, I had to do work and I didn’t like the way that felt” but unfortunately the people who go through that end up being able to create more.   And people who are artists still have to LEARN their art to use it. But creativity is more than art. Engineering is creative. Writing a book is creative. Creating math proofs is creative. Don’t stifle your definition of creativity to try to justify your desire to not do school work which actually can put you into a better position for creative pursuits.",1년 전,2,

@Wisdomseeker1028,I respectfully disagree. I dont think we should use public funds to teach people to dance or sing... i just dont think these things are productive or practical for the average person to pursue in society. Schools need to be as efficient as possible and teach the most useful skills to the most people that will benefit them the most in life. Reading and writing is crucial for instance for all walks of life. Math is also important for society as its needed for engineering and physics etc we should teach kids so that they can make the US a better place.,1년 전,1,

@00samira00,"Aaah… the efficiency reasoning. We have research that shows that productivity increases with rest and rejuvenation. Something that they in china have even integrated with nap time at work. We and our brain are not machines. Curiosity, play, movement, novelty and rest actually lights us up to be able to do and perceive things about our world that we otherwise would’t be able to do. It’s not a coincidence that a lot of brilliant people and inventors were artist at the same time or used sleep to came up with their inventions that we still use today. By “waisting” time dancing or doing other creative things whilst also  learning math and language, your actually giving your brain a bigger capacity to use these “academic” knowledges in a more effective way. Efficiency dose not equal speed. Putting less money into things dose not always equate a higher return or that you’ll be saving money.",1년 전,2,

Why does education have to be a vague box ticking exercise where everyone (nearly) is in a race to the middle and ends up skilled at nothing at all.  My children have been dancing and [playing in a football team since they were 5. They get so much more out of the few hours a week they do those sessions than an entire work week of school.   Why can't we have lessons in industry and skills? Why can't people explore their interests from a young age rather than only having time to 'find themselves' once they've retired? such a waste of potential",1년 전,1,

@maggieensley8819,I wish schools emphasized teaching how to read and not what to read. If they focused on how to write but left students the freedom to express their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgement. Basic mathematics needs to make sense in a practical way. If you can do the problem 10 times then why do you need 60 problems. Homework is horrible and should be discouraged in my opinion. Somehow teachers need to find a way to make the time at school productive and inspiring. Every kid is great at something and the ones who get the highest grades aren’t the only ones who count. We need to bring individuality back to our education systems. The school day is also too long. Make it an hour and a half shorter with the time afterwards reserved for homework and tutoring while still at school. Parents should focus on life skills and sitting down to dinner not stupid science projects and tons of repetitive lessons.,1년 전,0,

@mikelundun,"In the 1930's the condition we know now as ADHD was considered to be a moral failing or a defect in character and generally treated with violence and when that didnt work the children were written off. Gillian probably did have ADHD she also was lucky enough to have parents who were attentive enough to notice, had the means to see specialists and to put her into a dance school. Probably many more Gillians were just flushed down the toilet (figuratively speaking). Agree the education system is not suited to most kids but please dont dismiss a known biological condition like ADHD like that. It sounds very quippy but its actually quite dangerous. Nowadays Gillian wouldnt be given pills, shed have been left on a waiting list for 2-3 years while her parents struggled to find accomodations for her at school. When she did get assessed she probably would have been rejected because her behaviour wasnt disruptive enough. A huge percentage of ADHD females are only diagnosed in adulthood as they tend to turn the hyperactivity in on themselves and receive more pressure to mask the symptoms. If she was lucky enough to be diagnosed in childhood, they would indeed treat her with medication because if she has ADHD they know that there are certain chemicals such as dopamine that the ADHD brain struggles to produce. She still would have been a dancer - quite possibly an even better one. Definitely a happier one and not carrying around any shame or stigma from growing up ""not good enough"". Myself I was missed, as they just didnt know that much about it yet and was only diagnosed in my 40's. It saved my life.",1년 전,0,

@KnowledgeObject,"Here are the knowledge objects extracted from the content:  ### Title: Creativity as important as literacy in education  - Fact: Education meant to prepare children for the future, but the future is unpredictable.  - Situation: Education systems worldwide undervalue creativity and the arts.    - Cause: Education systems designed for the industrial era to meet needs of the job market.  - Approach: Treat creativity as equally important as literacy in education. Nurture arts, dance, drama, music daily as core subjects, not extras.   ### Title: Mistakes and risk-taking foster creativity  - Fact: Children naturally take chances and try new things.  - Situation: Adults become frightened of being wrong and making mistakes.  - Cause: School systems stigmatize and penalize errors rather than rewarding imagination.  - Approach: Encourage experimentation. Let children explore ideas without fear of being wrong.  ### Title: Rethink narrow conceptions of intelligence  - Fact: Intelligence is diverse, dynamic, and distinct in each person.  - Situation: Academic ability prized above all other talents.  - Cause: Education systems designed to produce academics and reward book smarts.  - Approach: Value all expressions of intelligence - kinesthetic, musical, spatial, interpersonal etc. Identify and nurture each child's distinct abilities.  ### Title: Nurture the whole child  - Fact: Standard education focuses heavily on the brain, less on the body.  - Situation: Children taught to sit still and control physical expression.   - Cause: Belief that mind and body are separate, and mental work is superior.  - Approach: Educate the whole child - heart, mind, body and spirit. Let children move, dance, play. Physical expression and creativity go hand in hand.",2년 전,1,

@tjd110,"The main pieces of advice given in the video are as follows:      Value Creativity Equally: The speaker suggests that creativity should be given the same importance as literacy in education systems. He believes that creativity is a fundamental skill required to navigate an uncertain and rapidly changing future.      Embrace Mistakes: The speaker encourages embracing mistakes and taking chances. He emphasizes that being afraid of making mistakes stifles creativity, and that original ideas often come from the willingness to try new things, even if they might be wrong at first.      Rethink Intelligence: The speaker challenges the traditional concept of intelligence that places academic subjects at the top of the hierarchy. He advocates for recognizing diverse forms of intelligence, such as artistic, kinesthetic, and creative abilities, which are often overlooked in traditional education.      Foster Interdisciplinary Thinking: The speaker highlights the importance of interdisciplinary thinking, where different ways of seeing and understanding the world intersect. He suggests that creative breakthroughs often come from the interaction of various disciplines.      Nurture Children's Talents: The speaker believes that all children possess unique talents and capacities for innovation. He suggests that educational systems should nurture these talents rather than suppress them.      Encourage Movement and Expression: The speaker notes that children often express themselves through movement and action. He argues that arts, like dance and music, should be given equal importance in education as traditional subjects, as they engage different aspects of human intelligence.      Prepare for an Unpredictable Future: The speaker emphasizes that the future is uncertain, and current education systems must prepare students for jobs and challenges that are yet to emerge. Focusing solely on traditional subjects might not adequately equip students for what lies ahead.      Celebrate Human Imagination: The speaker underscores the importance of human imagination in solving future problems. He believes that fostering creativity and imagination will contribute to a brighter and more innovative future.",2년 전,1,

I've often thought to myself that I would not want to live in a world without dancers, artists, paintings & creativity but I've never once cared if I lived in a world without professors.   The root problem is our struggle with money & trying  to position our kids for a future (we can't see or understand) in which they wont have to struggle as we do. Instead if we had enough money (or if our purchasing power wasn't diminished via inflation over time) then we would not feel a need to press our kids into a certain mold. We think we are doing it for their own good, but what if we had all our needs met & would have them met for our lifetimes without ""working"" what creativity would be unleashed then world be awesome!

@janezhao-po8fc,"教育不仅仅局限于学校教育，而是与整个社会环境和文化息息相关。社会和文化对教育的影响是深远的，它们塑造了教育的目标、价值观和实践方式。  社会环境可以包括家庭、社区、政府、经济和社会价值观等方面。家庭是孩子最早的教育环境，父母和家庭成员对孩子的教育态度和价值观念有着重要影响。社区和政府的教育政策和资源分配也会对教育产生深远影响。经济方面的因素，如就业市场和职业发展机会，也会影响学生对教育的态度和目标。  文化因素涉及社会的价值观、信仰体系、传统习俗等。不同文化背景下，对教育的重视程度、教育方式和教育目标可能存在差异。因此，教育改革和发展需要考虑社会和文化因素的影响，以建立适应社会需求和价值观的教育体系。  因此，解决教育问题需要综合考虑学校教育、家庭教育、社会环境和文化等多个因素。建立一个良好的教育生态系统需要各方的共同努力和协作，以营造支持学生全面发展和终身学习的社会环境。Education is not limited to school education alone; it is closely intertwined with the entire social environment and culture. Society and culture have a profound influence on education, shaping its goals, values, and practices.  The social environment encompasses aspects such as family, community, government, economy, and social values. The family is the earliest educational environment for children, and parents and family members have a significant influence on their educational attitudes and values. The community and government's education policies and resource allocation also have far-reaching effects on education. Economic factors, such as the job market and career opportunities, also influence students' attitudes and goals towards education.  Cultural factors involve societal values, belief systems, and traditional customs. In different cultural backgrounds, there may be differences in the emphasis placed on education, educational approaches, and educational goals. Therefore, educational reforms and developments need to consider the influence of social and cultural factors to establish an education system that aligns with societal needs and values.  Thus, addressing educational issues requires a comprehensive consideration of factors such as school education, family education, the social environment, and culture. Establishing a favorable educational ecosystem requires the collective efforts and collaboration of all parties involved, to create a social environment that supports students' holistic development and lifelong learning.   教育的问题通常与社会系统的许多方面密切相关。社会经济状况、资源分配、社会价值观和文化传统等因素都会对教育产生影响。  改革社会系统可以包括改善教育资源的分配，提供平等的机会和资源给予每个人，无论其背景和经济状况。此外，改革社会系统还可以涉及改进教育政策和实践，确保教育目标与社会需求相一致，并提供多元化的教育模式和途径。  另外，改革社会系统也可以包括提供全面的社会支持体系，关注孩子和家庭的健康、福利和社会支持，以促进他们的全面发展。这可能涉及医疗保健、社会服务、家庭支持和心理健康等方面的改进。  改革社会系统是一个综合性的任务，需要政府、教育机构、社会组织和个人共同努力。通过综合考虑教育、经济、社会和文化等方面的因素，我们可以创造一个更公正、包容和支持全面发展的社会环境。        Before addressing education reform, I believe it is necessary to first consider reforming the social system, as educational issues are often closely intertwined with various aspects of the social system. Factors such as socio-economic conditions, resource allocation, social values, and cultural traditions can all impact education.  Reforming the social system can involve improving the distribution of educational resources, providing equal opportunities and resources to everyone, regardless of their background and economic status. Furthermore, reforming the social system can also involve improving education policies and practices, ensuring that educational goals align with societal needs and providing diverse educational models and pathways.  Additionally, reforming the social system can also include providing comprehensive social support systems that focus on the well-being, welfare, and social support for children and families, promoting their holistic development. This may involve improvements in healthcare, social services, family support, and mental health, among other aspects.  Reforming the social system is a comprehensive task that requires collective efforts from the government, educational institutions, social organizations, and individuals. By considering and integrating factors from education, economy, society, and culture, we can create a more just, inclusive, and supportive social environment that fosters holistic development.          我们需要付出行动和努力，努力是实现变革和改善的关键。只有通过不断的努力、积极的行动和持续的奋斗，我们才能看到真正的进步和希望。每个人都可以在自己的力量范围内做出积极的改变，无论是在个人层面还是在社会层面。  努力不仅是为了改变现状，还是一种自我成长和发展的过程。通过努力，我们可以克服困难，充实自己的知识和技能，提高自身的素质和能力。同时，努力也是一种表达对价值观和信念的承诺，展示个人的责任感和奉献精神。  每个人都可以以自己的方式做出努力，无论是通过教育、参与社区活动、倡导变革、践行公正和平等的价值观，还是通过与他人建立联系和合作来推动积极的改变。重要的是坚持不懈地追求目标，持之以恒地为自己和社会的利益而努力。  虽然变革和改善需要时间和集体努力，但每一个个体的努力都是推动社会进步的重要力量。只要我们坚信自己的能力和价值，以及不断努力追求更好的未来，我们就能为实现希望而努力，并为自身和他人创造积极的影响。   We need to take action and make efforts; effort is the key to bringing about change and improvement. Only through continuous effort, proactive actions, and persistent striving can we witness real progress and hope. Each person can make positive changes within their own sphere of influence, whether at an individual level or a societal level.  Effort is not only about changing the status quo; it is also a process of self-growth and development. Through effort, we can overcome challenges, enrich our knowledge and skills, and enhance our qualities and abilities. At the same time, effort is a commitment to values and beliefs, demonstrating a sense of responsibility and dedication.  Everyone can make efforts in their own way, whether through education, engaging in community activities, advocating for change, practicing values of justice and equality, or by building connections and collaborating with others to drive positive change. What matters is persevering in the pursuit of goals and persistently striving for the benefit of oneself and society.  While transformation and improvement take time and collective effort, the efforts of each individual are crucial in driving social progress. As long as we believe in our abilities and worth, and continuously strive for a better future, we can work towards realizing hope and create a positive impact for ourselves and others.",2년 전(수정됨),0,
@janezhao-po8fc,"人类本身存在着各种缺陷和局限性。这可能包括认知偏差、情绪偏见、道德矛盾、自我中心主义等方面的问题。这些缺陷可以影响我们的决策、行为和互动，导致不公平、偏见和冲突等问题。  纠正人类的缺陷需要广泛的教育、培养和意识提高。教育的目标之一就是帮助人们认识到自身的局限性，并学会克服和纠正这些缺陷。培养批判性思维、开放的心态和理解他人的能力可以帮助我们超越自我中心主义和偏见，更好地与他人协作和共处。  此外，个人的自我反思和成长也是纠正人类缺陷的重要方面。通过审视自己的态度、行为和信念，我们可以发现和改变存在的问题，并朝着更加成熟、包容和道德的方向发展。  需要意识到的是，人类的缺陷是人性的一部分，无法完全消除。然而，通过教育、培养和不断的努力，我们可以逐渐提高自身的意识水平和道德素质，以更积极和建设性的方式参与社会，并努力减少偏见、歧视和不公平的存在。  综上所述，纠正人类的缺陷是一个长期的过程，需要从教育、自我反思和社会变革等多个层面共同努力。通过共同的意识提高和努力，我们可以逐渐改善自身和社会，促进更公正、平等和和谐的人际关系 。Human beings inherently possess various flaws and limitations. These may include cognitive biases, emotional prejudices, moral contradictions, and self-centeredness, among other issues. These flaws can influence our decision-making, behavior, and interactions, leading to unfairness, biases, and conflicts.  Correcting human flaws requires widespread education, cultivation, and increased awareness. One of the goals of education is to help individuals recognize their own limitations and learn to overcome and rectify these flaws. Cultivating critical thinking, an open mindset, and the ability to understand others can help us transcend self-centeredness and biases, enabling better collaboration and coexistence with others.  Additionally, personal self-reflection and growth are also crucial aspects of correcting human flaws. By examining our attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs, we can identify and address existing problems, and progress towards greater maturity, inclusiveness, and morality.  It is important to recognize that human flaws are a part of human nature and cannot be completely eradicated. However, through education, cultivation, and ongoing efforts, we can gradually elevate our level of consciousness and moral character, engaging in society in more positive and constructive ways while striving to reduce prejudice, discrimination, and unfairness.

@janezhao-po8fc,"人类的本性和追求优秀、追逐短期目标和利益的特点。确实，人类在发展和进步过程中常常受到内在驱动力和外部环境的影响，包括追求成就、权力、财富等。这些动机可以激发人们的努力和竞争意识，推动社会的发展。  然而，过度追求短期利益和快速成功可能会限制创造性思维和创新能力的发展。创造性思维需要时间、耐心和探索的过程，它不仅关注眼前的成果，更注重对问题的深入思考、多样化的观点和长期的积累。如果人们只追求短期利益和立即满足，可能会忽视创造性思维所需的耐心和坚持。  在教育和社会环境中，平衡短期目标和长期发展是非常重要的。教育者和社会应该鼓励学生和个体培养良好的价值观和品质，如努力、坚毅、耐心、持久性等，这些品质对于创造性思维和长期发展非常重要。同时，教育体系也应该提供多样化的学习机会和探索空间，鼓励学生思考和质疑，培养他们的创造性思维和解决问题的能力。  此外，教育和社会也可以通过价值观的塑造和认知培养来引导个体对待成绩和评价的态度。成绩和评价可以作为一种参考和指导，但不应该成为唯一的衡量标准。人们应该更加重视个体的全面发展、个人成长和学习过程中的努力和进步。  总的来说，创造性思维的发展需要平衡个体的长期目标和社会的需要，同时重视努力、耐心和坚持。教育和社会环境应该提供支持和机会，鼓励个体发挥创造性潜能，并树立正确的价值观，使创造性思维能够得到更好的发展和应用。Human nature and the pursuit of excellence, as well as the pursuit of short-term goals and interests, do influence human development and progress. This includes the pursuit of achievements, power, wealth, and other motivations. These motivations can inspire effort and competitiveness, driving societal development.  However, excessive focus on short-term benefits and quick success may limit the development of creative thinking and innovation. Creative thinking requires time, patience, and an exploratory process. It goes beyond immediate outcomes and emphasizes deep problem-solving, diverse perspectives, and long-term accumulation. If people solely pursue short-term benefits and instant gratification, they may overlook the patience and perseverance required for creative thinking.  In education and the societal environment, striking a balance between short-term goals and long-term development is crucial. Educators and society should encourage students and individuals to cultivate values and qualities such as effort, resilience, patience, and persistence, which are vital for creative thinking and long-term growth. Additionally, the education system should provide diverse learning opportunities and spaces for exploration, encouraging students to think critically and question, and nurturing their creative thinking and problem-solving abilities.  Furthermore, education and society can shape values and cultivate cognitive skills to guide individuals' attitudes towards achievements and evaluations. Grades and evaluations can serve as references and guidance but should not be the sole measurement criteria. More emphasis should be placed on holistic personal development, individual growth, and the effort and progress made during the learning process.  In conclusion, the development of creative thinking requires a balance between individuals' long-term goals and societal needs, while emphasizing effort, patience, and perseverance. Education and the societal environment should provide support and opportunities, encouraging individuals to unleash their creative potential and establishing the right values, enabling the better development and application of creative thinking.",2년 전,0,
@janezhao-po8fc,"传统的教育体系通常注重标准化的教学和评估，强调知识的传授和记忆，而对于培养创造性思维和想象力的重视相对较少。这可能会导致孩子们在学习过程中受到约束，被要求追求正确答案和规定的标准，而缺少探索、创新和个性发展的机会。  然而，现代教育趋势逐渐重视培养创造力和创新能力。教育者开始意识到创造力的重要性，以及如何在教育中提供支持和机会来激发孩子的创造力。教育者可以采用启发式教学方法、开放性问题、探究式学习等方式，鼓励学生思考、提问和探索，培养他们的创造性思维和解决问题的能力。  关于教育体系的发展，确实受到了长期以来的历史和社会影响。人们在追求卓越和优秀时往往会强调成绩和等级制度。然而，现代教育也越来越重视培养全面发展的个体，关注他们的创造力、批判思维、合作能力和自主性等方面。教育的目标不仅仅是追求成绩，而是培养学生的多元智能、适应性和创新能力，使他们能够在面对复杂的现实世界中应对挑战。  因此，现代教育正朝着更加综合和多元化的方向发展，旨在平衡知识传授和创造力培养，尊重个体差异和发展需求。这需要教育者和教育体系共同努力，提供支持和机会，让每个孩子都能发挥其独特的创造力和潜力。                                                                                                                                       Traditional education systems often prioritize standardized teaching and assessment, emphasizing knowledge transmission and memorization, while placing less emphasis on cultivating creative thinking and imagination. This can result in children feeling constrained in their learning, as they are expected to pursue correct answers and adhere to prescribed standards, while lacking opportunities for exploration, innovation, and personal development.  However, modern educational trends are gradually shifting towards valuing creativity and innovation. Educators are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of creativity and how to provide support and opportunities to foster children's creativity in education. Educators can adopt heuristic teaching methods, open-ended questions, inquiry-based learning, and other approaches to encourage students to think, question, and explore, thus cultivating their creative thinking and problem-solving abilities.  The development of educational systems is indeed influenced by historical and societal factors that have long emphasized achievements and the grading system in the pursuit of excellence. However, modern education is also placing more emphasis on nurturing well-rounded individuals, focusing on their creativity, critical thinking, collaborative skills, and autonomy. The goal of education is not only to pursue grades but to cultivate students' multiple intelligences, adaptability, and innovation capabilities, enabling them to navigate challenges in a complex real-world context.  Therefore, modern education is evolving towards a more comprehensive and diverse direction, aiming to balance knowledge transmission and the cultivation of creativity while respecting individual differences and developmental needs. This requires joint efforts from educators and the education system to provide support and opportunities, allowing each child to unleash their unique creativity and potential.",2년 전,0,
@janezhao-po8fc,"一个关键问题，即如何在教育中处理错误和规则的角色。确实，错误和规则在教育中起着重要的作用，但是如何平衡容忍错误和保持规则的约束是一个挑战。  容忍孩子犯错误是有益的，因为错误是学习和成长的机会。通过犯错误，孩子们可以从中学到教训，发展解决问题的能力，培养创造性思维和灵活性。容忍错误可以鼓励孩子们积极尝试和探索，不害怕失败，并且激发他们的创新潜力。  然而，规则和正确率也是必要的，它们提供了结构和纪律，以确保秩序和安全。规则可以帮助孩子们明确行为的界限，提供稳定的环境，并教导他们尊重他人和负责任的态度。正确率的衡量也是对学习进程的一种评估，可以帮助孩子们了解自己的进步和发展方向。  关键在于在教育中找到平衡点。孩子们需要在安全的环境中能够容忍错误，得到支持和引导，而不是过于指责和批评。同时，他们也需要明确的规则和期望，以培养纪律和责任感。这需要教育者在教育过程中运用适当的教育方法和策略，帮助孩子们理解错误的重要性、规则的目的，并积极引导他们在错误和规则的框架内成长和发展。  最终，教育的目标是培养全面发展的个体，既要关注他们的自主性和创造性，也要教导他们遵守规则和尊重他人。这需要综合考虑错误容忍和规则约束的平衡，并根据孩子的个体差异和发展需求来灵活运用。               A key question is how to handle mistakes and the role of rules in education. Indeed, mistakes and rules play important roles in education, but striking a balance between tolerating mistakes and maintaining the constraints of rules is a challenge.  Tolerating children's mistakes is beneficial because mistakes provide learning and growth opportunities. Through making mistakes, children can learn lessons, develop problem-solving abilities, and cultivate creative thinking and flexibility. Tolerating mistakes encourages children to actively try and explore, fearlessly embracing failure, and stimulates their innovative potential.  However, rules and correctness are also necessary. They provide structure and discipline to ensure order and safety. Rules can help children understand the boundaries of behavior, provide a stable environment, and teach them respect for others and a sense of responsibility. Assessing correctness also serves as an evaluation of the learning process, helping children understand their progress and developmental directions.  The key is finding a balance in education. Children need an environment where they can tolerate mistakes in a safe space, receiving support and guidance instead of excessive blame and criticism. At the same time, they also need clear rules and expectations to cultivate discipline and a sense of responsibility. This requires educators to employ appropriate educational methods and strategies to help children understand the importance of mistakes and the purpose of rules, actively guiding their growth and development within the framework of mistakes and rules.  Ultimately, the goal of education is to nurture well-rounded individuals who possess autonomy, creativity, and the ability to adhere to rules and respect others. This requires a comprehensive consideration of the balance between tolerating mistakes and adhering to rules, and the flexible application of these principles based on individual differences and developmental needs of children.",2년 전,0,
@firstandforemost1,"“I never let school get in the way of my education” -Mark Twain  ""If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original""  ""The whole purpose of public education, throughout the world, is to produce university professors...The universities designed the system in their own image [and the system itself] is a protracted process of university entrance. ""  ""Kids with degrees are often carrying on home playing video games because now to get a job you need an M.A and a P.h.d for the next one""   here is a someone's comment that i dont want to lose:  1. I agree that schools have become a kid storage facility for children while the adults are at work, teaching them one-size-fits-all random things just for the sake of teaching, and have them remember the information long enough to pass a test. Most Parents of course think this is good, but is it effective?  2. School also serve a more valuable purpose; socializing. This can go both ways if stopping bullying is not a primary initiative, but school is a place where kids learn how to socialize and interact with other kids, which is probably the most important knowledge they'll take away from attending school in the first place.  3. Other than maths, a bit of history and languages, I find that most of what I was taught over the decades I have attend school has been forgotten, because 95% of it has been either uninteresting or inapplicable to daily life. All the skills I utilize in my career have been taught through on-the-job experience. Do we really need 2 decades of school to apply for a job?  4. Why do schools not prepare children for life?

If that's the way, schools would be worthless and shallow. In fact, it seems to me, as Sir Ken Robinson said, education is about exploring a child's potential and making the most of it. In other words, the point is to help them to flourish from pigeons to eagles so that they can fly their way through life, something that some educational systems need to consider. On the other hand, if one thinks about it, some students are being prepared for today's world rather than for building and changing the future.

@LycorisRadiata,"I want a human to reinvent the school system, perhaps destroy it completely and start from scratch.  now we have a lot of technology and knowledge we can put it into use and create the close to perfect system for this time, the school system is too outdated. we could also now take into account how neurodivergences learn, so that way it makes it easier for anyone to learn, and make it really fun.  as an autistic student going to high school everyday, I think I really need this, this system doesn't seem to be made for neurodivergent communities and that profoundly bothers me. this is simply a burden to humanity and I think now is a good time as ever to change that.  humans love learning, somehow this current system destroys that common law completely. I think the world can change for the better if we reinvent schools.   it bothers me so much that I want to try changing it myself, I can't even use my brain like I used to due to school.   merely a disgrace to humanity.",2년 전,0,

Humiliation is a big part. Being made to feel like you'll never be good enough compared to others. Teach to the test or the benchmark or the high stakes standards test or practical career or college prep track. There is no test to measure the potential for creativity and wonder and beauty.

@тотпареньсэкрана,"How schools suppress creativity.   The theme of this topic is that children grow out of creative ideas, since after school they are unlikely to get a job in the specialty they want to choose, and if they do, it will most likely be unprofitable. And such advice may be well-intentioned, but they are bad. Children who enjoy creative activity are forced to study technical sciences only because it is profitable today. Don't do music, you won't be a musician, don't draw, it's not profitable, and so on everywhere. This was formed in the middle of the 19th century, when the industrial Revolution took place. Everyone needed engineers, but few needed artists, musicians and artists of this scale. And that's why the education system around the world is based on the fact that we give priority to mathematics, languages and only a small part of art and music. The second problem is that children are taught not to make mistakes, and this is good, but when a child is afraid to make mistakes, problems arise here. After all, someone who is not ready to make mistakes, is not able to create and think in an original way, he acts according to a template or as he is told. and that's exactly how we run companies, we don't forgive mistakes.",3년 전,1,

However, I just wanted to say one not-so-popular point: Psychiatry is not the ultimate enemy to creativity. With the example of Dancer Gillian Lynne, psychiatry may have inhibited her from finding the right environment and flourishing at the Royal Ballet dance school, but with many people psychiatry cultivates the ideal temperament,  sense of well-being, and stability necessary to flourish. You could easily make the (admittedly somewhat ridiculous) argument of requiring everyone to pursue dance school and then the Einsteins and mathematicians who need physics and numbers to flourish are the ones wit the problem. Conclusively, the point is not that ""psychiatry is bad"", it's that everyone bit of intelligence, just as Robinson said, requires diverse, dynamic, and distinct outlets and environments relative to each person's own uniqueness!",3년 전,2,

@valerian8999,"I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI in adulthood. If you looked in my school books, the margins were filled with doodles. All I ever wanted to do was draw. I was scolded by teachers repeatedly. Once, I was caught by the headmistress doodling, she was looking through the window of the door.

@Langkowski,"""Academic inflation"" is a good way to describe it. One of the main problems is that individual students don't get the required help they actually need, and many children that have one or more talents never discover what their talents really are.  I also strongly agree that intelligence is interactive. That's how you learn. Later, when you have accumulated enough knowledge and experience, you can use this in combination with your intelligence, but before that you need to learn through an active feedback system.",3년 전,45,

@carmelpule6954,"Sir Ken Robinson is very lucky because of his own imperfection and misgivings and he escaped the mentality of the "" Factory Schools"" or Factory school mentality. Here is how it went through history. 1. 10,000 years ago the parents educated their children by informing them how they can grow cabbages and farm and fish to have a shelter and earn a living. 2. Lazy people came about and they wanted to ride on the shoulders of other people as Criminals, Religions, Politics, Lawyers, Barristers and so many others including Kings and Queens Popes, and The Aristocrats.  and they all rode on the shoulders of the poor but projecting promises and delivering nothing. 3. There was an era where governance started to brew and Capitalists and Religions worked hand in hand including the Catholic Church members who enjoyed living like Kings and Queens. 4 The capitalists helped the Church and so a psychological social system was invented to exploit the poor people. In exchange for a Factory education and welfare and health scheme, the poor children were "" schooled"" to work for 16 hours and told to be tight-lipped, benevolent, honest, and obedient and all the spirit was taken out of them to prepare them for the workplace and to only do what is necessary and this narrowed the vastness of knowledge to what was required in the field and the factory and so the Capitalists and the CHurch could gain out of it. 5 Empires were built when the British sent their missionaries to other countries like Africa and India and Canada and Australia where the missionary went in with his own morals and beliefs and charity and totally destroyed the local culture the local people had including Christopher Columbus destroying the Red Indian culture and the British destroying the Aborigines.   and the British  Prussian Factory Education was aimed at healthy young children to fit the incoming industries that built the British Empire and the Belgian Empire under Leopold. The Church and the Capitalists worked together to mold the children into factory schools with small decks placed in one room with each student doing a task and even giving them homework to be ready by the next day and so the children became the product, and the teacher the chargehand and the inspector and the policeman, even using a stick to punish those children who went out of line with what was required to follow as in a prison system or a hospital where patients are told what to do or indeed the military where soldiers need to follow orders. 6. This only came about in 1750 when the Russian, British, German, and the US built their Factory school at religious schools and then at primary, secondary, and Community colleges and  ""Vocational training"" in a very narrow field just wide enough to permit the children to be used in a mass-production system where they had to have a narrow wishing of a  simple process without complexity. It was necessary to take the creation out of children so that they could keep a monotonous job on the field and on the factory floor working for the church and the capitalists. IN the church even marriage between nuns and priests was not allowed the issue is that being a virgin and being chaste will raise you a few meters higher than the factory workers. The workers were thus molded given low pay and made to work for 16 hours a day where being poor they thought this was heaven for them to have enough to eat,.Russia, Britain The US, and Europe all followed this molding of children and they all preached that their children were "" developed"" and those in Africa were still "" primitive"" as they did not fit in the factory philosophy of Russia and Britain, the US and Europe,  7 The women at home were drugged to join in the factory schools that men were sent to and with the demand for equality the women became narrow-minded and  were pumped up to work in factories and most women wanted to serve in the Board room at management levels rather than on the shop floor as men were drugged to do by Henry Ford and other Capitalists, Some of Henry Ford employees who realized how the bait and higher salaries got them hooked away from their families and so they were brave and went back to their own farms and were creative by doing their own necessities with their own minds with the help of their wives and their own children rather than be molded like sausages through a factory machines  8 At about 1960 Free education was offered but the capitalist then came in with private schools and private tertiary education so that the students are loaded with the educational fees that are now breaking their backs.  So the relation and sequence are very simple,  Being hungry and frightened, Religion came in with illusionary comforts, Then the Capitalists and Socialists came in with Profits and a promise of tangible engineered guaranteed comforts which people preferred, for this, the people did not mind becoming wage slaves where both the church and the capitalists and the bolsheviks and Carl Marks benefitted from the molding of children in factory schools.  Sir Ken Robinson due to his unfortunate condition was not regarded as being fit to join in and be molded in a factory school and he had time to think about what is happening around him. He may not realize but his own condition saved him and he is lucky. He does not seem to have understood how it all happened and is presting it with a beautiful sense of humor as he was not caught in it. But he did make his career in EDUCATION   and he did emigrate from England to the US preaching it his own way. The audience in front of him is being titillated into ecstasy by his jokes and delivery........... all because he is so clever and is offering a "" factory school "" education with a difference in that he is allowing the audience to think for themselves in pointing out the issues he mentioned,  But of course, if everybody goes around preaching and riding on the shoulders of their audience rather than working the fields and the farms and the fishing ground,  then that is not much different from what the Religions, Church, and Capitalist did in their "" Factory schools""   The TED talks are miniature factory schools with the audience being molded by the preacher but in this case, the talk is more of a placebo to make the people relax before they go our to work tomorrow.",3년 전,0,

When we grow up, we become frightened for being wrong and in the school system, mistakes are the worst thing you can make. But isn't school supposed to prepare us for the future? The knowledge we gain from school matters but creativity is still necessary. Students spend 18+ years in their lives taking tests, memorizing informations and spent hours finishing homeworks. However, true learning is born out of lasting understanding, not grades and tests. The informations we memorize fades by the time, but our creativity won’t. In school, even if you’re allowed to be creative, they put a lot of restrictions in it. Students are expected to follow methods instead of creating their own. For example, in Literature. Students are often given strict guidelines for writing things like poems. School makes us create poems that have precise rules for each individual line, making poetry seem very constricted and uncreative. School drains out creativity of oneself.That’s why school must focus on empowering students’ creativity.",3년 전,2,

Soon enough, you cannot even make the distinction between right and wrong. You start treating your opinions like facts, and your ignorance like knowledge, just to stick to the vicious cycle of denial.  This affects society at the deepest levels. Billions choose to double down on their mistakes, rather than admitting to them, everyday. They refuse to apologise to those they troubled or hurt, they drag on toxic relationships because they cannot accept they chose the wrong people, and they even vote the same people that already scr*wed them up.  I love this TED talk. I never tire of it. It remains extremely relevant. And Robinson is clear, concise, smart, and also very engaging and entertaining. Which is specially commendable, with such a huge and complex topic as education itself.  After all, our education is pretty much what makes us civilised in all senses of the word. Instead of just bald, feeble primates. It makes us mature, decent, cultured, etc. From the basic teachings at home, to the formal stuff in school.

However, when he mentions that 'the structure of education is shifting beneath our feet' and when he mentions that education serves work, he fails to get at the wider systemic implications.

@anegaute,"I want to comment, but find it difficult to word my thoughts properly. As a future educator, I do agree with a lot of what Robinson said. Schools are driven to be efficient, a common denominator in how to impart what is deemed important knowledge to as many people as possible in as streamlined a way as possible.     A process that in the worst case possible reduces people to a set of A4-organisms, a standard, rather than an individual.   However, how schools are driven that way, is only part of the problem. Other aspects are 1) our view of school and its purpose and institutional mandate, and 2) the politicians that decide educational policy.      My view of school has gone from an institution to just teach children, to an organ that is also meant to impart values - of hard work, criticial thinking, literacy and competence to participate, both as a worker and a member of community and democracy.      However, it is driven with a focus on results and numbers. Children are not primarily taught as members of society and democratic and community participanship, but as workers and participants in a market economy. They are taught in a way that they can give as much money and knowledge to industry as a worker, rather than a person/ and individual.  The way schools and curriculum works, is only part of the problem. To repeat, we as people - as parents, as citizens, and educators - also need to evaluate our own view of schools and its purpose and role, and the the driving policies we (complicitly) help enact.",3년 전,1,

The unspoken goal of education around the world is still to teach you the culture of your country, not to change it, but to have a common base with the others of your culture and therefore make it easier to live in your peer group. Even the formal education in the royal ballet is an example, there you train hours and hours the 5 positions of ballet. In China or India, you would train totally other movements.  This is even in the word itself, educare = guiding something out or away, not bringing you on the right track.

It’s not really a memory test - it’s more of a set of skills and tools that allow us to creatively problem-solve.   I see this video is 14 years old. I wonder whether over that time education has changed in the direction Sir Ken was recommending?  When I was a young man 40 years ago, I read Edward de Bono. He developed courses on how to think. And he emphasised the importance of making happiness your goal in life (“The Happiness Purpose”). I had great hopes for a revolution in education resulting from his work. But I don't think much has changed in 40 years.   On the subject of being WRONG - we are not taught the value of discovering our mistakes and learning from them. Some of the most important lessons we learn in life cone from the mistakes we have made.",3년 전,6,

And whilst there is a risk of that, the danger of the kind of stagnation in thinking we see all around us in education is far more dangerous.   Imagination and creative thinking are key in all areas.  Because whilst our knowledge is built on previous learning, it only expands when we ask 'what if?'.  We need more 'What if?' thinking and less 'Here's how'.  And we need schools to be the place children get to try all the things they can't do at home.",3년 전,0,

@lilasweet-waters3536,"My son, before the age of 2, had memorized the entire rhythm and nearly all the letters of the alphabet, and could pick up rhythm's and sounds of words to go with songs at the drop of a hat. But because he didn't always say these little interaction words with adults, and like to say single words when looking at picture books, there was worry over his language skills. He's 2 now and he's learning to sing amazing grace. Ages and stages questionnaires have been always been good, but because he is unique in ways there's a shadow of doubt I can perceive from his daycare workers. I even took the hints and proactively had him attend speech therapist who would visit daycare. The lady made an absolutely ridiculous report for for him, suggested I teach him things he already knew very well, and what was worse she sang old Mcdonald with him and passed on the msg to me to sing old Mcdonald with him... suddenly he hated the song. I pulled him out after only 2 sessions and I'm glad I did, my boy is a truly brilliant creature and I am more the wary this experience. Damn right education kills creativity, and teaches (as Howard Gardner says), a long knowledge base but superficial. We don't retain most of what we learn in schools, happened to me and I was and straight A B student.

@garyk.nedrow8302,"Schools do not kill creativity; they simply don't encourage it.  The same could be said of most businesses.  Institutions are created to serve the average  -- the average student in school, the average employee at work.  The creative individual is by definition exceptional, a round peg in a square hole.    The good news is that creative people are also highly intelligent and learn how to negotiate the maze, even with little encouragement or guidance.  Students with real abilities excel outside the walls of the school by entering writing, art, and scientific competitions on their own and demonstrating talents no school can teach.  Or by working after school.  Or by developing a small business.  It is probable that superior students would excel without formal schooling after age 14 or so.  Many famous men and women did.    Even today, the very best students are autodidacts who teach themselves skills and disciplines beyond the scope of the ordinary school.  What exceptionally talented children need more than teachers are mentors, people who already excel in the relevant field.  Michaelangelo, Da Vince, Andrew Carnegie, John Rockefeller had limited formal schooling, but did have worthy mentors.  Thanks to the teachers' union, there are very few teachers who excel at anything; they aren't qualified to be mentors.  Which suggests we should devise better ways of educating superior students and developing their special gifts.  Making them spend eight hours a day imprisoned in an institution is decidedly not the best way to do it.",4년 전,1,

I read roughly the same amount of book in those 2.5 weeks as I did over a 9 month school year.

@upiyinr8413,"Do schools kill creativity? | Sir Ken Robinson   Throughout the speech, Sir Ken Robinson mainly discusses that schools suppress children's creativity. Schools today tend to treat mistakes as an unforgivable fault, as we can see teachers who go furious when we choose the wrong answer by mistake. Mistakes don't precisely signify creativity, but most revolutionary advances have derived from creative ideas thought to be a 'mistake' in that society. As schools make children fear making mistakes, they grow up to lose the ability to create something inventive and ingenious. Moreover, this phenomenon is occurring throughout the whole world. Schools kill children's creativity not only by prohibiting mistakes but by underestimating subjects regarding creativity so as art and dance. The speaker claims that this phenomenon occurs throughout the whole world since most countries consider the ultimate goal of public education is training professors, which requires not creativity but logic. Likewise, creativity is underrated since it is not essential in industrialized society. What jobs require defines people's value. Artists and musicians make less money, so they are less needed. Following society's common demand of intelligence, university naturally changed into the job training center. The presenter strongly argues that this view on education should be viewed differently. For example, ADHD is defined as an attention disorder, yet if we change our attitude toward it, we can find that people with ADHD are talented in bodily activities such as dancing. In conclusion, the author asserts that humans' future depends on whether they adjust their new concept of the education system which can lead to the flourishing of humanity.  Even if the presentation was taken more than ten years ago, his idea is determined to be true. Also, the problem he mentioned is still not settled in Korea. What estimates people's value is the university and the specialty they majored in. Korea has not adapted to the fourth industrial revolution, concerned with computing technology that needs creativity. Exams in schools are taken not to give students motivation to study but to exclude them from success. Students in Korea are not ""studying"" but ""memorizing"" technical terms that they never understand. How could they make software and A.I.s though they have never created something new throughout their whole life? It is essential to reconsider the nature of the study.",4년 전,13,

Very little of the education system was assessed against the real world (ie jobs/human impact). Creativity isn't just knowing how to distract people from their lives, it is about knowing how to find solutions that no-one else has considered. You don't create a multi-billion dollar business by being able to do a lot of calculations in your head. You get there by creating a product that no-one has thought of yet everyone needs and hiring people with the technical abilities to make it.",4년 전,2,

@studyforsky,"SUMMARY The major subject : Education ruins children's creativity.  The first theme is human creativity, the second is creativity, that no one knows what will happen in the future or how it will come out, and the third is that everyone agrees that children have infinite talent. Will. The bottom line is that creativity should be treated as an important subject, such as reading and writing, and we all know that making mistakes right now is going to hurt life. But according to this person, mistakes are also creativity. And, in conclusion, it is explained that public education is to foster university professors. But it hasn't reached the peak of what a person can achieve, it's just a shape of life. In conclusion, the only hope for the future is to receive a new concept of the human ecosystem through which we can redefine the concept of the abundance of human capabilities. MY THOUGHTS This person's opinion: Since education spoils creativity, creative activities should be given importance.  I personally agree. If you make a mistake, your life will be ruined if you make mistakes. In this person's words, mistakes are creativity, because if they make mistakes, they fail, and if they use creativity, they fail. So, isn't it that people in our country don't have creativity? This evidence is already in the article. It ranks 11th among OECD countries (15 countries). Also, it seems that Korea learns less through such experiments or activities than other countries. That is why it is bound to conclude that it is natural that Korea cannot receive Nobel Prize winners or awards from the science and engineering field. In my opinion, what if I changed these tests to the experimental one? Then the children say, ""Well, shall we try this once?"" This is because the creativity will arise.",4년 전,0,

My passion is art. I have a talent for visual arts. But its not just talent, I practiced and drew constantly. Unfortunately, art is so underappreciated and the reason is obviously in this TED talk. School just want everyone to be the same. Isn't it ironic how many successful people were not successful in school? As ironic as it may seem, I don't see it as very ironic.

Standardized tests are the benchmark of education in my country and in many others. The natural curiosity and creativity of kids is stifled and they're not encouraged to think outside the box. This one size fits all formula has failed most students and the success of an education system is not that it prouduces a few gifted kids among thousands. It's that it sparks the interest of learning and facilitate it for everyone in a way that works uniquely for them so they all flourish. Thank you so much for this amazing talk.

It's very enlightening and it keeps your creativity ignited. Humanities should always be taught or at least integrated with any kind of education in any country.",5년 전,14,

@TheMikster95,"I heavily disagree with him altogether.  Yes schools should promote freedom of thought and even debates-I went to Jewish schools and my teachers always encouraged questions so we'd constantly be thinking.   Why are there intellectual competitions like science fairs? Or even simpler, spelling bees, and geography games? In 3rd grade we were given 1 hour each day to write whatever we wanted so we could be creative.   Every kid wants to be normal and accepted, and not special . In fact that is dangerous because it can make them feel better than others.  I was diagnosed with ADD at 5, I was held back in kindergarten and it was the best decision my parents made  I'm in college and still take medication and it's fine. It's not easy, but its possible, yet I'm the top student in my class not because I'm smarter but I push myself harder because I know I have to, but the result is gratifying.   It's way too extreme to say ""oh she likes dancing, she should go to a dance school!"" That is the exception, not the rule. Special Ed teachers exist for these issues. A school that can teach the basic subjects but finds ways to promote creativity is a good environment for children.",5년 전,1,

The teacher had the class stand in a line and as we all sang  he proceeded to lean into each individual pupil and listen closely to their singing. He went along the line tapping each child on the shoulder and passing judgement saying ""you sing"" or ""you don't sing"". He told me don't sing.   I'm 54 years of age now and that is the one lesson I remember from my time at that school.   I'm not shy and fairly confident in my myself but one thing I yearn to do but don't have the confidence.

@canoelicker,"Our education system is terrible, our education system is made to make factory workers during the industial revolution in the late 1800s. Its not made to create creative minds. And sure, we have altered it slightly in the last 200 years or so, but we do not encourage children to focus and flourish at the things they're good at. We teach them to focuse their time, effort, and money on things they may never use, on things they will forget by the end of the class, and on things that will get them a job at McDonald's. Things that they are not good at, and yeah, we have to teach kids calculus, but if someone is amazing at Art and let's say they were the best painter you've ever seen, and you ask the what they learn in school, they will almost always say math, or PE or science. Look at Finlands education system, right after reading this just search it up, youll get what im talking about. God i wish i could move to Finland.... If we taught children to improve on the things that they are great at and done things that they love doing they will find a natural passion and ability to succeed and improve.

@anahitharutyunyan5754,"The speech was interesting not only for the people who work or study in the education sphere but also for the authorities who have the power to change something, because the speaker addresses some inner issues of the system and mainly concentrates on how schools can kill the creativity in kids. To support his idea Ken Robinson brings an example of a girl who was written off by the school because of her inability to sit still and concentrate. Later thanks to the girl’s doctor it turned out that the girl is just talented with a unique sense of music and love to dance. That girl, Gillian Lynne, than became a very famous ballet dancer and choreographer whereas her school had all but written her off, mistaking her extraordinary talent for some form of behavioral problem or cognitive impairment. Maybe the school could argue that the girl isn’t following the discipline and concentrating and sitting still is mandatory in class not to distract others, but their approach of writing them off is not right for me. I think this kind of issues arise because the definition and demonstration of creativity is very different for all individuals. However, dear teachers please don’t consider kids with odd behavior “outsiders” because after all if the majority follows a specific behavioral pattern it doesn’t mean that the one with some unique manifestations is “wrong”.",5년 전,0,

@schoe5388,"One real easy way to solve the school problem is to hire more extremely qualified teachers and divide the classes into smaller classes with similar interests and abilities. Then even larger classes can be handled. The principal difficulty is really that the students are just forced onto the teachers who may not be qualified to handle these students in the right way. I know that these are extremely sensitive political issues that the high lords of education cannot even bring up to the population. But the teachers are also hostage to these limitations. So the only alternative is to have very small classes with very well-trained teachers paid very well as in Finland and adapt to each individual student in the classes. Of course, every individual deserved to be educated like that no matter what the circumstances are. And this is exactly what Jesus as a teacher practiced. (And his students include Peter, Paul, and so on who are the foundations of our civilization, the West and some parts of the East.  I would think that if he became a teacher today, his students would rival his former students also. Of course, this will be what the head of the current civilization would dread the most as Herod the Great did. Anyway, but we do live in a Fallen World as COVID-19 shows)",5년 전,0,

Schools doesn't kill creativity, in fact the environment that you live within is the one who kills it. I mean to be creative you have to start with the base within your home, and to be trained in a certain way of thinking by your own parents first. If you want to discover your talents and creativity you must be noticed, monitored by others in your environment, and encouraged to enhance that specific talent that you have, and when you come to school, school works as a complementary part in your progress. But what people want is to put their kids in schools,they don't ask about their levels, they don't follow up with them at home, they don't give them tasks that focuses on their talents, and they put their children in school expecting them to be graduated as geniuses. When ever there is something  goes wrong they will blame and mock educators, while they don't realize that teachers deal with classes full and stuffed with students, some classes have more than 25 or 30 student. Tell me how can you extract the talent and creativity from each one of them? should you teach  ? or give activities? or control the class? or search for each one's talent?? I think before putting the right on some one, we have to be fair enough to study where the problem lays.  Governments doesn't want to open enough schools, Schools' owners are mostly greedy people who wants to have money without giving back extra quality and resources. Teachers are just a nail in this system who do all the work by their own, and tolerate extra budget just to teach students properly, they get the least pay in community and yet everyone mock them and blame them to be the reason of the system failure.",5년 전,2,

@ИмяФамилия-я5ь6г,"Очень интересное выступление. Заставляет задуматься. Не могу не согласиться с тем, что школы способны отбить желание создавать что-то новое. Я выпускница гимназии 2016 года и могу сказать, что мне невероятно повезло с преподавательским составом, с директором. Я попала в ту атмосферу, где ошибиться было не так страшно, где были условия к развитию и становлению меня как личности. А после окончания, я попала в институт культуры. И каково же было мое разочарование, когда оказалось, что там никаких условий к развитию нет, увы, что я буду бояться педагогов и определенных предметов (как такое возможно? Очень просто. Что бы ты ни делал, все будет НЕ ТАК). Каково было и мое удивление, когда практически все одногруппники рассказывали об ужасах обучения в своих школах, о травле как со стороны учеников, так и со стороны педагогов. Теперь я понимаю, что боязнь ошибок - одно из самых неприятных последствий обучения в типичной школе России. Если же вам повезло со школой, не переживайте, ВУЗ может восполнить это сполна. И сейчас я жалею только об одном. Что когда-то придавала значение такому ""обучению"" в институте, а по факту уничтожению меня, моей внутренней гармонии и желания творить, унижению. Я никогда не была отстающей, но была подавленной. Не видела смысла в таком прожигании жизни.

Maths are useful for many career paths, which of course means it is necessary to teach. But, not to everyone. Not everyone will use their knowledge of math in the future.

@josephdoyle5590,"Everything is controlled by the financial system...they control everything and this is not me spouting off conspiracy nonsense it is a fact. We have the 28th President of the United States to thank for getting it to the point it is today. He agreed to allow the creation of the Federal reserve, which is nothing more than a bank that prints money off and ensures every dollar that comes out of it is done so at a cost to the USA government and thus the people via interest, if the Bankers would ensure he was elected...guess what he got elected...I question why are people so happy to go along with the farce they are living - for the vast majority of people are nothing but slaves for the banks. The education system is built in support of that as well. Why aren't we teaching people how to be happy in our schools? Instead from day one the schools program people to live a scam enriching the banks and other corporations. Massive student loans, then oh wait you need that 5 thousand square foot home...with many rooms you never use, and oh yes you need that fancy vehicle which gets poor gas mileage and takes most people what 6 years to pay off....lmao. People use credit with interest to act like they are rich...when they are actually poor. I do not care if you have a million dollar home..and a vehicle that cost over 100 grand....if you cannot pay cash - it means you cannot afford it so you are paying high interest rates so you can play rich. The current education systems does kill creativity and it also destroys the quality of life for many people as well by conditioning them to believe they should live a certain way which is all enslavement to the financial system and greedy corporations. This world will become a much better place when the financial system as we know it today is completely restructured - and it must start by completely restructuring our education system for the youth in the restructured system will grow up and generate the required changes.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@cameronn2771,"Truth is, school has us learn how to read, write, do math, and learn information that's been passed down to us generation after generation when in reality, one of the most important subjects has been completely ignored: Ourselves. By ourselves, I mean topics such as: What makes us unique, what is our strengths and talents and how could they be translated into something that can benefit the individual and community, how do we find out what we want to do when we grow up, etc. It is no coincidence why many graduating high schoolers have no clue on what career they want to do or even what they want to major in. If anything, the reason for this is more simple than we make it out to be: They're too busy and used to the routine of getting up and getting to class on time then go home and do homework and rinse and repeat. Unfortunately, this has contributed to the student loan crisis with many kids going to college cause they've all been told that it is necessary for success and then end up changing majors and delaying graduation or choosing majors for the sake of having a major.",5년 전(수정됨),2,

It kills creativity to create a sense of normalcy, as not everything in life will be made just to fit you. I do see where this man’s views lay, but I see nothing wrong with how education is as of now. Standardizing what our generation should know makes sense, after all, it’s just “a college entrance exam”. You don’t NEED to great in school if you plan on pursuing other careers.

@Selahsmum,"My only problem with this is that there is a reality of the way the world works, and I think that while we want to encourage kids in their gifts and abilities, we also have to help them understand that if what they are really passionate about (eg dance) is not something they can end up making a living at, that that's OK, too.  That its ok to pursue something even if it doesnt make you money (eg if you can't be the leader of the Royal Ballet), and that its also OK to gain a set of skills that might be somehow adjacent to your love (eg teaching dance at a local school or being a physical therapist, etc) that will also allow you to make a living.  Because while I want my kids to pursue their dreams (I homeschool!) I also want them to not feel broke and like they have a set of unemployable skills.  So, I think there has to be a middle ground.  But TOTALLY agreed on the flaws in public school and secondary ed and that's why I homeschool!",5년 전,0,

My stories met all of the criteria for the essay assignments, but the professor failed me on the spot simply because they don't accept fictional pieces.

@DigitalEelRich,"Education always lags--but a) the old knowledge and origins of things are fruitful references, and b) the higher the grade level and beyond, the lag closes and is eventually superseded. Saying creativity should be as important as literacy is not an insight. It is obvious. It is already treated that way. Indeed creativity emerges before literacy, and literacy depends on creativity to be there. They are, as most of these things are, intertwined. Dance was always a part of school (gym class, school social activities, afterschool instruction, etc.) until former president Reagan began the steady defunding of public education (30% during his two terms), the process that has all but eliminated the humanities from public schools today. It is still true that you will have a better lifestyle if you are educated beyond high school, even considering modern costs and student loans. Better education costs. It means realigning priorities. It means MONEY. Our tax money. More of it than ever before (as when Sputnik spurred education spending) needs to go to public schools NOW or they will disappear. It seems impossible but yikes, wake up! I know teachers who are already looking for new careers. Unless you want to go with homeschooling, charter ""for money"" schools, and the like. Unless you want to hang out with folks who treat most expressions of creativity as sinful and evil. Well, knock yourselves out, but that's when creativity will truly die. There are realities to face.

They also teach us to forget our dreams, simply because they’re unrealistic goals. There are so many people with a college diploma, they have a full time job and they have a decent salary. But how many of them live a happy life?  School should definitely teach us maths, science, history and all those subjects, but it should also teach us how to use or find our talents. Everybody has a talent. Lots of people say ‘school is a place where you develop your talents.’ WRONG! I’m a musician, and I learnt so much about producing music without school. How? I tried things and I discovered things. I met with people who are like-minded and they taught me how certain things work.   I know, we cannot give extra music, dance, art, acting lesson on schools (luckily there are schools for those things). But at least teachers should teach us that anything is possible and that we should stay curious.   The time we spent in a single school day is huge.

U get a deadline when to pass the exam at school to eliminate cheating etc. U have more time for yourself, there would be less ""depressed people"", less drug use by students as they wont get talked into it, less school shooting happening and there would be a lot more creativity in people, because school kills students creativity. And the teachers should have an option to see stats of students by name if they are struggling to understand a video, for example the student has replayed the video 10 times. The teacher can text the student personally to see if they need any help. The students can have waaaay more time to be kids or teenagers, or can do a 8 hour student job that would help the economy. and school would be fun af as u can only do the fun classes, and ur not obligated to go to school either, only for the exams, u can take sport classes or art etc meeting people like ur self. Or tell the school im not interested in the ""fun"" classes school has to offer but id rather want to help the economy but i always wanted to work at the farm and see how farmers plant a seed or how to crop and u would still be able to take the test at the end of the month. There are so many possibilities. i swear its a dream to have a system like that Smart Learning were still learning the old boring way, thats not efficient at all, wake up early sit in class for 8 hours, every fucking week for so many years that even the teachers aren't putting any effort in any more.

But to do something like this to one very young in change them from left to right. The brain then preservers everything backwards and it also has to be retrained. Back in the 1950 teachers destroyed thousands of children creativy and damaged them for life. And there ability to learn. If you are a teacher and have done something like this. And if you are right handed let me cut it off and see how you adapt. But it would be better if you are very young and your brain is just starting to learn and develop.,6년 전,1,

@KlLLERROBOT99,"Schools definitely try to force kids, who will be the next generation, into thinking and doing how they want them to.   Require them to learn what they want them to learn and teach with a force of making them learn and be correct. But if they try to be creative or try and get it wrong the school thinks two things: 1. They aren’t trying or don’t care about learning. 2. They aren’t trying hard enough, so they are wrong.  I failed certain classes in school, like Languages, Literature, etc... and I was told “If you don’t try hard enough, you won’t get anywhere in life.”, which is a terrible thing to say to someone who is “learning what they want to do”.   I wanted to be an Engineer but my school system told me it would be impossible if I don’t learn what they said I needed to learn. So I changed my wanted career probably 5 times. Eventually in HS, I said “I’m going to join the military.” and guess what the system said? “You will just be wasting your life.”  Well fast forward again, I did join the military. I served for 4 1/2 years, until sadly I lost my leg. Well I went to college for a few years after my recovery, got some certificates and now Fast Forwards to now. I’m 32 and own a company that has been going solidly for years.

@subsonic9854,"A strange and largely pointless talk. Being creative is nice but most of us arent creative or dont care. Finding your niche is nice too, but you cant guarantee you will find it soon or ever.   Random rebuttals:   Primary and secondary education exist to give us all a common context. If kids cant read, write, do arithmetic, or dont know the important moments in history or how government works, they will create a poor society of people who cant communicate or interact with each other properly.  At the optional tertiary level, you can get a liberal arts degree for a fairly holistic education or a technical education if you are more practical-minded. Neither path necessarily leads to merely being a university professor. The professorial path is usually for those who want to give back after a successful career, those doing research, and those professional students too afraid to ever leave school.  There isnt a society on earth or in history that has demonstrated a widespread aptitude for being creative. While the speaker admitted that kids being wrong isnt the same as being creative, he nevertheless failed to give an example of kids being genuinely creative rather than being wrong. Adorably wrong, yes, but wrong nonetheless. Again, basic education exists to put us all on the same page or context. Kids dont know anything so you must constantly teach them what is real or imaginary, right or wrong, cheap or expensive, etc. And like pet dogs, children constantly yearn to learn these things.   As for the dancer he spoke of-totally irrelevant to creativity, but anyway... she was clearly an exceptional case, like steve jobs or bill gates or einstein or any other genius who didnt make waves in academics but blew their niche out of the water. How many parents joining the standing ovation would be happy if their kids dropped out of college to start a dumb business or try to make it in pro sports? What if the dancer had suffered a career ending injury? On the other hand, nothing short of brain trauma will ever take away your education.  The opening and most nonsensical claim: we dont know what the world will be like in 5 years.  Well... obviously? Hardly a new issue. We do the best we can and work within our limitations. This would only be a problem if you didnt teach your students critical thinking, which is actually possible, unlike teaching creativity.  And yea, he totally ignored physical education, so it will continue to be neglected and underdeveloped, so adults will continue to not know how to stand or sit or pick things up properly, how to swim, run, jump, defend themselves if bullied, fall without injury, strengthen their core muscles, etc etc. Never mind that such education would he more effective than medication at lowring incidences of lifestyle diseases and overuse injuries.  Stop kidding yourselves. Education doesnt need a new paradigm or new methods. It just needs a revised and updated curriculum. Few people need more creativity. Nor do we all need to follow some grandiose dream or discover some innate talent. Just perfect what is already in the system.",6년 전,0,

In my school in Italy (scientific high school) we can express ourselves, sometimes. for istance we have religion classes ( i d k if that's the same in your country.. ) where we can give our opinions regarding a tale or a short story our teacher presents to us. It's fun, they are stupid sometimes, but it's a thing. Also sometimes we are asked to make some powerpoints, where you can adjust font, colours, images. It doesnt happen at any time, of course. The true moment of creativity really comes during the open day: some make some experiments, some prepare some cardboards, others are asked to prepare some sort of presentation. It happened once that a student was actually singing in one of the rooms with other students, dont ask why. We have lots of projects at our school, because we have to collect some credits, that will be useful for the final exam. To collect those, you have to participate to one of the projects, or to an extra activity (a sport, at a high level.. generally). For example this year I' ve participated to the singing project and it was fun! From your description, it s all dark and blue, and tremendously melancholic....

But now that you are telling me those facts about the uk, which i thought it was one of the best countries... maybe i should change immediately my mind and start appreciating Italy. I mean in my school I can express myself, just like anyone else... i must say tho that sometimes school is felt more as an eternal competition among students, to get the higher scores, marks.. and so on.. I am one of those, but that's what I want, I want to get more knowledge, and even if school doesnt always satisfy my expectetions, that's not even an issue: if i dont get it at school, im gaining it from books, from videos.   In my country, school is pretty welcoming towards anybody, (at the entrance of my high school there s even a sign: ""Nobody is excluded"") which sometimes reflects upon the level of education. I study the hardest i can.. realizing that i could probably get the exact same marks, by studying the half.. but things will certainly change at university.. so I prefer studying hard now and then feel a minor pressure at university.   What i want to say is that sometimes school is not enough for me... but at least creativity is not a utopia. Teachers are strict sometimes, yes, but lessons can also be more easy-going..? Teachers tell us some fun facts about their lives, even my strictest teacher. Of course we have then those who can only think about completing the program of all the topics needed, which then ruins partially the fun side and the spontaneous contact with students. Our english teacher is always joking... but again assimilating knowledge with him ends up being pretty difficult.  At that point, we have the opposite issue that you have in Uk:   >creativity.. fine >Competence... uhm >Level of knowledge gained.. uhm.

And indeed I ve always wondered about attending university in the uk or in the usa, but at this point.. maybe I should rather stay here.

The windsor family literally are stealing money from their own people, without even working! "" And now you are telling me that you wish it all disappeared!

@df6148,"FlyingMonkies325 The war on 2 fronts is probably the hardest war for a student.  I’ve seen good kids fall into gangs because their brothers, cousins and friends did it.  Bright bright individuals sitting in jail.  This is where parenting is SUPPOSED to come in.  But not everyone has good parents or even 2 parents.  So the teachers are now having to ALSO fight a war on 2 fronts.  How do we teach kids basic life skills, like respect, AND keep them focused on the actual course content? Well that takes a very special teacher with a big heart and they DO exist but are very rare or tied down to a curriculum.  See those teachers get paid hourly.  The school justifies their existence to its governing board by positive test scores.  If a school shows its passing more students it will receive more prestige and be easier to market towards parents and private investors.  What does this do? It means test scores become the driving force.  And that lovely teacher that we’re waiting for is now forced to TEACH in such a way that test scores are the main objective.  This means that they get handcuffed in how they approach their lesson plans.  They get boxed in.  Combine that with a student who’s fighting 2 wars and you have a disaster.  What needs to happen is schools need to hire more teachers and Classrooms need to be smaller so that students can be more engaged.  In the USA students are “Forced” to go to school.  But in 3rd world countries students are wishing to go to school.  On top of all that, society idolizes the thugs, gangstas, pimps, playas and sexy.  So these people set the bar for student expectations.  They make it appealing and before you know it the student is fighting 2 wars again.  Think about this:  A guy gets out of prison and he’s respected.  A guy gets his degree and he’s a square.  At least in the eye of the streets.  Not in other areas though.  So in the streets we have bad leadership, bad parenting, lack of role models and so many other things a student has to climb out of.  It is no wonder kids turn to slanging dope and gangs.  How do we stop this? Well a good start to your garden is by changing the soil.  Make sure that you get yourself in the right state of mind.  I used to look up to guys like Tupac, Eminem, Bone Thugs n Harmony, E-40, etc... and so now I realize those guys actually offered nothing to me.  They made a profit singing and rapping about change but also told you how to be a gangsta.  Like you said 2 Wars.  How can they claim to fight for one side of the war if they are supplying ammunition for the other?  Pac was a poet in street justice but a gangsta on his next track.

Though it feels we’ve been duped...it isn’t over just yet.  We’re here alive in the present.  And we have a lot to look forward too.  You ever wonder why they use so much cow crap (“bs”) as fertilizer?  Its because some of the best plants have to be planted there for others to be fed when it grows into a tree.  I’m really salty about the education system myself.  I feel like it rewards mindless following and punishes the critical thinkers.  But maybe thats why so many of our difference makers and inventors were college drop outs? A degree defines neither of us.  The WW2 gen was a different time.  Fields were growing, industries were just getting started.  Today? Industries are peaking and efficiency is what companies look for.  Back then a degree guaranteed you a job.  Today? Experience coupled with PRACTICAL knowledge will land you the job. But we were always told that degrees 100% earned the job.  To an extent it shows you know how to achieve and follow instructions.  And to be quite honest that is where it is.  Schools create employees.  What your on right now doesn’t fit because you are more of an entrepreneur type.  Ever been in a room and everyone is trying to solve a problem that you already know the answer to but NOBODY wants to listen? And it is just so obvious to you? its because you recognize a pattern others don’t.  So...the school system isn’t suited for everyone.  It makes great employees and sometimes those students branch out and become business-owners themselves.  Who do you think knows business more? The guy with the PHD in business economics or the guy who ACTUALLY has a business running in the Fortune 500.  Now, people in rich backgrounds can go to school with this mindset already.  THEY use school as an actual educational platform to improve their business skills when they get there.  But many people go to school to fulfill xyz requirements expecting abc results.  If your an ocean fish in a freshwater like you’ll see ALL the things wrong with it.  Scientists of old PRACTICED science to become scientists.  Today we have laws that bar anyone from PRACTICING medicine until they get their certification.  But the art of just practicing it is lost.  What I am saying is that before you even become a doctor, you have to already see yourself that way.  So whatever it is that you want to do, don’t wait for the school system to tell you what you know, start learning it now and prove em wrong.  Don’t let the ED system tell you what you know on paper.

Some people experienced bad parenting and copy it because that’s what they figured worked for them.  Regardless, whenever people don’t see your point of view or show affection...that’s when you can go into a dark place.   A lonely void of depression.  You can’t really let yourself go there because if you stare at the dark parts of life all the time, you’ll miss out on the light.  So...try not to let the past dictate your future.  I wish I could say just let it go because it sounds really easy.  But it isn’t.  Just, keep going forward is all I can say from one stranger to another.  Don’t even look back and when you feel yourself looking backwards stop and look forward.  Look up.

@chiaraincani8366,"@Nightingale is it ignorant the fact of never giving up or is it more ignorant to just accept everything as it is? If women had accepted the reality, nowadays they will not have had their rights, if black people had accepted the reality as it was, theh would not have had their rights. George orwell in its bestseller ""Animal Farm"" talks about animals constructing their unique farm, against humans. It turns out that pigs take over... issuing a form of dictatorship. Do you know how? They basically continued restrincting the freedom of other animals. Originally there was absolute freedom and democracy, but soon thereafter pigs started saying that they were the only one that could sleep for more hours and study more, for the ""wealth"" of the farm et cetera. At the the end pigs become the ""new humans"". and you know why? The shift was so slight and precise that the other animals would just agree on everything, they would just accepting reality as it is. You know what it reminds me of? It reminds of Nazism, Fascism, Stalinism, it reminda of North Korea. It reminds me of Robespierre, Oliver Cromwell. You know? Also at the time of Oliver Cromwell people would just agree of evrything. Abnormal things became more and more accepted, at such a point that there WAS NO FREEDOM, no possibility of having entertainment.    Your point of view conducts to a passive behaviour, where evreything seems normal. It is not. And accepting reality as it is, is not acceptible. I do creative things every single day of my life, i laugh, i draw, i write articles, poems, short texts. And this is my way of not becoming a passive slave of our school. If we all feel frustrated by school we should all do something for ourselves to prevent a society where there is no thought, where the is no freedom. You can do the change, you can do the change, by reading, by thinking, by writing, by taking up your favourite sport. School is not right to produce creativity? Fine you can do it by yourself, you cant give up! Internet is a whole world, plenty of information. We are the heads of our lives, not the others, not school. You are, I am. All things said, i cant accept to be called ignorant. People accepting reality as it is are ignorant. I know that school is not right to develop my creativity. I do by myself.  By the way, actually, from my point of view, school is not even that bad. Teachers are good, they talk to us, we laugh sometimes... they are normal people i mean. Thah make us participate to lots of projests. They give us the possib ility to meet writers, scientists. Righta now im preparing a text about the pandemic, which was requested by our teachers. We have the possibility to say ANYTHING we want to say, as long as it is linked to the pandemic. You know how many authors, writers, tv series, films, books can be considered. Thousands ans thousansd. My country is just fine, i know there are some deficiencies but i know how to do it by myself. Thats it, im not ignorant. Thanks",4년 전(수정됨),0,

The Documentary ""Most likely to Succeed"" does a FANTASTIC job bringing full ART to learning !They learned more in 1 semester than I did in college <3  Love it so much! Esp as a teacher! The problem remains EVERYONE is still stuck thinking the OLD model worked , even SAT  (well I did it, I hated it, stress and didn't make sense adn you NEVER have to take a test like that...so now my child can do the same without complaint cuz....payback or ""just the way things are""????)) .          The art way, you actually LEARN and APPLY and INTERSECT different school subjects just to complete the final project. It's brilliant the things students and teachers are teaching each other!!! BUT even students these days ( who havent seen this video or TedTalk yet) assume the SAT will better prepare them for life ( life isn't taking a multiple choice test but actually LEARNING HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS ), so they're refusing real education just to past a test. So Disheartening. THEIR PARENTS also agree! (what?!) Doesn't matter if teachers actually want to actually teach. Meanwhile, the reason teacher walk outs happened a lot nationwide last year is because the system hasn't changed in 100 years since it's invention by 10 white, old, males that based the school system off factory workers in England at the start of factory line work. This outdated system we STILL use in the 20th century doesn't even the pay a liveable wage!! 60% of Teachers have to find a 2nd or 3rd job, 50-58% say they are unhappy or mentally stresses,  people disrespect or put too much strain on teachers ( cuz parents don't want to parent the kid and assume teachers should just do it) (everyone's had a teacher but not everyone's been a teacher so it's assumed ""easy"" so they put MORE work on teachers to ""teach more""...that's not the issue. It retaining it!) and what you get it is extreme burn out of teachers who don't have fun or passion teaching anymore because they're just trying to survive and they may have short tempers or lack the same enthuasim they had when they wanted to make a difference. Most teachers feel they can't with the system today :( Very Sad!  Lets put less stress on teachers AND students so we can both teach and learn to the BEST of our ability. Cuz you're right. 12 years is TOO LONG, but this video slowly made a teacher out of me in those years so I can attempt to change it  where I can in my classroom...but it's going to take everyone, not just parents, students, teachers, or administration. It takes EVERYONE.

I don't have time to exercise or have fun with friends. I lost creativity because of school in fact, I'm more creative on games. If School causes depression because of bullies and stress, then why haven't we gotten rid of it? I used to get bullied at school and I hated it. But were missing another thing, what about sleep? Teenagers are supposed to get 8- 10 hours of sleep per day but most of the time teens don't get that. I cannot go to sleep at 9 pm without waking up through the night. What about family time? Only 2 days? Since teachers assign pages of homework, we have loss time to spend with our family and our pets. The fact that we only get 2 days off from school, and teachers assign us homework over the weekend is just crap. Presentations? Don't get me started on those, no one realizes but we present all the time. We present when we talk to friends and when teachers pressure us with a 10 minute speech in front of 200 kids then you get so stressed and worried. Life? Does school really teach us how to live? No, it doesn't after you graduate High school you don't know what to do. Not everyone can afford college and not everyone wants to go to college. After you graduate high school your basically stuck you gotta try to find the perfect job look for a house. Some schools don't do extra classes like cooking sewing so then you don't know how to do that either. School is one of the main reasons why most kids are depressed and stressed.

During the time period of the 13th through the 18th centuries schools taught a course of religious based dogma and suppressed creative thought, requiring the word by word copying of ""sacred"" texts. Deviation often came at the cost of lives, but still the creativity and explosion of knowledge that occurred during periods in this era are for lack of other words, astounding.    It is easy to point an accusing finger at someone that another wants you to do exactly that, but you do so based on your own ignorance and at the agenda of someone else   When I was a child, if I did something wrong at school, I additionally had to answer for it at home. Now, the first thing that comes to current parents minds is to take the teacher to task. We have bad teachers now and we had them then, I can give you names, but it was more important that we learned the way to learn and not have data handed to us.

Lots of jokes... no content whatsoever.  i guess the content starts at 9:03.  now for a comment on his actual content: educational inflation only exists because we value intelligence the same way we value each other and the world... as commodities. so long as value is defined only by supply and demand, instead of  creating an effect or cause, this will never change. it's the difference between basing a price of an item on how much you can bargain vs. how much it actually cost to make, and how much you need it. It's true value vs. it's mythical value. bargaining is a mythical human creation that has nothing to do with value, but rather power of coercing. it's to convince others that you deserve more and they deserve less whether it's true or not. this shouldn't apply to anything, never mind learning, education, and value.

@subliminalreviewer5657,"Here’s how schools ended my creativity. Growing up too maybeeee 6th grade, I doodled on EVERYTHING  My papers would be full of flowers and leaves and eyeballs and it would just be a hot mess, but I still paid attention. Doodling was the only way I could pay attention. If I didn’t move my hand around with a pen on a paper then I just couldn’t process anything. It was like I heard what they were saying and then a second later, I forget it all. My fourth grade teacher was the only one who understood. She would show my work to my parents at meetings and they would ask why she allows me to draw so much on my paper and she said that she would always let me draw as long as I continued to have all As. She said she noticed that I would be a lot more productive whenever we had a language arts lesson because I always had a pen and paper. Come 6th grade. My teachers started criticizing me. They said I would not make it through college with such messes on my papers, and they said my notes look like trash heaps. I had cut down a lot on drawing, and so did my grades. I dismissed my grades as just not being prepared for middle school, and then 7th grade came. I had picked up drawing again. But the criticism was far worse. My math teacher would yell at me whenever I drew because she thought I wasn’t paying attention and that I was trying to impress her. My social studies teacher would give me odd looks whenever we had paper checks, and my science teacher would scowl at me when she saw the condition of my warm up sheets. At that point, I thought there was a problem with me. I thought I had some kind of disease or problem with my head. I forced myself to just stop. Come second semester, my grades dropped tremendously and my teachers are noticing my rapid change in mood throughout their classes. I lost the skill I once had with a pen or a pencil and at that point I thought it was unrecoverable. I tested my creativity and told myself to figure out something to draw and 5 minutes later, I cried. I was so dull. All I could think of to draw was plus signs and glass chemistry bottles.",6년 전,3,

Even art and craft classes these days teach how to make one finished object, one way, with a kit provided to only make that thing.  Most of these craft and art classes aren't teaching technique and encouraging creativity. Why? It takes more time for an amateur who isn't usually called on to be creative to come up with an idea; even with hints and suggestions from the teacher. That's been my experience.",6년 전,0,

Enable creativity, engaging in projects of interest, shorten the school day to a good duration, making school a place of freedom and inspiration, collaboration and purpose. This  outdated school system is driving out the natural curiosity and problem-solving skills we’re born with, replacing it with rule-following, fragmented time, and disillusionment. Therefore I'm reading dozens of books on the school system and on education and I go through these YouTube videos helping me with good material, so if you'd like to join me, so we can share our ideas and together make a change I invite you to join our group on WhatsApp!

I am a victim of school because I couldn´t play a musical  instrument, I couldn´t dance or being so much creative and I had always the need to speak into the class. Sports and religion were my favourite subjects. The whole morning sitting in school was so tiring and at the end of class, very often at 1PM, I was so hungry that I couldn´t await to come home. Gladly my dear mother was there and she had cooked mostly a wonderful meal for me, my brother and sister… but now I am 56 years old and gladly I have a  pretty young spirit still with flaws in my head. ...these month I am about planning a creative private school...with many different workshops. My partner and I (a nice Chinese Lady) who I lent 1 cent at a bakery counter (where we have known each other) like to realize this very needed institution in this time... You will ask me what is my incentive? who has triggered it? These are the glittering eyes of youngsters, the appreciation of them and the whole fun that will bring the present in a circle of individual humans without any assessment of the performance...Creating a platform where youngsters can find out their potential and values with fun, pleasure and the goodwill and help of everybody around…Also, finally I will be able to unfold my own desires of creativity…slogan is: learning is fun - live to the fullest desire in the present  My kindest regards to you and a big thank you for your further inspirations in your video - Silvie",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Do you like pictures? make sure it has those.  Is it too wordy? pick another one.  It seems oldschool but finding a well written book is like having a one on one conversation with a person from the past or present.  Stay away from books that seem too fluffy with words.  Usually they are aimed at industry professionals OR they are simply writing the book to boost their own ego.  Download samples on kindle or check out books for yourself at libraries or bookstores.  Videos help a lot too but try to get a credible source.  At the end of the day, production is what matters.  Educational degrees just show you went through a curriculum.  It shows your trainable.  But if you could learn, create working examples in a portfolio that demonstrate your knowledge, pick up some minor certifications online through free courses just to have some basic stuff.  You could be good.  Another tip is to Audit a course online.  Auditing means you WONT receive credit but any class like this is usually free.  It allows you to scout the class, take your time with it and not worry about being graded on homework (you don’t need to do hw).  Your just an observer.  And this lets you soak in the information AND also decide if you want to go premium and retake it this time for the cert and with the hw.

I do think that i'm just as smart or even smarter than the average person even without school. In fact i agree with Eddy Zhong about that school makes children less intelligent because no matter what school doesn't allow you to be creative. Don't get me wrong school is still important but only before you hit the age when you move out of elementary school and proceed to upper secondary.

@agcla,"These are a lot of disjointed thoughts, and a lot of them are good. I don't think education puts mathematics and science at the top of any hierarchy, nor do I think the primary aim of education is to produce professors? Public education teaches people how to be efficient, non-curious cogs in a hierarchical machine that is beholden to the irrational moods of the market, and of course the most privileged subset of students go on to be the people at the top - businessmen, philanthropists (ugh), policy wonks, and yes, professional academics too.   There is no way to revolutionize education in a vacuum though. Education is the way that it is for a reason, and the fact that some abilities are stigmatized and others are fetishized is not down to some kind of flawed logic at all; it is perfectly consistent with the way that our societies are organized.   That is where the problem lies. And a lot of people who have 'made it' under the status quo, who are otherwise intelligent and well-intentioned, are willing to turn a blind eye to that fact because it might threaten their status and the comfortable little bubble they've made for themselves. And that's one of the hardest things to see.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@LEKProductions,"This happened to me as a child in the '80s, I always finished my classwork early, then held back while the slower kids in the class caught up. I had a burning interest in electronics, and I was so excited when it was announced that we would be doing an electronics module within our science class - it turned out I knew more than the teacher, as he was simply reading verbatim from a textbook, without any understanding of how it actually worked, which I tried to explain to him after he was passing off conjecture as fact to the other students, he hated me for this and I was removed from the class. Eventually at 14 years, I started to truant school in order to study in the local library due to my love of technical learning, telling the librarian I was on study leave (here in the UK, you get study leave time to revise your exams, or at least you used to in the '80s), I studied books on computer programming and electronics and filled my brain with so much knowledge of the technical interests I had. However, when the careers officer interviewed me before I left school, they steered me away from the electronics I was passionate about, telling me it would be ""very boring work"", and tried to interest me in office work.

I did my dissertation based off this video and reflected on my experiences when i was a child in education. now i am studying to become a teacher and since i've started I have realised that this video is UTTER UTTER BULLSHIT and a dated look at the education system. since i started my course I have been preached and preached to teach children in a creative way! which to be honest has shocked me! we are being shown ways to get children to ask, be creative think divergently. Ken Robinson here is simply saying what is wrong and shows no evidence from recent teachings what so ever! his charismatic ways make it easy to believe what he is saying but it is deeply wrong. On top of all of this he has no potential solutions!!! the only solution he talked about was asking why children work together in the same year groups! well fundamentally it makes sense given the social ages of children I don't want to go too far into that before i go off topic... but im here to reassure you that the education system is vastly improving and most of what robinson says here about teachers is wrong... ps. no i am not going to look back over this comment and make the grammar and spelling perfect and make the i capitals....",7년 전,0,

Also bigger parties (as in more than 10 people) tire me out quickly and i need some time alone to recuperate. Guess it messed up my social sense.  I still have a vivid imagination, but at some point i stopped voicing it. The thing that's bad is, that school doesn't stop bullying.

@wardenofmymusic5640,"There's a negative correlation between grades (marks/notes) in school and creativity. Obviously because the system doesn't want you to be creative. Why? Imagine you give a creative child a task. It will find his own way, create his solution, something new. Well how are you gonna measure this? You have one set of criteria for all students, so you want to measure how precisely they repeat exactly what the teacher had told them before. Just like you have one teacher. Every student has his own needs, talents, interests. Still, the teacher presents the information in one way to all students, who all differ in learning methods^^ I absolutely agree with you, that school should make children creative, because that's exactly what we need! Adaptive, creative problem-solvers! Not people who are smart enough to accurately repeat what they're told and follow orders, and dumb enough to think this makes them smarter than everyone else.

@ambiguousheadline8263,"The problem now is that schools have doomed everybody above elementary school to almost no creativity. If these creative assignments did show up, all of those students would either be totally stumped the entire class or fail the assignment after giving a bland, unoriginal creation. This means Middle and High Schoolers would have to fully start over at a pre-k level to build creativity again. Why would schools care enough to go through this problem when it's easier to keep spouting out the same school work and keep the same school structure that is training students to grow into mindless beings that follow orders?  Most of my teachers agree that creativity should be implemented into a complete revamp of the school system. The problem is that they do not have the power, even if they have the will to go through the pain of the redesign.

@Soytu19,"El sistema educativo esta totalmente desnaturalizado. Emplea el conocimiento por el conocimiento mismo y nunca enfocado a la vida misma. Está enfocado únicamente en el ámbito profesional y deja a un lado todo lo demás. ¿Qué es todo lo demás?, ¿hay algo más que aprender a parte del trabajo? Es posible. Lo que está claro es que el ser humano es el ÚNICO animal que nace y vive sin desarrollarse completamente (que le salgan pelos en los genitales no significa que esté desarrollado). Tal vez sea lo único que le diferencia realmente de los animales. El sistema educativo falla en todo esto.   Pero volviendo al tema anterior. El sistema educativo está totalmente desnaturalizado. Pone la mecanización y la memorización por encima de todo lo demás, y todo lo que se supone que enseña tiene poco peso con lo que realmente consigue, o sea enseñar a ser obedientes, porque si no, te quedas atrás y solo mientras los demás siguen adelante. Y la soledad es probablemente el miedo más terrible que el ser humano puede experimentar, y el S.E. emplea este miedo primario como motor principal de todas sus leyes absurdas.    El sistema educativo actual está totalmente obsoleto, eso es una obviedad. Mientras los demás ámbitos de la sociedad han avanzado, como son la medicina, la alimentación, el ocio, las comodidades y los seguros de vida, el transporte... el sistema educativo y mejor dicho, la forma de enseñar y qué enseñar, sigue siendo el mismo. Y esto es en gran parte porque el sistema educativo se basa en el lenguaje, mientras que todas las demás cosas se basan en el intelecto técnico del ser humano. Pero el sistema educativo actual, y el hecho de que esté totalmente obsoleto y que la gente no se entere, es realmente el resultado de la ruptura de comunicación tan característica del ser humano. La educación se basa en el lenguaje, no existe otro método de enseñar que no sea a través de la palabra. Sin embargo, el ser humano aquí falla. Creamos leyes absurdas, como todos aquellos en los que se basa el sistema educativo, con el fin de compensar brecha existente entre nosotros y lo que somos realmente capaces de expresar de nosotros mismos, o sea la autoconciencia.   La educación, que no el sistema educativo, es la base de todo el mundo humano que hemos creado. La educación es igual a humanización y viceversa. La educación es donde realmente creamos a las personas. Es la base de todo, y a pesar de eso nadie ve problemas en el, cuando en realidad el sistema educativo actual es una mierda que llevamos arrastrando desde hace demasiado tiempo. El momento en el que se consiga este cambio será un paso infinitamente más grande que la llegada del hombre a la luna.

@gracel316,"Although he has made a point, his remarks on the history of education are not all that precise. Actually the idea of free universal education appeared  way before the 19th century and in many different cultures. The aztecs, for example, believed in mandatory universal education (and when I say universal I mean they also included women in basic education). But also during the Renaissance, many protestant christians, especially in Germany, opened schools for all people to learn how to read, because they wanted people to be able to read the Bible (unifying the german culture and language on their way). The point is, yes, our modern education system is strongly influenced by the Industrial Revolution, but it is only because societies changed priorities along the way.  Also I disagree with this talk because it is implying that music, dancing and painting are the only ways to be creative. In actuality every person that is watching this video in their computers, cellphones or tablets is benefiting from the creativity that some engineer put into creating this technology. And ¿guess what? the used a whole lot of maths in the process.  My theory is that is not that we are taught a lot of useless things when we should be drawing and dancing instead. The problem is that we are given a whole lot of tools but we were never told how to use the in our every day lives. For example, we surely should use our history lessons when we vote. We should use all that biology knowledge to prevent the spread of diseases. We should use those grammar rules to communicate. We could use that high school mathematics to understand our personal finances and not get in debt. So, please stop saying only because we don't use it to solve our problems.",7년 전,0,

These teachers don't want to see their methods being replaced by someone they see as ""Inferior"" yet often times these new methods are proven to work better. The best way to get students to be more interested in their school is to actually listen to what they have to say, but in most cases that never happens. In my school district, many of the adults who hold the power to make a difference consider the student's input to be ""rubbish"".

@jules8717,"I'm 16, I've been telling stories for as long as I can remember, and I started putting them to paper three years ago. I've always been a ""gifted"" child--I excelled in math and science, and everyone told me how important and special I was because of my academic achievements, so I thought that my passion for writing was unimportant. I hid it. Even my parents and many of my closest friends had no idea I would pour hours and hours into my stories weekly, or even daily. This year, though, I took a high school writing class, which accompanied my English class. My teacher not only writes but is also very well-respected in the theater community, and has written several original pieces. It was only recently that I had the opportunity to write something creative for his class--a script for an original scene--and by the time I got around to it, I was exhausted from all of my academic work. I wrote the script in under two hours. It was far from my best work, but I simply didn't have the extra time to put into it. After I turned it in, my writing teacher approached me and told me it was outstanding, that he wished he'd had the opportunity to read my creative writing earlier, and that he wanted me to polish it and enter it in a short play contest next year. I'd hidden my love of writing for three years, and almost nobody had ever read, let alone praised, my work, so I was blown away--and I still am. I never dreamed that my ""hobby"" could be worth acknowledging, but now I was finally being told it was--not by the school system, but by a man who worked in a creative field. In the past few weeks I've opened up more and let more and more people read my work, again, outside of the school curriculum, and I've been told time and time again that I have a promising future in creative writing, if I choose to take it. I've been offered advice, I've been called a prodigy, people have offered to mentor me--it's astounding. And nothing I've shown people has been my best work! But I still have a hard time wrapping my mind around the idea that my creative achievements are more important than my academic ones...because only academic achievement is praised by the school system. I still have to sacrifice most of my time to math and science, because in the eyes of the school system, my writing is not worth a grade. In the eyes of the school system, my passion, my devotion to a creative outlet, means nothing. I'm not the only person I know in this situation--my experience might be somewhat of an extreme case, but I know gifted artists and musicians who are also seeing their talent and creativity squandered by the school system. I've seen it at every school I've ever been to, with dozens and dozens of passionate people. I've witnessed the exact moment when people gave up on their dreams because they were told math and science were more important than what they loved. The school system kills creativity.",7년 전,39,
@ela5746,"This may be the most unpopular opinion in the comment section. But I think the education system is fine, we just need better teachers. Teachers who teach creatively, interactively. I was smartest, I believe, in primary school. Years kindergarten to year 6. You would have one teacher, who would thoroughly get to know you throughout the year and due to that was able to embrace that, and customise your learning experience to bring out the best in you. It was a very one on one experience that nurtured everyone to be the best they could be. This and the fact that everyone felt the same way may be unique to my primary school. Instead of writing a persuasive text to do with the Australian gold rush, we turned the classroom into a court room, dressed up in 1800's clothes, gathered in teams and with excitement pitched our ideas to the class. Our TEACHER had turned what could be a boring lesson into a memorable one that we would remember, and through the various ways we could present our argument brought out the best of our individual talents and made us all feel 'smart' in a topic we may be lost on. This mindset made us confident learners, that weren't afraid to put our hands up, to be wrong. It made us want to learn MORE on topics we may hate. Typically, younger teachers are best. As times have changed extremely fast, the only ones who seem to fit with these modern kids are modern adults: millennials.",7년 전,0,

Profile that I'm on now is not what I expected it to be and jobs that should be my goals according to this are just... not. I would want to get into Art School, but I've never had an art lesson in my life and I just figured out bits and pieces on my own with time so... I wish I could fast forward next year of my life so I don't have to actually go through all of this mess of dealing with... well.. consequences of every bad decision I made up to this point xD)  ...Sorry for rambling. Haven't exactly talked to anyone about it, since I parents will just yell at me to get better grades now, I don't want to bother friends and screaming into the interned void doesn't seem like a bad thing ;) I'm going to just leave it here and maybe revisit in the future just for fun to see how much I effed up...

It is in the process of changing and updating, but we should spend more focus on skills, and less on numbers and facts. Yes, we all need to learn these facts, but we also need to hone our intellectual skills. This is what UIL tries to do with their competitions.

YouTube and home schooling. Mums can stay home.  Mums. Maybe one mum is a doctor and wants to be a doctor. Maybe another works three jobs to survive. However both may not have the capability to teach. Knowing something and teaching it are completely independent of each other. I am an artist. I teach art. Formally am artist that taught all subjects in a Montessori classroom. My students now are rude. They talk all the time. I don’t have the opportunity to even explain topics without interruption. I’d like to discuss creative thought but I spend my time discussing behaviour and their rights. I conducted a debate in one class about freedom in the classroom and another had to write 100 words about behaviour. The overwhelming consensus was they are the victim. I am an angry threatening adult who needs to let them just enjoy their life. They are 12-14. They think they know everything.

@anaezaaubreyborja7546,"I totally agree. As said in the video. “All children are born artists, the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.” –Pablo Picasso. When we grow up, we become frightened for being wrong and in the school system, mistakes are the worst thing you can make. But isn't school supposed to prepare us for the future? The knowledge we gain from school matters but creativity is still necessary. Students spend 18+ years in their lives taking tests, memorizing informations and spent hours finishing homeworks. However, true learning is born out of lasting understanding, not grades and tests. The informations we memorize fades by the time, but our creativity won’t. In school, even if you’re allowed to be creative, they put a lot of restrictions in it. Students are expected to follow methods instead of creating their own. For example, in Literature. Students are often given strict guidelines for writing things like poems. School makes us create poems that have precise rules for each individual line, making poetry seem very constricted and uncreative. School drains out creativity of oneself.That’s why school must focus on empowering students’ creativity.",7년 전(수정됨),748,

@ela5746,"Homeschooling. I believe it is good if you want your child to have a more relaxed education. I think some parents get the wrong idea when their kid is struggling at school, they think that school as a whole is bad and they take them out, start to homeschool. But maybe it's just that in particular school? There are many pros and cons of both, but I think going to school is better. Note, the pros of homeschooling is also technically a con, as children aren't learning CRUCIAL life skills that will help them survive at work later one. Lets go back to what i said earlier about it being more relaxed. They are used to constant help, always getting supervised. It's not every man for them self, 'just work it out'. They aren't learning to do things and deal with stress without assistance. School kids are used to being chucked a sheet and expecting to produce an A grade assignment with no help or guide, apart from a marking criteria of what they need to achieve. HS (home school) or private school kids are used to getting a run down of the assignment, getting constant help when they need it. What about when they enter uni/college? If they don't learn how to survive and fight the big fish, they will eat you whole.  A known con of homeschooling is the lack of social skills. I know you can learn how to socialise through groups, there are so many ways other then school. I mean standing up for yourself, facing bullies. You HAVE to face those people everyday, unlike HS kids who can hide from them all they want. It's like a parent constantly getting rid of bacteria from their household, resulting in their immune systems not knowing how to fight it off. Same with bullies. If they are sheltered from negativity, their hearts won't be able to take it when it finally hits.   Overall, HS kids won't survive in the shark tank and will be overwhelmed when situations that require skills you learn at SCHOOL hit them.   Disclaimer: Im not saying all HS kids have these problems, there are ways to get those skills out of school. Not every HS kids is sheltered or guided. I'm saying in general as an OPINION. You are completely welcome to state yours or object as you would in a formal debate, respect me and I'll respect you in return :)  IF YOU'VE READ WARRIORS: To sum it up better, I see HS kids the way the clan cats see kitty pets.

@rdmlb96,"I agree and support the claim that educational systems need to focus more on creativity and originality in the classroom. We need to prepare our youth for a future of uncertainty, because that is all the future is. No one knows what lies ahead or how the problems and challenges of tomorrow will be solved. It is valuable to learn of the past and know of how things have been resolved and corrected, but if we do not have the creativity to grow and change with the world then we are lost. This does not mean we need to do away with common core and only teach the arts, what it means is we need to rethink the way we teach all subjects. We need to treat every subject with the same level of attention and openness as the next. We need to teach math with the same focus on creativity and technique as art, and teach history with the same attentiveness to storytelling and emotion as drama.   We need to be less quick to judge children who may not be as good at multiplication tables or anatomy, but may flourish in other things. Albert Einstein said it best, “Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Sir Robinson echoes this philosophy in a story he tells about Jillian Lin, a choreographer who was able to find her talent at a young age and flourish. Rather than maybe today being told she has ADD and needs to calm down. It is important our educational system is able to find the metaphorical water in which all kids can flourish and grow. Too many kids in school are told they are wrong and believe they are stupid, at which point they are afraid to keep trying and be hurt again. So rather than giving their full effort and letting their passion and creativity flow, they suppress it to protect themselves against failure. This is saddening to see and crippling all over the world as it brings adults into our world who lack the confidence in themselves to chase their dreams and make the world a better place.  A big part of the creative process is producing an original work, and Robinson says nothing original can be made if we fear failure. So how can we be sure to not destroy children’s capacity to not fear failure and take chances, while still grading them upon their works. I think the answer lies in the feedback that kids are given as they go through their education. More often than not the response to an assignment focuses more on what was wrong than what was right. Alternatively, I think our education should focus on student’s successes rather than their failures, to the point that those defined successes can become points to focus on and grow. When a child is told they are brilliant, creative and can invent any answer they want they will go running in that direction. Of course, there are professors and teachers out there who excel in bringing out the creative side of their students but the system as a whole fails here. With ever advancing technology it is a pivotal time in education as new boundaries are reached and the classroom environment is changing. IPads on every desk in an elementary classroom offer endless possibilities for students to open up a black canvas and create unapologetically. Let us push our children to be brighter and better than we are and let them take the world with it. Let us show them to fail fast and fail forward and never ever give up.",7년 전,0,

I nearly had a successful game as well, ended up getting around 65 thousand visits on the game, alongside having up to 40 people playing it at once, 20-30 on multiple special occasions. ROBLOX is just some kiddy game, but for me its a good starting point. If school isn't teaching me something that I should have remembered, then its obvious that its not important enough.  As time goes by, hopefully I can teach myself some skills via Blender modeling, Unreal engine, or even Unity engine. School needs to embrace a skill or dream a child and/or teen wishes to go for, not block it out and force feed them homework and take up all available time before its too late.

Sometimes in life you get that reinforcement and sometimes you don't, but when you know that you ""know"" something and you haven't met others yet that are seeing and feeling what you see and feel it can be a little lonely.

Any reasoned analysis of the cost vs the output of the educational institutions would show how clear a welfare scheme it has become.  That said, learning, knowledge and creativity are extremely useful in providing a basis for a prosperous society and economy. If public education is an entitlement, the money spent on current educational institutional welfare could be directed toward a home/internet based educational model. It would be far more efficient (less cash per outcome) to have an educational entity that ensured all children had a functional computer and internet connection. There could be facilitators who would develop course goals and individual educational plans and to some extent coordinated learning. What you wouldn't need is a bunch of useless welfare recipients in universities and local school districts. Think of all the overhead that would be unnecessary if you had a model like this. And the facilitators (teachers) would have the resources to ensure they had success. With the savings you could even extend the facilitation to children under 5 without much trouble.",8년 전,0,

@thethinkingtree7362,"A note from my mom:   I watched this Ted Talk about 10 years ago. This concept of education shaped my whole outlook on homeschooling. After watching it I began a mission to discover each child's gifting and passions. We are a family of homeschoolers. So it was easy to apply this concept to our homeschooling.   My quest was to build each child's education around their passion. So when my daughter Anna was 7 and 8 she majored in the Arts. She learned to read at 9, and write at 11. I have facilitated the learning of each child in the same way, by majoring on their interests and giftings. I am now seeing the beautiful results as eash child follows their passions, and begins to walk in their callings and live out their life goals.  From early days Anna saw herself as an artist. I am so amazed at who she is becoming. But not just Anna, they all are thriving in their gifts, full of confidance, talent and character. Isaac saw himself as a chef, a dancer, a filmmaker. Joe sees himself as a Scientist. They have been developing their talents for years, and I have made it my misson to not let eduction get in the way of their missions.

@themistoklespappalas3834,"Creativity doesn't grow on trees and schools, i.e. creativity and schooling don't go together.    Schools are teaching students what they want them to learm and  they test them by asking them to repeat them. So studends follow this road of thinking: I memorize, I learn, I get the grade, I am successful. Almost never students are asked what do you think about this or what's your opinion about that, or still a lot better take this and this and compare them, combine them to present something new and let the students turn it in after months. Even when they do something like the latter mentioned, they are told what to make. You don't help creativity like this. In my humble opinion creativity needs free will, requires the mind to be trained to wonder around ideas and physical objects without constraints, that is, directed mental patterns: read this and tell that. This way I concentrate on what you ask me to do, I don't try to find what I will do. Indirectly they are trained to become obedient and that's what disciplined is to the social systems. If the mind is let free to wonder while absorbing information must be more creative.  MAYBE IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER FOR EVERYTHING ON THE TRAINING OF THE MIND INSTEAD OF SHOWING THEIR COMPETENCE IN LEARNING IN EXAMINATIONS TO SHOW IT BY CONTINUOUSLY ASKED TO COMPLETE PROJECTS ON THE MATERIAL CONVEYED, AND AMONG THEM MANY PROJECTS VERY LOOSELY DEFINED IN THEIR SPECIFIC SCOPE, BUT OFF COURSE MOSTLY LYING WITHIN SPECIFIC AREAS OF KNOWLEDGE.",8년 전,0,

@StuC5,"I went to school (and did much of my teaching later) in an era when it was commonplace for teachers to express their displeasure at children for getting the wrong answer, but they weren't all bad teachers. Pressured to deliver a formal curriculum within a set time scale, often fearful of principals, parents and district inspectors, such teachers became frustrated and exasperated that their teaching hadn't succeeded, that they hadn't engaged a child in a task, that they couldn't communicate with them no matter what they tried. They wanted to be good teachers but were failing. They had much to learn themselves. A BAD teacher, on the other hand, is easier to define. They are those whose main priority is not the needs or welfare of their students, but their own. Their own ego. Their own career path. Their own comfort and convenience. Their own quest for whatever power they can seize and hold on to. They are the ones Roger Waters sang about in 'The Wall'. A child in error is dismissed at best, humiliated at worst. Most teachers today are not like this. They are dedicated, hard-working, self-critical and keen to learn, and they fall on clips like this one of Sir Ken for inspiration. Bad teachers uses children for their own ends. Good teachers put the children first, leading and joining with them as much as possible on the quest for truth and understanding.",6년 전,4,

@amanieux,"ken robinson says every children is born curious and creative and we are ""educated out"" of our original creativity but can it be that this highly creative period in our lives is just a stage in our developing brain, meaning that even if school/parents tried to keep us in this childhood creative mindset we end up loosing this kind of creativity anyway ? it seems logical that when interconnections in the brain are being constructed at childhood a curious/creative mindset (free association or divergent thinking type) is required but when the brain wiring process is finished this mindset goes away just like somatotropin is generated to grow our body limbs then it stops to go in the next step of testosterone and estrogen to spark sexual puberty. is there a a ""creativity/neuron wiring"" hormone generated in the first stage of our lives to help grow our brain interconnections and then it stops letting our brain focus on other important stages in our lives, less creative but more stable in order to have a stable mental environment to raise our own children. an analogy would be seasons for the plant life form : spring is a marvelous season all this life magically sprouting out of nothing and growing at a very fast speed, but life cycle cannot be a continuous spring.  or can it ?",8년 전(수정됨),0,

You don't know about the island hopping campaign. 7. The Germans bombed Pearl Harbor.  How can you discuss that question intelligently if you don't know the basics. Can you write poetry without the alphabet, do anything having to do with finance without being good at math? If you toss your reading, writing, and arithmetic out and focus more on art and creativity then you raise people who are creative but with no skill set for getting a job.

(one hour a week) and music, like a jam b, writing your own song in pairs(OK, like the teacher did help you with the music, since not everyone plays an instrument..so you got like the piano chords, or drum or base line)  learning a song on the guitar.  and now. with the entire class performing one song. with loads of instruments. we do fireflies. I do the gajon. a box you sit on. some of the same sound a drum makes, like the base drum and the snare drum. I don't play an instrument. I'm better with melody than rhythm. but that doesn't mean I'm unable to do that.  yes we also value sciences. but our school slogan is ""becoming who you are."" I have an adhd diagnosis. my fine motor skills skyrocketed when I got to my school. the creative things help me be able to function in class. instead of eating paper, I now draw on it. as a fidget.  I went to regular education before this high school, in the beginning it was difficult since I had no idea what to create. yes I am and was on medication. doesn't mean you can't fight the effects of it. I actually regained some of my creativity, I never completely lost it. just when it was on demand.

Imagine what would happen if a high pourcentage of the population would use there capacity of creativity? Would they contunue to obey the gouvernments as they do today? Would they agree with the decisions of the people who want to control us?

But the chance of actually making a living out of being creative by music, painting or writing is like winning the lottery. If you want to pay your bills you have to do something else. Maybe because music for instance is digital and a song recorded once can be copied and played for an infinite amount of times, so only a relatively small number of musicians are needed to sate our need for music. It's also nearly impossible to get well known enough to reach enough people to be able to sell your music.

They just feed an immense amount of data to students without teaching them to think critically and creatively about it. The negative attitude towards the education system won´t fix this. The system is not rigged to make us obedient - we would be way more obedient if we didn´t have any education at all.

@Biowoman.,"Looking at the moment where he mentions that the original purpose of education was to produce academics is not necessarily correct. If you take education back to its roots, the industrial revolution, the purse of education was actually to produce a mass work force.  Although even if today's society were still using that original purpose, it would still be wrong because you don't really learn much about being in a work role unless you access higher education.

I don't wanna launch into a biography or anything but ever since I was a child, I loved dancing with all my heart. I'd dance every minute of the day and whenever asked what I wanted to do when I was older I just answered ""I want to dance as long as I can"" my mom found it endearing but as I got older, she constantly drilled into me that dance should be put to the side & to put lots of effort into school subjects, like Math and English. I've never really been good at math and that alone made me feel lesser than and unsuccessful but I accepted this because I'm quite a realistic person, I understand that in this society you have to do certain things to ensure a comfortable life for yourself & whatnot. But I didn't understand the constant dismissal of the creative arts. I still want a job in the arts and people always smile and nod when I tell them but you can also tell they're a bit perplexed by the idea.

This is not me calling for complete autonomy, this is me pointing out common sense, that these rules are ridiculous, educators caught off the grid can even tell you how they disagree with it, but you don't see them adding opinions on that on school premises? YOU are in control of how you act on school premises, you are supposed to act respectfully and keep yourself accordingly while in public and in a WORK place setting. School is a work place, it is not a petty echo hall for bullying, teasing, and poor quality teachers who may sometimes lose their composure. However, you are always in control of how YOU learn, not how others want you to learn. My special needs teacher mocked and ridiculed several coordinately impaired children and an autistic girl who asked to go to the bathroom at the wrong time. She even went as far as questioning how they didn't know most of the curriculum since it was so 'easy' in her mind, a month prior before we planned to homeschool, I put a tape-recorder in my lunchbox. After it was found out, they tried to discard the evidence during a parent meeting. after the tape-recorder was brought up, my father showed them it was in his pocket, we had nothing to lose, they asked for it, he declined, we both declined. Corruption at its finest! Our state's law explicitly states that it is perfectly legal as long as I am a party to the conversation, which I was, which is how I got in trouble, for disrupting and wasting '10' minutes of class time after I expressed discomfort with a bothersome student, the parent meeting was regarding this, except instead of blaming the student, I was blamed. This coincidentally was under the time frame in which the recorder was used (2 weeks in),  which resulted in a parent conference for which they tried to take it away.

It is not tailored to the majority, as it was supposedly designed to be. We are not all the same, as it turns out, we can be very much different from each other. Everybody has something  that sparks his/her soul and imagination. We squander their imagination and instead make them hate it. What a waste! It is upon the schools to help people find their spark and curate and develop it. Because only then people will stick to it and it will last.

@imrozzahan7328,"Many genius students of physics study Einstein's theory of general relativity today, but how many of them could sort out the idea that ""gravity""  is something else, the curvature of space time. Einstein thus challenged the god of physics of that time, Sir Isaac Newton. He was not afraid of thinking in a new direction,rather, he enjoyed it. That is what our education system can not do. It can not inspire us to change the perspective, the way of thinking. It is mainly memory based. Those who have good memory and a better  understanding of equations, are considered as brilliant. Yes, they are brilliant. They have good learning ability. But that is not all. We are human for a reason. We have advanced this far from the stone age only because of the creativity in us. The power of thinking differently and bringing new ideas is something that most of the genius doesn't have. In my country Bangladesh, we teach our children to memorize hundreds of paragraphs so that they have one common in the exam hall. But, we don't teach them how to think on any given topic and write on their own. Our children are afraid of math Olympiads though they get 100 out of 100 in the school exam. Why? because they get the same questions that they were taught  in the class or in the private tuition. So' they are afraid of something different to try on.",8년 전,1,

@Doubleolseven,"school killing creativity is equivalent to say school defeats education. or impedes the forming of the intellect. you're a sad snob.  if you judge a child as a human, then you should agree is a naturally-irresponsible human. the time and place of school is to awaken the sentiment of responsibility in a human child. this can only be done through the effort of learning. teachers are paid to make sure the kids make this effort. you should have focused on that.  at this moment in time, in western hemisphere the responsibility is taught as discipline towards the law. a law fewer people by the day are that understand, agree of or know. we don't know why the law is like it is. we only know we have to obey it blindly.  we have a right to know that laws are not always right. that at present time the  laws do not serve the right of the individual as they should. that laws can and should be changed only to serve the individual, and not the other way around. we live in a diseased time when individuals are reprogrammed via the damaging education, to become servers and executioners of the law. from the perspective of the law, we just traveled back in the time of pharaohs.  The schools don't kill creativity. Creativity is a talent: when proper lit, shines only as bright as the sweat on it's back. yet, we teach the kids  to see value in the dicey sweat, the sweat of  hit and run. We live in an era where teachers are carefully directed on how to contain the parents' struggle for the education of their kids. where teacher's preparedness to being a teacher has no relevancy. with the example provided, you said it yourself.  people are laughing at your entertainment routine. you managed to amuse the crowds with your educative dead sentence. we live in an alienated time. be careful though: the day died and the reasoning is violated in her sleep. the monsters she dreams of are already feeding from her body.",8년 전,0,

@CasuallyFeral,"Here's a tl;dr of what Sir Robinson had to say - or at least, a reiteration for clarity.   What do you think of when you imagine a talented child?  You might be thinking of ""talents"" through the lens of, ""I'm 13 and I'm as skilled of a painter as an art-school professor,"" or ""I'm extraordinarily good at sciences or maths."" But you have been misled, my friend, that is NOT what ""Talent"" is!  The ""talent"" behind that child artist are skills like steady hands, keen observation, fantastic mind-eye co-ordination, and a ton of learned things on top of it. Things like that are very easy to notice in children. There will always be that one kid that concentrates better than the others, the one that has a keen sense of space, the one that has keener ears than the rest, one that's very sensitive and inclined to personal relations & conflict resolution. But the thing is, talents like that need to be pursued. The brain is constantly changing and neuroscience is proving that its based on the combined systems of ""Use-it or Lose-it"" and the ""Reward System."" If you are constantly told to ""Stop drawing in class!"" and ""Your drawings will not help you in life!"" and whatever else, you will lose those precious, practiced skills of Steady Hands! - of Observation, of mind-eye co-ordination! We MUST keep practicing it, but our talents are so hard to cling to when we're downtrodden and made depressed by a system that refuses to see how much our ""idle drawing"" will prepare us for real-life opportunities.   This mentality is why Surgeons are being ENCOURAGED to play video games! Look it up, it's true!  Reflexes, precision, timing, attention to detail, the ""In-the-Zone"" concentration and so much more are all practiced via video games. But that surgeon likely didn't pursue decades of medical school because education alone got him there. He likely did it because he wanted to be one enough that he practiced until he was good, or maybe, he did it because it was already good at those skills already - and all kids are good at SOMETHING.  But if kids are pursuing their talents, and then often met with: No no, stop that. You there. Tell me what a^2+b^2 means. Can't do that? Welp, look at you, nice failure you'll be. See? You're a failure because you keep doing that... that... that THING that you do!  Does that sound like it would work in the long run for that child? Turning a square into a circle, when it was already a really nice square to begin with? No, no it really won't. And that's Sir Robinson's point. Enable ovals to become better ovals, triangles to be better triangles, while still allowing circles to become lovely little circles.",8년 전,16,

@Cosmalano,"One of the biggest things I took out of it was that I felt like he was trying to get across the point that everyone is creative, but you’re not allowed to be creative in academics. He made the point that schools prepare children to be college professors RATHER than to help them be creative, as though a professor must be exempt from being able to have original ideas. He also made the joke that during a social interaction, academics are praying for it to end so that they can “go write a paper about it,” as if to devalue talking about things in a structured way as a viable outlet of expression. All throughout school, I was one of the few kids that valued academics above everything else. When somebody asked me, “what’s your hobby?” and I responded “doing math or learning about physics” people would respond, “but what do you like to do for fun?” I’d have to give the answer “I play the piano” instead because it’s a more acceptable answer as a leisure activity. But I could do math the way a “normal” person my age played sports or played video games. I could sit down and solve problem after problem for hours, or rearrange problems and make my own in order to give myself a better understanding of a mathematical concept. And then I could apply that concept to a physical situation to find links between things in the real world that I never would have realized otherwise. I don’t consider myself good at either math or physics. Were I to ever achieve great success in the fields I would not want my achievements to precede me the same way high achievers in the arts often seem to. I would not want my achievements to precede me because I believe that I am not good at the topics, I merely enjoy them, and I wouldn’t want someone to feel like I was better than them just because I enjoyed something they didn’t. Most, if not all people can do math faster than me. I am extremely slow at doing my work, and for most of my life I felt like that was supposed to mean that I wasn’t good at it. Eventually, I even grew to hate mathematics. However, at the height of my loathing in the 10th grade, I discovered that if I tried hard enough, I could comprehend graduate level texts. I was impressed with myself for this, and unlike the other things in life that I had wanted to be good at in order to impress others (which admittedly is why I started doing more complicated mathematics at first), I could do something that I myself could be proud of, and I realized that was all that mattered. I derived great joy from discovering new ideas and the ways they link together, or finding my own new ways to understand something. I have even been brought to tears by the beauty I find in mathematics, as silly as that may sound. I would even argue, physics and mathematics are fields that praise creative individuals, as some of the most notable physicists in history include the likes of Albert Einstein and Richard Feynman, two men who revolutionized physics by working on ideas that everyone had worked on before, but in entirely new ways. So, I'd that no, he is wrong. Schools could certainly be reworked to be more inclusive of children that like to do things like dance, sing, paint, etc., or just be more accepting of students that enjoy different things and learn in different ways in general, but for some, the academic areas in school are the places THEY get to show off their creativity, and in a world that continues to attempt to be more inclusive of those we think are being ignored, we must refrain ourselves from putting the kids we commonly see as “uncreative” or “creative in the wrong ways” on the back burner, in favor of those that we think are being ignored.",8년 전,142,

Are you learning those subjects in creative and different ways? The thing is schools aren't even worked out for you either. they don't really teach you to problem solve. They teach you copy and paste information over and over again until your brain turns to mush, and that's all you're capable of. You've just demonstrated this in your comment by saying you were constantly frustrated and you even disliked math before you went out of your way to learn it. Maybe I misinterpreted your comment, Let me just leave you with this. How can you ever be innovative or creative in a space that doesn't allow you to think outside of the box?

@olivierberben9351,"you know whats the problem with quitting dancing, you can't dislike something you like. If you like to dance, just dance. Because if you like something you are motivated and passionate to learn more about it. So you might think you are not good at dancing but that is just because you can't dance like the people in the videos you watch. But the thing with art is is that it is an personal opinion, so you might be bad at the technique of dancing but that doesn't mean you can't dance. It's the same thing with paintings, paintings from 100-200 years ago are almost always described as beautiful because it is a very good representation of the thing they drew. It is called beautiful but it is actually ""good"" art because that artist had a good technique. So there is a difference between good art and art you like or dislike. So if you like your own dancing, it is beautiful. And eventually you might get good at is as well. Because you can get good at something you like but you can't make yourself like something just because youre good at it.",7년 전,1,

Moreover, bc of how society is which is what this talk hopes to change, this is why you couldn't be yourself and responded playing the piano is how you relax and have fun, bc your brain is wired different than others and we have all been wired to have like social norms.  Your very own creative self discovered the gratification in mathematics; how excellent and awesome that is, and the school system would applaud you, but if in his example if some other student's creative self finds gratification is dancing music or other sorts of things outside of our social norms of education then that student would appear to be rebellious or problematic.  Most people wont go on to have careers in STEM so to focus only on those things as to perfect it in everyone is wasteful and we could have potentially helped someone perfect his natural discourse,  of course as long as it is not something that wouldn't be harmful to society.

Another tip: search around your area for alternative schools outside of what your guidance counselor might find.

@lilaclizard4504,"I used to work in adult education & believe me there ARE stupid questions!!!!!! but my job as an educator in my view was always to encourage learning, which meant doing my absolute best to keep a straight face & answer in a way that not only answered the question, but created an environment conducive to learning - which can be challenging when the rest of the class has just had the same thoughts as I did!  example of a question I was asked once ""I live in an apartment, so if I call the emergency services, they have a key to my apartment don't they?"" HUH?????? (not my real answer) follow up when I asked how they would ""aren't all apartment keys standard & given to emergency services for emergencies?"" um no!  anyway imo, how a teacher responds to questions like that & how supported they make their students feel in the learning process indicates how good they are at their job!

@05445654,"I am not agree Mr Robinson, schools are teach us what is needed to people to survive in live and be prepared in daily ...and this is much important than having dancing and painting people around and doing nothing good indeed. BY the way talented people can always learn dancing, painting, everywhere even alone at home or they can go to courses... Kids can choose what they want, what they like to improve... But when even if they do not like math or biology or language lesson they have to learn it, because they do not understand now how important is, but one day they will understand... Also all is about personally possibility and abilities, so one middle class and equal system of education is perfect, the one of them who need special or extra lessons they can just take more. Maybe the only problem is the way of giving knowledge of teachers. They have to make it more attractive and push more to quality not quantity of lessons. Also for little kids they have not have the score grade system this really kill creativity because make them motivate not for learning and developing but having high score.... So you can not make all schools give importance to creativity... That is why after middle school even university when you grow up you can choose dancing or musical or art high school or university...",8년 전,0,
@melissachirico4901,"The idea of the public school system killing creativity is a valid argument. There currently is more of an emphasis put on academic core classes rather than fine arts classes and other programs, therefore creativity is being denied and the younger generation is not able to freely express themselves. Throughout Ken Robinson's argument, he uses personal experience stories of his family of their transition from England to Los Angeles to help convey the idea that creativity and free expression is being ignored or ridiculed. Robinson also incorporates the story of Gillian of how she was constantly shaking and fidgeting, her mom thought that there was something wrong with her daughter, so she took her to the doctor. Come to find out, Gillian was not sick, she was dancing, so doctor's prescription of medication was to put her into a dance class. Whereas if her mom would have just assumed that her daughter being sick, Gillian would have not been the successful woman she is today. By this, Robinson emulates the idea that people have to move in order to think reasonably. Ken Robinson uses rhetorical devices throughout his speech, including use of pathos, logos, and ethos to advance his argument the United States Public School system is slowly discouraging the creative abilities that our young generation currently has.",8년 전,0,

@infantrymama,"I think there are some schools that employ methods such as Montessori, Waldorf, etc. which support creative development, development of emotional intelligence and critical thinking... as was mentioned in the video, holistic learning. Unfortunately these schools are few and far between (at least in the US). Student's with ""ADD/ADHD"", dislexia and other conditions tend to thrive in these environments along side students without. Much of the information delivered in traditional school settings may seem to be unnecessary, however, I am a believer that exposure to information is a good thing. Knowledge is power. But what is lacking, and I am in agreement with the context of the video, is a delivery method supportive of creative, critical thinking which better equips minds to know how to utilize the information that is being embedded for future use. Creativity isn't only art/the arts... it is the capacity for conceptual thinking and problem solving, seeing situations and objects in various perspectives and dimensions. Again, if these aspects are not taught and fostered then more often than not the other information, facts, and data just don't stick and of course, seem like a bunch of jibberish that will possibly never be used.",8년 전,0,

@mrxcreamy10,"Again you are misunderstanding what I'm saying. People who made these great breakthroughs in maths or science or whatever, they did it because they were passionate about whatever it was - they enjoyed it. I'm not saying you or anyone else would get more out of music or history but I would get more out of music because I am more interested in it. And I have to say music is absolutely necessary for entertainment. Maybe you don't understand how broad music is. For example, horror movies would be a joke without music - it adds so much suspense and is absolutely necessary for jump scares. Music does not just include what you listen to on the radio but the entire soundtrack of a movie. You even went as far as to say music holds no academic value which is blatantly wrong. I didn't something click in your head when you, later on, said that you studied it at school. I think you would be surprised at how much maths and science is involved in music and what ""sounds good"" or interesting. Then you say that becoming a famous musician is highly unlikely and wouldn't have the same long-term impact as a scientific breakthrough. Well again, I disagree. Firstly, it is also highly unlikely for someone to make any scientific breakthrough on such a scale that you feel is important and of course there are lots of smaller breakthroughs which still have impacts. The same can be said for music and musicians, a huge popular musician may have a huge impact on many people and a smaller not as popular musician may still impact others but it's more of an emotional impact rather than something physical. Furthermore, someone who is not passionate about science or maths or any of your so-called ""important"" subjects are never going to make any of these huge breakthroughs. Finally, your argument seemed more based off the history of subjects like science, maths, economics e.t.c and not modern or ancient history itself. Obviously, the history of the former subjects is essential in understanding them and I would never argue against teaching the history of those subjects for those who are passionate about them (and even for the majority of people up until a certain point in their life). Again maybe history was more useful for you but not me.",8년 전,48,

It was incredibly hard to do the tests on books that made me FOR REAL GO TO SLEEP.  And the reason I could keep my grade up was 1/7 books I liked and therefore aced them, and I could often while reading think of the questions it would ask me (I would GET CREATIVE.)

@mvxsr,"I don't really have a problem with the school system in my country. I attend a private school in which we have no choice over the subjects we want to study, but this is so that we can learn more in case our dream career changes or something. In fact, my only problem is that there is an exam you take in 10th grade called the sprach diplom, that measures how fluent you are in german. If you fail that exam, you get expelled. I understand the reasoning for the strict measure that was taken, and the only reason I'm stressing about it is because I'm new and as familiar with german as other students. All I need is some more studying. Now, my problem is that I have nothing Im particularly good at. I excel in every subject placed in front of me, be it a creative or literate activity. Dancing, singing, algebra, geography, history. you name it. The best part is I don't need to study for it to get an 8.5/10. As crazy as it seems, I realise that maybe being able to accomplish any dream or plan I put myself into, doesn't seem like so much of a blessing, but hear me out. I am passionate about anything. I can't help but overthink and love what i do. For the time being, the thing I really want to be is a neurologist. But I don't want to spend my whole life behind a desk studying. But even if I shot to be a singer or writer, I would probably be economically challenged.

There was definitely an environment of ""There is no right or wrong answer, as long as you can support it."" Also, we were often given freedom to do projects in creative ways.  For example, one project was ""present a scene of Julius Caesar."" One group made a PowerPoint, one group turned it into a live game show, etc. My group wrote and filmed a cooking show based on the scene! We even watched and discussed this TEDtalk in class. One project was to pick a partner and debate two sides of a relevant current issue. The audience could ask questions, and nobody ""won,"" they were just graded o  how much evidence they used and how well they supported their opinion.

@iloveanime9226,"HoneyNutHijoles Glad it did, it all started with a comment like your one which told me to f the school, education is about learning so make it fun and it really helped that my Teachers were open minded, (when we were in last year, we would talk about anything with our teachers inside and outside of school and they were willing to go an extra mile to make it better for us and show us ""the real essence of education [which] school can never offer"" - said by our year team leader).   Currently I finished high school with a high enough ATAR to get an acceptance letter from every course that i applied to (mind blown again). In there you learn a formula/rule in math, apply it in the physics class and then build it in the mechanics labs. Similar to what i did while i was in high school and it seems that everything that you learn has a use and it is somewhat balanced between theory and practical. two important skills are creativity and ability to express your self, creativity in solving problems and expressing them in a way that will show that there are more Gains than the losses, and against competition.    after reading your comment i finished 2 assignments using my an old simple way from high school, it seems the harder the problem gets the easier the method to tackle it, yet it sometimes take longer period to complete which comes down to patience.",9년 전,7,

@toasega,"Why is it terrible? I was homeschooled by my mother. She taught me reading, writing and math. She would make me color two pages of a coloring book a day, and I expressed myself through building things with legos, playing on the piano (even though I didn't know how), I explored the outside world, became better at math, reading, and speaking than the other ""properly"" schooled children.  The bad thing was that there was a marriage, and at age 10 we moved away to a different place. The stepdad kept getting in the way of schooling, and we were so poor that I didn't do any schooling for years. All I could really do was read, and my only escape from getting hit or mentally tortured was to spend all day at the library. Every time we moved I'd find out where the library was and read as much as I could. By the time I was 13-14 I was reading at a 12th grade level, where other ""school-grown"" children could barely read within their own age group, if they even read at all.  In general I was pretty lonely, and friends were rare, but during those difficult years I learned about myself. I gained emotional intelligence rather than intellectual intelligence. When we finally escaped his clutches and I had to start school again (college), it took me 4 tries to get my GED since I had never gone to high school, and once I was actually in college, it took me 2 tries to get my Associate's Degree.  In general, the homeschooling never really ended. I was ""officially"" homeschooled from ages 3-10, and then unofficially schooled by life from 10-now (26). The only reason I would ever call it ""terrible"" is because it elevated my mind, my emotional control, my moral compass, personal principles, etc, beyond that of people who went through the ""system"" and were never challenged by anything or anyone, not even by themselves. Because of that I feel extremely alienated and cannot relate to most people, finding myself to make friends with those decades older than myself (I'm 26 but the friends I make are usually mid-30's-50's, and it's been that way for as long as I can remember).  So no, homeschooling isn't a bad idea.",9년 전,2,

@TheBengalDragon,"As a student going into a PHD program in Science education, let me point out where I disagree with this person.1. Creativity should not be given the equal importance as literacy, because Creativity is DEPENDENT on literacy most of the time. Modern creativeness has PRETTY MUCH ALL BEEN DERIVED from pre-requisite knowledge or some background idea and knowledge about a subject. This is especially true in Science. I'll be focusing on science here since I do notknow enough about Language and Arts education, bu have noticed how fundamentally different they are.2. ""If you're not prepared to be wrong, then you hamper creativity"" completely agree, but by the time we are adults most of us lose this creativity? not necessarily, Infact, most of modern day creativity comes from people who either are adults or about to be adults. especially in Science, an especially in Biology [my field of expertise].  because given the world and the  vast body of established knowledge we have today, it will take a significant amount of pre-requisite knowledge combined with the maturity and focus and determination of a determined adult, rather than a child who is suually easily distracted, to manifest true creative ideas.3. We stigmatize mistakes in the work area because mistakes in the work area is counter productive and damages the organization, or has the potential to. There are these things called research departments of many companies that allows you flexibility in creativity, the company pays you to go through that trial and error cycle. In schools, it is about meritocracy. How how can you expect a student that says ""coal + air gives us bad gas"" and another that says ""Carbon + oxygen give CO2"" the same way? Especially in science, these details significantly matter. There is a time where mistakes and trial and error can work, but it must work to develop something within the child, not for the child to merely have fun all the time, or else the child will focus on having fun rather than the entire purpose of learning. But during evaluation, you cannot applaud mistakes, that makes no sense. 4. We don't get educated  out of it. Some of us lose interest as we see that whatever we were trying is INEFFICIENT. Others get bolstered by education to continue their pursuit of displaying their creativity. 5. Are you kidding me? Why dance is not given as much importance as mathematics, or what is called perhaps the most important subject for science? I'm not even gonna acknowledge how stupid that sounds. Needless to say This guy lost legit points with me. 6. The purpose of education is to make people who can make a living based on their education gains, aka LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD. Of course there are other skills, surprised this guy didn't mention ALL THE NUMEROUS SPORTS SCHOLARSHIPS GRANTED TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO EXCELL AT SPORTS!7. OK i'll agree here, this benign notion of ""don't pursue that, there's no money in it"" sorta needs to change, and something must be there to encourage students to pursue these things, but aren't we getting artists nowadays who took many music lessons,  for example Lady Gaga? etc?8.  What about the fact that the world is getting more and more educated, problems and situations are getting more and more complex, demands for performance is getting higher and higher, and that's why the demand of better degrees is on the rise? what about work experience? that is one gigantic factor in all this the man doesn't elaborate at all.9.  OK, so creativity is based on how different disciplines or ideas from disciplines within the brain come together to form a unique and useful concept oridea. Then how can you be creative without having knowledge in these disciplines?10.  ""if a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?"" NICE!

@HPandLordOfTheRings,"I won't say that the school system is perfect, but it's most certainly not as terrible as people in these comments are portraying it to be. Every person is different, and I personally care about maths and science much more than I do painting or whatever. If you have passions follow them, but don't throw everything else away until you know you can. There are people in my year (which I think is 7th grade in American terms) who hate most of school. What schools try to do is open up opportunities for anything. School, a young age, is almost similar to food. You can't fully guarantee that you hate it before you try it. People these days seem to hate learning and it honestly confused me, because everything we do is learned. People didn't suddenly start dancing, they learned how to.

School consumes a lot of my time that it makes me wanna stay in bed and skip school. but I can't do that can I? So what I do is stay up all night til 3 a.m just so I could draw something and be satisfied. And so my tardiness was born. I had to leave home at 6:30, because it'd take 20-25 minutes to go to school and our class starts at 7. But I can't seem to wake up in time. And our school has a rule that says when you got late 7th time, you'll be suspended for a day. And I'm currently at my 4th late.

@Vyrus36," @hueykhalidX  money is based on the trade bargaining system that developed from the original hold/keep model. (Why fort Knox was originally full of gold before we moved away from the gold standard)  In any central system that requires assets or production to be housed and distributed, has fallen back on forms of currency to monitor that system.   People are often quick to point that ""money is meaningless"" but then don't understand what it developed from. Which was primarily grain storage. The American ""hay penny"" was an homage to that.   Essentially, all currency is only as valuable as the hold or keep that backs it. And it can only be backed, under a hold/keep and distribution system.  That's how markets are made, it's what trade is based on. Supply and demand, ergo, the supply of your keep and the demand of the community determines how much wheat you can buy for a penny, or a gold coin, or a Drachma could by if you're referencing ancient Greece.   This very structure, and shifting currency further and further away from a tangibly backed standard, (ie away from traditional trade standards where goods and services can be bought and sold with one another and maintains a relative trade value) to what more appears like mathematical gymnastics that ends in a sack of flour being valueless outside of the grocery stores return policy.

This approach is especially needed in this day and age of technology, social media, 'competency' based systems, vocationalism, state and corporate surveillance and all of that somewhat uncritical, shallow identity based politicking that's finding its way into education now (BTW - all things that have been seemingly imposed without popular consent). All kinds of creative pedagogical approaches can still be used if thats what people want - but there is a necessity in the world to educate children ""well"" as we enter into darker times (you know what I mean). We need passionate people - sure we do - but we need strong critical thinkers who engage with the reality of the world as it is - as well - and ALL students should be able to have an opportunity to take part. All students. regardless of their background should have a right to take part in 'society's conversation about itself' - that's something that is available to certain groups and not others.

The young 'social entrepreneurial' class is addressing public participation to a degree - and its been quite successful - but these are often standpoint/agenda setting based subjective campaigns rather than foundational objective knowledge. In other words (while I agree with many of the campaigns and support them) there is still the problem of objectivity in knowledge and the ability of a student (of any age, gender, race, class) to think through their own decisions, perspectives. Schools can be the means by which the next generation can be extremely well educated and prepared to take on the big challenges in life in they choose to do so. The education has to be available for that to happen. technology, social media, 'cult' of celebrity, self-interest, growing status anxiety - all produced by a money culture that is rarely questioned in a popular context - while all of that exists as the 'norm' in society - then we have to have a counter balance to it - to make a 'real' level playing field - something close to it - so we need well educated, critical thinkers from all walks of life. Schools can take on that role e.g. in the primary and secondary sector.",9년 전,0,

""I hated school"" yea, you know what, at some point you gotta get do something in order to be successful at something. Again, i'm not saying our schoolsystems are perect, there are certain things we'd have to change, and in order to find the 'right' way we'd need a lot of talks and debates.  Albert Einstein wasn't just a genius because of his cognitive skills, he was creative.  Finding your creativity in your madness is probably the most important thing you should acquire in your life.  And i'm certain - if done right - that's something you can teach at school. Not the creativity, but that you need it, and maybe some help to 'how to find it'.

@BadgerRein,"***** I hear ya. I had a teacher though in high school that was very much like the teacher the genius actor Robin Williams played in the delightful movie 'The Dead Poets Society'. He inspired us to express ourselves. To read out loud and write our thoughts, finding the rhythms and building upon that. From his influence in addition to my sister's prodding I joined the Titanic musical airing at my school and got a lead part! I never would have done this without subscribing to their thought! So what I would recommend for you is to give yourself an activity. In a moment where you feel an increase of heartbeat, warming of the ears, etc 'write/draw the concept that came to mind or even anything that is within sight of your eyes'. Let the meaningless 10,000+ thoughts we think everyday float away because they don't really matter at all. What matters are these 5 seconds or so where you think a new thought. Now you can stimulate this reaction at anytime by exposing yourself to stimuli you've never before sought out. Like books or 'The Dead Poets Society' movie. Bookwise I would recommend 'The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. The more you spend time on these 5 second activation modes that spawn new thought, the more you will navigate back to the true north of that original high school you! Peace and Love ^^",8년 전,0,

Africa is very poor, you should see how much they take education seriously, some countries in Africa are in dire crisis, they have no choice but to make sure that their people are educated. In a more diverse or first-world-country, for instance, America, it is really the melting pot for different views, which includes education, religion, ethics, etc. Having to accommodate how people learn in a first world country, means you are teaching students who already have access to the internet, such as yourself, you are teaching students, who embrace and love free thinking, who have a choice in what they do.

My advice is work on self development everyday, OUTSIDE of school. learn your talents and who you are, and before you say you don't have any hold it, yes you do. really question everything. Don't listen to people who try to say you, ALWAYS listen to who is giving the advice, are they credible? why should I listen them? everyone has advice for you but usually no one has the right advice.

@CatFish21sm,"I disagree with his point of view. I don't disagree that schools kill creativity. But they kill everything.  From a psychological point of view you almost literally could not design a worst educational system than our school system. There's one thing every human has in common, no matter how smart, dumb, mental, creative, literal, you are. Every person loves, loves, loves to learn! Loves to learn about everything, art, history, science, math, everything, anything. Everyone, I don't care what you say or who you are you love to learn. That's because the human brain is built for one purpose and one purpose only, to learn. It does this very well, and it loves to do this a lot. in order to build a computer that could hold the same information as one human brain it would have to be the size of our sun, with an equally large cooling system. but it still wouldn't be as fast or accurate. Our brain rewards us for learning, makes us happy when we learn something new, its one of the greatest feelings you can experience. But our schools are the best systems that we could ever come up with to make us hate learning. They are the only things on this earth that can make us hate learning. They are soo good at making us hate learning that 1.2 million people drop out of highschool every year in America alone. of those that go to college about 44% drop out before completing any degree whatsoever. If you gathered all of the best psychologists in the world then they couldn't design a worst system of education then the one that we use to teach our children if they tried.  We shouldn't make art a priority we should make changing our whole school system a priority!  The problem is we're stuck in a rut. People hate to change, to try new things. Its like he said we're afraid of failure, so it's so hard to succeed. We found something that works, not well, not efficiently, barely at all, but it works... or so it appears. So we don't want to change it. We're afraid to change it.  Give me a school a good budget and 10 years and I'll have highschool students graduating with a doctorates degree and 3.5/4 minimum GPA's. and the most important part, they will be the happiest kids in the world, they will love to learn and they will beat all of their competition hands down because they will be so good at learning. They will be writing books, reading empirical research, studying everything they can, not because me or anyone else will tell them to, but because they will want to, it will be their leisure activity. instead of a fashion or pop culture magazine they will be picking up science today. They'll be reading books about quantum physics and string theory as a little bit on the side right next to harry potter.  And last but not least, they will revolutionize this world, advance our technology and understanding of reality further and faster than the past fifty years.  Oh and they will love and appreciate art, all forms of art, just as much.  We're teaching our kids how to avoid learning, Psychologists could teach them how to love learning.

We certainly need to jettison anything that isn't centered on the needs of the child, including an insatiable curiosity which we can nourish rather than build walls to contain.  I think schools are a big part of the creation of criminality as well.  Kids who are forced to fit where they don't fit get angry and rebel, often to the extent that they self destruct as they try to destroy the box they are forced into.  Our children are the most important reason why we have a society.  All knowledge we have is or could be contained in a library and on the internet.  Kids need to cooperatively and collaboratively investigate who they are, what they are curious about, who is willing to devote the time they are to mastering something, whether it is dance, carpentry, gold smithing, jewelry making, figuring out the universe that surrounds them, comparing value systems around the world and how these value systems have created values to answer basic human questions and offer them the chance to develop their own answers, modify their own answers, consider the value systems of others, and learn to work with older kids and adults as well as younger kids and adults.  I developed a program where high school kids would work with 3rd grade kids to help them to be valued, and challenged.  The jocks in the school decided that didn't create the industrial peons industries need, even those those industrial jobs had left the country.  We need inventors, explorers, lovers, challengers, caregivers, helpers, scientists, optimists and pessimists, as well as many other professionals,  We need to terminate the high tech industry exploitation of foreign born scientists and technologists because we can't get enough kids to want to advance their skills and curiosity in the sciences and technologies.  We need to stop the drug culture that is created by kids to escape the painful life they life in schools being forced to produce tonnage rather than self awareness and an exploration that follows their curiosity.  Genius comes from turning humans loose to dream big and explore.  Of course they need guidance.  But that guidance must not be something that creates resentments.  Give kids the chance to be wrong.  Its a good way to learn.  Keep them safe but let them life a full childhood as they weave back and forth towards their adult contributions to intellectual growth.",9년 전,0,

@histake1,"Awesome TED talk. My key takeaways from here from Sir Robinson's talk - ""The goal of school education should not only be literacy, but also creativity"" Nextly, the assertion at the end of the seminar - ""If all inspects were to disappear from the face of the earth today - in 50 years, all life will disappear from earth. However, if all humans disappear from the Earth today, in 50 years, all forms of life will flourish within the next 50 years. We have a gift called ""Imagination"" and we have a responsibility to use it carefully as we owe it to our grandchildren and children"". I couldn't but agree more...Men and women should use imagination responsibly for positive purposes and not regressive or negative creativity. Which is why, we should have work - which is something that comes from our passion. There is a myth out there that rich people do not need to work, it6 is sufficient if they do wealth management and just dedicate their life to one goal- ""Enjoyment/Pleasure seeking""...nothing could be farther from the truth. An idle mind is the devil's workshop. The proportion of work to pleasure should always be of a healthy balance - even for the well endowed.",9년 전,1,

There are other things that are affected, so it's not just this-and-that answers.  Let's talk about society in general though. You see, large structures are much harder to change than they are to build. Society is no different.  Think of dominoes, where you can put each piece down slowly and gently, but once it becomes large enough, it's hard to go back and change any mistakes you might've made.  A better example would be a 100+ story building. Yeah, building it was difficult, but eventually it needs to be changed drastically to fit the times. Knocking it down would be dangerous and costly, not to mention having to rebuild it while a city now exists around it, where before, it may have been clear. Fixing it bit-by-bit is probably the best way in this case. It's a slow process, especially considering the building may be actively used while being fixed, but it works efficiently enough in many angles.  That's how society is. It's not something we can just bulldoze and start again. We have to fix it bit-by-bit. 10 years has not been long enough, especially since we have other issues going on at the same time. Regardless, just because there hasn't been a change doesn't mean you should just give up and go home. If no one wants to change anything, then nothing will change. Also, that's selfish of you to claim that because you're not giving credit to those who put into changing the system. Carry on and help the best you can. That's all anyone can do.",8년 전,5,

I've personally never seen this video before, but i've read lots of books and stuff said or written by academically acknowledged educators and just very smart people like Dawkins, Hitchens, Neil, Alan Watts, from Wim Hoff to Elon Musk, you name it. And even before that i never thought to myself that my children will go to school.   I've been aware of the education system being a failure for a long time, hence my dislike of having a kid enroll in a school, but after watching this, I'm actually very happy that my kid will go to school =) I'm only 25, and already found the woman i'll spend the rest of my life with. If i'm not unlucky af, my kid will start going to school, i guess, 2030. After the world changes. And we becoma a type 3 civilization and prosper as humans. It's either that, or there probably won't be any schools left to go to, and we go back to square one.. but i digress.  So my message, to anyone bothering to read this comment, would be to prepare yourself for the bubble. Things will change worldwide in less than a decade. Alot less. My predictions are these:  We will add 10 000 years to our calendar (look up holocene calendar i think) Mind controled bionic limbs with a sense of touch will become commercially available (tech already exists) Everyday technology we use will become microscopic Artificial Intelligence will take over 80% - 90% of human labor  All this will be catapulted into existence when someone thinks of a way to spread certain types of awarenesses to certain regions, through an app or a blog, and play with the world structure a bit, variants of real life people like V and Evey.

Many schools and places of learning are making changes but it's a bit like a new operating  system trying to challenge Microsoft! Another challenge is that teachers are products of that system and it is ingrained. Schools tend to be cautious by nature- they are exam factories and their results are used by governments as a metric of success/failure. Innovation and risk taking are alien to the culture of most educational establishments as a result of this. It's all pot luck if your kids are lucky enough to be taught by an inspirational teacher in an innovative sympathetic nurturing learning environment- sadly most aren't. They deserve better,7년 전,2,

The education system only values a few subjects that may very well hinder our creativity. ""everyone is a genius, if u judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree then it will spend its whole life thinking that it's stupid"" ~Albert Einstein That is a perfect example of what's happening today.For a person who loves music we cannot just judge their intelligence by how well they understand the periodic table. And if we are so big on being innovative then why are we all taught the same text book in the same way and have to sit for the same test. You can't just pour 10 glasses of water and expect one of them to fly into the air.

For example, right now I'm an freshman Engineering student but for a long time I had the desire to be a basketball player (which I was pretty good at) or a DJ (which I still have passion for), but dropping out would be a bad idea, as in today you have tons of them + it's more about the fate.

@wardenofmymusic5640,"Oh the data on that is crystal-clear, there's a negative correlation between school grades and creativity (~Dr. Jordan B Peterson). Because the system doesn't want you to be creative. Why? Imagine you give a creative child a task. It will find his own way, create his solution, something new. Well how are you gonna measure this? You have one set of criteria for all students, so you want to measure how precisely they repeat exactly what the teacher had told them before. Just like you have one teacher. Every student has his own needs, talents, interests. Still, the teacher presents the information in one way to all students, who all differ in learning methods^^ I absolutely agree with you, that school should make children creative, because that's exactly what we need! Adaptive, creative problem-solvers! Not people who are smart enough to accurately repeat what they're told and follow orders, and dumb enough to think this makes them smarter than everyone else.

It's almost as we're not even a part of the school, we're ""those"" students, the ones who don't really do anything, the ones who aren't good or smart enough for another major.  It really upsets me that the art major (that i actually wanted to do more than music) got removed only one year before i started high school and the music major is really close to getting removed too, and nevermind theatre and dance, those got removed years ago.  p.s When i say high school and major I'm really just using what's closest to how it works here in sweden, we don't really have majors and minors and ""high school"" doesn't work in the same way at all here.",9년 전,0,

And reading some of the comments on here about joy being taken from education shows that this really is important and people need to notice it!  My aim for this petition is to launch the start of Relationship Education classes for young people. Where we can teach children the values of trust, respect, loyalty, communication, love, and integrity in the right way. Our kids deserve to grow up happy and I believe with the start of this classes we can ensure they learn the most valuable life skills that will help them throughout their entire life.   We have all made mistakes growing up but wouldn't it have been great if someone were there to guide us through and share with us their own experiences so we can be aware of how important the decisions we make now will effect us in the long run? Could this one class change many peoples lives for the better?

My parents caught on and I would be punished for every page torn out of my notebook. So I stopped. I never drew anything ever again.

Well this in itself is ofcourse smart cause the problem capitalism is trying to solve is how do we as a people provide for ourselves.

@ethanwintill9865,"+Piet Baudoin that would make sense but comanies trying to profit themselves typically helps people, it has to if the price is becomes too low (to make it affordable to the poor) then the companies earn less (if any) profit. Company growth also slows as theres less money to spend on growth. These two factors make less food producers and so everyone still has food everyone is starving because there is so little available (i.e. USSR China DPRK).

@Khvost_,"+Kunal Garg I can. He begins with a question of philosophy. About the sound and a forest. It is all about the meaning of sound. Because sound as we know it doesn't exist, it's just certain waves. What we call sound is what we hear. So if there is noone to hear there is no sound! You can read a lot about that problem. --- The joke is about relationships between men and women. As a man he obviously portrays it from the men's point of view. All women think that they are right and men don't understand and don't know a thing - so they (men) are always wrong. (""Women from Venus and men from Mars"" is all about that). In his joke there is a man talking. And so if there is no woman nearby - he can't really be wrong because there is noone to think that he is wrong. It all has a connection to another phylosophic qouestion - can someone be wrong in terms of truth and lies - if he is the only one human being? It applies in linguistics especially. If you are the only one who speaks and understands the language - you can never be wrong, because nobody can tell you that you are wrong. And that brings us to another point. If there is noone to point that we are wrong - there are no rules at all. And if there are no rules - there is no language because language is about two things - sound and rules. I've probably gone to far, he ment just a man-woman thing. I hope you understand.",9년 전,1,

I have looked at private and Montessori schools in Ontario more specifically in proximity to me so Richmond Hill and Vaughan and found the Reggio system to be very interesting and creative in the way they address education.

Even when I went into film school, something that I really wanted to do, I ended up dropping out because I was afraid of getting low grades since I was convinced that low grades automatically meant that I wasn't cut out for the very thing I wanted to do. Ultimately, I ended up majoring history for no other reason other than the fact that I had my best grades in social studies were the classes I did best in; no emotional investment in it whatsoever.

Funny thing,  I usual got As and Bs with little effort (reason I was bored, school had no challenge for me).  I actually remember only a few classes I enjoyed and those where consider the hardest the school had, also those where the same classes where I gave my all which in turn I had 100s in.  I have actually taken a few college classes and been told since little they where suppose to be hard.  Well, let's say, I was disappointed and bored out of my mind except for the art class where actually putting skill and knowledge to work was very enjoyable.  The school systems definitely need a huge rework.  Heck, even the colleges and universities could use one as well.

@DerekMagill,"Compulsive public education is an outrage.  Consider this:  Children spend maybe 2 hours per day with their families. The rest is at school and in after school programs. This is a problem.  Children spend up to 8 hours per day sitting in the classroom.  From K-12, students interact primarily with people of the exact same age, experiences, knowledge and skills, yet they're supposed to function properly in the real world?  Students are habituated to following rules and seeking merit badges and accolades from authority figures, rather than creating real value.  The solution is not just a matter of reform. It's not just a top down fix from a bureaucrat in Washington. We need to end this system and allow students and families to explore other options.",10년 전,83,

@Atilla_the_Fun,"+Derek Magill ""Children spend maybe 2 hours per day with their families. The rest is at school and in after school programs. This is a problem. Children spend up to 8 hours per day sitting in the classroom"" Absolutely agree with you there, school hours should be cut down, especially in high school with specialization of subjects. Combine that with more efficient teaching (I remember that 3rd to 6th grade was essentially the same information just repeating itself).   ""From K-12, students interact primarily with people of the exact same age, experiences, knowledge and skills, yet they're supposed to function properly in the real world?"" I don't see the problem with this, Ignoring the fact that they are interacting with teachers, yes, it makes sense to socialize with people of your age group. You must realize that the difference between a 7 year old and 17 year old is not the same as the diff between a 27 and 37 year old (in terms of socialization).   ""Students are habituated to following rules and seeking merit badges and accolades from authority figures, rather than creating real value.""

@scottmiller5331,"+Wise Liar How old are children who can make their own decisions about education? Educated children can understand whether their education is important. How old are you when you realize that you would benefit from focusing on something other than public school? Because until that age, challenging children to try what is difficult, be it making new friends (which terrifies some children but is amazingly important) or trying to solve math problems or trying to spell words, is necessary so they can find what really inspires them. So you may think we arent appreciating the rights of children when we make them go to school, but give me an age at which children are ready to make their own choices about their education, with real evidence, and ill give you a chance. I think 18 is the age when children really are able to understand all of the variables and make their own choices. So when you graduate high school, you can be done if youd like.

To understand something, asking should be an option for others to expand their knowledge on one thing, or more than that, really.  Not all subjects in the old education system grants you the education you need to survive in adulthood. In that situation, you'd have to learn other things yourself; cooking, laundry, etc. If you are lucky to have people willing to help you, then you get the help you need and learn from others.

All it does is waste people's childhoods and precious time away, with something that is both useless and stressful for them. The only thing actually important in school is literature and truly basic math (plus and minus). Then, the way most (if not all) countries educate is just straight-up harmful. You have to somehow become a sponge and absorb twenty kinds of different information, only to spew it on a piece of paper to prove you remembered something, rather than learned something by heart. Plus all the pressure from educators, family, and even friends. If schools are to exist, they should be 100% optional (including not needing a school degree to enter college), with no obligatory tests, no pressuring students to do well, and with hours reduced (which already works in finland, which uses 4 hours of school so the children can have equal time to play/sleep/do whatever and learn).

How does he even know she had ADHD? Does this ""speaker"" even understand psychiatric disorders? Also people have written about ADHD well before 1900. But regardless of this, you can't use a single example and generalize. You have to use the scientific method. You know, the stuff we learned as kids. A single trial with a sample space of one means nothing. You have to do multiple experiments with a large sample space. You have to isolate the variables. Perhaps the girl had gotten lucky because of her unique situation and nothing to do with her ""creative"" actions.  Did this ted speaker looked at meta analysis of multiple children having found extreme success in creative fields because they were completely encouraged to never go through mechanized and formal learning?  Wait, but the title of the video ""do schools kill creativity?"" implies that the subject aka the video would answer that question. How would you like a question you have to be answered?  Well, if you know the person has knowledge, like for example a university prof. you will take it on face value with some background behind it. If you ask a person who has doctorate in education learning the same question you will listen their answer and take it as a information from a primary source.   This ted speaker is not information from primary source. He is presenting data from other sources. Clearly he is a great speaker, but we all learned in school, certainly not in dance class, that you have to cite your sources.   This man presents no graphs outlying the problems students face with education. There is no analysis of how the formality of current education systems have left people to not have creative solutions to problems for the real world.   The problem with education is that most of us don't know what science is - or in more general terms - an ability to think abstractly with logic. You would not logically draw general conclusions from an experiment with no control and a single same space. In easier terms, lets say you flip a coin once and get  heads.

@tovsteh,"1. I agree that schools have become a kid storage facility for children while the adults are at work, teaching them one-size-fits-all random things just for the sake of teaching, and have them remember the information long enough to pass a test. Most Parents of course think this is good, but is it effective?  2. School also serve a more valuable purpose; socializing. This can go both ways if stopping bullying is not a primary initiative, but school is a place where kids learn how to socialize and interact with other kids, which is probably the most important knowledge they'll take away from attending school in the first place.  3. Other than maths, a bit of history and languages, I find that most of what I was taught over the decades I have attend school has been forgotten, because 95% of it has been either uninteresting or inapplicable to daily life. All the skills I utilize in my career have been taught through on-the-job experience. Do we really need 2 decades of school to apply for a job?  4. Why do schools not prepare children for life?

@Dev518,"+toasteh The socializing argument is bunk. If anything, school is antisocial. It forces people to interact with each other that wouldn't do so if they were free. There is nothing desirable about people interacting with others that are the same age, becaue the real world does not place you into sctrict age based groups. If anything, school discourages people from finding friends that aren't their own age. Many kids are harshly bullied which leads to less socialization than when they entered school. Their is an authoirty that children go to in school to resolve their problems instead of working them out themselves. The actual amount of time spend socializing is very minimal and it is ended by bells that tell children when socializing is allowed. If a child does not go to school, there is no reason that they cannot be socialized. Homeschooling/unschooling groups, sports, internships, other activities, and daily life allow for plenty of socializing. It's not as if a child that doesn't attend school will sit at home all day every day and only interact with their family.",10년 전,17,

@tovsteh,"Dev518 ""It forces people to interact with each other that wouldn't do so if they were free.""  - I agree, but disagree with your problem. It 'forces' in the sense that it teaches the kids to deal with people they usually would not hang around, and if not just observe them and try to understand them. Its not always perfect, but what is in nature? Most of these kids build their relationships by attending educational institutions and discover their identify by discovering other people's. Yes, school takes up a lot of time, but I'm not arguing that; Im simply saying that socializing has a function in educational institutions.",9년 전,1,
@jaquelynngering3586,"toasteh That can have negative effects. Learning to just deal with what you're given instead of trying to get something better isn't necessarily a good thing. When I was in college I was extremely picky about which professor's classes I would take. I didn't want 'easy' classes, or classes with professors who were reputed to be poor teachers.  For the basic GURs the first two years I was in college, when I registered for a class it would just say ""staff."" So you picked the class that best fit your schedule and hoped for a good teacher. When the professors were announced for the courses, I would go back to the registration office and change my whole schedule to take classes from the professors I wanted, not only transferring out of classes where the professor was had a reputation for being lazy or a bad teacher, but trying to get into classes with the professors who had a reputation for being the most challenging.  Most of my peers were content to leave their schedules be, whatever staff was assigned to teach their classes. Some of those professors and courses has a major impact on my career decisions. Who knows what would have happened if I had just settled for whatever staff I happened to get in the first round of registration?",9년 전,3,

@tovsteh,"Jaquelynn Gering As with everything in life, not everything applies 100% to everybody, period. But fact of the matter is that over-protective parents and the isolation kids in the form of homeschooling is more often than not not an effective way for a child to develop social skills. These kids often experience social isolation when introduced because people often find them awkward. And even you started socializing at university; a place where I had some of the best memories and met some of the most fantastic people of my life, including my girlfriend. Suddenly the ""popular high school click"" was unpopular, and they learned something from that too. All I'm saying is that humans are social creates by nature, introverts as well as extroverts, and we all exchange ideas and discover our identities through socializing with assholes as well as legends. Why limit such exposure?",9년 전,1,
@jaquelynngering3586,"toasteh ""But fact of the matter is that over-protective parents and the isolation kids in the form of homeschooling is more often than not not an effective way for a child to develop social skills."" No. That is not ""fact of the matter."" There are no facts whatsoever to support the claim that homeschoolers do no receive adequate socialization. What you stated is merely an opinion and a rather ignorant one at that, as you seem to be going completely off stereotypes. ""even you started socializing at university"" That isn't even CLOSE to what I said. I said that in University, no one could even guess that I had been homeschooled. Jumping from that to making the wild and ridiculous assumption that I did not socialize until college is just silly.  Now, I did say some homeschooled kids feel like they don't fit in. That doesn't mean they don't socialize and it's not terribly surprising or worrying, given that many public-schooled children also feel like they don't fit in. It's a pretty normal feeling for most high school and middle school kids to have at some point or another.  ""Why limit such exposure?"" Because there's nothing to suggest that less socialization is detrimental to a child, and there's plenty of data that proves it's a much more effective way of educating. ",9년 전,5,

@benjaminolds,"flatball2009 I'd like to propose a question to you as a rebuttal to your stance.  If children aren't exposed to these areas of intellectual development, how can they know if they want to pursue that subject?  It's easy to say you don't need it because you don't want to do job x.  Without exposure to that field though, how can you know if you DO want to do that job?  Obviously you didn't enjoy biology nor poetry.  I'm with you there, buddy!  I partially agree that students don't need to become experts in each and every field, but without exposing them to enough of it to get their heads around it, they may never find that IS something they want to pursue.   At the end of the day, I'm more against our current educational system than for it.  However, reducing it down to the basics that people need to manage a checkbook and communicate isn't enough though to ensure that we stay a successful and prosperous society.  How many doctors have served you that never would have if not for an interest in biology?  How many fruits and vegetables would have never made it to your table if not for botany?  Would you be able to retire or afford your home mortgage if not for the people who found complex mathematics interesting and eventually built the banking industry we rely (too) heavily on?  Would the products you fill your home with get to you if not for the planes, automobiles, bridges, boats, and tunnels that engineers designed?  Each of these fields are just examples where someone found that spark of curiosity and ran with it because of exposure at a younger age.   There are those of us who don't find that spark in school and either find a way to get by or discover the curiosity for ourselves, but why not expose students to areas that can very well open them to opportunities down the road?  Worst case scenario, that student learns that they don't fit into any of the major fields of study covered and they have significantly reduced down what they don't want to do as an adult.",10년 전,4,

@benjaminolds,"flatball2009 So, do we have a single teacher per each student so students can jump from one subject to the next at their whim, or do students get to electively skip classes when it's a subject they don't want to take?  For structured school systems to realize that system, one of these two methods would have to be utilized.  The first is economically unrealistic   We can't afford to pay teachers what they're worth at that rate.  Not only that, but there are enough teachers who have no business teaching but are able to keep their jobs because there's not enough available teachers to fill their position.  In that environment, we could never staff the need.  In the second scenario you risk another problem.  What's to keep a student from electing to never attend classes out of laziness, lack of any interest, or other personal agendas.  Ideally, parents would help there, but any public school teacher can tell you that parents aren't accountable enough the way it is.  So in that environment, a student could elect to skip a vast majority of their exposure because they don't believe it matters to them.   Neither of these scenarios result in a society with more motivated and educated students than we currently have.

Now that I'm a junior in high school, I don't read as much nor write nearly as much as I'd like. There's all this talk and planning for college and SATs/ACTs.

@djw11111,"""Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything, isn't that true?"" ""When I was a student, if you had a degree you had a job"" (12:38)  So on the one hand the speaker is denigrating the worth of a degree because it doesn't get you a job, and on the other he is wondering why maths is at the top of the hierarchy of subjects and dance is at the bottom. (08:51) Maybe it's because Most mathematics graduates generally have jobs, dance graduates generally don't?  Yet the ""benign advice"" from others not to do music or art because you won't get a job is ""profoundly mistaken"". (11:50)  This is very basic and very confused.  I am saddened that this is the most watched TED talk, it seems to be little more than a feel good video (""all children have tremendous talents"" (03:05) - Do they?, ""all children are born artists."" (06:20)- Are they?) with few actual attempts at insights/contentions which are:  ""Creativity is as important as literacy""  I think saying creativity is an important consideration in children's education would have made more sense - as he offers no measure of importance by which the two could be considered equal. This is a banal statement though - it's nothing new.  ""Mistakes are the worst thing you can make"" In many subjects, including in most jobs, they are - and it's vital not to make them - accuracy is a virtue in many fields.  ""The whole purpose of public education [currently] is to produce university professors"" No. Those who understand the course the most are most suited to being the professors as they can build upon the collection of knowledge and understanding we currently have. Those that don't understand the course should do the best they can and apply it in real life.  ""Creativity: the process of having original ideas that have value"" A good definition, along with the criticism of ADHD this is the useful content of the video, the rest of it is telling jokes.",10년 전,0,

I also loved his connection to Gillian Lynne!  What a fantastic example of what we are doing to an outstanding number of children.   It seems that every student these days is classified as ADD, ADHD, etc.. the list goes on and on.  And instead of giving these students an outlet through the arts or sports, we medicate them and make them think that they have a disability.  In Gillian's case, what is considered a learning disability now is what brought her the greatest happiness and success in life.  It's amazing to think about what would not be the way it is today if people like Gillian were told to ""calm down"".

So it's (comparatively) easy to throw together an equation which explains all sort of complex physical phenomena (mind you, even so there's a lot that hasn't yet been explained in the physical word), but economic phenomena defy attempts to pin them down with equations.

@EEEL123,"megalibra82 Well, there are improvements which are pretty obvious - for example, if you lack the rule of law and don't have secure property rights and you want a strong and entrepreneurial economy, well, good luck to you. By not everything is so clean-cut. Take, for example, the issue of free trade. Most economists believe that free trade is, on balance, beneficial for developing countries (and I happen to agree), and very few would advocate out-right protectionism, but then you have people like Joseph Stiglitz who argue that capital controls of some sort still need to exist even if you can freely trade goods and services, and others who believe in a limited form of protectionism for the protection of 'infant industries'. There are success stories on both sides, of course, but there are so many variables that you can never know for sure. And free trade isn't the only issue people snipe about.  The other problem is that many ruling elites have a vested interest in a system that is dysfunctional for most other people. This is a problem even in developed countries - witness, for example, the disconcerting level of influence lobby groups have over American government policy - but it's far more serious in countries like North Korea (to name an extreme example), Iran and Russia etc. So even if we found a magic bullet for all the world's ills, the question is, would there be the political will to fire it?",10년 전,0,

It is a rather sad sight that students who want to take a course such as chemistry AP will generally need to consider first and foremost the effects on GPA. Students will drop out because in a university level class they got 70% for the first term, At most universities this is the average across all students.    The effect is inflated grades as more and more people are told to drop difficult courses, which then goes on in a chain reaction as standards become more strict due to students who took the minimum number of classes at the minimum level of difficulty as the other option means risking being derailed from education.",10년 전,0,

@G1vr1x,"13:21 Recognize the dynamic power of intelligence.  It's quite surprising Sir Robinson exposes that just before interrupting himself to expose supposedly specifications of brain between men and women. This implying that intelligence is mostly static, conditioned by the brain we are born with.  Of course we can't deny data from statistical study of the brain, women may have tendency to dispose of a differently shaped corpus callosum compared to men. But how can we be sure about the significance of those innate differences if the environment, the activities of the person, remodels the brain to adapt to the tasks. Typically musicians are also known to develop this region of the brain. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum#Other_correlations So the influence of gender may and should be contrasted with other influences on which anyone can act on ; so that we may stop redirect people from what they want to be to what they are most certainly capable of. And this links perfectly with the subject : education can have a leading role on self determination, which implicitly means to contradict every stereotypes on categorization (call it gender, social class, race, hair color, anything...)  Robinson seams to mean that education should be about everyone's emancipation in respect of an ""inner nature"", while it's commonly seen as a conditioning to comply to what society expects. But there is a misconception here, the ones in charge of eduction will still decide for the educated subjects what is their inner nature. Freedom can be seen not only as the pursue of one's goals of personal well being but also as the will to adequate to a situation and contribute to general well being. Yes it's all about individualism and collectivism, about ""shaping oneself"" without ""crushing"" it. But can anyone be ethically in charge of this excepted oneself ?",10년 전,0,

@kushsharma3798,"The problem with these kind of talks is that they focus only on the exceptions. What about the 1000 other Jileans who danced but ended up being broke, and ultimately disappointed with their lives. I'm in no way trying to discourage people from pursuing their dreams but I feel everything should be done with the right balance of mind and heart.  The thing about life is that our beliefs, passions and outlook is forever changing because life itself in never constant. So many people believe that life will be full of roses and gardens ONCE they find some dream job, but when they do get it, they relaise it all wasn't as good as they expected and then immediately start setting some other scenario as their promised land.  The wiser thing to do is to make sure you are enjoying your life in the present moment. If you hate your job, then set a logical target income that you can save that can allow you to quit the job to pursue something else. But don't delay life itself. Life may become better in the future or it may become worse you will never know. But this moment right here is the only one where you can say for sure that you can do what you enjoy in some form or the other.  Just to cite my own example. I have left over 15 jobs within the last 5 years in search for something better but every time I found a situation which I initially believed to be blissful quickly turned out to be something I did not expect. Nowadays I'm working on making photography my profession since it's what I love doing. But who knows whether it will work out or not. So instead of delaying my life totally, I live and enjoy my life right now as much as I can and at the same time keep working towards my goal. But this way of living makes me unattached to the outcome of the goal. So if it all doesn't work out in the end, I might be disappointed but not devastated for I'll know I did not give up life totally for this dream. Basically, the idea should always be to live in the present and make sure that we are enjoying to the fullest.",10년 전,1,

@NewbulaCo,"The difference between the speed at which people answer questions lies in their psychology/personality, I believe. People who tend to be outgoing, known as extroverts, have the tendency to answer questions quicker but with less accuracy, but people who are more in their own minds and quiet, namely introverts like to take their time, being extra careful and comparing their choices. Research shows that people can inherit these traits. So to which is smarter: both types of people, energetic and sensitive, have survived since the dawn of mankind, which can explain how useful both types are, and how much we need both types...  I got all that info from this book I've bought, ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts"" written by Susan Cain, who coincidentally has actually made a TED talk. She talks about what she covers in the book. I really valued all the information, since, I'm a self-proclaimed introvert and like you, I always find myself concentrating hard on one question at a time and making sure I have it right. On my practice SATs I fell a few questions short on each section since they're timed, about 30 mins (I think) for each, and you can't go back. I'm pretty sure I got a good percentage of correct answers on the ones I tried, though...",10년 전,2,

@jacob8949,"If always baffles me how exams are such an antithesis for the real world ( I am going to talk strictly about examinations regarding maths and science, as I have little to no experience of other subjects); you are not allowed for confer with others, you cannot substantiate your answers using source material, and you are most certainly not applying your knowledge in an innovative way. So long as you can remember a standardised list of relevant facts, you will be alright (sometimes you're even given a formula sheet!).  However, employees are not looking for someone who can reel off a long list of facts, as a trained parrot could... they are looking for someone who brings something new to the table; someone who can apply their knowledge critically and creatively in order to solve a problem i.e. to enhance that company's position. The current education system is far too rigid, and focuses far too often on memory tests rather than true innovation.  In my experience, group research projects are by far the most effective way of simultaneously learning/ applying the source material creatively, whilst simulating a working environment, and this is something I would love to see more of within education.  ",10년 전,1,

@ANTICARBONTAX,"Yeah it is but it goes hand in hand with hard work, I also got that advice at about 15 but that advice was off topic, the real point is allot of teachers especially the older ones who only want a pay check and easy job need to be weeded out, another problem I had was I had a hard time with pressure reading comprehension so in an exam I would need to read a question 3-5 times in order to understand and answer it, so in my exams I would only ever complete about 75% of the exam and I remember my science teacher asking""why are you so happy you only got 75%"" and my reply was "" I only completed 75% of the exam"". So how do you guys feel about short timed exams? My opinion is if a person doesn't know the answer no amount of time will save them and also who is smarter a person that answers  correct 100% of the questions but needs an extra 30mins in the exam or a person who completes the exam in the original time 30mins quicker but only answers correctly 85% of the questions???

@MrPikaPwnage,"Sorry, I once made an abstract assumption (on dextromethorphan, however) one day that all creative metaphor/analogies/allegories were actually wrong. That is that every time someone uses something in place of another for a statement or argument as opposed to proper diction they are[Let's take... idk ""cut drugs, your life will fade otherwise"" or maybe ""all in all, it's just another brick in the wall"" as an example]: A) mixing up the meaning (Anyone could receive the message completely incorrectly from lack of concrete idea [ex: fade being not a clear term/slang; just like the definition of drugs;]); B) not receive the message at all; or C) speaking to the choir (People who understand the message will be the only ones to hear it, therefore the message hasn't spread.) This, to me, applies to all artistic mediums of messages, which they are, we are information gatherers/hosts, as well as sarcasm/etc being unclear enough to be rightfully misunderstood (I almost cry for the species which tells each other something that means the 'exact' opposite of what they say). Be reminded of Occam's razor and abstractions of all kinds for this idea.  I'm wondering how this factors into the idea that creativity should be better proliferated through education, if at all, realistically.  Maybe I've just read a little too much on Buddhist non-dualism to understand english anymore; almost as if it's all useless description with no utility more than subjective perceptions of a power of superiority; almost as if death is a shared inevitable and almost as if Descartes' ""I think therefore I am"" is the only certain truth after all.",10년 전,0,

And if it is cause by all those environmental factors, then no wonder there seems to be an epidemic. Anyway, you know if you have ADD if you can't stay focused on the task at hand for about 30 minutes. Taking a break after 30 or 45 minutes is normal. Then back to the task, or maybe a different task.  Normal people actually display ADD when ill.  As for hyperactivity, that is rather normal for children, but that too may show up in excess due to the environmental factors mentioned.   When we see that an inordinate percent of black boys in the USA have a diagnosis of ADD/ADHD we do wonder if the disorder is genetic...but then these kids come from crappy American Black Culture homes where they are awash in all the environmental factors that may be the cause.  And add to that all the emotional disorder in that community.  I do think that if one placed a bunch of ADD/ADHD diagnosed American Black kids in a Buddhist monastery in say, Tibet, that all their symptoms would vanish.",11년 전,0,

@elinat2414,"It all comes down to the value schools place upon individual subjects. In the Australian system, this becomes blatantly obvious in the 'scaling' of individual subjects before a student's mark for their final year of schooling is released. Results for Maths and Science subjects are scaled up. The most extreme example is one Maths course where a mark of 40% can get you a scaled result of 90%. On the other hand, subjects like Music and Dance scale down (sometimes as much as 20 points below your original mark). This is because Maths and the Sciences are more valued and students that choose them are perceived as being smarter and working harder. Yes, maybe in the case of some individuals this is true, but the fact that they are making this notion universal perfectly demonstrates what Sir Ken is talking about here.

Bet you dont even know who Peter Thiel is? Technology has not changed in 60 years. FACT. In the last 60 years Apple (the supposed great tech company) got or rather stole something (computer) already invented decades before and put it into a phone (already invented before Apple) in which it controls any person who uses it. Take a look at the video ""Apple never invented anything"".  Technology is not changing. Technology is being hoarded by large companies for decades.

@rh001YT,"Marc Van Buuren Ahem, me thinks it you who is living in a fantasy land. That it takes time to perfect technologies does not mean that technology is not moving forwards. How small is that microprocessor in your cellphone?  How big would that same processor have been 60 years ago?  You compare a smartphone to telco of 60 years ago? Did telephones in the 1950s show maps and directions for your destination? Did they allow you to see images of just about everything?  Deliver the news?  Shheesh!  And there is plenty of new tech, such as genetic engineering, stem cell therapy, growing new organs and skin in the lab, the blind are beginning to see, nano-tech (I love the micro-fiber cloths for auto-detailing and cleaning in general - they really are superior), and the list really does go on.  What cave are you living it.     Anyway, it has been noted by many that it is quite normal for the various industrial and tech sectors to play out any and all known techs until the absolute limit of what can be done with them is reached, after which there can be a lull. However we are now in a time when such lulls may not happen as the new tech has been coming on even while the old tech is playing out.   If you just want to  be contrarian you could argue that the computer isn't anything new, as the abacus has been around for thousands of years.

@rh001YT,"***** Schools do teach critical thinking, but just the beginnings of that and the fundamentals.  In order to think critically you have to have fundamental knowledge with which to think. Anyway, ""critical thinking"" isn't a well-defined word, and it gets used for all sorts of different purposes.  But let's say ""critical thinking"" means asking ""how does that work?"".  Well, you have to know a lot just to begin to look into the matter, and that's part of the purpose of the education imparted by K-12 schools. For instance, in science class you learn all about stuff like mass, size, material hardness...that plants need nutrients in the soil as well as water and sunlight. You learn basic civics - do you really want more than that? And you learn geography - both natural and political (where nations are located...their boundaries...that India sticks out into the Indian Ocean...that China is across the Pacific Ocean from USA...  All that stuff, and history and sociology as well, prepare you to do something with that knowledge. But usually a university degree will be needed, cuz it's at uni that you really have to hunker down and take in a lot more detailed info and picture it all together in your mind.  Anyway, no one ever said that kids are not allowed to learn outside of school, and some always have, but most prefer not.

@MarkStanford,"rh001YT Look at the debate I mentioned with Peter Thiel and Marc Andressen. Technology has remained unchanged for 60 years. The stuff you mention was all discovered and created decades ago. Just because you dont see it in the market doesnt mean it hasnt been created. I seen 'photosynth' and 'musion technology' 10 years ago and still it hasnt been brought to the marketplace. The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first introduced in 1959. It took Steve Jobs 18 months to decide from thousands of colors of white what white he would use for a product. It took Apple how long before they brought out the ipad of which had already been invented 13 years previous. Stem Cell research is over 30 years being used for the same treatments. As for Genetic Engineering used since 1970, this will be the downfall of the human population. It is already killing thousands of americans annually and still they refuse to outlaw it. Look at the debate, then you will realise how uneducated you are about technology.  Your justifications just like Marc Andressen were shot down in seconds by Peter Thiel. The world we live in today is more drugged, polluted than anytime in history. It takes longer to fly from one destination in America than it did 60 years ago. Check it. How many hours before you take off have you to be at airport, TSA, and all the other trimmings...Get educated on very serious issues that the world faces today.  Contrary to what you believe we have still the same problems we had 60 years ago and nothing you have mentioned has indicated a leap in technology at what occured between 1900 and 1960. Nothing.  If you believe something has you need to open your eyes a bit wider and stop listening to BS from the media.",11년 전,2,
@rh001YT,"Marc Van Buuren Um, can you give a concrete example of stem cell treatments from 30 years ago, or 20?  Anyway, you at first claimed there to be nothing new in the last 60 years, but now you seem to be claiming that stem cell treatments are only 30 years old.   It does not take longer to fly from one destination to another than it did 60 years ago, but with increasing amount of air travel causing traffic delay into and out of an airport, TSA delays, etc, yes, one does have to alot time for that, and for short hops the time in the air may be only 30% of the time from home to final desitination. But again, you are playing this weird game of insisting that a peanut is a nut when in fact it is a legume.   It is quite possible that those with whom you disagree may not be ""listening to BS from the media"", and you only make your argument weaker with such assertions.    We really don't have the same problems as 60 years ago. Hepatitis C is now curable. One problem from 60 years ago was that incandescent lights burned out after a couple of years, and if a lamp got knocked over the filament usually broke. Now, white led lights last...well we don't really know, as they're all still going...maybe 20 to 25 years, and they keep working after the lamp is knocked over, and consume only about 12% of the electricity consumed by an incandescent lamp. In Los Angeles, where I live, I think all the street lights have been replaced with leds. That saves a lot of money cuz crews don't have to go out and replace them every few years, and those incandescent street lamps were expensive.    60 years ago India had virtually no middle class, just a small percent of rich people and the rest were impoverished. In the last 20 years India has zoomed ahead and now has a middle class larger that the middle class of USA and Canada combined. So the hopeless type of poverty that pervaded India 60 years ago is gone.  60 years ago, even 20 years ago, India had to import a lot of food.  Since about 2005 India has crossed the threshold and now grows enough food for all it's people and exports food as well.  I buy basmati rice from India.  So there's another prob from 60 years ago that is gone today. And I can buy that basmati rice from India at a price only slightly higher than USA grown rice (10 to 20 lb bags to get the best price).  So there's another problem solved: great basmati rice, sold in my neighborhood at a good price.   Anyway, it could be that current tech trends have changed the pattern of the old cycles, known as Schumpeter cycles, because each new refinement of the tech allows for further exploitation of the original tech and such may go on for a long time now.  According to Schumpeter theory, only when new tech based on old tech plays out all the way, and can yield no more refinements does capital flow into new research, as the profit margin of the latest, most refined tech will have diminished due to competition. The ""all played out"" point seems nowhere in sight, and capital is still flowing into refinements. Capital is also  being directed at selling product into developing nations, so at this point biz does not crave absolutely new inventions.   Did you know that drip irrigation is making deserts bloom, or rather, yield food? Sure, irrigation is as old as the earliest civilizations, but drip irrigation has really only taken off in a big way in the last 20 years.  Poor farmers in India, Mexico, Africa and elsewhere, who could only grow enough food to feed their family, can now, with drip irrigation, grow more than they need, the surplus being sold for money that they really need.  This is all new and good.  I suppose one could try to argue that there were robots 60 years ago, but whatever such thing existed then were mere curiousities. The first gen of really productive robots - welding arms on auto assembly lines - did not appear until, not sure, but I guess around 1980. But those robots were blind, and would weld a worker if he got in the way. Now the robots can see and will not weld if the object to be welded is not in place, or if something, like a person, is in the way.  There is indeed something quite wrong with you that you feel a need to insist that improvements, even really stellar improvements, do not constitute ""new"".  Everything is really only an improvement of what humans have always done, or wanted to do but couldn't yet make it happen.    Me thinks ye suffers from Debbie Downer syndrome, which is a type of schizophrenia.  If you continue down that path you will only get worse.  I've know two such Debbie Downers -0 one got better, the other got worse. The one who got better claims he got better by consciously making the choice to not over focus on the negative.",11년 전,0,
@walterneiss993,"rh001YT First off, If you really measure Evolution only by Massive Consumption such as Ipad, Ipod, computers, etc you are going to the wrong direction. That is not evolution, they didn´t create a product, they created a new market, a new brand. The revolution in communications comes after the Second World War. The rest is only improving an idea, and so many of them coming from Tesla too. It all cooperated to what we have now. Its nothing new. And the drip irrigation that you mentioned has been used from the Antiquity when jars of water clay were buried in order to infiltrating water gradually into the soil. The drip irrigation was developed in Israel because the country had water shortage, they wanted to take advantage of every drop. With the arrival of the modern plastics after the Second World War, it was developed  Micro-pipes of plastic and diverse types of droppers have been used in greenhouse in Europe and in The United States.  In Asia there is another system that was used for Milleniums too. It´s called the ""Terrace System"" to cultivate. The Guaranies have their own system that nowadays we all use. What i am trying to explain is that we use very old creations, and because of the ""LACKNESS"" of new ideas, we limit ourselves to improve them, and not more than that. And as we live in a globalized world, ideas are summerized in ""Consumption"" or every other that contributtes to the reduction of costs. Otherwise, they wouldn´t be ""Useful"". When radio was created, when the plane was created, when Leonardo Da Vinci got their best ideas, none of them were thinking about the lucrative part. They were curious and intelectual people with high level of creativity.   That´s why we don´t have any original idea because we limit ourselves to take old ideas to improve, and to kill or punish the new and revolutionary ones. Otherwise try to get into the science community to put against some of their theories. ",11년 전,1,
@rh001YT,"Walter Neiss It is said there is nothing new under the sun. One could say that radio was just an update on the carrier pigeon. The auto just an update of the horse-drawn carriage.  Micro fiber fabric just an update on fabric, which has been around for millenia.  I think you would agree that during the sceintific-industrial revolution of the 19th and early 20th century there were some really new inventions/discoveries. All that invention and discovery flowed out of the scientific investigations into what makes matter and energy tick.  All of that came from a few new ideas, like calculus, and refinement of older tech, such as lens grinding and the questioning of ""what's that made of?""  It just so happens that those new investigations into how stuff works caused a sudden bloom of new knowledge and stuff, yet all of it based on discovering more and more fundamental laws of physics.  Once any new 19th century discovery became known, the process began of using the knowledge to make stuff people wanted to buy, and to refining the knowledge to make yet even more new stuff.  But all the new stuff addressed ancient and universal human needs and wants.  As we dig deeper into what makes things tic, matter and energy, we are just the present day part of the same old process.  And as I said, all the new stuff comes from learning about the laws of physics.  So you seem to be dissatisfied that no really startling new laws of physics have been discovered - but then you should know that all the laws of physics of the different realms - mechanics, chemistry, light, etc all tie together at the Quantum level, meaning, that it is unlikely that many, or any, new laws of physics will be discovered.  It certainly could be the case that such discoveries have reached their conclusion, there being only gravity that still confounds.  but there is no lack of creativity, or clamp on creativity in the sciences, and attempts to figure out gravity are ongoing and require a lot of creative insight. But that particular problem turns out to be very difficult to solve.  But did you know that only lately, with the deployment of the GPS system, have we seen the first implementation of Einsteins hunch about a connection between gravity and time. The time signal from the GPS satellites is fudged with a correction factor to take into account the fact that time in GPS orbit is not the same as time on the surface of the earth. It was in the 1970s that Einstein's hunch was first validated, flying atomic clocks in super sonic jets at a very high altitude. So it took time to both invent the atomic clock and super sonic jets.  The time needed for some really new stuff is not a sign of a lack of creativity, but merely highlights that all the easier stuff, the low hanging fruit, was picked first.  Graphics processors in computers are relatively new, but most just take them from granted, and have no idea how revolutionary they are. Sure, it's all based on geometry, but what isn't?  The aircraft wing has lift because of it's geometry.  We are transitioning to solar power, but a complete, or 95% complete transition will take time.  Your position seems to be that if it is not sudden, then it is not new.  You are fated to be disappointed. Meanwhile, creative people will make astounding new stuff, perhaps just incrementally, but over time those increments really add up. ""New"" is not defined by your poor understanding of the history of discovery. When your life is saved by a stent, which is somewhat old tech now, you will not be complaining.",11년 전,0,
@walterneiss993,"I didn´t talk about ""Time"". I talk about the quality of investigation nowadays. If you are really interested in science i Suggest you to subscribe to the main international magazines Like ScienceOrg for example and discover the great contradictions between the community science. I am not talking about how much time we need to create or investigate. In fact, the world is going on a hurry (with no final goal), but not new ideas are coming up. One hundred years ago, the global pace was different, and we can see the big revolutionary ideas we had in every aspects, like arts, music, medicine, physics, maths, etc. Education has become business, wherever you are in the world. Everything is going around business: Art, medicine, etc.  That´s why you need a bachelor, a master, doctorate, post-doctorate, etc. And if you turn education into business, How do you believe creativity will bloom? I am not saying that we don't have creativity in the new century. Actually, I mean if the world has just duplicated the global population, we have  consequently more people specialized and going into college, so we should have at least so better ideas. And the GPS discovery and computers or whatever you want to put as an example, they are just war ideas. And war my friend is part of the massive consumption, because they are used to control other countries (why do you think that China has its own Google? conservationist posture? Don´t think so.) and to sell technology and weapons to minor countries (For example some countries in Africa). We need creativity to make a better world.

@rh001YT,"Walter Neiss The creativity among STEM types is off the hook - the patent office is deluged with new applications for patents. There is also great creativity coming from the artists, in the form of new shapes, colors, textures for products - new fabrics and fabric designs. Creativity is blooming, and the master's and phd degree holders are doing a lot of that. I think creativity can be objectively defined to some degree, but certainly it should not have to satisfy any one person's tastes.  The GPS system really is something new and creative, and it is still new and creative despite how it is used - most of that is used for civilian purposes.  Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel, whose legacy doles out the Nobel peace prize every year, though I don't think that's taken too seriously. But the Nobel foundation also doles out prizes in science - the criterion being that the winner must have come up with something new. Nobel claimed that dynamite was an istrument for furthering civilization, and as such it was used (and it's modern variations) to build canals, dams and mines.  Of course it was used (it's cousins) for weopons.  Near the turn of the 19th to 20th century, which I guess you would say was a time of great creativity, it was discovered that atomic bonds were surprisingly strong. One outcome of that discovery was the atomic bomb. Then the nuclear bomb, invented by the same fellow who gave us the modern computer.    By the way the goal of it all is more and better, higher quality stuff, and greater efficiency.  And that has always been the goal, and good progress is being made in that direction. Search on Google the keywords ""India real estate"" and you will be astounding at how much they are building and how nice it is - top quality.  The incremental improvements upon old ideas, which you seem to dismiss as uncreative, are in fact what is driving poverty down around the world.   And you may not know that the end of the 30 year, horrible Tamil Tiger vs Gov. of Sri Lanka war, was engineered by an IT guy from Silicon Valley, and funded by the Chinese.  Now there is peace in Sri Lanka, and Tamil children no longer have to take up arms, or lose arms.  And the peace in increasing prosperity in Sri Lanka is being funded by business.  ",11년 전,0,

@rh001YT,"***** The Sri Lankan conflict, it's long, bloody ordeal, it's end and the new prosperity emerging in Sri Lanka offers an excellent opportunity for study.  The ordeal lasted so long, 30 years, because each side was more or less evenly matched by about 1990, though the Tamil Tigers regularly resorted to terrorist tactics.  It was the TT who first invented the suicide bomber, and the video of that event can be found on you tube - not just the aftermath, but the detonation itself. The TT had an excellent funding network and muscled into the opium trade in the Indian Ocean part for funding, and part for arms - drug dealers and arms dealers go hand in hand. Being rather evenly matched, with smallish arms - both sides had artillery on wheels, but neither side much of an airforce, and so it was the Hatfields and McCoys taking turns at attack and retribution, failed peace talks, violations of peace treaties, etc, the result being  a continuous trickle (more than a trickle, actually) of death, maiming, destruction of infrastructure, and so on.  Neither could deal the final blow, until Gotabaya Rajapaksa, IT engineer from Sri Lanka, working in Silicon valley, along with his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, a politician in Sri Lanka, cooked up the scheme to get war funding from China in exchange for allowing China to built a port in Sri Lanka, which they have now done. For that scheme to work, the funding, arms and training from China had to be large enough to assure success, cuz no nation would build a port in a nation with a long, ongoing civil war, and when the other side was also using terrorist tactics.  The funding was, I think, a business calculation by the Chinese, and not so much a humanitarian gift.  But where India had failed to negotiate a peace, even after sending a peace keeping force, and where the UN and Scandanavian negotiators had failed again and again, it was business that finally brought peace.  After the plan was in place, the TT were routed in only two years.  And rather than take retribution on the Tamil people, who were very war weary themselves, the Govt. of Sri Lanka poured money, initially from China, into rebuilding the Tamil areas - this is still going on. A port is more valuable if exports and imports are moving through it. The Tamil area was cleared of mines. Captured TT soldiers were taken to rehabilitation camps, very nice camps, where they were well fed and clothed, and given secondary education and vocational training, and then released.  The child soldiers were rehabilitated similarly, with psychological counselling as well. With the TT completely defeated, investment money began to flow into Sri Lanka.  Investement in Sri Lanka has been returning well above 10% per year.  Some of that inflow of investment eventually gets taxed by the Govt of Sri Lanka, and that money they apply to rebuilding the Tamil areas.  Tamil has been added to Sinhalese as official govt language.  All these efforts are allowing more and more Sri Lankans, Sinhalese and Tamil, to make more money, and the Tamil and Sinhala populations are being integrated through business. A TT expatriate rump in Canada and England has been trying to get the UN to bring war crime charges against the Govt. of Sri Lanka, (sore losers) but not much is coming of that, as India won't sign on, cuz that would spoil business ties between India and Sri Lanka. And of course neither China nor Russia is signing on, so that is that. The rapidly improving business climate in Sri Lanka has enable the govt to sell lots of govt bonds - borrow money - which they are putting into the Tamil areas and reconstruction generally.  In the city of Colombo, an amazing slum reduction program is well underway, shanty dwellers being given apartments in new buildings with plumbing, electricity and all that. In a few more years the slums of Colombo will be gone!  Though the former slum residents are being put up in government housing, there is little chance that they will turn into what similar Western efforts have turned into, namely, hell, cuz Sri Lankans just aren't into gang banging and drugs and all that. It is an amazing success story, only covered in the West by the business pages. The Left leaning Western media and politicians don't want word to get out that a very conservative culture has found peace, where Westerners - the UN and such - failed to make peace.  ",11년 전,0,

What you dont know is the how they got to success you only judge their background. Anyone regardless of background can reach that stage if they work hard and practice whatever they do till they are good.",11년 전,0,
@Aznflipstuh9469,"rh001YT cont. If you are interested in a career in the STEM field , go for it. But what keeps one successful from the rest in this field is just like the trades, passion and drive. It sounds funny but there are passionate doctors nurses etc. They have an attachment to the studies then the work and the lifestyle. These will succeed over the kids who want to be a doctor only for the money. Yes there are kids in the STEM field not because they are interested in the job, they are only interested in the money benefits and other perks for these jobs. It is no wonder why many say today young people are not very interested in their studies . Reason is they are not in the right ones . They show interest in something else but they are forced to be doctors only because to satisfy the material needs society and culture drives them to achieve. I see that in your arguments. It is people with minds that are geared towards consuming luxuries that I am disgusted with. If you say that its really money a nice car and a big house to prove success, then you are deluded. It is no wonder why your not doing anything in your life. Your mind is full of this and other fantasies.

@rh001YT,"***** Well, it was a bit like pulling teeth, but finally some substance. Of course I disagree with most of what you've written. but you are right a uni degree is more important than ever these days, but that is because jobs are increasingly more demanding. I never said anything was wrong with someone taking a lackluster job, my objection is that school does not kill creativity, cuz otherwise there would be a lack of such. And it just so happens that STEM is at the forefront of creativity, but even so there is no lack of the arts.    The classes one must take at uni which are not part of one's major do help to ""round out"" the student and is part of the ground of creativity. An electronic engineering major may not be particularly interested in human biology, but by learning more about that at the higher uni level he may get an idea about how to use electronics to bring vision to the blind. Or a chemical engineering major may get an idea, perhaps it will take 6 years to materialize, about how to make a composite material for the building trade that uses less energy and costly materials, thus lowering housing costs.   I totally agree that uni costs too much and the courses outside of the major run up that cost. It probably is time for universities to offer a 2 or 3 year degree with focus only on the major. But that is off topic.  And no, I am not just regurgitating I am saying what I see to be true. ",11년 전,0,
@simonkeats6683,"Can't blame you, but you're still focused on the left part of the brain, given your examples... Ken's point is there's more to creativity. Also, it's a point of navigation. Say we're in the situation now where 3 out of 10 can make it successfully to the 'finish', wouldn't you want that number to be higher? And wouldn't you want a situation where the word finish can mean more than being outstanding in math or science?

@Aznflipstuh9469,"rh001YT Yes I agree that we have an over saturation of creativity in all fields as well. I do see that there is a lack of talent as well, talent which comes in hand with creativity will increase ones chance of success. If one has many ideas but does not know how to implement them in anything how can he be successful. Higher education institutions with the exception of trade , arts and music schools not just only oppress creativity but talent as well. They again have the agenda to design everybody in their image. So peoples individual talent to them is useless, but in reality ones ability to perform such unique and diverse actions can give one the upper hand in whatever field they choose. Which can lead to success, only if they work hard. Again post secondary education cannot design you , you design yourself.",11년 전,0,
@Aznflipstuh9469,"rh001YT Well you need to obtain a higher form of consciousness. The world does not run according to the mouths of professors, nor does books. Anything written 600 years ago has to be updated based on present research.  By the way , your example on an engineering student taking human biology , may give him or her the upper hand in the overall career. As you said it can help one achieve success in the medical field as well. But engineering is such a general field. There are so much subcategories of engineering including biological engineering. Not all computer engineers have an interest in crossing over to the medical field . Some are into the arts , both classical and modern. So when they graduate and get their jobs they can work hard in reviving classical architecture in the modern world. As long as the fields can relate to each other , there is nothing wrong with taking a course outside of the desired field. The problem will arise of an engineering major takes literature , philosophy , gay studies , women studies, race studies or any issue based courses. Because non of them can relate to engineering and how can one focus on studying for a desired career if courses like these will get in the way. Again you have to actually have to meet and befriend people who are already working and they will tell you that the biggest factor in getting them the job they are already in and the job they desire is focus. That is focusing on gaining knowledge and skills of or related to their desired careers. Many professors will tell their students to take courses left and right and claim that grades will land you a career path in a ""high paying job"" , that not being specific will cause students to just take random unrelated courses , study pass and dump all the information they have learned. That is a waste of time not to mention money.",11년 전,0,
@Aznflipstuh9469,"rh001YT  US is a country that has to invest in all fields of work. But you are also seeing it from only from a certain perspective. Its not the US that is importing STEM professionals , but it is also exporting them as well. I hear so many American graduates who are doctors nurses surgeons who end up working in Japan , Philippines , Korea Germany etc. Its not just because America is exporting the positions entirely . But people who hold these jobs especially nowadays have no sense of giving back to the country they were born in raised in. They claim they are not treated well back in America but that is clearly a lie. The US is in shortage of doctors and nurses. especially the ones who talented and passionate. The old guard, as many call them are dying out. I know because my family doctor turned 80 this year he retired 13 years ago. As he worked he was confident and put many of his studies to practical use. Not to mention he was approachable, conversation-able and is able to understand health problems patiently. Sadly we will not see anyone in the medical field like him with a passion anymore. The new rookies in the medical field do their jobs only for the money. If their mother country , America is closing its doors on the medical field, they move overseas and seek employment there, no its not because they want to import their skills overseas nor help people in foreign lands. Its because of the fact they will get higher pay than in the US. Its the money they are after.

@rh001YT,"***** I would agree with anyone who claims that the uni requirement for ""gen ed"" courses is excessive. As a uni grad I can testify that many students sought advice as to which ""gen ed"" courses required the least amount of effort to get a good grade, and those ""gen ed"" courses were the most popular. Then the profs of those courses would point to their popularity as justification for the uni to continue to ""offer"" those courses. So the universities swelled the number in the profesoriat, profiting from each at the expense of the student or his family or tax payer at large.  Definately a racket.  So while there are gen ed courses that hold little potential for the engineer, some still do, including philosophy.    But all of this is a bit off point I think unless you are trying to make the case that more K-12 emphasis on non-STEM ""creativity"" will result in a better social situation - I am left wondering if that will only lead to lower GDP and thus lower employment and all the ills that go with lower employment.  We live off of petroleum and fossil fuels - it is their high-energy-density that allows for modern Western living with excess cash in pockets to pay for non-instrumental creative things and entertainment.  When a nation is blessed with a lot of petroleum and coal the situation is better than if not. But with or without, any economy can only command that fuel to itself via STEM created stuff - so Taiwan has flourished after it turned to STEM.  The new govt in India has pledged to continue to vanquish poverty by harnessing it's STEM core to turn India into a manufacturing giant. The previous govt. in India had just recently scaled back fuel subsidies to improve the nation's balance sheet and to goad it's people into using fuel productively, rather than merely socially, in order to command more fuel into India at market prices.  So I don't see much sense in curbing STEM in favor of non-STEM, and as we are awash in non-STEM creativity I find such ideas rather strange. ",11년 전,0,
@rh001YT,"***** The old guard of physicians was better, I agree with that. But I don't think the new bunch owes anything more to anyone than does anyone else. Any doctor, new bunch or old bunch, is doing their fair share by coming to work on time, following procedures and being skillful - most still live up to that standard.   Anyway, in a few years we will see the USA grant full MD status to MDs that graduate from accredited medical schools in Inida.  India has been pushing for this for a long time and I think recent large defense purchases by India from the USA are part of that deal. So the USA students can get their degrees in India at a much lower cost, have much smaller student loans to repay, and may then be able to spend more time with patients.  We can also expect some more Indian-origin MDs.  If you want to give MDs in the USA a break, let their malpractice premiums go down - but that will only happen if Republicans have the White House and Congress.  The overall school situation will also likely improve in such a scenario.  I am not in favor of CORE as it is too rigid and will take all the fun out of school.  Ken Robinson is a Fabian Socialist and the CORE initiative is a reflexive reaction by some to nuttiness introduced into schools by the Fabian Socialist goad of winning a long slow game of dumbing the public down so that more will be dependent on government.  Clearly this has been working, and it is not turning out well, and the solution is to just think straight about it all and use language accurately and face up to certain realities, such as it is impossible to have the largess needed for the uncreative types, or the creative -decorative types, unless STEM is leading the way to bring in the money and create jobs.",11년 전,0,

@rh001YT,"  As usual, a lot of whining from floating ne'er do wells. Let me bring this discussion back down to earth - I shall ground it.  In the modern world, which is most of the world today, human life depends on petroleum, natural gas and coal for life itself. Even the food is grown and trucked to the cities with petro-fertilizers and gas/diesel. It is only the productive humans who, by turning fuel into useful products, keep it all going. Yes, of course the dockworkers are needed, they are part of production. Creative types who contribute to production are also needed, though less so, as we don't really have to have good looking autos and kitchenware - a plain design will suffice.  The reason we have a huge entertainment sector - creativity - is that fossil fuels provide so much gain that not all people are needed, and the gain is so great that surplus money is in most pockets to pay, like welfare, for entertainment. So the schools must focus on turning out as many productive people as possible for the survival of the population. The non-production oriented ""creative types"" have to compete for the surplus entertainment pocket money.  If schools put more focus on the creative types, at the expense of productive types, there would be less pocket money to sustain the entertainers and decorators. If you do not do well in school because you're the creative type, at least be thankful the schools are focused on productive types, as then there is pocket money for which you can compete. And please note, it is rather inconsistent to claim that school kills creativity, when science and engineering are extremely creative, and when we have a glut of entertainment and decoration. Quite apparently school is not killing creativity.﻿ Show less",11년 전,0,

@louisezenteno7797,"I think the biggest reason why school is immensely flawed and why a bunch of little geniuses are not coming out of every classroom is because of the foundation education has built itself upon, that foundation being man-made logic and rhetoric. Now I know a lot of people might label me as crazy for saying such a thing, but its what I think. School makes you think that if something doesn't make sense, to our EXCEEDINGLY limited minds, then that thing is wrong. If such a thing is not evidenced, or in front of you, it is false... But why is the eye more credible than the heart?  If a little kid were to be a genius, his ideas would probably be illogical because they are unprecedented. But a little kid wouldn't even conjure up such ideas, because the minute he starts school he's taught a method of thinking, that method being ""sense"" or ""logic"" but the logic of today is not the logic of 1,000 years ago, therefore, such teachings would be invalid.    I think the reason world-changing creativity or geniuses is so scarce is because, if someone is a genius, they first have to jump over the obstacle of questioning something (like math, science, theatre, etc.) they were taught was concrete fact their whole life. We develop our children's mindset to grow in boxes, and to deny or deem wrong whatsoever things do not conform, fit in, or align with that intellectual or logical box. If something is not aligned with some theory or fact created by some ""genius"" who lived years ago we tell our kids, or we believe, its wrong. We make kids think like all those ""geniuses"" who layed down the foundation of science, math, literature, etc. and tell them they're wrong if they don't but why? They're just humans, they make mistakes, they're not all-knowing... We don't teach them how flawed all scholastic subjects, because ALL were created by what seemed logical to a human being... To an imperfect mind. Do you know how many times what's logical to a person is completely wrong? We don't teach our youth, that currently, we know as much as babies who just got out of the womb. In every subject, and in the way we live life.  I don't buy into the idea that were so advanced as a society, because people have been using the same methods to denote whether or not something is right or wrong for a long time, such things don't help us advance as much as we'd like too.  So I think school should encourage kids to not be afraid to innovate education because it was created by imperfect minds who easily can create imperfect methods or ""facts"" this then would allow children to view themselves as equal. In short, school should be about ""creating"" and creativity.  I tell people all the time, and i would encourage kids and students in all schools, to pray and ask for guidance and inspiration (with the only intent of your heart being to help and serve) and through diligence, and scripture study, such will be given. MANY geniuses learned this way, and they did change the way society works and thinks. Our Founding Fathers who layed the  foundation of our country did seek such inspiration, an many others as well (as they have said), and the fruits of their labors are evident. I'm aware most people will disagree, but that's just the way I think, and there's nothing wrong with someone having a different opinion :)  If you'd like to know more about what I believe you can check this out: http://www.mormon.org/",11년 전,0,

I asked a teacher about this and he said that it is difficult to teach a class in different ways. A way of think of what school is at this moment in time is through cooking for instance all foods have to be cooked in different ways and temperature or the food would be under and or over cooked which will deem it unusable and thats what students are different people that need to be taught in a way they will understand or find it easier.

My friends consider me smart but all my parents see are my grades. They think that in capable in doing better in my grades but I'm just not like that. They think that I'm a certain kind of person when I'm not. They told me this story of my dad's friend who's band was very famous in my country (Philippines) and they told me that they're not rich and not happy even thought whenever they play in a show they always seem to be happy. I would honestly rather be like them then a rich person who's job is something I don't enjoy doing. I wanna tell my parents how I feel but I think that'll just end up in me being unloved.,11년 전,0,

@evilplummulplive,"***** The way I would teach children (and the way I do try to teach my younger siblings) is by trying to engage them in a way that encourages them to nurture their own interest in education and desire to be educated that as Ken says, we all have. Personally, the  subjects I dislike most and those that I struggle with most are those that have very strict right and wrong answers, the subjects where being wrong is fatal and I think this is because those are the ones where I (and I think most children in school) was most aggressively chastised for being wrong. I believe school should be a co-operative process and to an extent this is true in certain parts of the world, most predominantly in mainland Europe which incidentally has extremely high academic success. I can say from my own experience if nothing else that I struggle to learn from teachers who are inflexible. I don't think many teachers are inherently unpleasant people, but I think some struggle more to innovate within the restrictions placed on them. If there were no restrictions and teachers were able to find new ways of dynamically engaging their students, I believe both creativity and intelligence would flourish.",11년 전,8,

If I didn't have that point, the rest of my argument would have no meaning, Without that basic (if flawed) idea, the argument would have been 'Statistically, some teenagers must enjoy school, so there's no real problem...', which I think you'll agree isn't quite what I was going for. I can only apologise if my error offended you in any way, though, having been a teenager for quite some time myself and having known a respectable number of teenagers over the years, I think the sample data I have of their opinions of school, do support the idea that most teenagers find the whole process distasteful, at least while they're in it.

@theawesomegamr,"Interesting comment. I feel the same way as you. I'm 16 as well, and I had no interest in continuing with school, so I decided to give home schooling a try. For someone with AHDH, its been great. Basically how my schooling works is I do one or two collage courses at a time, and its been so much better, because I can be fully dedicated to those one or two subjects at a time, and although I am technically doing less work, I am being much more productive and I am learning a lot more than I ever did in school. But the truth is is that this method of learning doesn't work for everybody, I think that if people want to improve the education system, they need to allow students to be more open to different options of schooling, because the education system now might work for some, but I think its safe to say that it certainly doesn't work for everybody.",11년 전,5,

And unfortunately,  the problem is even deeper.  All these same abritrations apply to Special Education as well. This means that gifted students may be taught at a pace that won't challenge or propel them (though,  it's been my experience that most gifted teachers have a slight ""to Hell with rules that shouldn't apply to you"" policy) and Special Needs students (whether these are students with autism, Down's Syndrome,  Cerebral Palsy,  developmental delays,  etc.) will be expected to test and perform with their grade level.

My school hardly had enough money to rent their building, but that did not stop them from taking students to the extreme when it came to being able to do stuff.

@Nine-TailedFox4,"Just my 2 cents on why schools are flawed down to the core (this is coming from a 15 year) :   1. Schools dont teach you to explore or apply the information you learn. It brainwashes you to think that it is absolutely necessary to have someone teach you stuff in order to learn. Sometimes a little bit of trial and error and exploring will help you understand concepts better. School just teaches you to be reliant on someone else for knowledge. No super student actuals gives a crap about knowing anything. They want an A.   2. Our schools are literally failing... at failing. Even if your a straight A student that works and and studies, I dont think your all that smart. It just so happens you excel in the environment that requires you to memorize and take tests. Not to explore, be creative, innovative, or actually learn anything. Not only that, kids aren't even meeting any of the standards our education system sets. School is an institution that wants to standardize everything and has no personalization but brainwashes kids to believe that this system is the only way. The only reason it is so important is because it gives you a grade that will be used to give judgement to people on how intelligent (it does not have any connection to intelligence) they are so you can get a job. Although school teaches you the basics, the current system could never truly make you understand something elaborate on a deeper level. That requires passion and exploration. Two things the system gets rid of.   3. School makes you think your worth is actually decided by your GPA or grades. That kid who has a 4.00 is better than the the kid who has a 1.5. They may not tell you that because its stupid but thats the way of thinking kids are going to adopt when your making everybody compete for grades. Students always asking about each other' s grades in my school and its like they get a kick out of having higher grades than someone else. There has to be a better way that is more personalized towards particular student's strengths and interests.    4. Special education department makes it easier for kids who have so called ""disadvantages"" although 90% of these disadvantages are misinterpreted. All it is that some people learn differently. I dont think thats such a bad thing although everybody thinks special ed kids are dumb. Just means that they dont thrive in a BS environment. Instead of solving the issue schools get more money to continue doing the same things but to a more extreme extent. They categorize kids, put them in separate places because they are ""dumb"" and make them even dumber.

@FSTK,"In the defense of the current school system. Every action taken by a district, or board is the reactive response to a broad-demand by industry, by people for a systematic process of maximum efficiency and minimal waste.  Society values high GPA scores, high grades. Job Interviewers believe the person with the most valuable piece of paper should get the job, not so much the person themselves. Universities sell their students on the hopes of a stable future through their education-process with little incentive to explore outside the beaten path. High Schools sell their students on the idea of always aiming for A grades because that is what gets you into college. Society focuses on extrinsic rewards and that has transferred to the parents, whom demand the schools, their representatives, and the people in charge now believe in the extrinsic motivation to further subvert the true-learning process we are still trying to achieve with Common-Core. We are telling our kids to go to college, without a true reason why they should other than that extrinsic motivator. STEM major this, Business major that, Medical/Dental school for the next few students willing to step over the bodies of others.  In response to the demand of the community to produce apt people of society, our education system and our way of life has shifted in response to those demands which means a very business-oriented outlook on the schools. This would be fine if the taxpayers are willing to pay their share as well as put in the work needed to help facilitate the learning process. The facts are schools are underfunded, understaffed, and parents expect the schools to raise the children for them. To literally turn children into adults in 12 cycles, ready to take that 6-figure salary. We do not need to envision a future like that anymore because South Korea, Japan, China are the literal embodiments of what it means to push everyone to succeed. And the suicide rates, speaks for themselves.  If the schools are indeed failing, then the community is to blame, the nation is to blame, and you, yourself is to blame for our current situation. When Common-Core kicks off later this year, it will be interesting to observe a situation where preparing every student for college-bound education will be the answer we've been looking for.",11년 전,15,
@rh001YT,"You are whining, though it may also be that you are in a school or have teachers that suck. Come on now...explore and learn on your own? How much can you learn that way. Math is taught as it is because it is the distillation of 2000+ years of math developed by thousands of math-heads, each having to learn from books or teachers all that had come before. How lucky you are to get so much of that in just 12 years! And it does take 12 years for most just to learn what is today the basics so that he/she, if so inclined, can then learn even more at university and then apply that to making new better stuff in more efficient ways.  And the same holds for all the other subjects - you just can't learn very much on your own, nor would you know where to begin or how to chart out a course of inquiry, and then actually follow it, so that at age 18 you were prepared to make a living in this world or go to university. Grades do determine the value of the student since we know that most of the kids who have earned high marks do end up adding value to society, especially if they are STEM types, and less so if they are soft-headed, but even they can add value to society if they can follow simple instruction sets well.  Please note that if you do not earn high marks, if you can only do simple stuff, your future is not too bright as more and more machines, robots, are doing the simple stuff. The new Baxter robot has a starting price of $20,000 - you want to compete with Baxter?  I have seen bars that have ipads or other tablets on the tables. Customers click on the drink or finger-foods they wish to order, and then a waiter or waitress brings said to their table.  See? In these instances Machines have cut the need for waiter/waitresses in half.  In time, sooner than you might think, Baxter will bring the order to the table.  As for the Special Ed kids, I think it is true that many of them have emotional, not cognitive problems, but the teachers did not sign on to be therapists or psychiatrists - the school is not where such problems get fixed. School is not Mommy & Daddy, and if Mommy & Daddy are rotten, the kids will often be rotten also. Well, it's  not that the kids are rotten like Mommy & Daddy (what Daddy?), but the parents are in the process of rotting the child. This is a phenomenon in many, but not all the developed nations, but does not often occur in Asia.   School could be better, but it will only get worse while controlled (public schools) as it is by liberals, progressives and Demoncrats. The Republicans and Libertarians want to see the school system reformed, but presently don't have the power to do so. Your individuality is not favored by the current powers in the USA who prefer conformity, as in Animal Farm. See that movie (animation) if you have not seen it already.  Ken Robinson is your enemy. Any adult who tells you that you are good, when you're not, is no friend, rather, a fiend. An adult that expects you to be stellar, to join the noosphere, is your friend, well, not really a friend, but at least someone who does want you to really blossom.  You are competing in a global economy now. You are actually competing with kids in Asia, and to some extent, Latin America, as well as of course Europe. Asians love school. Did you know that more and more Indians speak English everyday, and those who did not learn English well in the Indian public school system will often pay for remedial English after they enter the workforce?  I kid you not, Search this on YouTube: Raja Manickam English, and you will see vids of adult Indians taking remedial English.  And to see Indians who don't need remedial English, go to NDTV daht com, India's super station, and you will see how well they speak English.  they just blabber away in English.  And if you go to the sports section of NDTV you will see that even most cricketers speak English.   Don't stress out. Steady as she goes. Pay attention in class and do all the homework. You can find all sorts of supporting info on the internet, including tutorials. In fact, a lot of Indian teachers post math lessons on the internet, in English. And, you can find Indian tutors for math and English, charging a rather small fee, the tutoring being conducted over Skype.   If you need to improve your reading skills, watch foreign movies and read the subtitles. There are lot of foreign movies on Netflix - I recommend Bollywood movies.  Good luck! Cheers! ",11년 전,0,
@Nine-TailedFox4,"rh001YT I am actually a pretty damn good student dont get me wrong, but i dont like the system. I never said I was a bad student so im not really whining about it. I've just hated the system for a very long time. I didn't say learn everything on your own but i do think schools dont make you want to explore and they definitely dont really teach you how to apply stuff. Dont get me wrong, again im a good student and i like math a lot but when you have to solve an equation, what good is it for? I can solve it but they didn't teach you why I should solve it and its real life applications. Everything in the world is mathematical but students dont see it that way.

A productive discussion, raising many points pertaining to education, learning processes, jobs and competition - more so than this video. I am a mathmatical soft head, however my father - who would now be way past the age of 100 if he were alive - was able to work out logarithms in long hand as it used to called. By the time I went to school we had a book of log tables. Then calculators were introduced. In my 30's I asked my father what logarithms  were and how to work them out long hand. Although I have now forgotten the process I can remember with sheer delight the sense of victory I obtained after hours if not days of struggle; this has served no useful purpose in my career. In his eighties my father decided to take up learning the piano keyboard with a little help from his daughter - an accomplished pianist - I gave him a little guidance and he would sit for hours in total concentration working out  right- hand melodies without a great deal of interference from me. The points and questions I am trying to make is as follows: i. Learning is an innate desire in humans. ii. The thousands of years of learning preceding our current civilization was done, so far as is known, by brainpower, skill, ingenuity and a profound  practical understanding. Current civilization stands on the shoulders of these giants who had to rely on their own wits. iii. Do the benefits of technological computerized aids outweigh the redundancy of the sharpened tool of brain power,  understanding and application in real life? iv. Can human progress be defined by the production of robots both human and technological? I am not saying to anyone do not go to school. In my experience it is best to take what is on offer good or bad, identify gaps in understanding and then formulate the questions that might elict from the educator the answers sought for. If no satisfaction is obtained, then like the giants it is necessary to go it alone. Innovation is always needed to prevent society from stagnation.",11년 전,2,

@rh001YT,"Steven Van I want to thank you for taking the time to post your well expressed ideas with regards this vid, and perhaps my comment. A post like yours is worth much more than the content-less praise heaped upon the pied-piper Sir Ken.   I do want to differ with some of you claims. The job will usually go to the applicant with good grades, but those that higher do take into account extra-curricular interests and achievements, as well as personality type. So in fact the job does go to the person, and that person's grades are part of him/her.   Good grades K-12, especially 9-12, are a pass-key to the university, as is one's parents ability to pay. However many do get full or partial scholarships, or can, as a last resort, take a student loan. The path to university is a well-beaten path, and the path to university graduation is also well beaten as many have come before - it is a matter of sheer numbers. But by the third year at the university the students are expected to do some original work along the lines of their major, and then there is the master, during which time one is supposed to master ALL the important bits. It is at the PhD level where one does truly original work. As so much has been done by those who went before and are working in a field it does take 8 years of higher learning to reach the level of being able to push the boundary out further. This is how it is, and it's not a bad thing, but certainly is difficult. For those who have only 4 years of uni behind them things are not bleak, as often they, working in their field, by age 40 or so know more than the PhDs.   There is little if anything new or interesting or salable  that comes from untrained out-of-the- box thinking, primarily because the bar is set so high.   And please know that US public schools K-12 are not underfunded - rather, a bloated education bureaucracy soaks up too much of those funds, while making the situation worse. And in the USA, many dysfunctional subgroups seem to do everything they can to ruin their kid's chances to learn well in school.   Anyway, I think you know all of what I've just said which leaves me puzzled by your comment.    Cheers!",11년 전,0,

@rh001YT,"IAB98Raptor Yes, well, it is YouTube, so...  As far as Sir Ken and his ilk goes: We all live on fossil fuels, with just a tad of nuclear and renewables thrown in. The fossil fuels are precious, and it is probably wise to use them carefully. Those directly engaged in productive work, and all in their support chain, like product shape artists, accountants etc, turn fuel into useful and life sustaining stuff, and, being engaged in competition, do all of that more efficiently year after year, thus actually reducing the demand for fuel. The public school system, which is paid for by taxes, must keep it's focus on trying to tease out and prepare the productive members of the herd. It is immoral to take taxes from people, to take part of their sweat, and use it to promote unproductive endeavors. A play on Broadway does create jobs, but all those jobs depend on others, the audience, having excess money to spend on such frivolities. The audience can only have excess money if they are productively turning fuel into useful and life sustaining stuff. Artists just happen anyway, and we are awash in artists. The truly talented artists do quite well...as long as the overall focus of the audience is on productivity. But note, in this long recession, which will likely be followed by inflation, many orchestras (classical, romantic and modern) have lost much funding and either gone on hiatus or suffered reduction in pay. Some pop musicians are feeling the sqeeze also, and in response to lower revenue the music companies have reduced risk taking and resorted to churning out new versions of the same ol same ol low quality and really low brow stuff. Currently the USA imports a lot of engineers, scientists and nurses via the H1b visa program. In the USA, we are lacking STEM types. We are not lacking artists or actors or pop stars or figure skaters or athletes.   Sir Ken is not suggesting that students need more practical examples for math - and actually many examples are part of the lessons - he is not suggesting more rigor be expected of the students. Rather he is trying to steer resources away from what is needed into what is not needed.   The really bad public schools do not need additional fluff, they need additional rigor, but usually the parent(s) make sure that their children are not oriented to more rigorous learning. Stories like ""Stand and Deliver"" show us what is needed in such schools, but Jamie Escalante was a rare bird, and I doubt he could do today what he did back in the 80s because the overbloated public school bureacracy would quash him based on some double-speak bs pretext.   In Los Angeles, Jamie Escalante's backyard, the public schools have tossed out detention and other forms of discipline, such as requiring an unruly student to sit in the corner, as such ""hurts their feelings"". LA public schools have also eliminated truancy laws, so neither the kids nor their parent(s) face any penalty if the child is a no show. That's the kind of stuff you get from Sir Ken and his comrades.   I know of a charity in Kolkata that rescues street kids, gives them room and board, and enrolls them in their school. The school is quite rigorous, requiring uniforms and good grooming in addition to requiring total respect for the teachers and total focus on the lessons. The kids do quite well, and most play chess and read, write and speak English. None there feel a need for Sir Ken and his ilk.  Even the street kids in India, some of them, are  now in competition for global jobs, which means American jobs too, and so how can we justify spending tax dollars on fluff? (I actually know a street kid from Kolkata who is now at a college in the USA.) A little fluff is fine, but that's all. As I mentioned, the truly gifted artists and pop stars make it anyway. What kind of schooling did Michael Jackson have? When he was young, it was probably rather lackluster, and when a teenager.....though living in Encino I doubt he paid too much attention in class.  Compare Richard Feynman to Sir Ken - completely different geist. Feynman was in reality, Sir Ken is a nutter. ",11년 전,0,
@Nine-TailedFox4,"rh001YT Well I dont know a lot about Sir Ken but most of the stuff I say are reasons for schools being bad are points I came up with by myself. This is why my argument wasn't so much about making all of the arts and other crap on the same level as math and other important stuff. My stance is a lot different. Sir Ken has no influence on it but I did find this Ted Talk interesting. I do think that the arts are important and there should be a bit more focus but not equal focus. Your right however, the current system doesn't teach you how to apply the important stuff to the stuff you love and believe me, it is applicable. Otherwise we wouldn't need to learn the important stuff. All of this stuff we learn is just data without any real interpretation or use (at least not until you go into college) but we need to know why we learn other than to get into college and be ""successful"". The reason school kills creativity is because we do not learn to apply our knowledge until college and by then it is too late. Seemingly useless data will kill your creativity because you are not encouraged to do anything with it besides take a test.

Who cares if you have a maths degree or if you can dance? We all need to stop caring about being judged and do more of what we love so that we may be happy and more importantly feel fulfilled inside. If you're not happy or fulfilled then life is not worth living no matter how much money you throw at it or what you do.  At the moment there is a serious lack of free time in which you get to do what you want so that you may be happy. The norm is to be miserable for 48 hours a week and make yourself happy, or rehabilitate, with the rest of your time which is an incredibly stupid way of going about it. You end up spending over 70% of your time every week being somewhere you don't want, doing something you don't want so that you may take home a little over 30% of your wages after being taxed over and over. How can anyone be happy like this?? Most people aren't and just swallow it because they are getting by and settle in their piss-puddle of broken dreams because seeing everyone else doing it must mean it's how it's supposed to be. Well, the world is waking up now slowly. The chemicals that make us docile and the fascist governments are starting to lose control.  If everyone pursued more of what they loved, were encouraged to do so and the teaching was tailored to their learning style then everyone would be dedicating more than 48 hours per week WILLINGLY to do the thing they loved and even more so, be enthusiastic about it!  Your fossil fuel argument shows you have a narrow sight for the future when fossil fuels are gone and our planet is destroyed. As this man in the video said, if all insects were to be gone other life forms would follow, but if all humans were to be gone all the other life forms would thrive. You have to admit that is painfully true! This era of modern industrialism has served its purpose and there's plenty of evidence that the world is on the brink of a new reform as we are becoming more aware of what we are lacking that is making us unhappy.

@rh001YT,"Filip Ionita Sorry for such a tardy reply, but I've been very busy with my plans to get into ecommerce - it's going well.  You seem to fail to mis the big picture.  That you can even be alive today (I assume you're not living deep in the Amazon or in a poor village in India) is because of fossil fuel's huge energy density.  The energy allows for huge amounts of agriculture, dairy and meat farming/ranching to be done by a tiny percent of the population, thus freeing us all from that. Also, the fuel allows for the construction of water resevoirs and filtering and moving that water to you, as well as creating and installing all the pipes.  And then the energy is used to build and operate all the sewage systems so your excrement is carried a long way away from your home and everywhere else you excrete.  All of that is a good thing, don't you agree?  Now that you don't have to grow your own food and tend to your fields all day, collect water from the river or well by bucket and live amidst your excrement you can try to pursue some work that is less arduous and more pleasant. Even being a clerk at that county courthouse or in a business is better than the way it used to be. Some people do like education, and do make good use of it to push their own limits and the limits of sci/tech/biz, in pursuit of an even more pleasant and less arduous life, and in the process keep the ball rolling so the next generation can go to school and to make life even easier and more comfortable.  If you have a root canal, in the USA and many other nations it will be done well by highly trained experts, and their skill and the advanced pain pills given afterwards will make the whole experience much less horrible than it used to be. And after the root canal a crown will likely be fitted, typically expertly, and you won't have to be toothless.  Few remember to thank the engineers who created the incredible material from which the crown is made. Those engineers and material chemists likely studied hard.  Now some do try and don't hit as lofty a target as they would like, and some don't really try. Yet even for them good future opportunities may exist because of all the hard studying and then hard, cognitively difficult work done by all the others, which just keeps opening up new, never before heard of opportunities.  I know a man from India who came to the USA and started a printed circuit board company.  He's a smart fellow, and has to keep updating his knowledge cuz the pcb industry keep innovating. He employs about 100 native born Americans, as well as a few Indians.  Soft-heads like yourself just don't get the big picture, cuz your stuck at stage one thinking. You (and your fellow soft-heads) assume everything will keep running as usual - electricity, water, sewage, food production and delivery to a store near you - even though no one makes a serious, difficult effort.  It will not keep running, and if that ever happens a hell will be unleashed that you don't want to see.  Don't over focus on my words like ""fossil fuel"". It just happens to be the only one currently able to keep modern civilization running. Anyone would gladly use any other energy that is just as good. Right now however none is. Still, you can do your part by switching to led lighting (created by those you dismiss), avoid using your air-conditioner, wear sweaters indoor in the winter, only turning on the heat (provided by those you dismiss) when it gets really cold, and take short showers, even switch to bucket showers, running the shower head only briefly to rinse off.    I know a guy who does what he loves - plays and teaches bagpipes.  He has to travel around in his car a lot, and he uses a computer to record and release his music.

@rh001YT,"Kerro Guano Well, I'm not sure what point you are trying to make. First you blame the corporations, then the government, then the deluded citizenry - at least you are thorough. Wherever one finds poverty one can often ascertain causes of such, however one can also find counter-examples which can refute. Taiwan is doing quite well, as compared to say, PNG, but why? Both are islands in Asia without much in natural resources, but fortunately not lacking in water. In fact, I think PNG has a better set of resources than Taiwan.  Virtually all of Europe was as poor as Indians in say, 1500, and the differences between India and Europe even as late as 1700 were small - most Europeans still living hand to mouth in 1700 as were Indians.  What set Europe and her child, the USA, on a path to prosperity was an emphasis on educating the masses, and a focus on STEM. Taiwan forged ahead post WW2, under the leadership of Kai Shek, due to emphasis on traditional edu and STEM - same formula used by Singapore which was a dingy and somewhat swampy place with zero natural resources.  As for the trades, a lot of tradesmen have gone on to enjoy great prosperity, typically because they also had business savvy and some inherent STEM abilities.  There is a billionaire in India, Rajesh Saraiya, who was and still is a dalit, who built his empire upon welding.   I don't think you understand some economic basics.  USA and Europe are consumer societies (but still produce a mega bunch of stuff) because of their prodigious use of petroleum and coal.  Anywhere, when the STEM types have invented enough efficiency, the surplus energy of oil and coal can then support a consumer class as the STEM efficiences and the high energy density of oil and coal accomplish with rather few people the drudgery of farming, food transport and refrigeration, mining, wood-cutting, paper pulp production and water collection and distribution, as well has sewage sequestration and treatment. Only this kind of society can afford to spend on the arts and various dalliances into whatever one wants to do to express oneself.  You can't have it both ways, sorry.    ",11년 전,0,

@rh001YT,"Kerro Guano Ok, I gave it a read. The problem with that essay was that it over-categorized the American consumer as being slaves to commercial fashion, which is not the case. Most people, including Americans, simply want better products so as not to be annoyed at, or have to pay the price to fix stuff that breaks. So the auto has become very reliable as compared to autos of the past, and they are more comfortable, and everyone likes comfort. Most people are not shopping for mansions but rather a home that is large enough so as not to feel cramped, with a yard for the children and for entertaining friends and guests (barbecue, garden party), and with new homes shoppers are looking at quality of build, so as to have fewer home repair expenses in the future.  As for cellphones, the main reason people upgrade is to get more and better features that they actually use, and which either save time or increase profits. These days faster means less waste and so more profit.    I think you find it hard to believe that any surplus money anyone in the West or anywhere else has, to spend on frivolities, is a direct result of running the economy on the high energy density fossil fuels. And the consumer society is also a direct result of running on fossil fuels - all those not working directly or almost directly in the core sectors of farming, water collection and distribution, sewage handling  and dwelling construciton, addressing the universal human needs, are surplus workers who only have work because of so-called consumerism.    Much of the Indian population still toils long hours even though they do not have the surpluses of money found in Western nations. Most of rural India and all the tens of millions living in the bustees are poor because they are not using enough fossil fuels, or the other high energy density fuel, nuclear power.  India is building nuclear plants to address the lack of energy. But one can't simply command by one's will the energy needed. It is in fact the STEM types, and their business savvy partners/bosses, that figure out more productive machinery that then creates more profits with which to buy the high energy density fuels.  And then with those fuels there comes more profit, as long as the fuel is used for more productivity. Even without exports, this equation works, but with exports it works faster.   One could argue that using these high energy density fuels to merely light one's home after sundown is a waste - not productive. That's true, but we get away with that because the energy density of high energy density fuels is huge - after productive work is done there is excess fuel to light the home after sundown.   Without a lot of fuel the best one can do is rural India, or another really good example is Myanmar - a totally boring place where few have proper houses and even fewer have air conditioners. The suicide epidemic among small time Indian farmers would never have happened if they had more high energy density fuel. Only since Manmohan Singh became Finance Minister, and then Prime Minister, has India faced the music that more fuel and modernization is needed, and the romantic dreams of old India were unsustainable with an ever growing population. See all those street kids in India, clustering around the rail stations? All that is needed to make them disappear, disappear into stable homes and school, is more high energy density fuel. And all the marginally employed or unemployed parents of those street kids will find jobs serving the consumer sector, cuz they will not be needed back on the farm.  Consumerism is the result of doing things right and using the high energy density fuel to create jobs for those not needed in the core production industries.  ",11년 전,0,
@rh001YT,"Nicki Hi! I for one am glad to hear you can't waster even a moment veering off the expected mark. You must count yourself among the lucky ones who has been given the opportunity, or earned the opportunity, to receive a uni edu.  Now is the time to learn everything the profs are trying to impart to you, and then you will graduate as a person of greater worth in society.  the 1st 4 years of post secondary education are not really meant to be a time of creativity but a time of learning facts upon with which to be creative after graduation from uni, or after a master's degree. But even then, your job may not encourage creativity, for instance, we really don't want nurses to be creative, rather, we want them to follow the rules and procedures.  I suggest students think about where creativity can be injected, and where known rules must be followed. There is just a tiny foothold where creativity can actually lead to something other people care about, but once that foothold is found, all the known rules must be applied to take advantage of it.  Those footholds appear here and there, almost at random, but the better one knows the established rules and procedure, and follows them, the more the little footholds appear.  So please keep going, focus on getting good grades, and then things will turn out well, but maybe not in your first year of employment.

The non-production oriented ""creative types"" have to compete for the surplus entertainment pocket money.  If schools put more focus on the creative types, at the expense of productive types, there would be less pocket money to sustain the entertainers and decorators.

""And we are not heading to a human abyss, don't get you're knickers in a twist.""  We are already in an existential abyss and always have been, you alleviate this for yourself by making yourself an existential parasite via corrupt economic mechanics and malignant ideology/denial of reality.  ""Efficiencies are increasing incredibly - solar panels getting better, led lighting is taking over, motor efficiency is going up and microprocessors are cooling down, and even the efficiency of cooling is going up. Soon graphene will replace much of the steel & aluminum bringing unheard of efficiencies. Switching power supplies are incredibly efficient and lightweight.""  Is this to say you do not actively deny global warming like the majority of the right-wing? I'm sorry, who was it again that has systematically cut/impeded education and consistently denied and stunted science? Technologies such as thorium reactors/nuclear fusion and graphene may pave the way for an over-abundance of resources, but it is the right-wing/elite who are doing their best to suppress said technologies and fucking up our environment in the meantime.",11년 전,0,

The schools, not all of them of course, but the majority are increasing creativity as judged by the excess of creativity in the world, especially in the West, in which I include Western leaning Asian nations. Long before fossil fuels run out the scientists and engineers and their mathmatician buddies will have CREATED such efficient machinery that it can be powered by, for instance, solar cells, the efficiency of which will be increased by STEM types mentioned.

The overwhelming majority of schools do and always have stifled instead of exploiting natural curiosity, as it stands schools only function to teach students never to expect any efficiency/functionality from any governmental institution.  Things are not getting better you idiot, they are getting worse. On precisely what do you make this assertion? Things are getting worse because militaries and economic imperative/necessity still dominate the development and implementation of technology. Additionally, according to NASA we may have already passed the point where it is structurally IMPOSSIBLE to prevent the collapse of industrialized civilization. Your blind faith that the necessary technological advances will arrive in time (at least at the current rate) is precisely that, a religious-like blind faith. We don't just need new energy sources before fossil fuels run out you inebriate, we need them before we do so much damage to the environment/ecosystem that collapse is unavoidable. How the fuck are we going to deal with ocean acidification which will leave us with no fish in 50 years and exponential desertification which will decimate our already stretched to capacity food supply? Technologies to resolve these already exist, but they aren't being implemented because there are too many fucking morons like yourself screaming ""CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE TOO"" and preventing any sort of regulation that requires a bare minimum of resource efficiency/environmental maintenance.  The power-base of the right are not 'prosperous' you dimwit, they are typically obese, mentally inept and in or near poverty. And once again, is it not the right who have systematically furthered dependence and consumption of fossil fuels whilst stifling science and technologies which would provide an excess of resources/energy?

@rh001YT,"joope zixzixzix Oh puh-leeze, you are rabid. If you can stop the increase in Human population, go ahead, but I don't think many people anywhere will help you. A lot of Westerners, primarily Caucasian, have significantly curbed their population growth, and most experts seem to agree such is due to the last 200 years of prosperity increase. I saw a TED vid where the prof showed how even the Islamic nations are clearly trending to near zero population growth, and he linked that trend to their increasing prosperity. China has limited it's growth for some time now. Nasa and others always base their predictions of doom by extending past data. Such predictions have come and gone for 200 years. Whenever they ""gone"" it's because of new efficiencies. Follow the trend line of increases in efficiency and things look good. But you are impossible - due to your personality, and what I detect as depression and maybe a slight case of schizophrenia. Things will always look bad to you, and you will blame phantom enemies because of your paranoia. But there is no sense talking sense to you because of your condition: Debbie Downer.

You're fucking delusional, of course it looks good, because you are deliberately ignoring the fact we are rendering the planet uninhabitable for complex life you idiot. A few slight increases of efficiency here and there will not make up for the fact we are decimating our own food supply. If things are so fucking great than why are we exterminating species at a rate faster than previous mass extinction events genius? Stop dodging the question of ecology. You literally have nothing, just some blind optimism that because a few improvements are made here and there, 'everything will be OK'. This isn't the case, at the current rate collapse is inevitable.  ""Nasa and others always base their predictions of doom by extending past data.""  No they base their data on prediction models you idiot.  ""Such predictions have come and gone for 200 years.""  Not in today's world, and not with verifying data. People have historically denied the inevitability of disasters until they occured, so what's your point. As I said earlier, the world has changed more in the past 200-400 years than in the rest of human history combined, just because humanity was sustainable in the past when crap medicine, famine and frequent wars kept the population down doesn't automatically make it so now. Yes there are technologies on the horizon which could elevate even the poorest regions to similar living conditions in the west, but unless we reduce consumption now we will have done too much damage to survive in the meantime. You find these consequences easy to deny/ignore because they will take decades/centuries to fully implement, but they won't be so easy to ignore for those who come after and I don't exactly consider it responsible to do so.  My depression is irrelevant, as anyone who is halfway conscious/aware of what's happening has great reason to be depressed. There is also a shifting perception in the field of psychology that depression is not delusion, it's recognition of an overwhelming reality. The truth hurts, which is why you seek to label anyone who presents you with information you can't handle instead of responding directly to the information itself.  Tell me genius, do industrial trade journals study the sustainability of our system? Do they examine the ecological effects of our industrial sector in great deal, or just deal with economics which takes no account of the reality outside of itself? Don't you think they would kind of have an economic imperative to deny/ignore any unsustainability?

@niennaserena4959,"Wow...is this still about the video or are you guys just taking this out on each other. Both of you have valid points.  There is nothing wrong entertainers or anyone creative. Anyone who has an ounce of creativity in their blood can have capacity to do things like invent new technology or perhaps address the issues of the world. And the world is teetering precariously and that it seems that new things are invented more faster than their old counterparts can be used. Maybe schools are not killing creativity - there is creativity everywhere, even in the science and mathematical field. However, do not criticise those who do not do so well at school because they are creative. What Ken Robinson is addressing is that there is more of an emphasis on the science, the math, the business sectors, which of course is understandable. But it's not like those doing let's say media, or visual communication or drama do not have a sustainable future. I would have disagree with rh001YT when you say that 'anyone who forgoes food and shelter for art and entertainment...surely are mad'. What of those who do arts and entertainment for food and shelter? To them, art is their life. And as for the argument that turning out more productive based people is essential for the survival of the population, I can surely see that happening because for some reason I see less people working as they are being replaced by machines to do the jobs and that surely is going to keep the population going, by doing nothing and letting the machines do the work. Although one could argue it takes creativity to invent such technology, and it pays for those working in that particular industry, it does not seem like the answer to the survival of the population. Just saying. Have a nice day guys.",11년 전,0,
@rh001YT,"nienna serena Hi! thanks for the well thought out contribution. Need for ""Art"" that supports the productive community, such as packaging, product shape, advertising, etc will not go away as long as there is a productive community. Schools do not need to focus on that, it seems to happen anyway, perhaps with just a 2 year degree after HS. If schools put more focus into ""art"" then we run the risk of shortchanging the productive community, as they need the rigor of STEM classes to get them up to speed. But ""art"" is not sustainable by itself - the productive community must use fuel to make new stuff that allows for excess income to be spent on the arts. ",11년 전,0,
@niennaserena4959,"rh001YT You're welcome. But then again nothing is quite sustainable, right? The materials needed to make the fuel, the machines and things that drive technology and the economy isn't going to last either, Maybe we won't see it end, but they will. And why does art have to involve making 'new stuff'? Can't we just make use of what we have, such is the art of life? We don't need million dollar brand new props for entertainment. I mean, this tug-of war that is happening right now in these comments in reply to your original is probably entertainment enough for you isn't it? You don't see it costing a cent or a penny. And schools may not be killing creativity, But they are torturing it. The lessons aren't creative or inspiring enough for students to pay attention or to harness to harness and strengthen the skills they have. By the way, I'll be teaching drama and biology. Isn't that weird? Creative enough for you? Might just be creative in my approach :P Enjoy your day :) ",11년 전,0,
@rh001YT,"nienna serena Well, the fossil fuels will run out but by then solar will be able to take their place, especially as motors will be more efficient and materials lighter. Virtually all metals are recycled, including ships. Wood is sustainable, and yet even paper is recycled. It was said in the 1980s that there was not enough copper in the world to provide telephone service to all the people. Then came cellphones, and that need for copper went away, and the cell phones are so cheap virtually everyone has one with some exceptions of course - but soon, everyone will have one. Soon graphene sheets will take the place of aluminum and steel and you know what graphene is made from....carbon!  Anyway, good luck on your teaching gig - sounds like a interesting combo. ",11년 전,0,

You keep making reference to technological improvements which have little bearing on what is necessary for our survival, but the reality is under the framework of global hyper-capitalism technology isn't implemented because it's cleaner or more efficient, it's only implemented when it is more >profitable< to do so.

I do not believe it is school as a concept that kill creativity, but the inflexibility of how subjects are taught that kills it. Some students are simply less creative than others.

@softalpenglow,"I believe Sir Robinson has a valid point in regards to school systems to a certain degree is killing creativity for certain individuals, however I believe this is due to the paradigm that everyone's goal in life is to earn a large income as possible. This is also true in Asian upbringing (like myself). All my life my parents have told me to go to school, get good grades and get a good job. This has been true for many years for the general population that in order to have a successful career, you need to do well in school in order to get a job. However obviously the supply of jobs are less and less thus the increased demand for higher education. The schools are not purposely killing creativity, they are only attempting to provide the most options to as many students as possible. Obviously this is no longer true, I spent five years getting a university degree only to realize at the end of it that I hated what I studied and I wouldn't be able to get a job with it either, so luckily now I pursue my passion for pastry and baking and am attending a local college which provides such a program. However I was lucky enough to attend a high school that stressed the arts and creativity as much as academics. Otherwise I don't believe I would have ever found my passion. But I wouldn't put the sole blame of crushing creativity to just the school system, it's the whole paradigm in the world where making money is the most important factor in life.",11년 전,0,

@nickrobinson2023," Yolo Swaggins Sorry I did not answer sooner, but I rarely use Google circles. I was educated in a system which still lives on today, and I am best part of 50. Education methods have not evolved with the times. It's about giving everyone the chance to become that which is best suited to the individual. It's about equal opportunities and being happy in the job you choose. Perhaps weath would not be a thing that a few posses, but it would be equitably distributed among the population. Because having experienced first hand the results of such a system, I'm concerned that those with more resources will take advantage of the ones with less. Education is a tool to liberate society, therefore, an educated (programmed) individual will certainly be useful to the economy but also will become exploited by those who run the economy. None of the governments care about population just their wealth at the cost of the individual.  Every wealthy man's dream to have an army of drones to make his bank account grow. Ken Robinson is saying that individuals should not be all put in the same category as is the case in our modern system, but rather be classified and educated according to their capabilities. There will be artists, writers, architects, dancers.... We teach in schools as if we were teaching students to be university students, yet not all will become professors. The model Sir Ken Robinson proposes is fair to the individual, and in the long term is good for society. Perhaps the term ""Utopia"" would be exaggerated, but in a way it would be a much happier world as individuals would be doing that for which life has prepared them. This is my opinion. Everyone is free to think as they please, yet everyday the consequences and the results of such errors are at first sight by taking a look at our modern society.",11년 전,0,

And I was told by a dean to give up trying to change the school system, Because 'I won't change it'. Its malignant advice. Damaging and dangerous. What kind of system are we raising our kids in when all I heard in middle school and high school to give up; to quit? The next question- Do we want this kind of system? Because i never did, but sadly I was a victim of it. I was at a disadvantage being ADHD and a dyscalculic (mathematics learning disability, its similar to dyslexia, but math.) I was pumped up on ritalin by catholic school, and had adverse effects coming off it. No math teacher helped with my math disability. I couldn't count change or read time, how the hell do you expect me to algebra or geometry? I failed probably 2 or 3 out of 4 years of math in high school. But luckily I brought the school down on their mistreatment of my LD/ADHD, and they were forced to change my schedule and fix the math problem, thus I graduated. We have a voice as people to make a change. I was pushed down by my peers and the establishments people. But I made it through, even though it was hell, without medication too. To those who are told you ""can't"", don't listen to the bad advice, its exactly what i say- BAD advice. What are the teachers, psychics? How do they know what i'll be doing in 10 years? Sure, I could be flipping burgers and be in jail. but thats a negative perception of someone with an LD / ADHD. Lets look at what I'm good at instead though. Music, arts, politics, business, theology. Soooooo... yeah. The doomsayers? Don't pay a second of attention to them, because if you're suffering and going through the hell like how I did, theres hope, raise your voice and stand up for what you believe in and prove them wrong.

@KNOWHOPE72,"Ken touches on an important issue - the negative impact the schooling system (especially university education) has on society. The reason kids lose their natural creativity and imagination is because the schooling system, ESPECIALLY university, puts them in a box. This by the way is not some random consequence of education, but it is BY DESIGN. There is a world system (some call it the matrix, which is a metaphor for all you think the world is) and it is universities which are responsible for putting you in the box (the matrix) and maintaining this system. In other words, universities are the guardians of the system. Ken affirms this when he says at 11:20 ""They all came into being in order to meet the needs of industrialism"" and at 11:55 ""The universities designed the system in their image"".  Ken also illustrates just how blind psychiatry is by labeling ADHD as a psychiatric disorder i.e a handicap, when in fact it is actually an attribute if channeled in the right direction i.e the Arts.  Ken sums it all up very well at 18:12",11년 전,19,

However, if used as a means to an end to promote thought, for instance instead of being on the medication in the anecdote from the video, or, in a means of communication to convey a certain point, what has been created is not simply a dance, but an association to another point of function. Admittedly, I cannot create an example with dance, but can do show with another art form. Consider a theatre classroom setting in which one must act and convey human emotion and intensity. Now, consider that means of theatre used to convey an idea on say, global warming. If one is interested in theatre, they shall use the medium to promote the meat of the idea, causes, effects, and amount of factual validity to it, while creating a story.

The balance between function and aesthetics may be a sought after goal, but speaking for the UK, our education system is not achieving function for millions of students, so what price aesthetics.",11년 전,0,
@ilikrandomness,"I agree. An entry level position that requires basic skills will not require a large amount of creativity, and does not tend to promote it. However, an entry level position is just that. It is intended to give the employee the basic skills and experience in a workplace on a template on how to conduct business. The patent office, or fast food establishment, or any sort of menial labor does not take too much mental power, and therefore not much creativity. (btw before going further, I would like to note that I am aware that many people keep entry level jobs for a long time and live off of those wages. My heart goes out to them.) However, if education is intended to promote skilled employment, that is a different situation. A lawyer, or engineer, or even middle management in the entry establishments will require a decent amount of thought process to achieve their goal. That goes along with creativity when put into practical application. As the arts promote creativity, and different forms of thinking, being able to use an argument, or make a more efficient blueprint requires knowledge and creativity. And as for the risk factor, many establishments will not go along with risk if there is not some sort of approval process, and those that will are likely to have risk involved anyway.

On the neurobiology side of things, you do forget a lot of the specific content you memorize in school, but at the cellular level, the act of memorization changes your brain's ability to memorize things in the future.  Memory research is still too underdeveloped to know anything for sure, but there appears to be a BDNF driven pathway that might have a lasting effect on the ability of dendritic spines to form new synapses following studying/learning . . . and, oddly enough, following cardiovascular exercise.  Making your brain store and recall any information (and for some reason running a lot) will have lasting effects on your ability to learn anything.",11년 전,0,

@AlSchollArt,"       A true inspiration!! Thank you!! I learned to paint when I was 30 and have remained a child ever since. I now teach the youth through live art inspired by music.  I do a number of things with Art Live Painting on stage to music, Art Battles, Teaching, Community Paintings, etc. I and am actively trying to make a difference and a statement in this regard via ARTIFONIA. A live art musically inspired tour of California with the mission of creating a rolling Art and Music Studio to bridge the gap in the Arts in our school sysem.              We graciously ask you to take a moment to see what we are doing about exposing creativity, art, and music to our children and our future, and forward to your friends and family.         Myself (Al Scholl) Founder and Co Producer (Art) of the ARTIFORNIA team, Brian Johnson Co Producer (Music) and Garret Laver (Co Producer Film) are trying to make a difference starting in California and actively have a plan in place to attempt to change the system.         Artifornia is on a mission to bring back art & music to our children through a live art and music tour of California in the Summer 2014. We are currently live on Kickstarter and would be truly grateful if you would take the time to see what we are doing.   http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/638369194/artifornia-exposing-art-and-music-to-future-genera?ref=live      With your support we can accomplish our mission. I have assembled an a large group of musicians, artists, live painters, promoters, teachers and volunteers to accomplish our goal and plant the seed through creativity. As Artists we struggle to do what we love, some more than others, some more ""successful than others"" but as a team we can unite as a creative force to make a positive change for the future.                                                           Thanks for your time and consideration!                                                                                            Al Scholl  P.S. ""We pay a price when our children are not exposed to the arts, values, creativity, right brain activities and creative forward thinking. With Artifornia, exposure is the key. Even 1 hour can change a child's life forever and improve their future. Embedded messages born with art and music will shine a positive light on all of our futures.  Music feeds your soul - Art pays the toll - Soak in the vibe - We're all one tribe - Hear with your eyes - Listen to no lies - Let art motivate - It's never too late - You can rise above - Do what you love - Create your own view - It is what you are meant to do - For you are the best - It rests in your chest - Follow your heart - And simply start - Your mission from above - Go! Do what you love  Thank you from all of us here at Artifornia for taking the time to listen to our dream and helping us make it come to fruition!""  - Al Scholl",11년 전,1,

Having spent my entire school career studying music I know that this video speaks truth. Creative arts people were a massive part of my upbringing, and I've met loads of talented and intelligent art students, but the schooling system in the UK just does not treat them that way. Many simply give up and choose to go through the system studying ""academic"" subjects like everyone else...GCSE's...A levels...Degree...Job (hopefully). A lot feel lied to when they choose to study a subject like music, because they get told the music they've written in class is crap or doesn't meet a certain fucking grade criteria simply because it doesn't sound exactly like a style or artist that has already been invented. Sometimes it's even like the people who write the creative courses themselves don't want the students to spend time being truly creative.

It is society's hope that you will learn a sh*tload in school so you can contribute to the furthering of the future. Many have done so, and you know that. Many of the whiners here full well know that even under the best circumstances you could not contribute to the advancement of solar cell efficiency or the cure of horrible illnesses. And so K. Robinson plays to the weaker members of the herd, flattering them like a pied piper. I suggest it is better to be truthful. Do the best you can - really do pay attention in class, do all the homework, do extra, and don't smoke weed. A small percent will dominate the rest, why not try to be in that higher group - you can, you know, because the USA and a few other places on earth are meritocracies, or becoming such. It is not merely a matter of domination, but of leading the way into the future. The average have rarely mattered, and when they did, it was only briefly, such as the French Revolution.  Look at China - where did the Maoist peasant revolution go? It is gone!  If your parents suck because they will not provide a conducive study environment at home, you have my sympathies, but blame them, not the schools. If you have any valid complaints about schools it should be about the lack of rigor, not the lack of ""creativity"". K thru 12 you are not capable of any really valuable creativity, and you know it, so quit the fronting. Actually I've read about high school kids in India who write and sell for $$$ cell phone apps, but that's India, where school is rigorous and the students wear uniforms and are polite.  Try to be the best you can be, else, right or wrong, someone else will, and by age 30 you will have serious regrets.

However most people who do well did benefit from their 12+ years of, as you call it ""memorization"". For instance, chess champ Anand has a degree in accountancy. And the list goes on. But if you read books and know case law, then you have memorized, so it makes no sense for you to be demeaning the art and practice of memorization which like a muscle, improves and becomes more beautiful with exercise. I did mean to say that creating is a higher level skill than memorization, but I do want to emphasize that any creation of real value comes only from one who has already ""memorized"" that which has come before. So we can look to Beethoven, who created the current modern world of music taken serriously, only after he had mastered (what you call ""memorization"") Haydn, Bach, Mozart, Verdi & Rosini. In Beethoven's time, and still today, no one could dispute his creations, as none could top him.

@rh001YT,"***** I'm a bit astonished by your question. Take for example any music composer. Such a person has memorized various scales & chords & depending on genre, much or all of notation and all the common arrangements. Take for instance the late Leonard Bernstein, conductor & composer. When conducting he knows, that is, he has memorized, all the charts used by all the players and, like all good conductors, knew when just one wrong note was played by one player.  Or on the other hand, engineers memorize a mountain of knowledge so they can dash out a new design. I have a hard time thinking of a credible creative endeavor that does not rely on a huge database of knowledge. Storytellers know tons of stories and rules for storytelling as well as spelling and grammar. One can just throw blotches of paint on a canvas...but did you know many of the more successful of such attempts are rule based? Even Fung Shui is rule based. Also Manga.You have to know (have memorized) the rules to apply them on the fly - occassional reference to books is allowed, but often the creator knows the book quite well and knows (has memorize) exactly where in the book to look up some data.

@rh001YT,"Josh Graham To read one must have memorized many word definitions, rules of grammar and word structuring & phonics to make quick sense of unfamiliar words.  To read something and understand and interpret one has to have memorized enough of the background material to make sense of the new material and to judge it's validity. One does not spend the years K-12 in memorization only - integration of the memorized knowledge is also taught and is expected. Those who learn, really learn - which requires much memorization - will outpace most of those who don't and enjoy a more comfortable and fun life, as comfort & most fun costs $. Chess champ Vishy Anand has a degree in accountancy and has memorized a gazillion chess moves/strategies. Might his ability to memorize been developed by all that memorization K-12?  Is the brain not like a muscle? Does it not get better with workout?

@vnsh44,This is the truth of the present day education in India. All educational greats keep asking the Education and Examination Boards to reduce the school baggage load. The system and more so the education mafia and the school management have a tendency to use such advice tangentially and increase the baggage load. Many of the private  schools are extending the class hours by 2 to 3 beyond the standard school hours to teach the courses of the next semester or next higher class. If the children with normal school hours are not in a position to find time for extra-curricular activities how can they with extended hours of the school. l How can this be useful to creativity? How in such environment a child can think of being innovative? In fact it is all due to profit making tendencies of the education mafia added by the Corporates which is in a mode pf producing foot soldiers for them.

Perhaps the issue is that society prompts early sexualization and the arts reflect society.  Is any glorification of love or sex something you should put an age limit on? If that is so we need to drop Chaucer and Shakespeare out of the curriculum as I can make a strong case for Romeo and Juliet being a bad influence.

In high school the only thing that helped me survive through the difficult math and science classes I had to take were my electives. These electives allowed me to focus on something that was not academic so that I did not become burnt out.  The same thing applies to children from elementary through high school. We need to give them opportunities to be creative.,14년 전,0,

The London school was a nightmare with children from all over the world many of whom were violent and drug users. The lack of discipline and poor standards were shocking. Who wants to be a teacher in such a situation? NOT ME! I am so glad that I am back home and would NEVER put a foot inside another UK classroom again.,17년 전,0,

@vijitc1209,"I think he made the clear distinction when he stated as his core contention that creativity is just as important as literacy and should be treated with the same status. He believes there is room for both in our education system. He never really said that Maths or Physics is not important. He just claims that there is a real stigma associated today in our education system towards to the arts, particularly towards dance and music.",18년 전,0,
@stylianosm,Useful talk. I think there should be a distinction between basic core knowledge that each of us to get in education and the development of values & key capabilities that shape personality and relate to creativity.,18년 전,0,

@organicxangel,"If I may add...on a side note, it's quite interesting to read the previous comments and see the arguments from both sides.  It would be interesting to see what would happen if this was shown to a school board, a group of students, teachers who like this serious ""write this, draw that, you have to do it"" learning style, and teachers who would like to see the ""be creative, just pick up a pencil and draw what you wish"" learning style. (My bad for the bad description of leaning styles...)",18년 전,0,
@organicxangel,"I agree, and I love my teacher for suggesting to my class to watch this. In my 8 (currently at my 9th) years of education and 41 (working on the next 6) passed classes, I've only had a handful of teachers and classes that I could really enjoy, the art classes, gym classes and the classes where the teacher allows students to have heated discussions and really dive into topics that interest us - music, games, 'the systems', things that we want to change and have say in.",18년 전,0,

I fight the teachers on giving me more creative project, allowing me to actually use my mind rather than simply repeat them like a voice recorder or something.

@olywood9,"One final thing before i get dun' for spamming. People tend to forget that art actually feeds into modern design and construction. I dont care where you are, if you look around the room youre in those objects around you will have been a drawing on an artists sketchpad at one point in the design phase. Art is just as much functionality as it is aesthetic pleasure. People just dicking around on canvases actually make up a tiny percentage of the art that fills your daily life.",18년 전,0,

What we need to understand is that originality is not a requirement for creativity, but rather that it is result of some creative works. Originality should not be pushed, as pressures to be original would decrease attempts to be creative.",18년 전,0,
