And this equates to boring videos. Heart is exactly how a typical rich person (from an old-rich family) lives - by being low-key discreet. This is especially true for many East and SE Asian rich families. And old money rich doesn't like showy, in-your-face-logos shoes, bags and clothes. And they do love reasonably-priced and quality stuff like us normal people. I used to work in the company of Singapore's richest man - and we often encounter him, and his children during working. And let me tell you, they're all discreet with their clothes, and they have no qualms about having a $1.40 cup of coffee with us during tea breaks. In fact, they are very uncomfortable when they're around people who look like million-dollar bucks! We can always tell that those people really have no money to buy a condo unit. :D",3년 전,1,

So with that we can assume two things: All of Heart's clothes are not in that one closet. And two, a bulk of her audience/viewers who look up to her may not be able to relate to the kind of ostentatious wealth she most likely has so she's probably being conservative with what she shows in her vlogs.  As for the Himalayan Birkin, most bag collectors acknowledge it to be the holy grail of all holy grails in terms of rarity and price. Even rarer is the Himalayan Kelly. Now Birkins, depending on size, start at a little over $9000 USD brand new. A Himalayan Birkin, now sold mostly at auctions costs anywhere between $100K USD to as much as $400K. There is a six-year waiting list at Hermès boutiques for a brand new one so you could imagine why this is mostly sold at auctions and why collectors deem this as their Holy Grail and the one they'd save if there was fire at their house (Singaporean socialite Jamie Chua also said this).",4년 전(수정됨),0,

You can look up tours of her other collections of art/fashion.  Edit: she also has a gallery and other stuff which she strictly doesn't want to be captured by the camera",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@gglenn3099," @strawberrycherrybaby  From what I know of her from her online presence, she is a very responsible person financially and like to invest her money.  For her to have a collection of clothes in a museum or warehouse is a complete waste and the opposite of who she is.  Further, one cannot be modest and extravagant at the same time just as you cannot be rich and also be poor.  You also mention she does not like to broadcast her elite lifestyle yet she has Youtube flaunting how affluent she is.  She likes to show off and that's fine because she worked hard for it but be honest and like her for what she is and not for what you want her to be.",4년 전,1,
@strawberrycherrybaby," @gglenn3099  In your opinion it is a waste. Many people with money choose to invest in luxury fashion goods, just like some invest in art, cars, or property. Showing people who are interested (like you, since you watched it) in fashion her collectibles and art pieces isn't flaunting. My closet is all thrifted and I'd love to tour each piece, bc there is a story for each one. She's doing the same thing. Just bc her clothes are more expensive doesn't make it 'flaunting', nor does a higher price tag automatically make it 'extragavent'. Much of her closet looks to be beautiful staple pieces, that while expensive, are not over the top or 'extravagant'. I'd say that showing an extremely small portion of a large collection is the definition of modesty, as it's being restrained and moderated. Seems like you just have a bone to pick with people who like clothes.",4년 전,6,
@gglenn3099," @strawberrycherrybaby  Try again with your logic and know the meaning of flaunting which is to show or make obvious something that you are proud of.   Extravagant means costing too much money.  Do you know what you're talking about?  Sounds like you're very confused.   Yes, I watch people like her, Jamie Chua, Jaime Xie, and others and like I said, I do not take their flaunting against any of these ladies.  That's their right for whatever reason but calling them humble, low-key, or discreet while broadcasting their wealth is lunacy.   You also insist that she has a lot more collection of clothes in a warehouse and museums which I haven't found online.

The best things i love about her is her love for art, for humankind and for animals! She is very smart and articulate, well-mannered! Maybe because she also got influenced from Senator Miriam! ❤️ She tries not to flaunt everything because she is a politician’s wife.

@GQ-tf6pd,"@Joel Lorenzo  not really. I think that heart is stylish. I love her. Don't get me wrong, but I still think she cares more about brand than the vision of the brand or quality or meaning, whatsoever. Parisians are most likely the low key ones. And I'm an asian myself. I see a lot of crazy rich asians, so obsessed with trends and logos. Now I respect them, that's their style, we have different preferences. But I'm sick of people saying ""oh rich asians ain't about the logos"" or ""rich asians are so low-key"". Oh if only you know. You guys have to get your facts straight. Rich asians tend to buy clothing pieces from the most famous designers.. and I think they do it to be somehow superior from the conquerors/westerners. They get so mesmerized so easily by high end stuff. Just like some nouveau riche    Americans. If I were rich and and if I were them and is really concious about quality and design. I'd buy more from brands like The Row, Chanel (but not the ones with like in your face pieces with so much logos in it.), from Scandinavian, french, british, young designers, and contemporary fashion like numero ventuno, Sandro, etc. Not from brands that are all about the name and the price that serves no justice like, Cartier, Hermes, and many more.

@juliane5632," E L V A  It's not ""POWERFUL CHINESE ASIAN FAMILY"". It's ""POWERFUL FILIPINO-CHINESE ASIAN FAMILY"". Since if you describe is as chinese, please remember the money of china has a highest currency  than philippines so heart family won't fit in the most powerful chinese business and new family business in china. And i guess your bad at this things. Net worth is the total wealth of an individual, company, or household, taking account of all financial assets and liabilities. Heart hasn't taken full charge of her family holds on business. So if you check of what she holds and total money she gets will be near 3-10 Millions of dollars. Compare one kardashian member family net worth than our Heart. Kylie jenner herself make more like 1 billion of dollar. It's becuase as well as the currency battle. US dollars has the strongest currency while philippines only ranked 30th and soon going low from corruption and inflation. Lmao, please study currencies and base on the family plotted business and what she only truly holds. I don't see heart to continue on the biggest business they have but her husband who is experienced on monopoly more than heart.",4년 전,0,
@juliane5632," E L V A  HSHHS, first of all im a filipino but i don't support heart based on net worth here. Old chinese money cost 5-10$ (legal estimate) only and even you have those, in modern world it isn't acceptable for this kind of money unless your a money collector. If heart family gave her money it's not enough to be called NET WORTH. Net worth is only acceptable as a  ""total wealth of an individual"". Not the given money. Other accepted is as well is company, or household, IF SHE'S taking account of all financial assets and liabilities of this. Which the money given isn't 100% hers. If she does inherit the money the biggest question, what currency money is it,  dollar or china money (if it's php its out of the league) and who will get it? A half or full charge for heart or a half or full charge from her experienved monopoly husband? Who will entrust the biggest monopoly in the philippines? Who is in check the biggest company when people wants to take it down out of competition. Meaning it needs an experienced person. Now compare the net worth kylie and heart has with the right basis. According to kylie's agency, her cosmetic products get s 900$ million dollars. Which made her to be the called ""YOUNGEST BILLIONAIR"" without the help accounts of her parents money. With her extra careers it earns fairly more than heart based on currency, net worth and modernization rules of which of this can be accountable",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@juliane5632," E L V A  I don't like kylie but the reason of her getting the 'SELF BILIONAIRE' was depending on her net worth that has no inheritance too with any family but of her own careers she has (especially her ripoff cosmetics which cost too much). Old chinese money doesn't give much even it's made out of gold because of it's limited built. Making one Tael is around 0.253336 US modern dollar which doesn't even cost much. Even if you use gold it is limited made and cost around 2k not like many golds today which always cost 20k more. Even if Reynaldo Ongpauco is a big tycoon holder or any (since he is remained unknown) hence he didn't make it to the top tier list of tycoon holders in philippines who are many remained unknown too but still made it to the list (which mostly has a billions of net worths). The comparing is basis of old chinese money is because the modernization does not look at it's importance as modernization money is more held accountable than those even it's legal, modern money is the most accepting type money only not old which shows that how much old money is now off even you make it on a gold. Hence sycee is only used for goodluck only now :/",4년 전(수정됨),0,
@juliane5632," E L V A  It is half but what i think kylie did was a clout marketing, she used kim to make her skyrocket which led her with those extra careers and business.

@fagioli7063," @gglenn3099  You really thought you did something with that. Showing something isn't the same as flaunting just because it's on a video. If I uploaded a video of my grandma's obituary it's not flaunting her death. You obviously like definitions so google flaunting.   Flaunting display (something) ostentatiously, especially in order to provoke envy or admiration or to show defiance.   Did she upload the video to provoke any of those emotions? No. If you took basic language arts you would've learn connotation and denotation. Denotation is the dictionary definition of the word (like I just shared) and connotation is the emotions and feelings connected to that word. Flaunting has a negative connotation. So she wasn't in no way flaunting her wealth. She uploaded to share things she's really proud of in her closet.   Furthermore, she comes from old and new money. Her parents weren't poor. She would've been living a more then comfortable life if she didn't become an actress or pursue her artistic abilities. People brought up traditionally or from old money are taught not to flaunt or brag and to have class/elegance. If you don't know wtf you're talking about don't open your mouth or type on your keyboard.   And all I said on the closet situation was it's not impossible for her to have other closets.

He was asked how ""rich"" these women are and he could not give their networth except for the Yeoh sisters whose family is well known in the UK's upper class society.  He socializes with fashionistas like Heart who is obviously well to do and that's how he elevated her status as ""crazy rich asian.""  Why do you think he picked young beautiful women over some guy or family matriarchs/patriarch?

@892kct,"Ok like Heart Evangelista is a classy Filipino fashion icon and yes she was featured in crazy rich Asians spread on Harper’s Bazaar. However, she’s NOT a CRAZY RICH Asian. Yeah she’s rich and her family too, but I think people overestimate her (and her family’s) finances. There’s probably thousands and maybe hundreds of thousands more Filipinos that are a lot richer than her. It’s her fashion forward lifestyle that makes her seem crazy rich, but trust me a lot more (like sooooo many) politicians (here in the Philippines lol) and entrepreneurs that make more money than she/her family does.  Her family also isn’t that important here in the restaurant business as you said. Yeah they made money from their chain of restaurants but they’re only one of the many owners of the company. Plus their restaurant isn’t really popular anymore.   She was a famous actress when she was younger but I think she’s more focused as an artist right now.   My point is that she’s rich but not crazy rich. I can easily think of a few personal friends/families  me or my family is friends with that can rival her lifestyle.   Also another conclusion: this brings me to the fact that people cannot fathom how crazy rich the real crazy rich Asians are 😂",5년 전,1,

Paris Hilton would be like “Who’s Zara?” Like you won’t see them covering their cars with diamonds even if they can afford to.

You are better off looking for them in China, Japan, or Singapore for those crazy rich Asian types of wealthy people. Not the Philippines.  Although the queen of them all is in the Philippines.

He's not about elegance but about being extra and theatrics.  So I don't think that his closet should be the basis of your comparisons.,5년 전(수정됨),0,

People should not talk about old money vs. new money because it shows your ignorance in not knowing the difference.

Ang concept ng Crazy Rich Asians books is about the ""old rich"" and their crazy lifestyle. Old rich like the Ongpaucos, Cojuangcos, Lopez, Ayala's. Even the richest family in the country, the Sy family, can't be considered an old rich Kasi new money sila. And the book tackles about the old rich controlling politics and having influence over almost anything.

And don't pretend that anyone richer than you is also ""smarter"" than you. Your boss isn't a genius, he just got there before you did, probably because daddy had the time and money to give him the opportunity to flourish, where a lot of people are forced back to the bottom no matter how much they try to climb out.

Real crazy asians are also investors they love investing on their stuff which is why their riches last for generations after generations and they don’t just buy all these Gucci stuff and call themselves rich just like what Heart said she likes things that last long.

She knows how to spend her money well (half thanks to her husband, Sen. Chiz Escudero). She invest in things/companies that will gain her a lot, like vlogging. Anyway, it's your preference.

@thefatpinoy.,"If you have followed Heart's interviews,you will know that before the Harper's Bazaar shoot, sinabihan niya si Kevin Kwan na hindi naman talaga siya crazy rich asian but Kevin  insisted that she be included in the shoot because she is living the lifestyle. Although it is true Heart is not really the richest in the country but considering and adding the entire Ongpauco clan's fortunes, then you can say that they are really a force to be reckoned with. Ang concept ng Crazy Rich Asians books is about the ""old rich"" and their crazy lifestyle. Old rich like the Ongpaucos, Cojuangcos, Lopez, Ayala's. Even the richest family in the country, the Sy family, can't be considered an old rich Kasi new money sila. And the book tackles about the old rich controlling politics and having influence over almost anything. If you've read it then you'll realize that the true old riches don't want to be included in the list of who is the most mayaman. In fact they control the news to maintain their privacy.",5년 전,31,
@athenstar10," @thefatpinoy.   The Ongpaucos are like the Verperezes, rich but more of considerably, middleclass and never really got political and social influence(except for heart who made her own name). They were movie producers back in the 50s before her uncle created the cripy pata we now know,  and they were not  seriously big to be considered old rich. Yeah, old rich controlling the politics and have influence over almost anything?  Zobel de Ayala, Lopez, etc.  ""true old rich don't want to be included in the list of who is the most mayaman"" 😂😂😂 You don't need to read it to know, most old rich people are low-key but Forbes and even BIR  gives provides the  list based on the company's or individual income (Forbes do credible research) and for BIR, the tax that individuals or company paid for the year(which may actually have been altered by their accountants😁) I worked in an place where I dealt with these types of people so I got a clear picture.",5년 전,3,

They own farms, restaurant chains like Barrio Fiesta and other companies, these rich people don't just put all of their wealth in one place, I'm pretty sure that they invest in stocks as well, which means that they make money while they sleep, add to that the fact that she also worked as an actress. Her parents were actually furious when she married her now politician husband who was not as wealthy as them... they even vowed not to speak to her for several years.

@cheezusfriest7845," @ameliap0ndd  In a Filipino or Southeast Asian household, comfort is always put over lavishness. Many then-colonized Southeast Asian countries are considered third-world, and we have a very unstable economy, which is why money should always go to comfort and security. Many rich SEAsians invest in businesses because they would secure their wealth for the next generations to live a similarly comfortable life because most of the people who began the wealthy dynasties used to be in the working class. With the importance of family history, the unstable economy of the country, and the future of the family in mind, practicality is a must. Yes, they would enjoy luxuries at times because it's their right, they have the money for it, but they also have the responsibility to keep their wealth stable. Another thing why SOME rich people choose to live simply is because it helps them connect with their heritage and tradition deeper, which is an important part in Asian lives.",3년 전,0,

Heart is old rich so she doesn't have to prove anything while Jeffree is nouveau riche and tends to flaunt his riches. Though nouveau riche is usually derogatory because they're deemed to be less classy, and people like Heart Evangelista are put on high regard because her family has been rich for generations. It sucks that people put terms like that based on money, it seems so scrutinizing. But it is true and it's more evident at least to me in asia. It's actually pretty interesting to see the differences on how old rich acts in comparison to nouveau.  Hope that helps :))pu",5년 전(수정됨),279,

Jeffree grew up with American values that's about being proud of what you earned and achieved, and that it's okay and normal to show them off. Heart grew up in Philippines and Asian values of being humble about your riches, achievements and good deeds. Jeffree and other American celebs (and maybe European too) are just naturally more inclined to flex while Heart and other crazy rich Asians are more inclined to keep quiet about their wealth and lifestyles.

@aldelasarmas9675,"...thank you for featuring Heart...she is a darling of the Philippines indeed and a rarity for a mega rich, high society, legit celeb and global personality (she also fronts for a lot of fashion labels in Europe and Asia). Regarding archival level clothes..(they are truly fabulous to have...am sure Heart has a few (but the local and whoever designer she may ask will gladly  oblige to her...since money is of no concern and she really os one of those fashionable ones out there with the personality to go with. lovable.) My family lived with the fab Mrs Betsy Bloomingdale and she is sensible for a lady of her stature that she uses the same haute couture dresses (dress attached with the original sketches by the great Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Bohan, James Galanos)...and after awhile...because to have more than a few, because of their lifestyle...the clothes becomes a burden to maintain and occupies so much space...(Nan Kampner j heard has to buy the townhouse next door for her clothes)...that was the old money lifestyle. Heart, also being a wife of a politician...and already well known to be from a legit, ultra rich family and she herself has multiple businesses and endorsements...had the right sense to not flaunt and rub it to the masses...because as i mentioned, she is a rarity that she remains classy with more wealth...unlike most of the new rich personalities we see....the more wealth or money they get...their trash of a personality in them is spilled over. These are the ones where money brings out the trash in some people...and it smells..and they look like they are screaming with it  (tacky as f@ck) and they almost always downgrades the fabulous works of these designers. And btw...the  level of richness of the true rich in Asia is beyond...as they have businesses in other countries..not basically directly labeled to the family corporation...and unlike here in the US...the government, Forbes, ex-wives/partners etc can audit and trace anybody’s wealth....and in the Philippines, the trie mega rich you can tell from the way the speak, behave (proper and polite), carriage...and they just evoke ..rich.",5년 전,0,

They have three Lamborghinis in the same type, but in different colours, red, yellow and blue. The leather furniture in their house is all Hermes and the husband has 20 Hermes belts. They gifted their daughter a 3000 USD Balenciaga purse when she was 12  and bought a 300 USD smart water bottle for their 3-year-old. When they come back from their trips from Paris, they give out around 20 150 USD boxes of chocolate from Patrick Roger.

Then, you start to store the items with values in its heart of long history and the pass-down items from your mother or grandmother. The wardrobe will look like vintage more. You spend less because you know that money pool will not last forever as your child and grandchild need to have a job for living. New money means you and your family have been growing the rich for a time, the money well goes from 5 or 6 to 10, and you all spend that much on luxury life to show off the world that you are rich and richer. Everything to you need to be expensive and new, fresh items in your hands. The wardrobe will look like hype and sparkle.

Have you ever ask the author himself if it's true or not? Because from what I'm reading here, you and others basically just quoting old interviews back to back.

@eyeamjona,"To give you some additional information, wealthy people are divided into new rich and old rich. There has been a rise of new rich in society. That doesn't mean they are ""less poor"" than old rich, not necessarily. But personally, I think what seperates the old rich to the new rich is the attitude.  There are old rich families in the east who literally own ISLANDS, specially in the Philippines since we're an archipelago. But they don't show it. Because old rich are more, subtle (?) or maybe even private, about their wealth. Since they are old rich, they not only inherit the money, but as well as the personality and attitude that comes with it. Hence, the difference in how they ""show"" their wealth, like Jeffree Star (as you mentioned and compared in the video). Like you said, conservative or private. See those white curtains? She's not showing everything.   And she said ""Abubot"" which is translated into ""Trinkets"". Like sunglasses, stuff toys, scarves, some keychains, stuff like that.   I think its really cool ur getting interested in the Asian aspect of fashion. I hope you can check out luxury Asian designers who are equivalents of western luxury brands!

The importance for them is how the clothes work for them rather than what the brand is. So yeah, I have an old money friend who loves shopping at Zara, H&M and Uniqlo and even go with me to Salvation Army finds.

There are a lot of people who go above and beyond to defend Heart, and while I don't think she's a bad person, I just think she's shallow and materialistic. The justification that she's ""richer"" than her husband is overused and kind of inaccurate. She's upper middle to middle class, her hubby is from a political family. Knowing how those families are here in the Philippines, they go above and beyond to hold onto power and they make the most of the financial benefits (legal and illegal) that their positions have to offer them. So regretfully, I can't stand by anything this woman advocates. She's spending money that could be used to fund better education and programs for the poor. She's spending it on bags and jewelry and frankly to me it's just a hedonistic waste. That's just my opinion though",5년 전,1,

Also, The Philippines can’t be called “A very poor country” because there are a lot of wealthy and rich families in here, We are also rich in natural resources, Us Filipinos are more like ‘middle class’ cause we aren’t wealthy or poor. But I do admit that there are a lot of Filipinos that are poor, Which I wish the government and us citizens would give them more help but besides from that... Get the famous artists’ concerts here all at once or at least all in one month especially the K-Pop groups as the Philippines is one of the largest K-Pop fanbases cause almost our whole country is hooked and addicted to K-Pop and get them to have their concerts here all at once and you’ll see how much people will be able to attend even if concert tickets here in the Philippines are way more pricy and expensive than other countries’ concert tickets.

Me or any other average person participating in capitalist society in order to survive is not comparable to billionaires putting their money in a safe haven, thus not paying taxes or ensuring any redistribution of their wealth. It is important to not be fooled by philanthropy which only serves as an alibi for humility all the while these billionaires have the means to control production. Capitalism requires slow dismantling of the superstructure and me flipping off my boss is not enough to accomplish that. We as members of the working class literally do not OWN our OWN means of production, we are obligated to alienate them to the higher ups who, surprise, are the ones cashing out and constantly accumulating insane amounts of money because, as said earlier, they protect that money from the harms of currency speculation.",5년 전,1,

And the leather is so stiff that the zips and the accessibility aspect is just kinda inconvenient.   plus, considering the price, you kinda treat the bag like glass because its so hard to get on the waitlist (like, a 5 year waitlist) so overall I'd rather spend my money on Chanel's cruise collection than something that I'd spend years waiting for and then using it a few times a year.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@speeeee35,"Do you not know any filthy rich people? They are the worst. Far worse than anyone else. Fun fact: they’re just better at faking it.  Oh and the other difference is that they got ACTUAL jobs instead of being trust fund kids who turned 19 and were like “I’m a painter now. Mom... Can you call your friend and see if he’ll put my pix in his gallery? And dad can you ask your best friend if he’ll put a full page article in his magazine about how I’m an up and coming artist? Thanks love you! Bisou bisou!”  The Kardashians went to finishing school and everything too... and if you didn’t know anything else about them, and ran into them in a store or mall, you would think they were classy too. The only reason you don’t think they’re classy is because you’ve seen their personal moments on a reality show where they’re like arguing with each other and stuff.  What else do they do that’s not classy? Make jokes? Act like human beings? Guarantee that the only difference between these ladies them is that she’s a bigger phony.",4년 전,0,
@juliane5632," @arusu1806  Some of the stuff evangelista has is either gifts and hardwork collection where she sees it a real art and even canvas and some as collab. Some of her money of course goes to her company, home, taxes (even it's low, the higher your wealth you have in the philippines the bigger your tax is) and she still has a spare to give as one of the country in asia has a high poverty especially this year.",4년 전,0,
