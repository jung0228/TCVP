For one thing: BLATANTLY sexualising a 14 year old child actor/ a child character/ a minor Lindsay Lohan. Also keep in mind that this was directed by an almost 40 year old man. Normalising ""jokes"" like, a full grown man being attracted to a child, or spying on someone while they're naked or in the bath just because you can. ""It's just a joke, relax!"" No. It's not a joke because it's not funny. Some SNL sketches are really good, but when I watched this one, all my respect just flew away.

@ulibarriL," @puputput9125  In the skit, Lindsay Lohan is not portraying Emma Watson. She is portraying Hermione Granger. Emma Watson is an actress, just like Lindsay, portraying a fictional character.  You need to come back down to reality, because down here, the only person being sexualized is Lindsay Lohan.  The pictures of Emma Watson before she turned 18 has nothing to do with this, and it doesn't matter whether she was 18 or not, because she never gave her consent, which makes it totally wrong and a violation of her privacy no matter how old she was at the time.  The skit is only a problem with those who have a problem with it. The skit was not and still is not a violation of any law.

I think we are coming to realize that more and more as a society and it's a good thing. The age of consent should probably be partner dependent, 18 year olds only being able to date 17-19 year olds, 20 year olds being able to date 19-23 year olds, and 25 year olds and up being able to date 23 year olds and up for example. Not saying that would be the exact ages, but I think it would be a much better idea than just opening the floodgates at 18.

@nikoniortnike," @saysomethingaldcsbiggestfan  are you making a moral or legal argument?   Because legally, SNL skits take place in New York, where the age of consent is 17. So this is permissible under New York law.  Morally speaking, I assume you oppose pedophilia on the basis that minors are not mature enough to consent to sexual activities. If so, I must ask. With regards to maturity, what differentiates an 17 and 9 month old individual from an 18 year old? How is it moral in one case but not in the other?",1년 전,0,
@saysomethingaldcsbiggestfan," @nikoniortnike  you literally just said in a previous comment “morally”. I’m not talking about consent, I’m talking about the way she’s portrayed here.

@nikoniortnike," @saysomethingaldcsbiggestfan  I asked for clarification of your position because it sounded like you were making a legal argument, as morally speaking, your stance makes no sense.

What difference do 2 months make. You haven't answered my question.   On your other point, I agree. We have reached an impasse.

@TheDarkShadowMann, @ak102986  yeah but it doesn't mean she was an adult that's a mistake people did they treated her as an adult nit knowing she's just a teenager trying to have fun because if so much work that was coming her way people judged her for her every mistake even tho she's a teenager and teenagers make many mistakes she was born mature and if you know the true history of Lindsay you would know she was being over sexualized since 14 years old so poor Lindsay thought it was ok for them to make this SNL but it wasn't ofc no one will say anything about her being younger because she was very attractive and many men wanted her so they didn't want to stop her from being over sexualized at younger age even her money hungry family didn't mind that she was young as long as they were getting that cash. Do you know even her brothers told the media that they jacked to there own sister Lindsay it was disgusting 😭🤢,1년 전(수정됨),3,
@ak102986," @TheDarkShadowMann But what I am arguing is that she was not a teenager. That she exists in a grey area between teenage and adult.   I am not arguing she was not oversexualized, but that is a matter of how you define oversexualized and the fault of her parents/industry.   You are confusing the issue with other problems. Is the sketch in poor taste? That is an opinion. Does the sketch do anything from 2004 that was illegal? Nope. It is immoral? Again that is an opinion.   The age of consent in NY is 17, she was 17. If you can consent to sex then this sketch is not a problem. She does not show her boob, it is relatively minor in terms of anything. If she was a normal teenage girl, going to the beach, she would be wearing less.   I would argue it is only because of her trouble that this is even an issue. Yeah, she comes from a broken home. So do many children.   So, if the issue is she is underage, then that should mean movies with her being underage should be problematic, including Freaky Friday where she grabs both her breasts and ass in a scene, and mean girls, where you have a group of supposed to be high schooler (i.e. underage) dancing in sexy Christmas costume.   Also, if she did not have to do the sketch SNL would have canceled it and done something else. According to numerous sources happens all of the time when the guest rejects a sketch for one reason or another.",1년 전(수정됨),0,

Are you ok secondly yes this is what I'm saying they have been over sexualized her in several films including mean girls yes they have and even the media said vile things about her when she was a teenager that I will not repeat thus no matter 18 or 19 she was still practically a baby at the time and no matter the fact that you think snl would cancel it wrong SNL has always been a shit show for guys and has been unfunny for quiet a long time now so when they start falling naturally they bring in females to over sexualize and if you in any way defend there actions against young teenage women that makes you a indeed*pedophille* and you have something wrong with you,1년 전(수정됨),0,

@Jesus-saves411,"🧙🪄 “What Must I Do To Be Saved?”   This is the most important question in human existence and one whose answer is clearly outlined in scripture. In order to be saved we must first realize our true state of sinfulness before God and know that He alone can save us, cleanse us, and give us eternal life. Scripture tells us that Jesus is the only way and we can not have access to God through any other means. In fact, in John 14:6, Jesus plainly stated... ""I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.""  God Loves You! God loves you so much that he made a way for you, through the shed blood of his son so that you might be able to spend eternity with Him.  “For God so loved the world that he gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have Everlasting Life” ( Jn. 3:16 ).   Man is a Sinner, and Sin has Separated him from God! You may think you are a good person but being good is not enough! Every man has sinned and there is none that is righteous before God!  “For there is not a just man upon Earth, that doeth good and sinneth not” ( Eccl. 7:20 ). “For all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God” (Rom. 3:23).   Jesus Christ is the Only Remedy for Sin!  Jesus Christ is the only remedy for sin. We can not be good enough to get into heaven, nor can our good works get us there.   There was no other way for God to erase the effect of sin except by blood. The shedding of Christ's blood indicated that the penalty for sin had been paid; a perfect sinless life had been sacrificed for the lives of all who have sinned.  “. . .Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins” ( Hebrews 9:22 ) “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God...” ( I Pet. 3:18 ). “Neither is there Salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” ( Acts 4:12 ).  You Must Receive Jesus Christ as Your Lord and Savior To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord, while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life. This confession of Christ as Lord assumes that it is Christ who will work and fulfill His own righteousness within man, as man is unable to attain righteousness of his own accord.   Jesus calls this experience the “new birth.” He told Nicodemus: “. . . Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God” ( Jn. 3:3 ). We invite you now to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour. “But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His Name” ( Jn. 1:12 ). Pray this Prayer and Mean it with all Your Heart Dear Lord Jesus, I realize that I am a sinner and have broken your laws. I understand that my sin has separated me from you. I am sorry and I ask you to forgive me. I accept the fact that your son Jesus Christ died for me, was resurrected, and is alive today and hears my prayers. I now open my heart’s door and invite Jesus in to become my Lord and my Saviour. I give Him control and ask that He would rule and reign in my heart so that His perfect will would be accomplished in my life. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.  Congratulations! If you prayed this prayer in all sincerity, you are now a Child of God. However there are a few things that you need to do to follow up on your commitment. 	•	Get baptized ( full immersion) in water as commanded by Christ 	•	Tell someone else about your new faith in Christ. 	•	Spend time with God each day through prayer and Bible reading 	•	Seek fellowship with other followers of Jesus🤍🙏🏼",1년 전,0,

@paulg6274," @TheDarkShadowMann  I'm not sure how many times I need to repeat that she is acting here and not having sex.  Yes there is immoral stuff that goes on in Hollywood with minors but this isn't it.    (Edit: before you freak out, I noticed your other post and made a new reply below.) On a SEPERATE TOPIC, in regards to sexual consent laws: Some ppl are ready for physical relationship at 16 whlle others are still not ready at 25.  We need to set an age for the law cause the logistics of assessing it on a case by case basis are impossible. The unofficial rule of ""half your age plus 7"" actually works pretty well most of the time.  If I understand correctly, you're arguing that actors should not be allowed to participate in any scene that is remotely sexual until 18 (?) Does it actually make a big difference in your mind if Lindsay is 17+10 months vs 18+1 day?  Like, the former is disgusting but the latter is fine? 🤔      If Lindsay didn't want to do this scene and was cohersed or manipulated into it, obviously that would be bad. But there is no indication that was the case and I think the subject material was quite harmless:  ""Guy finds a 17 yr old, fully developed, gorgeous female attractive but she's too young to persue anything with.""

@TheDarkShadowMann," @painoyoutube  People are murdered, is a part of reality too. Even so, is not something to be accepted and normalized. Same goes for rape, child abuse, harassment, etc. Just because it happens, doesn't mean it should be normal or socially accepted. Would you like to be in those victims' positions? Or watch some of your loved ones in those positions? I don't think so. And to fight these things, we gotta fight other more subtle things that may send a less good message about sexuality. Is not right to fantasize about teenagers or children if you have enough age to be their parents. They don't have the same maturity and notion as an adult, even the most mature ones. Is simply not healthy physically and mentally speaking, if you read researches on the topic. And no, women don't mature before 18 years old, our bodies continue to develop until our early twenties. Only after that are we strong enough to bear children, for example. Some girls have their first period at 10, yet they're far from ready to give birth. They may even die because their bodies aren't prepared. Just read about Henry VII of England's mother, Margaret Beaufort, who gave birth at the age of 13. Or watch documentaries about girls being wed and impregnated at the age of 15, in Africa. They will be far from pleasant and correct.",1년 전,0,

@BigSlimyBlob," @BasedHumanx  Forced? You say that like they put a gun to her head. Given the skit, they are most definitely not pedophiles. All the characters suddenly found her much much more attractive specifically because she had developed large breasts, which a pedophile (who prefers prepubescent individuals) would have found less attractive, not more. And I don't see why the age difference would matter. Her body is one that a normal heterosexual male would find sexually appealing, no matter what his age is. A 90 year old man doesn't suddenly find 80 year old women attractive, he still likes 16 year olds the most.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@BasedHumanx, @BigSlimyBlob  dumbass she was forced because this was her first skit and if she didn't do it she wouldn't get to ever host SNL and they told her we will analyze your performance in your first air then we will get you as the host of snl. They said it knowing that poor Lindsay she wanted to be on tv for her family but they didn't care they only made her get sexualized and viewed by 30 year old men in this sketch don't you know all the men here was 30 not 17 or 20 like are you sick in the head or something??

@BigSlimyBlob,"​ @BasedHumanx  That particular actress has had some difficult time with drugs and whatnot, and I definitely wouldn't be OK with that. But we're talking about the skit here, and there's nothing wrong with it. It's objectively not a pedophile case. She's way, way, way past puberty. Roughly seven years. Statistically speaking she'd most likely fantasized about all sorts of stuff and probably had sex already. But you're concerned about a comical, wholesome ""Hoho, this girl grew boobs over the summer and now the boys are drooling"" joke? That doesn't make any sense.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@BasedHumanx, @BigSlimyBlob  kid see you just proved my point how can you think she had s#@ before if you don't even know her. Secondly it's pedophile case because all men were starting at a 17 year old girl imagine behind told this story in a book about a skit where 30 year old actors stare at a 16 year olds you know what. It's absolutely disgusting and immature even Donal trump said that he would love to take her to his bed yet he was 50 and she was 16 y'all are pedophiles,1년 전(수정됨),0,

@RatatRatR,"I can see finding this skit crass, but let's not go building up some ""everything is rape"" nonsense.",1년 전,0,
@TrueWalker88," @RatatRatR  Yes, that's what it is. It comes in numerous forms. They are joking about statutory rape because an underage person is not able to give consent by law. The legal definition is: ""engaging in any type of sexual activity (physical, verbal or visual) with a child, even if the child says 'yes' at the time."" Anytime there's a sexual act toward someone without their consent, that's sexual assault. Watching someone naked without their consent is considered a form of non-contact sexual violence and therefore assault. That's why the crime has 1st degree, 2nd degree, 3rd degree, etc, there is a continuum.   Continue to educate yourself, it's pretty important. You shouldn't have to be told, it should be basic common sense and decency.  Your unwanted sexual feelings toward someone can go beyond attraction and into criminal territory. You are not entitled to someone just because you find them attractive. Feeling or thinking is one thing, and sexually projecting at someone is bad enough. They can usually sense it and no one likes a creep. But speaking, gesturing or making nonverbal communication is when it becomes an action.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@TrueWalker88," @RatatRatR  No one said everything is rape. But a bunch of 30-somethings skeeving on a teenager is everything I said it was. And you know it. You just don't want to admit that you're a creep, too.",1년 전(수정됨),0,
@TrueWalker88,"​ @RatatRatR  No one said everything is rape. but an adult teacher having sex with an underage student would be statutory rape. Watching someone take a bath without their knowledge or consent also falls into the sexual assault category. So these are rape jokes. Also, adults making a skit sexualizing an underage actor is the same thing. If you only associate the word rape with penetration, you need more education on sexual assault. If you are feeling defensive or need to have that explained to you, you are likely just triggered about your own skeeviness.

@yesyesyesyes1600,"Okay, so let me tell you how I see that ""Stereo"" joke. I think they did something absolutely great here.  First - the Latin thing: in ancient Roman Latin ""incendio"" means ""I am setting on fire"" which is not just a reference to the source (Harry Potter spell list) AND the fire place, but could also mean that she is making him engulf into flames by her beauty and appearance.  Second: Couchio. A ""couch"" (a piece of furniture you can sit or lay down on) derives from the French word couche which again derives from the Latin word collocare which means ""to sit down/lay down"". In French ""coucher"" means also not just ""to sleep"" but ""to sleep with"" somebody.   And last but not least -  ""Stereo"": They could have said ""music"" or ""radio"", but stereo means that there are at least two sources of sound. If you listen stereo and have 2 loudspeakers left and right you hear different sounds or instruments left and right IF the music was recorded in  stereo. Here we also have the 2 brothers left and right and I am sure they would give an arm to take her stereo. 😂 It comes even better. Stereo derives from the greek word stereós which actually means ""stiff"" and ""hard"". And can be found in ""to stare at"" someone/something. Later it got the meaning of 3dimensional hearing because of stereón (""volume"") Not conviced yet?  The joke gets even better. 😂 Yesterday I showed this piece of art a buddy of mine and he burst out into laughter. I was like - okay, it's funny. That's the reason I showed him this episode in the first place. But that funny?!  So I asked him, why he was laughing so hard. And he asked: ""Couldn't you hear that? The music! It started with the ""Pornhub""-jingle.""  Whoever wrote this joke - is a pure genius 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩",1년 전,2,

@TrueWalker88," @Yellowandblack37  The whole point of having an age of consent is that a person is not old enough to have the maturity to consent to things up until the age society has deemed appropriate. In the US, that's 18. Underage actors also have parents who sign off on things until they are legal. Obviously there is some grey area when it comes to the moment people reach maturity. Turning 18 doesn't suddenly make a person emotionally mature, they are still a teenager and not even an adult yet, but still, they are legally responsible for whatever they do after their 18th birthday. In her case, she was pushed into sexualizing herself as a teenager by her insane momager. Her dad was absent from parenting so Lindsay turned out the way she did from crappy parents and an audience who was willing to exploit her, as in this skit.

Plenty of teenagers have budding sexual feelings but are still emotionally healthy, not going full porn fantasy at 17 or being objectified on national television. It's skits like this that led her to self harm and addiction. That's not the kind of love you want from your parents - pimping you out for fame and money.

This type of attraction is often beyond our conscious control and may occur without us even realizing it.

Luke 13:3 [3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.  John 14:6 [6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Matthew 18:11  For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.  John 8:12 [12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.   Matthew 4:17  From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.   Luke 6:27-38 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,  6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.  6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.  6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.  6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.  6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.  6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.  6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.  6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.  Matthew 5:2-12 King James Version 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.  Matthew 24:4-14  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. 24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.   Exodus 20 King James Version 20 And God spake all these words, saying,  2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.  5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;  6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.  7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:  10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:  11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.  12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.  13 Thou shalt not kill.  14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.  15 Thou shalt not steal.  16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.  17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.    ..,..,..,..,..",3년 전,0,

@estebancomulet,"SO I have nothing against Emma, Rowling or Radcliffe etc, but just have a very INTERESTING anecdote about how pervasive and huge an indent it has made in our culture. I'm now 37 years old and from London.  I haven't read the books or seen any of the movies. When I was around 30-35 years of age, I went on a lot of Tinder and Hinge dates and EVERY time, without fail, I was asked by the woman 'Are you a Harry Potter fan'? (they invariably were - read the books, bought the t-shirt, dyed-in-the-wool take a bullet for Harry' fans). And always within the first 30 minutes of the date, like it was an elephant in the room waiting to broached. There was NOT ONE DATE where it wasn't mentioned. I should state there was nothing mentioned about Potter in my profile at all - I am not a fan, nor do I hate it - just indifferent, never cared to read one. Nor do I look like any member of the cast, no more than anyone else. And we're talking about approximately 45-50 dates in total over 5 years. I started to keep a mental tally because it was just becoming too ridiculous. I thought there was one who was NOT going to mention it, as the date was wrapping up, and went very well. And technically she didn't - but the next morning, as I was coming to, I noticed she had since slipped into casual wear, and was - I shit thee not - wearing a Harry Potter t-shirt (which she was very becoming on her it must be said), she gave me a cup of tea in a Potter mug, and her bookshelves were lined with Potter.

@Rose_Bride,"I keep seeing comments here saying that Lindsey Lohan was actually only 17 years old when she did this skit. If that's true then this is both DISGUSTING and EXTREMELY INAPPROPRIATE, having LITERAL grown men (and the grown woman portraying ""Harry Potter"") oggling this child. Let's be honest; even if she was 18 it would STILL be disgusting. I remember as an 18 year old I was still mentally a CHILD despite the fact that I had an ""adult"" figure.  The most disturbing thing is that all the ""adult"" actors who were involved in this skit today try to act like they are social activists who care ""so much"" about social justice, when they were perfectly content to sxu@lize this CHILD. NO WONDER Lohan had such a rough adulthood littered with trauma and scandals. The so called ""adults"" in her life completely failed her.",4년 전(수정됨),12,

That entire season, penis size was mocked, jokes about, etc, in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE that year, all but one episode.  But BOO HOO, it's directed at a woman and all you women, I'm guessing, are offended.

It’s like they just hurried in as many unprepared PEOPLE as they could to almost make their own cast seem hilarious by comparison. And then once the show basically became an entirely new cast aside from Keenan Thompson, the show has almost just become a parody of itself, and what it used to be back when it actually mattered.

@bigmanmccheez5342,"Alright, here's the thing. Whenever something is filmed to be shot and aired on TV, consent needs to be given by the actors. If Linsey had consented to doing this skit, being of age and knowing that it is for comedy purposes, then it is fine. People forget that these are actors, they aren't actually sexualizing the girl themselves. They're playing the role of teenagers, who are attracted to a class mate, that's it. The comments saying ""the other actors are like 30"" so? it's acting; they're playing a role. It's only weird if you make it weird. If you take it for what it is, that being a comedy skit, then that's what it is. If you go into detail about stuff and find problems, that's when it gets weird.  She is 18 by the time it releases, cool, it's not pedophilic, and even if it may be seen as it to some, there's proof that it's not meant to be. It's weird that the actors are 27-30.

America itself is a country built off of slave labor, plundering nature resources, and rape of women and men?   Shouldn’t all Americans be held responsible for what happens and has happened in America?   This is probably the reason why every other country hates our ass because we shift blame on each other, instead of realizing we are all individually responsible for what happens in our midst.   It’s like we are more reactionary than preventative, meaning we’d rather hang the accused rather than prevent a crime from happening in the first place.   Parents should protect their children or they shouldn’t have them. People need to stop putting pictures of their underage children online in their parent theatre, if they don’t want creeps to get a hold of them.   People who can’t afford to maintain a child’s needs should not reproduce, but they do, and who do we blame then?   In the end it doesn’t matter who’s fault it is if we are 1. Looking to place blame on anyone other than ourselves. And 2. Have no intention of protecting our children who we want to save ironically.",4년 전,1,
@zavd.r.3638," @millmille2131  “wrong things” aren’t overtly wrong but wrong depending on your morals which not everyone has the same stance. Since sexualizing children is absolutely wrong, why is it legal to be a teen mom?   old enough to birth children, but not old enough to conceive them? That’s what doesn’t make any sense imo. If we really cared about children and their safety we wouldn’t leave them in the care of untrained parents, but we do, and my own mom had kids when she was 17. So where’s the logic in that? Where’s the laws that prevent crimes instead of all the ones that punish for them?   How is it even possible justifying being a teen mom, in any circumstance, based off of this logic?",4년 전(수정됨),0,

@HRDKR93," @kimster69  if they seem creepy, sounds to me like good acting. I do get what you're saying, I just don't agree. Not everybody has to agree on everything. What I'm saying is when I was 17 (even younger) people used to think I was over 18, I used to drink in pubs without getting my ID checked. Not just because I LOOKED over age, but I also ACTED it. Age is am arbitrary number. We use ages to define when people are ready for things AS AN AVERAGE. Otherwise nobody would be drinking until their late twenties (legally). What you're trying to tell me is that there is no such thing as ""exception to the rule"" when it comes to age. Which I personally find to be quite stupid, as I know many young people who are wise beyond their years, and even more older people who are ignorant as fuxk. I would take your stance if this was pornhub, or if she was topless, but she's not. She's wearing clothing that modern tiktokers would deem not revealing enough.

The Nazis were blatantly left with a government so large and powerful it seized the private assets of it’s citizens to pay for is massive social policies.  Also fascism was founded by Giovanni gentilie an avowed socialist who himself developed the ideology as a step further to the left by incorporating the it on the national level.  Read a book and lay off the young Turks. People like you and their denialism attempt to take the worst aspects of governmental history and attempt to project its stupidity on what you believe to be your political opponents, then actually believe it’s true.

Thus leading to the fact that her parents had to sign on with this along with her agent. I’m not blaming the actress at all, I do believe that the people that encouraged her to do it are at fault. Along with the people defending the sexualization of a 17 year old girl. It doesn’t matter if it’s a boy nor girl, if it was a boy then I would have come to the same verdict, it’s actually worrisome that you which I assume to be a Feminist ally are perfectly find with a minor being sexualized for entertainment purposes. I’m not saying she wasn’t smart enough to realize what she was doing, I’m saying that no one should allow/promote such behavior it’s down right sickening.

@scarveza,"@Pril a child becomes a young woman on there 16th birthday. In my opinion not able to consent intelligently but to call a 17 year old 3 months from becoming 18 a “child” is a big stretch on your part. To answer your question no I don’t agree with the sexuality of a miner but cmon that’s the least of the issue when these people are referencing a actual child and sexualizing the likeness of that child , you shouldn’t be focusing on the consensual intentions of a more than capable adult when there is a more pressing issue at hand",4년 전(수정됨),1,

Yeah, I suppose it’s an issue that the movie and fashion industry uses underage (<18y) kids , especially girls, in a highly sexualized context. Sometimes it’s part of the story and seems ok, but other times it does seem gratuitous. You can only assume the kids’ guardians have signed off on such “acting” gigs.

Yes, Emma Watson is an adult now but they created this, like you said, almost 10 years ago. Meaning she was just 20 when this came out. What makes this even worse is they are sexualizing the character she played when she was just 9 -18. So you need to apologize, say it was wrong of you to devalue the disgusting sexualizing experiences both of these amazing woman were put through and change the way you view this situation.

Seriously, being an adult is knowing what to do at the right time and the amount of experience you have accumulated throughout that time. A child born into war is way more matured to an adult born in the U.S. A child born into poverty is way more matured to a child born into riches and vice versa depending on their condition.

Perceived maturity has little to do with it, it's just societal foolishness vomited over all of it. Increasingly older young people are immature because they're treated as such, even forced into such a role to a degree. In times past people would just give adult responsibilities to teenagers after they went through puberty.

Why not have more uplifting experiences than when they have totally discovered themselves they can go “ oh I would love to be in that skit it would bring me joy that is so me!”  I’m not exactly convinced that’s what happened here in this skit.

I don’t care to be honest if you’re creeped out because someone is 2 months younger I don’t know what to tell you. Yes that is illegal in the US but I still don’t care that much. It’s not like she was 13 or something she was basically an adult. You’re just paying attention to the legal age of consent. Now I’m not saying that’s ok. I’m not into kids or anything I just wouldn’t say it’s necessarily creepy. Because she is basically an adult. Just to say I definitely don’t approve of the sexualization of minors I just don’t care in this situation since she is essentially an adult. She just looks way too much like an adult in this sketch. And don’t go grab your pitch fork and call me a pedophile or something like that because I’m literally younger than she was in this sketch currently. I’m not some creepy old man just to tell you. The main point of what I’m saying is that no matter how old I get I don’t think I will ever find this sketch creepy. Actually the fact that she was 17 in this makes me laugh even harder because of how they didn’t just wait 2 months so that people who observe every joke to find one flaw can’t really find that much to use.

@justintime1343,"Amen,  @justTyping !  I suspect that some of these people (particularly women) are deliberately misusing the term ""pedophilia"" for no other reason than because they're jealous of Lindsay's attractive, youthful voluptuousness, and the attention & admiration which she received for it.  A blind man can see that she's decidedly fully-grown, post-pubescent, and eating up all of the attention she's getting.  What's truly unfortunate, is the fact that by casually misusing the term ""pedophilia"" where it doesn't apply, they're cheapening the term, and thereby cheapening the experience of actual children who've actually suffered at the hands of actual pedophiles.  For that, they should truly be ashamed.",5년 전,1,

Please stop making this a kind of child abuse, which would be way other th top. It may be disproportionate (especially nowadays), but not as huge as you would like to see it. Again: I dont know the backround and I guess you do neither.  I find that scene quite funny. Not because of the cleavage. That is not interesting.

@benr3799,"My guess as to why she is (sexualized so much) is due to a certain section of the fanbase. That same fan base that attacks J.K. Rowling for her viewpoints on feminism. The ones that perverted her characters to their liking in a way that was NOT intended by Rowling. You could also blame Hollywood for casting an attractive teen to fill an attractive teen’s role. It’s a story for kids, but unfortunately some adults out there sexualized all young female actresses at the time. Emma got it so bad just as a result of the massive popularity of HP.  The culture has been injecting sex into culture openly since the 60’s, so I truly do not understand what is so surprising about this. You can’t have sexual revolution and freedom in only one dimension of sexuality. That is just moralism. Who is to say sex is bad after all? Christians? You wouldn’t be here without it. I’ll leave it at that, you puritanical Christian life-perverters littering the comments not understanding your own societal biases. I’m sure you’d love growing up in a country where age of consent is 25, after full brain development. You’d hate childhood. 1/3 to 1/4 of your life would be gone before you could live it fully. Yeah, exactly, everyone wants the age to be lower when they are young so they can LIVE TO THE FULLEST. Then once we are old, we want to stop our kids from having sex for as long as possible. Disgusting American tradition. Selfishness and puritanical grime left over from the 1700’s at its finest. Age of consent could easily be like getting a drivers license, once you can fully understand the responsibilities that come with portions of adulthood, you can access them like the rest of humans. You shouldn’t be held back because of age, that is dangerous thinking and selfish thinking. Some kids don’t live to the age of 18. Think about that. Think about their rights. Protecting vulnerable children from harm is important, but so is letting them live an unrestrained life (before it’s too late). Historical societies (let’s say Egypt) only lived till maybe their 30’s. I don’t believe they would have sequestered over half of a human’s time on earth to being “too dumb” to participate in society. There are children smarter and more capable than fully fledged members of US society who are 40. Why should they not be allowed to make choices for themselves? Why are they legally considered too dumb to make conscious decisions?? Society would be the laughingstock of the animal world if they could understand it. Anyway rant over, don’t prey on children, help children choose exactly what they want to do in life and allow them to follow their own path without interference, or if it must happen, with minimal intrusion on their human and constitutional rights to privacy, dignity,  opportunity, liberty, and happiness. I was unhappy as a child because of US minor laws. They are OUTDATED and hold society back. Funnel money into education instead of paying your (apparently borderline-too-dumb-to-choose) 18 year olds to kill innocent civilians in other countries with guns. This is not America. This is puritanical and moral chaos developed by the evangelical church to attempt to eliminate sex and education from society. It’s failed on so many levels, and it’s time to think about the feelings of children instead of treating them as inanimate objects until the age of 18",3년 전,0,

@psychoPilgrim36," @shakabrah3030  it is still creepy depending on the age gap. A 30 year old dating an 18 year old is legal but its still gross and also known as “cradle robbing”. You guys are the idiots who cant seem to grasp the concept of mental maturity. And dont even try that bullshit of “some 18 year olds are really mature!” Because even the most mature 18 year old shouldnt be with a 30 year old, and the thing is... mature 18 year olds usually dont want 30 year olds. Its the immature ones that get trapped in relationships like that. An 18 year old and a 30 year old are in completely different life arenas. The 18 year old just got out of high school and is maybe going to college, probably works at mcdonalds and has had a couple relationships and almost no independence. A 30 year old has been out of high school for 12 years, probably has a more established job, probably has more money, and has a fully developed brain. They probably live on their own, 18 year olds are more likely to live with their parents. Why would a 30 year old be interested in someone who is in such a different place in their life? The only answer that makes sense is that they want a power imbalance. Why would they want to date a kid as opposed to someone who is in their life arena? Thats why its more acceptable if a 40 year old dates a 30 year old, they are both in the same life arena even though they have a big age gap. 18 year olds have a lot to learn in life, even if they are really smart. They still have so much to learn about the world, wouldnt someone older want someone who has already learned those things? But i know that no matter how hard i try to explain that to you, you wont get it or agree. Like yeah, older men can totally think lindsay lohan is hot even if she was 17, its just that normal people wouldnt say that. They would think it in their head. Cause obviously it’s undeniable that shes pretty but only a creep would be like “oh this 17 year old is so hot and sexy”. Most people have a conscience that tells them that its wrong to say things like that about someone who isnt even a legal adult. They arent bad people for feeling that way because like i said, clearly she is pretty. But they would be bad people if they acted like it was ok to talk dirty about an underage teenager. Because if that kind of thing was acceptable, then that means high school teachers could just talk openly about how hot they think their students are and thats disgusting",5년 전,8,

@psychoPilgrim36," @avada0   the reason people call them gross is because they are. If a 50 year old is attracted to a 16 year old then they are a MAP, a minor attracted person. Which is gross and weird. If you dont understand why, read my previous comments again until you get it. Being physically developed doesn’t equate to being mentally developed and adults who feel comfortable saying they are attracted to minors are fucked up because they are ignoring the fact that the minor is in a completely different mental state and place in their life. And when i say minor in this case i am talking about someone who is physically developed because like i said before, i know that they can be attractive but its the mental aspect and lack of life experience that makes them unappealing. And as for women getting away with it easier, you’re right and thats stupid. The pain of male victims of statutory rape is mocked and made light of in media and its ridiculous.",5년 전,0,

I don't know who came up with this idiotic ""mentally developed"" fallacy but you fools sure like to latch on it. Humans reach their complete cognitive capacity by their teenage years, after that they gain experience. Not only that, but mental ""development"" has nothing to do with sexuality.

@bangtansoya9046," @mariajosefenton3728  Just tell me how you found out she was underage. Plz just tell me. Which btw has been proven by Justin that she wasn't, because the age of consent in New York (which is where they are) at that time was 17. Not only was she 17 during the recording of this, but she was also 2 months from 18.  And btw, OF COURSE it matters whether they know or not. Are you being serious? What if a 16 year old lies about her age to an adult and he hooks up with her? Is that his fault? Or is it the fault of the 16 year old for being stupid and irresponsible? Maybe her parents? If you don't know the real age of someone in such a situation, OF COURSE IT MATTERS.  I'm willing to bet the writers didn't know about it either. And btw it's not sexual. Srsly, YOU'RE the one who seeing it that way, because idk you got some problems maybe... I mean, millions of other people are finding it hilarious and you, a much smaller group of people, are finding it sexual. Who's in the wrong here?   This is clearly made to be funny, and if you don't see it that way, that's on you. I remember when I was 16 and some of the girls where already growing up fast in my class. Had big ol' titties, and the guys would always joke about it. They never said ""I wanna fuck her"" or anything sexual like that, they were just being kids and blushing, being shy and awkward and shit. Was good times.  Also, you think Hermione is underage? Well so is Harry, so is Ron..... So what's the problem? The only reason they cast grown adults for those roles, is because this is SNL and most of the cast is grown adults. But they have to have the host in on it, because why else have a host? So they cast Lindsey. And the obvious role for her was Hermione lol.... And by the fucking way......HARRY IS BEING PLAYED BY A DAMN WOMAN.  Btw, I like how you argument can be literally simplified to: ""I don't like this and think it's wrong therefore it's wrong. I'm not gonna use any reasonable methods of explaining why it's wrong in a general sense (Like i'm doing btw.), I'm just gonna say it's wrong because I, ME 1 PERSON AMONG 7 FREAKING BILLION, find it wrong"". Again with this bullshit in this damn generation. When are people like you going to realize the world isn't about you? It doesn't give a fuck about your feelings? You people lack humility to dangerous levels.  But again, just answer my question. How did you find about it? That she was underage? Because when I first saw this, I didn't know and I actually didn't even think about it, I just thought ""This is funny"". And of course that matters. And if you don't it matters, plz stop saying it and explain to me why?   And if this is so wrong, plz explain how. How is wrong? Because so far you've said it's wrong without actually explaining how or why. Explain to me how, this has a negative effect on whatever. Stop just saying it's wrong as if it's already something agreed upon by the vast majority. Because it isn't. Again, millions of people saw this and they liked it.",4년 전,1,

@the-evie-show,MHproductions I think it still would have been very creepy if she was 18. It has less to do with her specific age and more about the gap between her and the 30 year olds sexualising her.

@mayarthecatslover1," @the-evie-show  it's meant to be taken as a skit man, they're not actively sexualising her it's just the characters they are playing are attracted to this girl and they are all the same age, teenagers(except for Hagrid lol). You're not gonna shape your entire cast lineup based on the age of the actress that's playing the main role. The reason why they picked Lohan is because she was a popular up-and-coming attractive teenage star that fit the role of an attractive student, pretty sure casting a 40 year old to play a girl that recently went through puberty wont be as convincing. Overall the skit's theme is sexual but that doesn't mean the actors were actively sexualising Lindsay Lohan the actress. Just like how actors make out and ""have sex"" in movies even though it's all being acted for the sake of the scene and no real sentiment is being shown by the actors and actresses.",5년 전,19,

The writers just should have thrown out the idea or used it with an older actress.  3. She is absolutely capable of making her own decisions... but there are teenagers all over the world who make their own decision to be in relationships with older people, without realising those relationships are predatory. Just to be clear, I am not equating this sketch to a predatory relationship; just using that as an analogy to try and prove my point. Also, it is easy to feel pressured into doing something you don’t want to do when parents and managers are telling you to do it.

@cringecat3614," @typicaldenielle3854  I agree with you. No one should be sexualizing no one, men or women. Above people with a penis or boobs, we are human beings with feelings.

@cringecat3614," @CoasterCoat  People are murdered, is a part of reality too. Even so, is not something to be accepted and normalized. Same goes for rape, child abuse, harassment, etc. Just because it happens, doesn't mean it should be normal or socially accepted. Would you like to be in those victims' positions? Or watch some of your loved ones in those positions? I don't think so. And to fight these things, we gotta fight other more subtle things that may send a less good message about sexuality. Is not right to fantasize about teenagers or children if you have enough age to be their parents. They don't have the same maturity and notion as an adult, even the most mature ones. Is simply not healthy physically and mentally speaking, if you read researches on the topic. And no, women don't mature before 18 years old, our bodies continue to develop until our early twenties. Only after that are we strong enough to bear children, for example. Some girls have their first period at 10, yet they're far from ready to give birth. They may even die because their bodies aren't prepared. Just read about Henry VII of England's mother, Margaret Beaufort, who gave birth at the age of 13. Or watch documentaries about girls being wed and impregnated at the age of 15, in Africa. They will be far from pleasant and correct.",5년 전(수정됨),35,
@typicaldenielle3854,"Voldemortadella there’s a difference being sexual and being sexualized,  being sexual means expressing ur own self of ur sexuality by behavior or how you talk being sexualized means no matter what you do you are viewed as sexual. there’s a difference",5년 전,28,
@cringecat3614," @CoasterCoat  Now you made your point! But as the other person said, you may be confusing sexuality with sexualization. Of course we need to desire our potential partners! I desire men! But I don't look at a man or a boy and think of him as a piece of meat ready to be eaten all the damn time, even when that person has proven to be so much more than that. That's the difference. Most people who sexualize others do not regard them as real, thinking people, but as objects of pleasure, which was perfectly exemplified by this parody, when Hermione was worried about finding something to stop Voldemort and all the boys cared about were her boobs. And worst things could originate from that, there's no denying. My comment wasn't entirely off topic, I replied according to what I understood from your comments. You need to be careful with words, otherwise people will understand totally different things from what you originally intended to say. Sexualized people can hardly be taken seriously because people don't acknowledge them as capable, thinking human beings. This has been happening with women for ages, and it still happens in our days, though is reducing. And no, I'm not exagerating, I wish I were, though 😕",5년 전(수정됨),17,

But lots of young starlets don't get that tough love, and are only enabled, even by their own parents, because they're money-makers, and people are afraid of getting cut off if they tell them anything they don't want to hear. They're more concerned about getting kicked off the gravy train than of a child's well-being.

@mchevre," @lemonlover22  You'd be surprised the random and unexpected little moments in your adult life where you'll be trying to figure something out, and you'll realize that knowing some basic rules about triangles like angles, the pythagorean theorem and also basic algebra, can really help you figure out whatever it is you were previously stuck on. And I say this as someone who's no math wiz at all, doesn't have a math related job, and its been 20 years since I graduated high school.  That said, students often miss the other major purpose of teaching you these things, other than just preparing you for a potential career and equipping you with basic knowledge for life: It forms the groundwork of your ability to think critically and analytically in general. The process of learning math and doing math literally trains your brain to be better equipped to figure out other things that have nothing to do with math. This has been proven empirically.",10개월 전,0,

@moistman3110,"You're just making a joking point, which is totally fair, but the idea that being attracted to a 17 year old, especially one as fully developed as Lohan was here, is a pedophilic thing is simply rediculous. We look down on preying on children because  A) they are too young to understand what they're doing. That doesn't apply to the vast majority of 17 year old, especially lohan. And B) they are physically underdeveloped to the point of it being no different from being attracted to s 10 year old which is just . . . Ugh. Lindsey is CLEARLY fully developed, objectively physically, and up to a bit of debate mentally. Regardless, if there are still tons of countries that accept 16 as the legal age of consent, then I'm pretty damn sure that 17 is cool in mostly all cases, especially since it's only a year off from the U.S.'s own legal age. My point is that there's too many tightasses who look down on others seeing an essentially fully grown woman in a sexual manner, and it's stupid. And before anyone starts, no I'm not a pedophile dumbfuck. If a girl is fully developed in both categories and consenting then there shouldn't be any problem whatsoever.",5년 전,5,

@SeaJay_Oceans,"It's December 2019: and reportedly, Harry Potter Author J.K. Rowling Faces Criticism for supporting a woman researcher, Maya Forstater, who allegedly may have said, ""framing the question of transgender inclusion as an argument that male people should be allowed into women's spaces discounts women's rights to privacy and is fundamentally illiberal (it is like forcing Jewish people to eat pork)"". [1]     Maya eventually lost her job.   When going to court, they ruled against Maya, with the Judge reportedly stating that Maya ''is absolutist in her view of sex and it is a core component of her belief that she will refer to a person by the sex she considered appropriate ...""

Of all the people in the world, Mother Nature would know...  It’s still so ominous and chilling when referring to myself in the third person. I almost never get used to it.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

@araelsongheart6918,"@Utathya Manna, Two problems. One: Jesus Christ was an arrogant prick. You’d know if you stalked him or even got to know him. Two: Even if the Bible weren’t written by humans as recorded history in a biased manner, by saying such a thing you’ve just violated one of dad’s biggest rules... well, according to the Bible. If you knew my father, you’d know that he didn’t really follow the rules he set forth and wasn’t a good dad at all (hooray for the universe’s first dysfunctional family). But still. If Yashua actually was my dad on Earth, rather than just “gifted,” then you just “use[d] the lords name in vain.”  Anyway, I’m not too serious on telling you this, so don’t get annoyed with all of this. I am who I am, but I just don’t really want to deal with any confusion or any “wtf” messages.   Yeah, I know I could just not post this, but I’ve already completed the message and it would be wasteful to not post it. Mother Nature takes what Mother Nature needs. No more, no less.",6년 전,3,

@araelsongheart6918,"@SimonMing Productions, I have read a significant amount of it. Most of what I read was just after it was written. But, of course you don’t know my dad as well as I do. Mostly because I actually lived with him. Of course, I don’t take much stock in it because it was edited several times to justify human actions, on top of the fact that humans wrote it as recorded history in the first place. Perhaps if it wasn’t so biased and misinterpreted, then I’d say using it as a means to explain certain aspects of history would actually be a viable option.  Alas, many things said in the Bible that are even slightly accurate are misinterpreted because of my family’s history of manipulation and internal feuding.  Also, forgive me for being so “closed minded,” when humans are the ones that couldn’t possibly accept who I am and my story because of a widely accepted notion about my family that just isn’t accurate in the slightest.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@araelsongheart6918,"@SimonMing Productions, Also, I’m not sure what your motive is for criticizing me for my knowledge (or lack thereof, so you seem to think), however the next time you decide to tell someone they don’t know as much as they think, ask yourself the following:  “what do I know for sure about this? Do I have any experience? What does the person know? What have they experienced? And if I tell them that they don’t know as much as they say, and turn out to actually have much experience and actual knowledge, what will I do or say?”  Most likely the answer to the first two questions will vary with the situation. The second two answers will most likely be “I don’t know,” unless you actually know the person well enough. And the final question’s answer could be very different depending on who you’re dealing with, how you’re feeling and/or feel about them, and how they might react.  In this instance I probably wouldn’t have said anything and kept moving if I were in your shoes with the typical human mindset that “Celestial beings wouldn’t parade around in human skin, regardless of their situation. That person is just insane.”  Well, that is a very closed mindset to have, for one. And other than that, my options were say “hi” to Luci and live with him where I wouldn’t be able to experience anything new and different, wander the dimensions with my feelings and unfortunate experiences alone for the rest of eternity, or take up residence on Earth and perhaps see where humanity ends up, and maybe find a few interesting people (that actually make eternity less boring) every century or two.  I took my chances, and so far I haven’t been disappointed.  EDIT: I received a recommendation for “why do stupid people think they’re so smart.” Not the word choice I would have used, but there was a study that has become known as the Dunning-Kruger effect. People who don’t know as much about a certain field of knowledge think they know more than they do because they don’t actually know how much there is to understand and perceive the unknown as a smaller amount than those with extensive knowledge of a subject. Those with extensive knowledge tend to overestimate the amount that they don’t know rather than underestimate the unknown.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@eristineforever6934,"Monomi I ship them from her sixth and seventh year. Maybe fifth as well. I know I am doing this backwards. I am really sorry about it. Any other year, absolutely not. I like to think of it kind of like Erik (The Phantom of the Opera) and Christine. As in he’s kind of like a father to her when she is a kid or teenager and then as time moves on and she is in her sixth or seventh year he becomes much more to her and she becomes much more to him. They fall in love not bothered by the age gap and/or difference. Now, I did found out about pairings done by fans that are soooo much worse and disturbing than this one. And they are -  1. Albus Dumbledore/ Hermione Granger 2. Professor Flitwick/ Hermione Granger  3. Severus Snape/Harry Potter  4. Severus Snape/ Ron Weasley and so on and so forth.   Well, you get the idea. You may think Severus and Hermione is a gross, disturbing pairing but, again, these ones are so much worse. You may hate me for saying this and think I am gross and disturbing but I would rather be with someone who is old enough to be my dad (Severus 😁😍) than someone who is old enough to be my grandpa (Dumbledore 🤢🤮😤😠😡🤬).",6년 전,0,
@eristineforever6934,"Monomi I meant to say Severus/Harry and Severus/Ron is weird. I am really sorry if I offended you in any way. By the way, I have always believed that age doesn’t matter in a relationship. I am going to get off topic here to ask do you know what Eristine is?",6년 전,0,
@eristineforever6934,"Monomi I don’t know why. I can’t explain it. I just don’t ship gay couples... in shows and books that is. It’s nothing against gay people, alright?

@SidPil,I'm surprised so many people think Watson was a good actress in Harry Potter. None of the trio were good actors although tbf they were kids so obviously Lindsay's seems better. However the standard for child actors has risen exponentially and I am excited for the reboot since now we'll actually get good actors and hopefully be more book accurate. People just like the original actors purely due to nostalgia and because they were the original.,2년 전,0,

@jonathanhenly99," R. M  Conservatives are still the ones complaining about comedians. Just look at the original comment in this thread, complaining about SNL.  Most complaints you see about comedians these days come from conservatives.   Today's liberals are not like 'fascists'. If anyone's like fascists it's modern conservatives who effectively want to ban Islam (and other strands of thought they don't like) entirely. Ban anyone who follows Islam from entering the country etc.  That's what repressing free speech looks like. Policing religion, trying to get people fired for kneeling during a song, or doxing people for writing game reviews they don't like etc.",6년 전,0,
@jonathanhenly99," R. M  Most people don't know that because it hasn't happened, and posting propaganda videos from Prager U (FFS) certainty isn't going to be changing my mind, nor many others.  Those videos exist solely as historical revisionism on the part of a conservative propaganda channel that seeks to claim credit for historical liberal achievements by trying to create a division between the 'old liberals' (now termed classical liberals) and the 'new liberals' (the regressive/sjw left, who are supposedly all secret commies).  In reality, it's little more than re packaged McCarthyism, red scare after red scare.",6년 전,0,

@eattoast6378,"@Alpha Omega you know you can just like Google examples of satire and it perfectly describes this sketch right? Like you're making it out to be grown men falling over little teenage girls. But that's not at all what's happening. They're all adults making light off and exaggerating the absurdity that is being a pubescent teenager. It's funny because it's not that, instead it's actually two goofballs overreacting to Lohans FINE ASS in her prime. Like damn, she was fuckin hot back then. And literally any guy or girl who knows a guy who has ever been to middle or highschool and witnessed a growth spurt can relate to this. And that's like fucking everyone ever, even you. You just don't realize it because you're a fucking crazy person, looking to strawmen to beat to justify the tinfoil you wear to keep the voices out.  ""Lmao"" this dick bitch.",7년 전(수정됨),0,

And just because he is passionate about his opinions doesn't mean they're wrong, it just makes those opinions more likely to be challenged. I respect that.",7년 전,1,

@neilisalive4892,"shethewriter I think it's more that our generation is obsessed with their voice being heard, to complain and it matter to everyone in power, and will raise absolute hell to make change in any way they can, including something as simple and irrelevant as poor humor (like this skit). Hence the whole ""triggered"" meme. People who get triggered (in the meme way, not actual trauma trigger) are being made fun of because they lash out about stupid, truly unimportant things. That's how I view it anyway. My point with the original comment in this thread is that it's pretty frustrating that companies in this current time have to tip-toe around how they write their humor so they don't upset the more ""triggered"" individuals that get mad about mostly everything. Outrage culture is alive, significant, and so destructive in this day and age. Sorry for the novella.",7년 전,10,
@shethewriter,"No need to apologize, I hear what you are saying. I largely agree with you, even as a highly sensitive person. On the whole I think there are huge benefits to the sensitivity of our generation (especially as someone from a marginalized group, I have more options and freedom now than I ever would have imagined for myself even ten years ago, especially in light of #metoo), but unfortunately there are some negative side effects, like you said.   There definitely is an outrage culture that I think is damaging to the people who engage in it. I agree with the premise of a lot of the outrage, but ideas spread so quickly these days it's almost like trauma itself has become a cultural phenomenon. I think people who really struggle with trauma actually find this pretty uncomfortable, myself included. I'd rather focus on the positive. Being able to live in the outrage is a kind of luxury, past a certain point. So you really do bring up a great point.  As a writer, it does upset me to think that anyone would feel like they couldn't express themselves. I remember a colleague pitching an idea that was really...insensitive and inappropriate on all levels, and he just got so slammed for it. I COMPLETELY disagreed with him, but I made it very clear that I thought he should pursue what he wanted, because it was a matter of his personal voice (and it really was, because it was art, it's not like he's a politician). So I came to his defense and ultimately he respected my opinion and actually ended up changing his mind. There will always be things that writers feel like we can't say...personally, I try to leverage those limitations wherever I can, because they make me more creative. The fact that a clip like this, that's just slightly dated, can be posted online and start an intriguing discussion is important. Clips like this were really destructive for me as a child, but looking back on it now really helps me not take the social changes for granted, and it makes me realize how rapid those changes have been.

If you talk about ""snowflakes not being able to handle humor"" don't go sanitizing this thing and turning it into something it clearly isn't. How many of the people in the comments do you see talking about how the dudes are jerks? The majority of the audience empathizes with this kind of behaviour, considers there's nothing wrong with treating girls and women like this and cheers on. Try as you might, that's the truth. The people speaking against it or realizing it's wrong are those ""snowflakes"". But anti-snowflakes, so to speak, realize then can sound truly enlightened and go ""Everybody sees it as satire against male bahaviour"". I think I heard this opinion a lot when people were criticizing ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". If these sort of skits or films were actual parodies of this type of behaviour, you wouldn't find a soul doing it anymore. If it were meant as satire, it wouldn't be so overdone so as to fall over the heads of most people and seem more like validation than criticism. Also, how are people even making the difference between ""meme triggered"" and ""truly triggered"" these days? The word triggered was turned into a meme by a bunch of slimy, callous jerks and now nobody can say something is upsetting because ""Lol, triggered much snowflake?""

@ooDirtyMickoo,did i say the metoo movement was fake? i dont remember saying that. i realize women were abused and raped.   the only point i was making is that the overton window has shifted significantly considering what you can joke about. the world is far more sensitive now than it used to be even 10 years ago despite conditions being relatively the same. like comedy is in a bad place. that doesnt mean women dont get raped. dont conflate those things.,7년 전,43,
@adamnonex6001,"You did not say the me-too movement was fake. Nonetheless, the tone of the comment suggested a certain resentment toward the cultural elements that led to things such as the me-too movement, which is not primarily about rape. I thought your comment was a little exaggerated; certainly “everyone” would not be crying sexual harassment, and I can't think of any recent example where people have lost jobs for making one (arguably) sexist skit (or movie), so my comment was intentionally exaggerated as well.  I think the concept of the skit is still funny in 2018; the reactions of the men (and the asexual world of the early Harry Potter films) are being parodied. Nonetheless, were it written now it's more likely a writer would want to add some element to suggest that Hermione is not clueless about why the boys/men are behaving oddly. And that would not have made it less funny. On the contrary. As with most SNL skits in recent years there is basically one joke that is repeated with variations for the entire skit. I at least would have been amused to see Hermione, who in the actual Harry Potter films is no dimwit, figure out what's going on after a couple of minutes (in real life it'd be quicker) and somehow embarrass the guys.  I disagree that comedy is in a bad place. Humor has always changed, and if you watch old comedies or comedians you'll find a bunch of humor that seems dated for all sorts of reasons. But there will always be new things to find funny, and new ways to find old things funny, and I'm finding no shortage of funny things to watch.",7년 전,9,

@adamnonex6001,"You sure like the phrase “Overton window.” I agree that some types of humor are more offensive to more people than they used to be. As an observation, that’s rather banal, like someone in 1970 pointing out how few westerns were left on TV. My feeling, based on the exaggerated way you expressed it, was that the main impetus for your post was not to express that observation but more to express a certain resentment about it.   Remember also that if the range of targets for humor has narrowed, it's broadened too. The masturbation jokes in this skit were commonplace by 2004 but pretty rare prior to the 1990s. Drug humor was common in the 1970s but virtually disappeared in the “just say no” era. Even in 2004 some of the recent comedies about misbehaving/raunchy women (the movie Bridesmaids, mostly anything with Amy Schumer) might not have been made. Yeah, it’s harder to get away with humor that seems to be from the point of view of men acting like jerks, or that relies on ethnic stereotypes. That is real, but it also may seem a lot larger than it is, as the disappearance of westerns may have seemed to those who grew up watching them.",7년 전,1,

@adamnonex6001,"There will be plenty of jokes about men acting like jerks and playing on ethnic stereotypes. But more of them will be taking the point of view of the victims of the jerks. And the ethnic humor will be done with more nuance, often by the people of that ethnicity, so it seems less like put-downs. An old example is All in the Family, which played on stereotypes, but in which Archie would typically end up being the victim of his own prejudices. A newer example is Master of None, which only intermittently featured ethnic humor, but when it did it did it in a way that put the viewer into the world of the non-white characters rather than looking on them as outsiders.  I appreciate your measured response to mine and Erica's comments. I enjoyed thinking about this SNL sketch and what I actually thought about the broader issue, hence my additional posts. This particular skit, as you say, can be taken in various ways. It may not have encouraged viewers to harass, but nor did it feature the men being challenged for their jerkiness. It’s hard to imagine a woman writing the skit this way. And I would argue that the skit could have been funnier and fresher by, rather than riffing on the same theme for five minutes, ending with the twist of Hermione revealing that she'd noticed all along what they were doing and somehow using it to her advantage.",7년 전,2,

I won't go into detail about how it actually effects me personally--I did find stuff like this pretty destructive growing up--but I think since people understand each other more (men understand more about women now and vice versa), our humor has become less about pinning jokes on cultural frameworks that don't support them (i.e. Hermione represents one of the first iconic fictional girls with a personality and mind), and more about the social contexts themselves. Of course here I am trying to explain humor, which never works lol. You are probably right, it could be sensitivity to social injustice.

@shethewriter,"It's true that people deal with trauma very differently. In fact, I find that male victims of abuse actually respond more readily to crude humor because for them, it can be a way of coping. For me as a kid, stuff like this just served as a scary reminder that I wouldn't be heard, and that the older I got, the less important my voice would be. (thankfully that is changing).  That, on top of the constant violence against women in the news and in my background alone was enough to really affect my behavior and make me a fearful child. But everyone is different.   I don't think that just because you find something funny means you're condoning it at all. That said, when male friends and family members laugh at those things, it makes girls feel like they someone have to prove themselves to be different than other women, to be worthy of enough respect that they can be an exception to violence. It's honestly kind of hard to explain. But I've been more hurt by the complicity of men close to me than from actual, physical encounters with men (although those are obviously dangerous and traumatizing as well). I try not to think about it, mostly, but I think that's what's changing. People are trying to take a more holistic view of the culture in an effort to properly stigmatize the more direct crimes.   Still, though, your moral character should not be judged by your sense of humor alone. I agree that that is unfair! Everyone is in a different place.  Change is uncomfortable.

In that context, I take the following comment to mean that though one may admire bodies, that is not their purpose. So, the answer to your question about models, etc., is that when a person chooses to place himself or herself in a context where such open “admiration” is to be expected, then it may be welcome. But when one is going about one's day, and has not invited such admiration, and may not welcome it, others would do better to admire the person in their heads rather that express it in their conduct. Admittedly, that is my interpretation of the comment, which might have been clearer, but clearly, notably in the last sentence, uninvited sexual attention is what Kid is objecting to.  But sure, euthanize folks for making dumb comments. Inside of a couple of generations global warming would be solved!",7년 전,2,

@Wairanoinoma,"James Bradby Judging maturity based on physical attribute is dangerous precisely because of people like you. If you define maturity based on boobs and ass, it only justifies people who ogle at 14 yrs old’s “mature” boobs. 😂 I for one developed early and had the figure of full grown women by the time I turned 13. There are teens who do not want to be sexualized for having a full figure body because it not only feels dangerous, but it actually is. You will never understand how a 13 yrs old girl feels when adult men ogle over her body. If teens have the freedom to be sexualized, they should also have the freedom to remain innocent. Has any man ever apologized for ogling over my body and whistling after realizing I was only 14? Nope.",7년 전,0,
@Wairanoinoma,"James Bradby lol your argument was that legal age doesn’t matter whether it be 18,19 because girls are physically mature by then. By your logic that exact age of adulthood doesn’t matter since girls physically mature early, it also follows that physically mature girls are adult enough to be sexualized. This notion is what you should be careful of. Also, you just admitted that you can’t tell person’s age just by looking at them. THAT’S PRECISELY WHY YOU SHOULD NOT GO AROUND SEXUALIZING TEENAGERS. If the teenager in question wants to sexualize themselves, that’s totally fine. But as a responsible adult, you shouldn’t be sexualizing teenagers because they might be younger than they look 😂 wait I have a feeling that you might be a teen. In that case, all is forgiven and you may freely sexualize your fellow teens.",7년 전,0,

I know the percentage of people that speak like this in the UK is very low except in certain parts of the country as we are mostly from peasant stock but the Americans see a high proportion of posher accents as it tends to be posher people that appear in the bigger movies so they assume we all speak like this.

The child actors who escape that fate are mostly from wealthy families (so their parents can afford to protect them instead of being tempted by Hollywood:  Natalie Portman and Clare Danes are in this category) or they took a long time to find mainstream success (so they got to have a normal childhood, like  Anna Kendrick and Ben Platt).",7년 전,0,

He bounded forward, pulled open the door, and set off up the spiral staircase. He was on the sixth stair when it happened. There was a loud, wailing, klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backward and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry’s feet. “Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ dormitories,” said Harry""[...]",7년 전,1,

I know it's a stupid thing to get upset about considering it's only a fucking skit, but I think it's just natural for someone who's read all the books and has seen all eight movies to notice. For example,  Harry was never that short in his fourth year (which was the school year Voldemort returned). Also, Hogwarts was a relatively safe place, so they didn't have to really worry about the school being attacked by him or his Death Eaters. And the fact that Ron is taller than Fred and George (y'know, his older brothers) really irked me a bit.",7년 전,0,

This is actually Sexual Harrassment in all of its glory and not a damn person is saying shit about it.  Because she was paid to do this.  She agreed to do this for money.  Sexual Harrassment is also judged by perspective.  What you think is sexual Harrassment I may not think is.  Also most people who claim this shit are only doing it because they don't like the person they are doing it to for what ever reason.  It is a means of retaliation.  Sexual harassment is only words.  FFS people get a damn backbone.  Sticks and Stones may break your bones but names and comments will never hurt you.  BTW ladies if a guy says your pretty and tries to ask you out to dinner or a movie.  Its not harassment, he is a male your a female its called Procreation.  Men gravitate toward women because that's what we are genetically predisposed to do.  If you take it badly that's your problem.  And being called pretty which creates a issue for you would imply that you don't think your pretty but infact the opposite.  If I call you pretty and you think that's harassment, then you think your ugly.  Or you could say I think your a dickhead and move on.  Or you could say thank you and move on.",7년 전,46,

I'm positive just about every man here has witnessed some other men do creepy shit around/to women. And I know we would've flipped the fuck out if it was our own sister or mother getting harassed. Men do it (and in my own personal observations they do it FAR more often than women). Sure, there are allegations (innocent until proven guilty does need to be exercised) and people have lied about rape, nobody is saying that's okay. It's just stupid to let this whole hollywood sex scandal extravaganza have ANY influence on your opinion of society in general. This is specific to a bunch of rich and powerful people, not us average joes. Money corrupts, we all know that, and hell, even a lack of money corrupts. It's a pretty common theme that if money is involved, people aren't going to be very decent to one another. Anyway, it's not cool to be some gold digger, and it's not cool to just assume you can whip your dick out in front of women or grab on them.

@zacheryspencer,"Lindsay looks so beautiful here! 2004 was Lindsay's best year in my opinion. Her worldly success of ""Mean Girls"" and her debut album got her so much attention and she is a really pretty girl here:) We both are the same age, I graduated high school in 2004 and I fell in love with Lindsay at this point:) She sounds so much like her character here with the English accent from The Parent Trap:)   Things really started to take a downward spiral in 2005. That's when she dyed her hair blonde and got way to skinny. I believe she was allowing herself to get sucked into the ""Hollywood Scene"" and all the partying. I think she had to cope with a lot from her family background growing up and she was strong for so many years.   Finally all this attention was coming to her, and then it all got out of hand. I really hope things are better for her now because it's so many years later. She is a really bright girl and very talented. It's sad when people get into a certain lifestyle and it’s takes so much away from their lives. The Hollywood world is definitely not a stable and good world to be in. You have to be really grounded and surround yourself with good people. And sometimes finding good people can be really hard in this world. Wishing Lindsay all the very best:)❤️",7년 전(수정됨),82,

@tamo3813,based on what you said and how you didn’t consider how powerful male instincts are I’m going to assume your female and any guy in their teens would have an intense urge do what this comment said the big problem is we restrict the age when you can “do it” as they say way too long it’s unnatural for humans to wait that long for reproductive activity that’s why certain sites make a lot of money by hooking young people onto their sites illegally and then getting them to pay for stuff as adults also if you could read minds any guy you meet you would consider a creep,7년 전,1,

@fierceresolve-vc8im,"honestly that skit in snl is just a friggin joke, you don't gotta be all pc all the time its good to fight  for men and women to treat each other better,and to stand up against misogyny when its blatant, but sometimes both genders just need to know when to be  reasonably offended  and when to just shut the heck up and recognize when its time to live a little ,relax a little and learn to take a   friggin joke. not every joke like this is some passive aggressive  mgtow way to put down women.  this skit from SNL in my opinion, is just making a funny joke about  the awkward experience that both young teenage boys ,and even some grown men have had in their lives when they've gone a long time without seeing a close platonic female friend and then to be shocked to see them again and realize that instead of being able to see them in a simple platonic light like   they would want to, they instead find themselves drooling over her because  all of a sudden the tomboy in their group now looks hotter than the pornstars and bikini models they secretly fap to in private, and how funny it is that we men don't know how to react to this situation and hope that we can adjust to these circumstances seamlessly  without our female friend feeling the need to say ""hey pervert my eyes are up here.""   its not trying to be a sexist and misogynistic slap in the face to women, if anything  its poking  fun at how easily men's  minds can drift to sex even when we  would rather it didn't. and both genders know that not  all  men are sex crazed horndogs, and that  their are many  men that do demonstrate both respect for women and self control around attractive   female friends and co workers in spite of how distracting a woman's cleavage can be if she's blessed with a bountiful busts, and i imagine situations like this are awkward for all parties so i think both gender need to take a deep breath and learn to take a joke for crying out loud..",7년 전,1,

@deepseadiver1499,Like i mean is that all you think of women? The size of their chest?,8년 전,5,
@deepseadiver1499,PheenX ya because that's absolutely ridiculous and offensive to females everywhere- including myself,8년 전,7,
@deepseadiver1499,"PheenX Ha ok first of all.  You said at the end of your reply I shouldn't waste my time replying to you and to save my time. But if I just came up and said ""fine I won't waste my time"" and left, you'd call me a coward. Maybe not online but you'd 100% think you'd won either way so that's why I'm not going to stfu. But because you completely changed the topic for most of your reply from talking about female body rights to bashing my account and subscriptions, I'm actually going to go back to the original topic before debunking all your points.   I'm offended because you told me that the only way you see women is for the size of their chest. Yes I get that's the male stereotype and you find things like that hot- but judging a person solely on the size of a body they can't influence without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on painful surgery is bloody ridiculous. You told me that it's not your fault I don't have any tits or ass. And I'm just going to point blank admit it. I don't. I'm a B cup and don't have a very thic ass- but on the contrary to your fucking opinion that doesn't make me any less of a person. What, so I should be shunned by you because even if I have a great personality you don't think I'm hot enough to jack off to every night? Because that's the point your getting across. That's just rude. Plain rude and to be frank- despicable behaviour. Sure, I can't tell you what to do. I can't stop you thinking these things. But I can try bring you up to date with the modern worlds because apparently you still live in Game of Thrones   And now to your very childish and immature jeers about my subscriptions and outside life: Yes I am subscribed to female you tubers. Yes, SOME (not all like you said) use their body for views. I'm not saying it's right but I look past it because unlike you I watch them for the content and not their body. Plenty of male you tubers use clickbait so don't act like it's just for woman getting views.  The fact that informing me I must be friends with the girls who wear crop tops and makeup is an insult in your mind makes me laugh because shockingly- the amount of makeup a girl chooses to wear does not define her and neither does outfit choice.  Why the fuck are you bringing up Logan Paul and Ian into this? Who gives a rat shit if I'm subscribed to them both? I love Ian's content cop and I like a few of Logan's vlogs. Not really sorry this offends you.  And I'm not going to dignify your twitch comments with a proper response. You brought it up for no reason just because it's the only proper example you have of female sluts online beside pornhub. I don't watch Twitch, I don't care about it. Those girls can do whatever they want but either way it doesn't make them any less of a person.  P Also fine- you don't agree with my thumbnail of a gay ship. But it's a lot nicer art then your filthy ass baby.",8년 전,6,
@PheenX,"I never changed the subject. You said it's bad to be attracted to (let me say it like your passive-agressive ass) 'large breasts'. Or basically, you made it seem like that's what you meant. I don't judge people's bodies, nor do I 'solely judge a person on the size of their chest'. I am only attracted to that. And that is my opinion. I've had 2 girlfriends who didn't have a mind boggling body, but they were very nice people. And I never said you had no breasts or ass. You said that yourself. I brought it up to prove my point, that it's not my fault that you don't have things that I like. As everyone else says, there's more fish in the sea, and there's probably a person out there that thinks you're perfect. I'm attracted to basically everything as long as they have a nice personality. But I won't date a friendly horse for example.  I brought up Twitch because you think that it's bad for guys like me to be only attracted to breasts (I'm not). It's a prime example of women knowing that they're attracted to it and using it because they have nothing else to offer. I brought up your subscriptions because you're subscribed to people who do things that you think are bad. You're trying to make me feel bad about something a lot of women do daily.  You might be different from the rest, and that's awesome. Because I hate mainstream people and love different people. My comment was a joke. You can see these ''I'm a simple man'' comments everywhere.   And finally, the beautiful being in my profile picture is called Magmuloid. Don't you dare call him filthy. He's a holy being and will save us all one day.",8년 전,1,

@PorcupineTheOneandOnly,"jasmine bats actually, it really never is the age. ""adult"" and ""maturity"" are two entirely different things. sure she is physically mature, and to be physically mature and a legal adult are about age. legal to vote, legal smoke, legal to buy things from commercials, or buy rated r movies. but if you're referring to mentally mature sometimes, depending on life circumstances, that can happen at an early age. say 10. and for some, it never happens or it can happen at forty. and everyone has a different voice you cannot distinguish someone as being an ""adult"". voices come with many different patterns and elevations, some women have higher pitched tones but are completely physically and mentally mature and an ""adult"".",8년 전,4,
@PorcupineTheOneandOnly,"jasmine bats your English is bad. bodies become mature when the body hits puberty. it's part of human growth. go to http://www.google.com/ and search: physically mature. it'll get the results. and by that age, the important parts are fully developed. such things that are necessary to procreate, for example. other things like Ear and nose growth, which happens to the elderly, aren't important. it's not absurd, unless you hadn't taken a health class yet in your high school. if you had, you would surely understand this concept.",8년 전(수정됨),0,
@PorcupineTheOneandOnly,"jasmine bats I think I may not explained well enough from the beginning. when you were speaking about Lindsey Lohan not being an adult, I was thinking you had meant ""mentally mature"". Physically Mature is entirely different from Mentally Mature. in different countries/cultures you may be considered an adult at age 16. but being that, is an age thing and has perks for whatever country you may live in. in America it's 18.   then with physical maturity, the first step is after your infancy, then puberty, and up to adulthood. During those years your stomach, bones, muscles, lungs, and such grow so you can do more.  ear and nose never stop growing while you're alive, it stops when you die which makes those ""plastic like"" parts not dire to your growth to reach adulthood. Mental maturity is what some consider as being a true ""adult"" and being responsible and such is ""adulting"".  but having a matured mentality comes with certain circumstances, like a spoiled rich good for nothing boy whose always needy, may never grow mentally. he may be childish, or a ""man baby"" if he stays that way till the age of 60 and worse when his mind deteriorates. a young girl, age 10, abandoned and neglected has to care for her baby sibling. she becomes responsible and motherly and by those circumstances she becomes mentally mature and possibly even more mature when she would hit adulthood. people react differently to different circumstances though. it's about their psychology, to say whether or not one is mentally mature. I hope this explains everything better.",8년 전(수정됨),1,

@PorcupineTheOneandOnly,"jasmine bats it's not about age when it comes to the mind, the mind is a complex thing and a child or teen could be more mature than a twenty year old. it highly depends on the events the individual had to go through for them to develop the right or the wrong form of mentality.",8년 전,1,

The treatment of women here still isn't perfect, what you're seeing is progress. There are a few more women showing up in Hollywood, and as authority figures, but many people still don't treat women and men equally or think about them equally, and many people still won't elect them for president. While other countries struggle with women's rights, it's almost impossible to get them to bow to western authority, which I personally wouldn't even want, they should come to that on their own. But the fight here needs to continue or we'll just go back to how it started. The fights not done, but we've come very far. Anyway thanks for coming to my TED talk.",8년 전,14,

And a few more points, the wage gap isn't real and the 1/4 women being raped on college campuses is also a lie. Also feminists seem fit to go to public events talking about male issues and shut them down. They even want to defund the Boy Scouts program because it's somehow sexist. Femensim is a movement against men and it shouldn't be taken seriously.",8년 전,10,
@oneiione,"It's true that Hillary got lots of votes, but that doesn't really help your case when an openly sexist man actually won the election. That really just goes to show how many people are okay with that. The movement is mostly about changing the ideas this country has about women, because there is still so much objectification of women in media and well, you've seen all the ""cool young white guys"" (alt-right) who don't respect women at all. And there's a lot of them. Maybe I can't speak for anyone else in the movement, but I don't hate men, I'm just trying to protect the future of women and gender equality.",8년 전,7,
@oneiione,"I see you saw that graph too. I'd recommend backing up your claims when you tell people you think something is a lie, otherwise it's not very convincing. I want to point out ""big cities"", because it's fairly common knowledge that big cities are some of the most progressive places in the country, and the wage gap still exists in those places, it's 11% in NYC. Also please fact-check. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, homelessness is made up of 60% men and 40%women, and while it's still a gap it's not as big a gap as you claimed. While the suicide rate statement is true, how exactly would you blame that on feminism? I've noticed that some of your points don't really point to feminism and point to some other problem, so maybe you should advocate for stronger suicide prevention tactics and other issues rather than using it for your anti-feminism message. Of course I don't like that more men are homeless or commit suicide, but that's what feminism is about, equality of genders and equal help for them. I agree that the concept of ""women and children first"" is outdated and should be revised. A man can rape a woman and get away with it so I don't see your point. According to RAINN, 23.1% of women and 5.4% of men are sexually assaulted on campuses (the statistics are undergraduates only). Essentially, we don't hate men and don't try to shut down men's issues unless there's a threat to equality there. This response might be a little all over the place but this is the youtube comments section so, sorry if I didn't give a perfect speech.",8년 전(수정됨),6,

@XxDomesticPieXx,"vivicrylic I'm too lazy to actually look at those statistics that seem to be recent. The ones I reference were from about a year or 2 ago so they might be dated. Let's say I believe everything u said. U still said that the gap in some big cities is divided between men and women. But again the wage gap has been debunked so many times that just saying men""EARN"" more doesn't say anything. And u said earlier that we have to change the idea of women rather then laws and stuff like that. U said that because was put into office then that someone means that since we think it's ok that that makes us sexist. 1 I don't think trump is sexist. He has many women on his own team and I've seen him interact with women. Just because he says he likes grabbing women by the pussy(which most men agree with) it doesn't make him sexist. Plus if more of Americans voted and supported the woman running for president(even though she is a horrible person) I don't think Americans are sexist. Again no laws or patriarchy against women.",8년 전,2,

@XxDomesticPieXx,"vivicrylic I don't like arguing because u said it perfectly when u said YouTube comments is all over the place. But my final point is that u said that femenism isn't about hating men but a lot of things femenism do contradict that. Again femenism looks great on paper but It just doesn't make sense as they seem to hate anything that can help men. They try to defund the Boy Scouts cause it's sexist against women. They protest and shut down events talking about men's issues including the suicide rate. Some coffee shops in Britain have a men tax to counter act the""wage gap"". And again men don't fucking get away with rape. Anyone even accused of being a rapist is seen as a monster for the rest of his life even if falsely accused. He can lose his job and everyone in America hate rapist. Also why aren't women who accuse men of rape then turn out to lie about it, aren't punished? And again a women can rape a man and can sue the man for multiple cases of child support and get away with it. I don't respect 3'rd wage femenism because America isn't a sexist place. It is a disgusting movement that is getting way to much praise. Also I agree with equality of sexes but I'm not gonna do anything by calling myself a feminist.",8년 전,2,

@oneiione,"Thub Thiccy I mean if you don't get it by not then I'm probably just repeating things you've heard and dismissed. Comments like ""grab 'em by the pussy"" which heavily imply sexual harassment (in context the statement is about harassing women), valuing women primarily on their physical appearance only, creepy and inappropriate comments about his own daughter... the list goes on. I figure this must mean nothing to you though.",8년 전,0,
@manicoasis4200,"that grab em' comment was from almost 20 years ago, how is this relevant beyond a meme? what evidence do you have that he values them on appearance only? and how is it inappropriate for him to make comments about his own daughter? I'm sorry but this is grasping at straws",8년 전,0,
@oneiione,"Thub Thiccy that is literal sexist language so... I'm not sure what you mean. I feel like maybe you guys don't understand what sexism is? It's treating women as being lesser than men. Objectifying women, violating their privacy and personal space, and just being disrespectful towards women specifically is why Donald Trump is sexist. But I realize that you don't understand what I'm saying and that your beliefs will never change, so if you disagree with me you don't have to respond with any snarky remarks. I get it.",8년 전,0,
@manicoasis4200,"vivicrylic objectifying? I will have to disagree between objectification and compliments. Thinking less of them?

Thats like saying ""global warming will hurt some countries worse"" and being called a racist for saying not everyone dies instantly, lol.

By saying that he disrespects women specifically, I'm not trying to imply that disrespecting someone who happens to be a woman is being sexist, I'm trying to say that disrespecting someone BECAUSE they're a woman is sexist. Sorry I didn't say it very clearly.",8년 전,0,
@oneiione,"Manic Oasis yes, i would say it's objectification. I apologize for sounding like like I'm on a moral high ground, I'm just very passionate about this issue and feel disrespected by it. I'm not sure if you're a man or not, but I think it's a lot harder to recognize the problems that affect certain groups when you are not part of it. As a female I have experienced this firsthand and when I hear sexist comments toward women it's very unsettling to me. Over a very long time Donald Trump had consistently reduced women to their looks, calling them ""nice pieces of ass"", commenting only on a female olympian's appearance, and while he has some women working for him during his presidency and such, that doesn't change the fact that most of his staff is white men. I'm not trying to attack men in this statement, I'm just pointing out that pairing that with the attitude he has held for a long time, it doesn't seem to be a coincidence. I know there are differences between men and women, but that doesn't excuse actions that marginalized one and raise up the other. But sexism is such a nuanced thing that is often subtle, and it's been part of history for so long that it's hard to see sometimes, especially for men. But just because something is ""normal"" and part of our ""heritage"" doesn't mean it's right.",8년 전,0,

Its more to do with going back to our feeling in our teenage years in high school when we first began to show signs of puberty and we found the girls we once liked and played or fight with to be attractive once the change started. Some of us may have been too shy back when we were young to ask said girls out and as adults, we revisit those feeling through cosplaying.

So If you're a feminazi nitpicking all things different about genders, just think you idiots, men don't complain about their equally hard standards. Being called a woman in most eyes means to be beautiful, appealing, not from me but all who call people that mean it in that way, being called a man means to be strong, athletic. BOTH HAVE INSANE STANDARDS TO MEET NOT JUST WOMEN, went off track. BUT UNDERSTAND THAT YOURE NOT OPPRESSED, men also have social standards different from women but equally as hard .  So can you idiots understand not just women have high standards   And what are you gonna say 'oh that's sexist' cos it's not, it's the truth , being good looking people require those high standards FOR BOTH GENDERS. I dare you to even think of a reply worth an argue.  13 years old, boom just shut up all the feminazis who do not realise we are all burdened.

@haamurabaigreygate19,"+Blackjax137 I'm with you on all those points. And have you noticed there's a lot of fast-paced sly, witty dialogue in a lot of US shows? Except that it's not actually witty, it just gives that impression because they're replying to each other quickly & confidently, but it's just blah-blah crap. I don't know if I'm explaining this correctly.. But it might help to quote Bill Hicks when he said that, intellectually speaking, America was at about an 8th grade level.  Anyway, Brit comedy is the way to go, but if you want a real American comedian you should look up the afore mentioned Bill Hicks. He's known as the comedian's comedian, though he is, or was more than that. Nothing was sacred with him & he wasn't very well known or popular in the US- offending too many people no doubt, but he was very perceptive of all that's wrong with the world & wasn't afraid to tell it like it is. He was more excepted in England when alive, which makes sense.. Similar in many ways to George Carlin. Check him out too if you haven't already.  Also search a vid called 'Red Dwarf USA Documentary' if you wanna see what the writers of Red Dwarf faced when they went to America to kick-start the US version of RD, though big surprise, it bombed due to the studio executives wanting the terribly written US script, and refusing the funny one written by the UK writers.",10년 전,2,

@ProfessorSakharov,"+Blackjax137 I have to agree that most Brit comedians tower over US ones. But some few do stand with the best of British. One or two are mentioned in other replies. One that isn't is Tim Allen. Yes, he had his hit sitcom, but his stand-up stuff that led him there was excellent.   Other parts of the world have also produced giants of comedy, though they quite often come to Britain in order to reach those heights. Seems to be the planet's launchpad/catapult for comedic talent.   Australia, by not initially appreciating his talents, gave Steve Hughes the urge to try his luck in Britain. Britain gave him some television exposure then set him loose on the world, though I'm not sure America is quite ready for him yet.   After moving to Britain from South Africa, Trevor Noah appeared on several British TV comedy shows. Now he appears to be conquering America single-handed.   .",10년 전,0,

@wilbso,"Liza Glover I'll grow some eyes as soon as you grow some brain cells.  It doesn't matter whether I call you a fangirl or fanboy, it's a small insignificant variant and even if you consider it mildly important it wouldn't matter because both terms are widely used between both genders anyway. I'm a male, but I wouldn't care in the slightest if something got mixed up with fangirl or fanboy.   Not mentioning the fact that you're attempting to base an argument off something so small and petty is completely ridiculous, and really proves you have nothing actually useful to contribute towards the argument other than something extremely minuscule that really little people bother to notice.    And if you think turning the argument around to me not contributing anything worthwhile. then don't bother. As Tristram Webb said, the point still stands, and not just that but you don't seem to realize it's a sketch for gods sake. Not a fucking book, it's 5 and a half minute sketch, sorry they forgot to include the entire backstory of each character. And the ""Whole fucking plot"" was based around a growth spurt with a little bit of Voldermort coming back, it wasn't title as a novel, wasn't titled as a movie so how about you develop some fucking sense and rewatch it then and try and understand the humor behind it you deplorable simpleton.",10년 전,2,

Oh yeah that and you are basically, Wizard Jesus and Its sorta your job to fight the magical  world's equivalent to Hitler, just because you where there when he was killed by some ancient magic that we will in no way shape or form try to replicate, but yeah we would' rather place all our trust in some kid and not the magical equivalent of scientists and doctor whom have extensive knowledge in such magics, as common knowledge of magic in our society boils down to levitation, disarming, the repelling of evil,laser beams in a verity of colors, high pressure water spouts, all destroying fires and more! Did we mention that these spells alone are thought to you in middle school and high school? You now, because teens are responsible enough to have the means to kill without leaving evidence right? We also have a library filled with dark magic that we shouldn't even have available to kids, but screw it, lets have a whole section on immortality, necromancy and forbidden magic, no you no what lets have a good portion of the library be dedicated for this stuff and make it as easy to find as possible. Our schools and governments have top notch security. By that we mean that the schools extensive defenses can be bypassed by wardrobes from Narnia and that a bunch of teens are capable of breaking in to the area 51 of the magical world, that probably should have more protection than an elevator ride from the lobby.

You completely misunderstand the situation and i would also like to remind you that..pedos are not monsters, they only cross that line when they abuse children....but i'm not afraid of them or you so call me what you want, lol. but for the sake of saying it, i will say.. i could never be a pedo because i'm into voluptuous women and hentai......which is kinda scary tbh..there's a lot of pedo hentai..but since it is fantasy i see no problem with jerking off to ''cartoons''. On the other hand.. i saw a pedo cartoon once... and hated it..then like 3 months ago i watched it again to see if i would like it more (after it popped in my head) and i actually hated it even more.. but yeah this comment is getting long so call me what you will.",11년 전,2,

I have 600gigs of porn that i could gladly show you to prove otherwise, but if you are a cop or a head doctor, i'll fucking pass on that, thank you very much. those 2 '''professionals'' are kinda bullshit...cops are just as paranoid as i am..only more aggressive and hiding behind a gun and a shield & head doctors..can make all kinds of shit up, like my depression mixed with weed = i must be a schizophrenic..

You idiots haven't even seen the show i am talking about, but yet you are so willing to paint me as a pedo or some kind of pervert, fucking plz.. i've only had sex about 8 times in my life, and i'm 28 years old.. if i was gonna rape, kids or women or animals, i would have done so already, lol. I happen to think i am not messed up in this situation but i am indeed the answer to most of life's problems. I have many solutions on dealing with the abuse, for instance a gated community for pedos to live safely away from kids is a good idea, because then they won't be frowned upon as they live with their own kind, and then you won't need preacher pedos in church doing nasty shit to kids on sundays or whenever they find the time to do that kind of stuff. I don't understand you two... i mean kids are abused everyday, i am willing to suggest solutions and speak free about who i am..what i've seen and what i like....then all of a sudden i'm the badguy? well fuck it, whatever.. mankind is fucked anyway.. we're circling the drain already, ciao.",11년 전,1,

BtW i had the idea that some kids are so bad that maybe sacrificing the would be useful to society, BUT you can't do that because many of these ''monsters'' today were sacrifices, which means your idea  is perpetuating the problem.
