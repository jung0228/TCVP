@sarahroberts2482,"First time I’ve watched you=love.  Fast fashion needs to go. As an artist and a designer who does custom pieces, it literally makes me want to stab my eyes out with my best sheers when I hear/see these people say, “I bought this but I’ve never worn it.” GRANTED…. Many custom pieces are extremely delicate, expensive and time consuming to make, however, they ARE made to be worn. If I spend 272 hours hand beading a custom rabbit fur shawl, one you specifically wanted after seeing the sketches for and then dropped the $7K on it, I expect it to worn. At least once. Maybe that’s asking too much but couture pieces are not made to hang in closets. Period. It’s an insult to the artist/designer and anyone else who put time and energy into that piece.  Then again, I live in LaLa Land where I actually WEAR and handmade 90% of my clothes. I may not be crème de la crop (just yet) but I do know the value of durable, sustainable clothing that is NOT cringe fast fashion. I believe, if you are an ‘influencer,’ you have the responsibility to the people, THE ENVIRONMENT and our future as a whole to not be indulgent in the fast fashion world.

Massive materialism is a character deficit, filling voids with things because you’re empty inside and feel inadequate.  And I was a high end NYC fashion designer in the 80’s and a runway model in the 70’s.  I thank God I grew as a person and left that all behind.   With all the pollution problems, increasing poverty and inequality, Financial insecurity, and social dysfunctions we are having in our society today, this is the worst possible direction for us to be going in.

@벨라-i6u,So is my family were more on the Louis Vuitton side then the Gucci the only people who I know has Gucci my family is my mom and my grandma owns really really really old I would say vintage because my grandma bought it when she was in her 20s so yeah I mean I love some Gucci items but you know. I prefer waiting till I grow up and learn money to buy Louboutin Gucci whatever I want because I think when you buy something with your own money that you earned your feel more happy that you didn’t waste someone else’s money so me and my sister will have to share my moms stuff one day,5년 전,0,

I remember back in high school, all the girls would flex their ugly brown monogram bags from MK and LV and little did they know my everyday jewelry cost more than their bags, and I could actually use it towards something useful afterwards.

They stick with finely tailored, impeccably  designed clothing made from the finest of fabrics. Of which they often have personally made just for them. Timeless is key. “Designer” labels are not.   What Luke said about rich people having zero taste literally had me in tears tho’ because it’s SO true! LOL   You either get the ones that stick to basic beige and navy blue or you have the other end of the spectrum days or wild about colors and prints or ruffles and bows, or those who either don’t know or don’t care how to pair items.

@YourMajesty143,"It's a cultural thing, we like glitz and glamour. My village from Palestine throw parties like they're the Oscars. You have to buy or make a gown, and it can only be worn once. We have 3 different parties just for an engagement (Qirayit Fatiha, Tulba, Khutba), then we have the Love Story which needs to be photographed & filmed, then we have the Bridal Shower and Bachelorette Party (we do both), then we have the Family Gathering & you can't diss anyone by not inviting them so you need to rent out a huge dining hall, then you have the party after visiting the Courthouse & Mosque (Haflat Kitaba), then the Goodbye Ceremony the night before the Henna & you can't diss anyone so you need to rent a cabin, then you have the huge Henna Party where everyone needs to come in traditional thobe dresses decked out in gems & Swarovski crystals, wear their 100 gold coin headdress, and all the gold they own around their necks, fingers, and arms. At last, you then have the White Wedding. I'm no longer part of that extravagant and overindulgent culture (I'm Atheist now), but it was very glamorous and there was always 2 to 3 parties a week every year. During my 1st engagement, I had anxiety over throwing so many parties. It's overwhelming. If you want to make money, buy a party center or dining hall near an Arab population -- you'll be booked for the rest of your life! Arabs love to celebrate everything! Have a baby? Graduate college? Family reunion? Is it a holiday? Just want to throw a fair or carnival for the hell of it?

@grimsoul9779,"What annoys me about her video is that everything she has in a closet a stripper or prostitute has but the stripper or prostitute gets a bad rap. Like I can't stand when so-called designers take Street fashion throw on some shiny crystals some plastic or some other garbage texture are Fabric and then all of a sudden everybody is like it's fashion. All of her Shades were crap. They were literally the same thing just sparkly are you throwing on a gold chain. Then she had the nerve to say that one of her Shades the crystals fell out and I refuse to spend hundreds of dollars on anything and a piece of it falls out. Fashion is garbage now. There are some good fashion designers out there. But fashion now is just straight garbage. Literally everything she picked up I was like if you weren't who you were they would be calling you a stripper or a prostitute. Simply because of your choice in clothing. And I don't think that that's fair. I don't think that Designer should take something that already exist or that somebody else created and stole they label on it and all of a sudden it's relevant. This is why I can't get behind the fashion industry there is little to zero actual creativity, much like Hollywood.",5년 전,0,

@lucyosborne9239,"I love looking at this stuff! I think if you saw my wardrobe you would die on the spot because it's so practical. It's different than most peeps because of my body shape, which lead me years ago to making certain parts of what I wear. If it goes on over the waist, you can bet I made it, custom for myself. This includes my sweaters and coats knittingart.net if you're interested. It also includes shirts as I have worked out a system for dressing. Easy, moderately colorful and practical. Corduroy pants, straight legs in an array of solids. Depending on the season, I wear 3/4 sleeve length t-shirts, solid colors in a completely different size range than the pants. Are we painting a pic yet? After that, it's up to me. My fabric comes from either Liberty of London or from Balinese artisans who make batik pint cotton fabrics. Did I mention being a natural fiber snob? My wool for knitting comes from all over the globe but I purchase them either from the wholesaler because of my business, Knitting Art, or from the internet, believe it or not, Ebay sells yarn from outlets in Germany that are all up to date colors and fibers at wholesale prices. This still makes one sweater sell for minimum of $350, charging $1/hour for labor. The buying public just doesn't want to pay real prices for real labor. I do it because I love it and because I personally need clothing. As for shoes, I was a ballerina many years ago and then a Registered Nurse, and contracted arthritis when I was 18 years old. Birkenstocks to the rescue! my feet are too deformed (I told you my body has weird problems) to wear closed toe shoes which is just fine with me. It's so easy to pull a look together. Do I feel pink today? How about Drama Queen? I also have some vintage things I bought 30 years ago that will remain classics: silk blouse with puff sleeves and button down in ecru. Basic. Chenille skirt in olive green with fringe at the bottom. Business outfit. Put a silk jacket that has been heavily worked with embroidery and patches of velvet in a deep teal with the blouse and skirt and there you have it. Flowers in the hair, eelskin bag and done. Simple. Formal wear, totally different story. I do my own because of the fitting problems. I do a lot of beads and hand made lace on silk and velvet in conservative colors, dark raspberry, navy, slate gray silk chiffon pants topped with a tulle jacket decorated with satin ribbon in teal and brown with a pale shade blouse and a nice strand of pearls matching earrings and it's time to go to a wedding. I just ordered some fabulous silk from a wholesaler I know for $40, 3 yards for a skirt. I made a silk top that feels lonely. It's in dupioni with amber/rose tints, solid color and the new fabric will compliment, over a full petticoat. It's practical, not expensive and I feel great wearing it. Enough said.",5년 전,0,

These that I see in the video are most likely fake because they are flimsy and a chain doesn’t seem to stay horizontally in place, but she might have bought it unknowingly and paid some hefty $1,5-2k.

@JaesadaSrisuk,René Caovilla is actually kind of an interesting luxury footwear design house. They’ve been around for 80+ years and are still family-owned. They’re in between Salvatore Ferragamo and Christian Louboutin in terms of aesthetic and market segment. Their shoes are dressier and way flashier than the classic casual luxe craftsmanship of Ferragamo and more ladylike than the sexy fetish-inspired Louboutin.,5년 전,2,

@yleilaf.a7967,"​ Dark Glow  Cause of quarantine, I have nothing else to do then write long-ass comments -_-. Read it as you wish. Anyway, Huda will keep on thriving no matter how bitchy you are.  First of all, Tell me how she is homophobic? Oh yeah, because her brand didn't allow a man to be featured on their page. First of all, her brand is based in Dubai, UAE. Homosexuality is unfortunately and unnervingly illegal in the UAE (google it). People believe makeup on men makes the man a homosexual, therefore her brand would get in trouble by the law. She must have found a solution or something by now because she currently posts boys/men makeup pics to her 42 million followers. She even shuts down the homophobic comments in her comment section. You can check for yourself  Another controversy: the alleged stealing of a concept from an indie brand. I'm sorry but when I think of baking, I think of literal baking. It's not rocket science to link the two ideas together. The indie brand sent the PR package, but there isn't literal proof that Huda and her creative team looked at it since her billion-dollar makeup brand must have many workers. The PR sector of the company or whatever might have not looked into the indie makeup PR since she doesn't promote other makeup brands. OR, one of her workers saw the PR package, pitch the baking idea to Huda without mentioning the brand who first thought about the concept.   Then there's another one about lightening the vagina and I agree it is a dangerous thing to do. But at that time it was trendy in Europe and in the Middle East. Many clinics in those regions were doing the procedure. She was posting something that was trending without knowing the harmful side effects, which I condemn but it seems like she doesn't do that anymore. Actions speak louder than words.  Ok... now... tell me what other scandals made her a moron and unworthy of her money? I'm curious since you must know her personally. I mean... I only make those accusations towards people I know on a personal level, unless they are criminal or do criminal acts, cause I am not a pathetic low life scumbag who talks shit about a fucking stranger on the internet.",5년 전,47,
@yleilaf.a7967,"​ Dark Glow  I don't know how not liking JS sense of style makes that person a homophobic... something is truly wrong with you... I mean he usually does have no sense fashion.

@NoOne-ib1xs,"YLeilaF.A Lmao, this pretty late, I was gonna like your comment with your first argument, but the latter two kinda just went as defense against her because of one simple thing: Research  While being Indie, at the time of the scandal, not only has it had it’s reputation amongst the beauty sphere with Videos made by Influencers and decently known on IG (her main platform) but the concept of a “flour powder” could’ve easily been seen with their research department which indicates either lack of care towards their research or respect towards smaller brands   Tbf, we now know that both brands are sh*t, so I guess that settles that.  For the Vagina Bleaching, I’m pretty sure even Google would’ve shown some articles from the results. I’m aware they change per country, but as a Big Influencer she at least would a TEAM to search up what she would promote and would’ve encountered some articles if not whole papers on the danger it poses so yet again falls into either Laziness or Lack of Ethics during the promotion even it was she herself in the stand because she has the social responsibility as someone with a platform.",5년 전,4,
