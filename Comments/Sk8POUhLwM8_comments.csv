@g26s239,"So Asian Boss really dropped the ball on this by not putting sufficient qualifiers on this guy's claims. If someone in a bar claims to be a Marine Scout Sniper, Australian SAS etc with no verification there will be skeptics. Likewise with claims of having won a Victoria Cross. Unlike claims of being the last ninja it is possible to prove Scout Sniper or SAS status or having won a Victoria Cross. Who besides this guy verified these claims? Is there a Ninja Registry in Japan? Has there been any verifiable ninja activity in Japan in the last 70 years?  I generally like your content but people who make claims such as these shouuld be held to some reasonable standard of proof.  Being 69 or 70 years old does not keep people from making grandiose claims, look up Gianni Russo's claims for reference.",2년 전,0,

But in this age of mass communication and rapid change, essentially home-schooling an army would be grossly impractical.

I bought that game only because everywhere I read people were saying that it is a true successor to the tenchu series which is false. I found myself fighting for my life in that game more than I care to admit. My first and best approach to an enemy territory is 🥷 stealth. Even in action games I just can’t let go this kind of play style. But in sekiro the number of stealth kills are limited to only 2 ways 1 air kills 2 behind the enemy’s back that’s about it. They don’t even have chain kills in that game and the rest is just samurai fighting in dark souls style which obviously same devs and yes also including the same devs of the tenchu series but that does’nt make it any less better in terms of a default setting for a strictly stealth approach to things from likes of tenchu, aragami 2 which is promising.

@tjpaul72,"My is Tim Anderson. Mentioned Mr. Yamashita's Ninpo Book a Style:  Nanban-Ryu Ninjutsu. Nanban Satto-Ryu is a Ninjutsu Fighting Style passed down from Hasshimotto Ipussai to Fujita Seiko. Fujita Seiko passed the Satsu-Ryu Ninja Scrolls down to Kenwa Mabuni and Imanzo Iwatta. The Satsu-Ryu is based of the 5 Elements of NInja Fighting from the Gorinto. Shitō-ryū is a combination style, which attempts to unite the diverse roots of karate. On one hand, Shitō-ryū has the physical strength and long powerful stances of Shuri-te derived styles, such as Shorin-ryū and Shotokan (松涛館); on the other hand, Shitō-ryū also has the circular and eight-directional movements, breathing power, and hard and soft characteristics of Naha-te styles such as Uechi-ryū and Gōjū-ryū (剛柔流). Shitō-ryū is extremely fast, but still can be artistic and powerful. In addition, Shitō-ryū formalizes and emphasizes the five rules of defense, developed by Kenwa Mabuni, and known as Uke no go gensoku (受けの五原則), Uke no go genri (受けの五原理), or Uke no go ho (受けの五法):[8]  落花 (rakka, ""falling petals""). The art of blocking with such force and precision as to completely destroy the opponent's attacking motion. Examples of rakka are the most well-known blocks, such as gedan-barai (下段払い) or soto-uke (外受け). 流水 (ryūsui, ""running water""). The art of flowing around the attacker's motion, and through it, soft blocking. Examples are nagashi-uke (流し受け) and osae-uke (押さえ受け). 屈伸 (kusshin, ""elasticity""). This is the art of bouncing back, storing energy while recoiling from the opponent's attack, changing or lowering stance only to immediately unwind and counterattack. Classic examples are stance transitions zenkutsu (前屈立ち) to kōkutsu (後屈立ち) and moto-dachi (基立ち) to nekoashi-dachi (猫足立ち). 転位 (ten'i, ""transposition""). Ten'i is the utilization of all eight directions of movement, most importantly stepping away from the line of attack. 反撃 (hangeki, ""counterattack""). A hangeki defense is an attack which at the same time deflects the opponent's attack before it can reach the defender. Examples of this are various kinds of tsuki-uke (突き受け), including yama-tsuki (山突き). When, practing this Nanban Satto-Ryu the Five Element Ninja Fighting Stlye you practice Fighting in with Silent foot steps on Rice Paper. The 5 Elelments are practiced on your 5 Toes. This is a very small section of Shito-Ryu that has a Ninja Fighting System based off of the Five Elements and there are Scrolls owned by, Genzo Iwatta and all of the Scrolls passed from Fujita Seiko to the Shito Masters are known as the Koka Flow. I have an Ancient Document that talks about how the Gorinto Five Elements were used in the NInja way for as well as Women to Seduce Men by wearing Five Element of Make up and the Seasons. As well in Fujita Seikos Tora No Maki it makes the Requriment of the Godai No Heiho use of the 5 Elements can be used in Fighting and in Stealth. I also, previously own if not the last Copy of the Book Nanban Satto-Ryu Jujtsu by, Ippusai Hashimoto. The Book Mentions he was a Spy and an Assassin and was a Soldier during the Boshin War and was captured during the War and sent to Prison wear he exscaped and became a hired Assassin and Killed an attacker with a Shuto a Sword Hand. I have a rare Magazine Article that was Published in 2013 where the Ninja Scrolls known as the Koka Flow were passed down to the present day to Genzo Iwatta and there are photos of them and Fujita Seiko. I started Shito-Ryu in 1984. I have studied Ninjutsu extensively and focus my training arounf the 5 Elements of Ninjutsu and I also, train in the Toyama Batto-Jutsu that was that with Nanban Killing Southern Barbarian Style was taught to the Nakano Shadow Warriors. In 1936 Mr. Fujita founded the Kobudo Research Society. Okinawan Kobudo in Okinawa did not practice the skill of using twho farm toools as weapons only one. Such as one Jitte or One Sai not Two. Mr, Seiko changed that according to Koga-Ryu Weapons and tools were used by Two Hands. So, the Manji Sai was also, from the Manji Symbol of a Koga Samurai Caln known as the Manji Clan. Mr. Seiko gave a Menkyo Kaiden to Motokatsu Inoue. There were no 2 Handed Weapons Kata in Okinawa so, with the Koga influence of using two weapons instead of one were implementented by Inoue,Sensei and he learned of Shotokan from Gichin Funakoshi and added Two Handed Weapons Kata from Shotokan-Ryu. I have a Rare Book from Japan called Koga-Ryu Combat Ninjutsu. In the Book it speaks of that there were Ninja Clans that did indeed have a their own Ninja Fighting Styles. It goes on to say because, of the influx of Guns coming in from Spain this would hurt many Ninja Clan Families that had their own Ninja Fighting Hand to Hand Combat Systems. Infact, it mentions the names of a few of those Ninja Clans who practiced Red Hands in the Ancient Shrine Temples of Japan Secretly.",3년 전,1,

@jn846,"Wow, thank you so much for this video. It helped to enlighten us to the reality much more than the false impressions we have all had for decades about Ninjas. It was great to see him, he's like a regular person in many ways. Very practical in how to develop and use the skills, as he showed you can use many of the same techniques for Ninja activities or for farming, and some of the same tools! Very pragmatic. Although there was a bit of conflict from what he said about Ninjas main goal is to survive, however they were still called upon in war as spies for espionage or even as assassins. But I think the point is they preferred to not have to use their Ninja skills for killing if it was not necessary.  It's always great to shatter misconceptions we have from Hollywood or other sources and get to know the real story behind this famous Japanese discipline.   I liked that he was doing exercises that had a Buddhist meaning. That shows he is a Spiritual Warrior which is above all other practices. I hope that he can pass down the tradition, it would be a shame if it died out altogether. Just like the Shaolin or other traditional martial arts practices.",3년 전,25,

It is known today as the ""Iga"" and ""Kouga"" ninja. However, even in the ""disappeared"" group, there was a family who personally taught the technique. So there are many different ninjutsu left in various parts of Japan.

@akiramenai4973," @spacewargamer4181  I think probably what he's saying is that shuriken wouldn't have been a common weapon, and that's pretty obvious. If you're in town to find out about an enemy or just gather info, you're sure as heck not going to be carrying things that would contradict your cover. And, if you're supposed to sneak into a castle and kill someone, you wouldn't want to have a stack of them clanking around in a pouch. If you had more than one, you'd have to have them separated by cloth, which means you can't pull out the stack and start throwing while you're on the run.

@5aiv.,"there were never any such things as a ""ninja group"", shinobi were merely roles within samurai ranks like a medic is in a modern military squad. they weren't their own entity whatsoever and were more alike a sub division of the samurai and were used for spying and espionage or just simply scouting. and as for the periods there were barely any shinobi still operating within the samurai ranks during the 16th century aka during the Edo Period of japan as the Edo Period was relatively peaceful and so there were no armies waging war.",2년 전,1,

With the exception of some Sikhs & Northeast do u wonder how, there's no trace of all these in ind? Lot of contemporary ind attribute that to colonialism, & the Islamic conquests. But these disappeared even before the Vijayanagara era. Suddenly the Buddhists & jains who once were 3/4 of Indian masses...became an absolute tiny minority.  Brahminism kiiled Buddhism & again installed its shitty products, wherein the commoners & natives were put into shitty castes & their various cultural aspects like warfare were shunned & banned. As a result, u can see, even to this day, so many of our tribal folkdances are nothing but codified martial arts.  What hurts me the most is the Brahminism's sheer concentration of power that produced a mercantile economic society (landlords & priesthood) & so Ind today is a 3rd world country while China, Japan, South Korea, & other South East Asian nations borrowed & nurtured our cultures a long time ago....the results r in front of u.  Japan too had a long history of powerful daimos & such landlords and reverb since practices of untouchability....but Buddhism & its by product sanity (modern education & tech) triumphed in the end.",4년 전,0,

@tombstoneharrystudios584," @namelessking111  exactly!  I'm all for historical preservation but at some point you have to be realistic and say that certain aspects of the art are impractical, ineffective or just not appropriate  According to various sources (Hayes, Adams) Ninja were trained from birth in the arts. However, despite their relative isolation, they would have still been able to bend into a society when there was plenty of travelling monks, entertainers, rural workers and so on.  But in this age of mass communication and rapid change, essentially home-schooling an army would be grossly impractical.  I mean, you'd have to have pretty sophisticated ID faking and computer skills in order to conjure up an identity that would fool the authorities.

He mentions running normally tires people out, which is pretty in line with how forward leaning running is usually more energy efficient when running faster.

@anniedarkheart5224," @ari8184  To rephrase your question with context, ""Why don't distance runners run like they are holding a sword steady?""  Well, because they aren't holding a sword steady.  Runners do lean forward to create forward momentum.  Distance running form isn't standing perfectly stable and do not do ""standing leg extensions"" for miles and miles to primarily propel themselves forward.  Proper distance running form involves having good posture, if you bend at the hips then you dragging back your own natural momentum.  You lean a little near the ankles to keep good posture and not destroy your natural momentum.  Check out other videos with distance running form.",2년 전(수정됨),10,

They're wearing all black, or black, and blue, but this never looked out of place anywhere.  Honestly, throughout time, you see someone wearing all black, and maybe think ""That must be hot"" unless it's a dark alley.  That uniform is basically traditional sweats.  The Ninja Mask serves 2 purposes:  Concealing the face of Extras, and Stuntmen so the choreographer can make 20 guys look like 200 ,and ""Hey look, a Ninja!"" so the kids that came to see ninjas, or Daredevil beat up ninjas can see Ninjas.

Using circle knives that are sharp on the inside and outside seems ridiculous and dangerous.,4년 전(수정됨),12,

@macthompson9750,"Actually the orange jumper I dont hate any more. I slept on Naruto all this time and only recently watched it. They never outright say it, but think about it like being seen when you want can be just as important as NOT being seen. With the clone jutsu he uses it's pretty clever I think. Plus  If you can conceal yourself while wearing a bright color your probably pretty good at it.      ALso notice ninjas wear blue not black. That's because it's actually harder to see dark blue at night. Black clothes are TOO dark.   But In a modern setting that's not really true either.with modern lighting and building materials blue or black might NOT be your best option at night. Orange In theory could be  just as good depending on setting.         All that aside, before Naruto, it still seems like you had the wrong idea of what a ninja was. Basically a ninja was just a person who attempted to travel amongst times of conflict to gather Intel. Many fueds and wars in Japan's past and, in general, traveling used to be pretty dangerous even in peaceful times. Like the whole reason for driving on the left vs Right side of the road goes back to sword carrying days. You pass people on the left, because most people draw their sword with their right hand. Traveling at night used to be a no no. Tbh it still kind of is. If you were out at night your probably up to no good. So to move at night you need to make sure people don't see you.       So in reality, the best Shinobi from naruto In the traditional sense is probably Jiraiya. Wandering around gathering Intel at brothels, bars, and bathhouses. He only fights when absolutely necessary, to the point he will let people rob him. Jiraiya was the master at playing the fool.       Point is being a ninja isn't just about skulking in the shadows. I think I read it was pretty common for ninja to dress as monks and  merchant anD stuff. That would be a way to potentially cross war torn lands and borders. a ninja is basically just a spy.

Sure you can use the “proper” method but what really is language apart from a means of communication? If two people can convey the same meaning (and emotions) a verbose and jargon imbued paragraph can via grunts then the grunts are more efficient.   Sure you can appreciate the beauty of proper language (prose and poetry) but do not impose your ways on others who have committed no wrong against you.,4년 전,25,

The whole point is do something and it not to be known. not leave a not, they want you to not even know the item is missing, hopefully ever. if you are to be dead. just dead. dead before you hit the floor, no response no reaction, no evidence left that anything happened. just like the person never existed, is the most desired outcome. their reasons and motivation to do anything are 100% theirs, and their intent is to make you think whatever that is, it is not. that is a Ninja.

@euniqemurphy3803,There is a trick with breathing too  Like when you get exhausted from doing something you start to breath heavily...well if your not trying to be heard by someone just breathe in through your nose and open your mouth and just let the oxygen flow ....just open and not do anything...and just let the air do its own thing and you do nothing....just don't breathe so heavily and you won't be heard that's the trick......,4년 전,0,

@UToobUsername01," @block4562  the last ninja is probably a meme among the ninja today who are all probably cyborg killing machines like Motoko Kusunagi in Ghost in the Shell comic. Given how high tech japan is, it is not out of reality to believe they have thier own equivalent to DARPA in the US and modern elite soldiers have more high tech stealth tools. Eg instead of the World war 2 era smoke bomb to hide, they'd have optic camouflage tech to make them invisible, and noise-canceling gadgets to supress soundwaves etc To me a modern ninja is a black ops soldier with all the stealth tech modern science can equip a spy/assassin with. For instance Instead of a grappling hook to climb to the roof of a building, think of nanotech gloves that let you stick to walls like in the call of duty black ops games rather than ninjas from old 1970's martial arts flicks who used old school tools of traditional ninja in history. Don't think of a ninja as the martial arts kind but more like the spec ops soldiers with suppressed pistol, disguises, fake ID and hacking skills to obtain intel from computer networks. Maybe they even have a backpack with a spy drone to recon the area to see which areas have the least security and encrypted communication devices to send images they view through google glasses directly back to HQ to make decisions in real time and some c4 explosives to distract the local security to make thier escape easier as they head back to base undetected while attention is diverted towards theloud explosion. In a nutshell the MODERN ""ninja"" is the same as spec ops guy on a black op mission using better tech than regular issue equipment.",4년 전(수정됨),4,

I know this because I was a practitioner Ninjutsu, is more a path of enlightenment and its true. Don't let the Hollywood gas you with Illusions as the ninja most people believe.

@matthiaselsner7961,"The elements of the body  There are two main energies: spiritual energy and material energy. Spiritual energy is conscious and material energy is unconscious. The soul is conscious spiritual energy and the body is made up of unconscious material energy. Without food, there would only be the self, the soul aka antimatter with a size of 0.1 nanometer with its shells.  According to the Sankhya philosophy, a person's body is composed of the following 24 elements:  (1-5) 5 mahābhūtas (""great elements"" - earth, water, fire, air, ether / space), (6) manas (mind, inclinations, spirit), (7) buddhi (intelligence), (8) ahaṅkāra (ego  as a result of identification with the body and what goes with it), (9-13) 5 senses acquiring knowledge (indriya - sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch), (14-18) 5 working senses (karmendriya - legs, arms, anus, genital and speech organ), (19-23) 5 sensory objects (indriyārtha - shape / color, sound, taste, smell and touch), (24) avyakta (the unmanifest)  The five great elements, the ten senses and the five sense objects make up the gross body and manas, buddhi, and ahaṅkāra make up the subtle body. Avyakta is the basis of both. In this connection of 24 elements sits the individual soul (jivātma) as an inhabitant of the body, accompanied by the paramātma, the oversoul.  .With soul and oversoul, the human being consists of 26 elements. Jivātma and paramātma are both referred to as kṣetra-jña (""knower of the field""). The body is kṣetra, the field of activity, and the soul is the knower of the field. But while the Oversoul knows all fields of all living beings, the individual soul does not even properly know its respective body. Through unthinkable long contact with the material energy, the spiritual souls have forgotten their original knowledge and identify with the body in which they are currently living. With the body they try to enjoy by manipulating material nature and exploiting the riches of material nature.  These 24 elements are manifestations, transformations of the material energy and exist in and outside the body as constituents of the universe. Their development, properties and interactions are described in various Vedic scriptures and also in the Ayurveda classic Caraka-Samhita. Just as a potter makes a jug out of clay and water, the spiritual soul, under the influence of the three modes of appearance, sattva (goodness) , rajas (passion), tamas (ignorance), unconsciously creates its respective body from the 24 material elements through its inclinations. In contrast to the potter, who knows how to make a certain object, most souls do not know how they made their bodies. They carry out certain actions with one body, cherish certain likes and dislikes, etc. and receive their next body from the Oversoul according to their karma  The three doṣas (bioenergies and bioelements), the seven dhātus (types of body tissue), the upadhātus (subsidiary body tissue) and the malas (waste products) contain the mahābhūtas in different proportions. The seven dhātus are:  rasa (lymph; plasma) rakta (blood) maṃsa (muscle tissue) medas (fat tissue) asthi (bone tissue) majja (bone marrow and nerve tissue) śukra (sperm and egg cells)  The upadhātus are tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, muscle fat, breast milk, menstrual blood and the six layers of skin.  The body's breakdown products are feces, urine and sweat. Hair, fingernails and toenails, ear wax, and other secretions are also considered malas. The malas feces, urine and sweat, ear wax and other secretions need to be eliminated regularly. If they are not properly eliminated, disease will arise.  ( From the signs and symptoms caused by the increase or decrease in doṣas, dhātus and malas, the doctor can determine which mahābhūtas are required to restore their equilibrium. Then he can prescribe certain foods and drugs (with corresponding mahābhūtas) to compensate for the deficits or excess of mahābhūtas in doṣas etc.)  Whether there are other energies and what these are all about can be found in the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures.",5년 전,0,

@YongShengOng,"In Japanese, it is possible to have different words with the same pronunciation and therefore same Rōmaji spelling. But in reference to the Kanji, his comment is suspicious. The word 忍 which can be read as 'nin' or 'shinobi' typically means 'to endure', or 'tolerance'. Perhaps there are other underlying meanings to the word representing a very obscure art, but it generally does not mean brutality. Separately, Nintendo is 任天堂, where 任 and 忍 shares a similar pronunciation. The direct translation of 任天堂 is ""leave it to heaven""- where任 means to leave it to, or to entrust; and, 天堂 is just heaven in general. Of course the actual, story behind the name Nintendo is anyone's guess.",5년 전,11,

It's about peacekeeping, harmony, inner and outer health of the body, the mind, and developing character, willpower, etc.  It's not about trying beat people up in the UFC and win a championship belt and become world famous.  This is fake martial arts.  Yes, those people know how to fight in a combat cage but they are fake martial artists because they cannot even self-discipline themselves in their own lives and win in life.  They all get in trouble with the law, drug problems, domestic abuse, financial ruin, depression, emotional instability, etc..... that's how you expose fake martial artists, not by beating up a kung fu master with boxing and then say kung fu is fake.  You guys are so damn dumb if you believe that.  Martial arts was beautiful ....an art but when the dumb white man learned it from the east, he of course had to turn it into a stupid entertainment business and people actually think that's real martial arts.    Win the cage, but they lose outside of it.   Real martial artists lose inside the cage, but win in life.  That's the secret to martial arts bitches.",5년 전,1,

Wrestling,  mma, and a little boxing🥊, Muyi Tai, Hung Gar & wing Chung kung fu,  Wa Do Ki Kai (cross between TKD, Shotokan, Goju Ryu).  Often some  of the easiest techniques can be the most deadly. Throat strikes,  collapsing the eardrum,  cutting off the bloodflow and or airway of the brain, breaking the neck and spine,  not to mention weapons such as a simple pocket knife. Don't forget hammers, screwdrivers, etc.  A pen or credit card can do in a pinch as well.  Brag a broom handle,  break it over you knee, and use the sharp end too stab your opponent (improvised weapons 😈).   Even a rock (The oldest weapon in History).

The meaning of the word ""ninja"" is literally ""a person who practices espionage"". Ninjas were spies, not assassins nor fighters. Ninja weapons like shurikens are entirely fictional.  Ninjutsu (literally meaning ninja skills) was not a martial art. Their scrolls were all about espionage: teaching techniques of infiltration, propaganda and blending in crowds using everyday clothes.  PS.

@marinomele4575," @ayamgepreksambelpetir5942  BEWARE THE VIDEO IS SPREADING MISINFORMATIONS The guy in the video is talking about a myth like if it is real, states he is perpetrating an old tradition and explaining ""stealth skills"" ninja used and stuff: this is bogus. Total fiction. Propaganda.  I'm glad you're interested in ninjas because this means you could be interested in knowing more about the actual historical profession, I strongly suggest you videos from Metatron, Shadiversity and Anthony Cummins (this last one is pretty technical and difficult to follow tho...)  Long story short: Ninjas progressively ceased to exist before 1800, since they became obsolete for that time period. But in the early 1900s, movies were made and this lost 'profession' became popular once again, but it was changed since very little was still known. Alongside this, people started to show up... Stating they were descendants of ninja warriors, that they were the keepers of an old tradition. They started to teach those secrets alongside with Ninjutsu (the martial art). They became pretty popular and even a huge business for movies and tourists. Until... a study in the early 2000s exposed all of them :\  Their supposed legacy was disproved and, adding the final nail in the coffin, in 2015 some ORIGINAL ninja scrolls were translated (how cool is that) by a team lead by Anthony Cummins: For the first time - after centuries - we could read the secret techniques of ninjutsu, written down by the hand of a medieval ninja sensei. But... It was disappointing. It was found out that ninjutsu (lit. Ninja techniques) had never been a martial art, ninjas were not trained since a kid and so on... It was completely different from what we knew. And, more shockingly,  everything in the original scrolls contradicted what these false sensei were telling everyone :\  Of course a lot of the current senseis, like the one in the video, might be unaware of the lies... I mean someone told those to him, right? So it's possible that he truly believes in everything he sais. But the girl in the video still doesn't say anything, nor there is a warning text of some sort... Maybe ""Asian Boss"" is unaware of this too? But this is an issue! This vid has 9mil views! How many people now believe everything they heard from the vid now? :\  Btw, It's a really interesting topic. I hope you'll decide to look up to those sources I've suggested to you ^^   PS. Ninja is also an incorrect chinese pronunciation, in medieval times the japanese kanji of ninja was actually read ""Shinobi"".",5년 전,77,
@ayamgepreksambelpetir5942, @marinomele4575  thank you so much.... so did he know about all of this. I mean all of information in it were lie or he just pretended to do...i probably should watch other video about this issue,5년 전(수정됨),1,
@marinomele4575," @ayamgepreksambelpetir5942  Glad I did! Hmm... who knows... Well it is very plausible that he didn't know himself, so he's not lying... Although it is somewhat possible that he did actually know, since he seems to be aware of some facts. But keep in mind that this seems to be a VERY touchy topic in Japan.. So even if he is aware of everything he might have chosen not to give credit to the discovery in order to preserve their oral tradition (I mean, if you think it is a very human thing to do).  I suggest you to start with Shadiversity video about the topic, I think it's easier to understand since the other two are more technical (or at least it's been so to me). But Metatron and Anthony are far more knowledgeable, as Shadiversity sais himself, so I suggest you to look at their channels too afterwards ^^",5년 전,14,

@whatsthatsmell2936,"Ninjas have been dead since the end of their use during the feudal era of japan. Ninjitsu was never an established martial art of any kind, ninjas would be trained in whatever martial art was traditional to their province. They rarely had to use any hand to hand skills due to the fact that they where spies/assasins. If they weren't gathering informathion they were killing people in there sleep with a kunai dagger. The modern day idea of a ninja that japan likes to promote is a complete sham.  When this man dies maybe the lies will die with him.",5년 전,6,
@marinomele4575," @whatsthatsmell2936  The lies is too radicated in pop colture to die with him. I mean, look at how people imagine dinosaurs to be just because of jurassic park... I appreciate you have knowledge on the topic but let me address just one issue: kunais were just tools, not knifes to stab ;) Also they weren't really assassins, they did so far too rarely for that to be considered a distinctive ninja skill.  The rest you said is accurate and I'm glad you did so ;)",5년 전,4,
@whatsthatsmell2936," @marinomele4575  no household in the feudal era would of gone without a sword, dagger, shield, bow etc. So yes they were weapons first and foremost, as was there original purpose. Anyone during the feudal era that took up arms against an enemy province could call themselves a ninja if they wanted. A woman once jumped from a tree, pinning  a ninja from a different province to the ground untill the men came. She was declared a ninja! Ninja was a very loose very broadly used term during the feudal era and that is the point im trying to convey. For reference, ninjas that were close to and trusted by their shogun would often be sent on solitary assasination missions. This is documented extensively. But as i said before 'the history books are written by the victors'",5년 전(수정됨),7,
@marinomele4575," @whatsthatsmell2936  Once again, as already said, you're right. I just wanted to say that kunais were not meant for stabbing. Could someone have been stabbed by one back then? Probably. But, as you say, people carried knifes and swords with them - it was unlikely for them to improvise a weapon from a tool. Not impossible, once again, but unlikely. So that's why I wanted to point out that associating ninja with kunais is not good. They coul've used those to kill as much as they could've used a rock.  And you're very right about the looseness of the term. They've existed for 300 years and changed accordingly to the time period. This being said... people used the term loosely, but this doesn't mean we modern literate have to do as well. And I say this because in ninja scrolld there was so little about assassination that it is safe to assume it was such a minuscle part of their job, as a matter ninja were used very rarely for killing. It was far more valuable to gain intel instead. So yes, the term ninja is a loose one even in medieval japan but this  doesn't mean we have to follow that trend as well - since we have more information than them.",5년 전,3,
@whatsthatsmell2936," @marinomele4575  i suppose were both right, most ninja weaponry was developed from available agricultural tools of the time. And rightly so, ninjas implemented them as tools for things like forcing holes into walls to hear what was being said on the other side. But they were also part of a ninjas primary arsenal of weapons.  Also true is it that a live ninja is more useful than a dead one. But i clearly remember in the seconn year of my bachelors when we covered eastern history, that shoguns would send droves of ninjas disguised as farmers, (not hard when there was no ninja uniform). To infiltrate, gather information and kill high up operatives of the opposition province. But again yeah were both right!!",5년 전(수정됨),9,

@marinomele4575," @fireflymiesumae  Oh, no. They were real of course!  The problem is guy in the video is talking about the ""myth part"" like if it is real, states he is perpetrating an old tradition and explaining ""stealth skills"" ninja used and stuff: this is bogus. Total fiction. Propaganda.  I'm glad you're interested in ninjas because this means you could be interested in knowing more about the actual historical profession, I strongly suggest you videos from Metatron, Shadiversity and Anthony Cummins (this last one is pretty technical and difficult to follow tho...)  Long story short: Ninjas progressively ceased to exist before 1800, since they became obsolete for that time period. But in the early 1900s, movies were made and this lost 'profession' became popular once again, but it was changed since very little was still known. Alongside this, people started to show up... Stating they were descendants of ninja warriors, that they were the keepers of an old tradition. They started to teach those secrets alongside with Ninjutsu (the martial art). They became pretty popular and even a huge business for movies and tourists. Until... a study in the early 2000s exposed all of them :\  Their supposed legacy was disproved and, adding the final nail in the coffin, in 2015 some ORIGINAL ninja scrolls were translated (how cool is that) by a team lead by Anthony Cummins: For the first time - after centuries - we could read the secret techniques of ninjutsu, written down by the hand of a medieval ninja sensei. But... It was disappointing. It was found out that ninjutsu (lit. Ninja techniques) had never been a martial art, ninjas were not trained since kids and so on... It was completely different from what we knew. And, more shockingly,  everything in the original scrolls contradicted what these false senseis were telling everyone :\  Of course a lot of the current senseis, like the one in the video, might be unaware of the lies... I mean someone told those to him, right? So it's possible that he truly believes in everything he sais. But the girl in the video still doesn't say anything, nor there is a warning text of some sort... Maybe ""Asian Boss"" is unaware of this too? But this is an issue! This vid has 9mil views! How many people now believe everything they heard from the vid now? :\  Btw, It's a really interesting topic. I hope you'll decide to look up to those sources I've suggested to you ^^   PS. Ninja is also an incorrect chinese pronunciation, in medieval times the japanese kanji of ninja was actually read ""Shinobi"".",5년 전,3,

The meaning of the word ""ninja"" is literally ""a person who practices espionage"". Ninjas were spies, not assassins nor fighters. Ninja weapons like shurikens are entirely fictional.  Ninjutsu (literally meaning ninja skills) was not a martial art. Their scrolls were all about espionage: teaching techniques of infiltration, propaganda and blending in crowds using everyday clothes.  PS. Ninja is also an incorrect chinese pronunciation, in medieval times the japanese kanji of ninja was actually read ""Shinobi"".",5년 전,4,
@rayanli8418,Marino Mele Dude wtf my comment is nothing about that.And also you meant to say japanese not Chinese,5년 전(수정됨),0,
@marinomele4575," @rayanli8418  Oh it wasn't at you specifically, but since the discussion seemed to be going towards anime and martial arts I thought it would've been fine to drop some insight here... Since, you know, ninjas are always portraited as some kind of fighters/assassins in everyday media... But it's so wrong! :\  Heck, this man even claims to be perpetuating an ancient tradition when all he says is straight outta pop-culture - that is nowhere near what was in the medieval ninjutsu scrolls... This video should be warning people from this tourist-traps and not mislead anyont into thinking that guy is a ninja - or that ninjas were even remotely like this guy sais they were. Kinda upsetting...  So no, sorry, it wasn't at you ;) More like a message left in the right place for people who wanted to read something accurate.  PS. Actually I did mean chinese XD That kanji is pronounced as ""shinobi"" in japanese and ninja is just a transliteration of the chinese way of reading it.",5년 전,2,

@marinomele4575," @rayanli8418  That's exactly the point. ""Nin Ja"" is a japanese pronunciation derived from the chinese ""Ren Zhe"", with the Zhe sound being pretty close to Ja.

So basically ninja is a more modern term, derived from the chinese pronunciation - supposedly due to intercurtural exchanges.",5년 전(수정됨),1,

@marinomele4575," @albusnightspring8057  You're right, but that ""kinda"" is a major problem. The guy in the video is mixing facts with fiction, pretending to tell the truth. You can think of this as what it's done in a book by Dan Brown. Mixing myth with history in order to create a compelling narrative: Cool, entertaining - but to not be confused with some kind of historical truth.  And this is the problem. The guy in the video states he is perpetrating an old tradition, explaining ""stealth skills"" ninja used and stuff: this is bogus. Total fiction. Propaganda.  I'm glad you're interested in ninjas because this means you could be interested in knowing more about the actual historical profession, I strongly suggest you videos from Metatron, Shadiversity and Anthony Cummins (this last one is pretty technical and difficult to follow tho...)  Long story short: Ninjas progressively ceased to exist before 1800, since they became obsolete for that time period. But in the early 1900s, movies were made and this lost 'profession' became popular once again, but it was changed since very little was still known. Alongside this, people started to show up... Stating they were descendants of ninja warriors, that they were the keepers of an old tradition. They started to teach those secrets alongside with Ninjutsu (the martial art). They became pretty popular and even a huge business for movies and tourists. Until... a study in the early 2000s exposed all of them :\  Their supposed legacy was disproved and, adding the final nail in the coffin, in 2015 some ORIGINAL ninja scrolls were translated (how cool is that) by a team lead by Anthony Cummins: For the first time - after centuries - we could read the secret techniques of ninjutsu, written down by the hand of a medieval ninja sensei. But... It was disappointing. It was found out that ninjutsu (lit. Ninja techniques) had never been a martial art, ninjas were not trained since a kid and so on... It was completely different from what we knew. And, more shockingly,  everything in the original scrolls contradicted what these false sensei were telling everyone :\  Of course a lot of the current senseis, like the one in the video, might be unaware of the lies... I mean someone told those to him, right? So it's possible that he truly believes in everything he sais. But the girl in the video still doesn't say anything, nor there is a warning text of some sort... Maybe ""Asian Boss"" is unaware of this too? But this is an issue! This vid has 9mil views! How many people now believe everything they heard from the vid now? :\  Btw, It's a really interesting topic. I hope you'll decide to look up to those sources I've suggested to you ^^",5년 전,6,

Next, Focus, Survival outdoors, Survival in a life-threatening environment Survival in the meaning to be independent, self-defense and for most cases to be in combat is protecting others from harm and/or death. My list can go on and on, Please start meditating and focus on this question and give into the universal energies to guide you to your next grasshopper/pupil. Your Sensei who will smile upon you, If you pass down your teachings. Think of it this way, Your Sensei who could tell himself, The ways of the shinobi-no-mono/ninja are not needed anymore. Why should I pass down my teachings to Kawakami Jinichi? Guess what? He passes it down upon you and you didn't honor his teachings to be shared with the worthy. Why not? Laziness? Fear as in self-doubt? You need to step up and keep your promise and honor your sensei and clan. The knowledge within those teachings is extremely valuable too. I'm highly disappointed in you for not honoring your Sensei's teachings as he may not want to do it either as an old man, but he knew he had responsibly of his promise in honoring his Sensei and clan and he completed with you.",5년 전,0,

Whilst at the same time doing a bunch of drinking and smoking weed and popping methadone. Do this stuff for a while until you start to realize that things you have been doing in your life line up with the things you have been studying about ninja. Plunge into a form of madness where you question things so much as to if such a thing could possibly exist in modern times. Question your sanity. Find a way to lose all emotions until you are a robot that does nothing but train in the way of the sword, without knowing why. Your mind will bend. Either it will bend back and you will become something that shouldn't be, or your mind will break. Do this,  and you may have some unfortunate understanding of what it means to be ninja.",5년 전,0,

@wasichu66,"That was indeed a bit of a ridiculous statement from him. Ninjas had developed a vast arsenal of tools and weapons, and of course they didn't carry all of them everywhere... they would use the specific tools that were fit for the mission.  Shuriken proved useful mainly as a defense when being pursued.  As much as we all enjoy the odd guy in the movies getting a shuriken stuck in his skull, that is fantasy.  Shuriken were not deadly per se, but being made of iron they were often rusty, and though a shuriken wound in itself would very rarely be life threatening, the consequences from the rust made it a dangerous and feared weapon. An interesting variant was the tetsubishi, small spiked balls or triangles thrown and scattered on the ground behind you for the pursuing enemy to step on and... ouch.",5년 전,32,

@wasichu66," @OlGregge  Lovely reply, but please, don't scream, it hurts my feelings. And don't get so violently upset over a simple comment, it's bad for your liver. I'll ignore your childish attempt at insulting me and serenely set a few things straight: 1. I'm not American, and don't live in the US. If I were and did, I don't see how that's relevant 2. Sadly, the days when I could be called a boy are loooooong gone  3. Nobody said the shuriken were specific to the ninja, or even that they were ""stars"" 4. I pointed out myself that the ninja movies of the 80's were fantasy 5. Pretending to have absolute certainty about what people did or did not do and how centuries ago is an exercise in intellectual arrogance 6. For Master Kawakami Jinichi to dismiss shuriken as not being used by ninja field operatives just because essentially they are a pain in the a** to carry is, I maintain, a ridiculous statement 7. I don't watch anime or read manga, never have, don't like it 8. Me I'm just a simple dude. Who happened to start his Ninpo Taijutsu training in the late 80's under Sensei Jean-Pierre Seibel and Sensei Carol Ceramicoli, at the NY Taijutsu Dojo, which was part of the then-called ""Shadows of Iga Society"" of Shidoshi Stephen Hayes, when there was literally only a handful of authentic ninjutsu schools in the West, which were under the authority of Soke Masaaki Hatsumi, founder of the Bujinkan.  Look it up, learn something. I think his credentials are a bit more solid than those of ""the last ninja on Earth"". 9.

@wasichu66," @OlGregge  No harm done man, as I said, just comments on a video.

Contrary to your statement, they were never left to go rusty, they were constantly sharpened in order to remain effective for the purposes of being able to easily penetrate flesh or slash arteries as they were sometimes used as make-shift daggers if needs would arise.  They were only associated with Ninjas from 1960 onwards, this was brought about by the Movie Industry.  If you're going to write long winded comments, pleas stick to facts, that way, the readers time is not wasted.  The old man was right.

I am pretty sure they never met, but know about each other's claims, so why no reaction? If someone says ""I am the last living practitioner"" (and Hatsumi never said this), he is also saying that the other one is a liar. It's a bit unfair, not only to the other person, but also to the students. But, ninjutsu, being first and foremost the art of deception, I can easily see, that the truth is somewhere in between and the real practitioners of ninjutsu are out there, training in Bujinkan, Jinenkan, Genbukan and various other schools.

@duranpredur1098," @JeannaFriskeInternational  That is because he is wrong. The use of shurikens by ninjas have been largely exagerated but saying that they are hard to throw, costs a lot, hard to conceal is complete nonsense. Hitting with those is easier than most other throwing weapons. They can be crafted with poor quality metals, as they are not meant to be resistant to anything. And saying that ninjas would be worried to walk with throwing stars on them when he proceeds to explain that the spear, the sword and the bow were ninjas weapons is ridiculous... Now, i highly doubt any samurai ever brought shurikens in battle, they perform like thowing knives: poorly, completely useless in fighting.

@PjustP," @duranpredur1098  Mabye you are right but you Sound less correct then the supposed last ninja. First, he showed he knows something you didn't, ok you can't because we cant' see you. Second, If he is telling the truth then he ""lives"" it and you(I suppoes) only read about it unless you are also a ninja. Third, the main reason I can't take your info as the only truth is your claiming Ninja were samurias. Now I also only know what I read and hear and have not spoke with any real ninja nor samuria, but I'm pretty sure that the info I have about samuria and the Japanesse pertaining to their honor is correct. No Samuria would accept other samuria as ninja, their honor forbids it. Now ninja were spies so a ninja posing as a samuria mabye but then he was NOT a samuria but a ninja acting as one, that's not the same. Of course samuria can be honorless but not officialy because their Code forbade it meaning that any evidence of their honerlessness would strip them of their title. So if a samuria were to be a nija he would have to conceal it from everyone for his entire life and that of his Family for fear of punishment against them. That is possible yet it would not be alot and surely not ALL ninja like your post suggests. that would mean the whole philosophy and meaning of samuria existence would be a lie.",5년 전,0,
@duranpredur1098," @PjustP  Not how it works. What credentials do the man have? No more than me. Nothing he says can be verified, whether it's the facts he states or his personal story. Ninjas were, to him, extremely secretive. So it would next to impossible to check information about them. Also, ""it's all secrets but let me tell everything about it on the widest broadcasting service in the world.""   I'm pretty sure i linked sources to support my facts. Things that can be verified and discussed, not irrefutable and easy to fake experiences. What impressive feat have you seen the man perform? I know he is old but y'all take him seriously just because ""ninja"" is written and said all over, seems weak to me, as proof.   Then you straw-man me, as expected. I never said that all ninjas were samurais, i said that a lot of them were. Can you spot the difference? I may have exaggerated, because most of the written sources about ninjas were written about or by samurais, where the lowest level ninjas were not worth talking about. What is absolutely certain is that some samurais were ninjas. Usually not the high social level samurais, true. But the class of samurais is way more diverse than one would think. Some were not rich and had to work to live, some were filthy rich. Some were brave, loyal, full of honor, others could be treacherous, using dirty battlefield tactics.   Just have a thing in mind, samurais and ninjas were humans. Humans are diverse, so ninjas and samurais are too. Becoming a samurai was not bound to personal values or martial prowesses, but a birth-right privilege. You would be taught bushido and martial arts but lets not assume that each and everyone would retain and enforce those at all time, it's a very costly hypothesis.",5년 전(수정됨),1,
@PjustP," @duranpredur1098  Ah, now you communicate better. You didn't say ""all"" that's true, you said often, which is alot. But you are right, they are humans and humans are not perfect. But when it comes to credentials he does have more then you for the simple fact that he is showing on camera while you are writing on YouTube. That doesn't mean he is telling the truth but he is at least ""seen"". BTW, it used to be a secret but hasn't been for decades now. So being on YouTube does NOT diminish his claim to be a ninja because it is suppoed to be kept a secret. Don't know what is true but it makes sense that ninja didn't use shuriken becasue, even with ""lesser"" metals, they were expensive and if I hear correctly ninja were not wealthy. And why carry those things around when you can literaly get rocks everywhere. Mabye they were used by those ninja that were samuria because of their title, they were for the ninja with the privilege of being samuria, just a thought.

@duranpredur1098," @whatyalokingat1735  So what? Its not a spear, why are you pivoting?   Checked the three-section staff. It's a chinese weapon , used in kung-fu (a martial art, not an actual warrior-oriented craft) It made its first appearance in japanese katas in 1935...   Chained weapons are usually way overestimated. Flail, nun-cha-kus suffers greatly due to the lack of control you can have, which is absolutly critical in combat.

@williamTjS,Although I don't completely agree with what this Duran guy is saying... he makes a good point. I don't think having a sword or a bow as a ninja is a smart weapon choice.

@Diovobirius," @williamTjS  Well, if you keep up with the video and think about it, then it's not that hard to figure out explanations for the different weapons.  Sword: Fairly common weapons - steal it from your opponent. Spear: Worst case scenario, you can make it from wood using a sickle. Bow: You can make it from your spear.  That said, as explained from the video this guy is the last one of a specifik group of ninjas. Why would all different groups be the same, use the same techniques and the same knowledge? For sure they would be influenced, but that is all. Also, they have mostly just been around, not actually doing much in the same way as they did in the Edo-era. Why would the skills and knowledge he has be the same as it was at that time? It is probably more representative of what was used in WW2.",5년 전,0,
@williamTjS," @Diovobirius  although i agree with the reasoning behind the sword, the spear and bow still seems unlikely. Sticks are too fragile to be made into spears and sticks arent durable enough tk be made into bows especially considering the required materials for making the arrows. But yes you are right, not all ninjas build the same but it was just weird that ninjas have those set of weapon skills when they are mostly in cover",5년 전,0,

@duranpredur1098," @Diovobirius  I don't say that ninjas could not fight with those weapons. They were probably almost always trained warriors, samurais or not. There is a problem tho, the shaft of a spear and a bow are two very different things, you'd need a pretty stiff staff to craft a spear and i doubt it would be worth the time spent on it. And a true warbow is deceptively simple, whichever one you consider, the yumi bow being a composite AND assymetrical one.",5년 전,0,

@Dad_a_Monk,Actually it stops the ground from being muddy. Most rural homes in Japan use gravel like that. Just a comon landscape technique. Doubt he's worried about being attacked.  There is an old Japanese technique in homes where iron leaf springs are built into the floor boards touching so they squeak as you walk across the floor..no matter how carefully you walk. It is found in some of the Japanese castles. This may be what you're thinking of.,6년 전,41,

@THExJMC,"@Laviath Yes.  Black people's skin is dark and therefore heavily protected from sun damage keeping it very nice into old age.     Asian people tend to have very oily skin which results in lots of unavoidable acne and smelly hair, even into older age, however they will not wrinkle until 60+ or even 70+.  Asian people in actual eastern asia are also very meticulous about skin care and staying out of the sun.  In addition,  diet tends to be a lot cleaner, hence why you see so many healthy old people particularly in Japan.     No need to be offended you snowflake.  Generalizations are just that, ie what you may expect to see in general.  There could be outliers, hell even the majority of the population could not fall under a generalization.  But if a large number of people from a particular group do fall under the generalization then it's not ridiculous to associate them with it.",5년 전(수정됨),0,

@THExJMC,Laviath Those paragraphs are like 1-3 sentences.  Didnt know writing for more than 5 seconds = offended.  You wanted some generalizations about black and asians so I gave you some.   Generalization  “a general statement or concept obtained by inference from specific cases”  I said it as if it were true for the entire group (based off of many instances where it is) that doesnt mean that it is true for the entire group or that I believe it to be true for the entire group.       “The sky is blue.”  Generalization about the color of the sky.  Doesnt mean i dont believe it turns red/orange/pink etc.  Nothing screams offended like someone telling everyone theyre ignorant.,5년 전(수정됨),0,
@THExJMC,"@Laviath You fail to see the difference between using a generalization to make an assumption and actually saying an entire group is literally the same.  I do believe in my statement, many white people tend to have bad skin and hence look old sooner.   Just because I also believe that there are some white people who have good skin in middle age, doesn't mean I don't still believe my first statement applies to many white people.

@Sun-Tzu-,"The whole shuriken thing was a bit misleading, we know that ninja carried them, but they weren't thrown, they were used as knives. The original shurikens were likely farming tools, like multi tools, where each point in the star would be a different tool like on a Swiss Army knife. Shuriken literally means ""sword hidden in the hand"", so they would have openly carried them pretending they are just tools. The concept of throwing them probably came from a take on the metsubushi, meaning ""eye closers"", they are a cross between a blowgun and pepper spray where you would blow in one end and a cloud of irritants like pepper, sand, or glass would come out the other end. They also may have come in the form of hollowed out eggs filled with glass that you would throw at your enemies eyes.",6년 전,0,

@SandraNelson063,"He never comes out and says that there are no more existing ninjas. He says they vanished. I think, for the good of Japan, there could be many ninjas quietly going about their business, protecting Japan's embassies, companies on foreign soil, traveling business people. Looking completely forgettable. You wouldn't look at them once, never mind twice. There would be families who have nurtured the traditions and taught their children, a few every generation. It's not something just everyone can do.   This man is the window dressing. He is the man juggling flaming chainsaws, drawing all of the attention. The ""real"" ninjas are not seen or heard. They are the quiet grey people that blend gently into the background.   The academy he will open will keep the traditional history and some of the self defense tactics alive in the public culture. But his students will not be real ninja.",6년 전,0,

Tai-Chi was a martial art and it turned into a therapeutic practice that people around the world benefit from everyday. Tai-Chi masters are very real and very active.

I've done a LOT of night time stalking in unlighted areas (a ton of it the woods) and that's not even close to the ideal way to do it.  The key to not tripping isn't to lift your foot two feet off the ground with every step.  That just tires you out before you've gone a hundred feet.  The key is not to move your foot forward, step down, settle your foot AND THEN SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT.  What people don't realize is that we shift our weight as we step forward when walking normally.  That's why you trip over stuff in the dark - you've shifted your weight before finding a place to put your foot, so when your foot fails to fall, you do instead.  It's not like it's a secret technique like this guy and other so-called ""ninja"" claim.  It's basic kinesthetics.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

In fact Asians don’t only look young, they ARE young, sure years add up but biologically they age slower. Japan has a lot of natural disasters and some of their food ressources have a slight radioactive contamination, plus they drink alcohol very often, some fruits are pretty expensive, heavy smokers aren’t uncommon and they can smoke inside buildings or restaurants, etc, YET they are the longest living humans on Earth, also youngest looking.

He is the founder of the Bujinkan Organization and is the current Togakure-Ryu Soke. Soke=headmaster. An-shu Stephen Hayes trained under Masaaki and is the U.S. highest ranked Master. He has many accolades of martial discipline. google to read more.,6년 전,0,

They (4 housemates) have this expression every time we bump on each other on the stairs or on the hall to the stairs. They would suddenly touch their chest area and looked terrified of me and then let out a DEEP breath saying ""OH MY GOSH! You surprised me!"" or ""Whoooh! You scared me. haha"" and every time this happens I am terrified as well cuz I didn't know I've been walking steathilly for a long time I didn't even realize.

@ROFLWAFFLELAWL4,"For anyone wondering about the ""Naruto Run""/""Ninja Run"" he does demonstrate it when talking about not kicking your feet to move but letting gravity do it's work and you ""catch"" yourself with your feet instead. The 2 arms backwards was something I'm fairly certain was made popular through media either from shows, some art, and animations. It's much easier to translate 2 arms extended back than a proper run.   That being said there is a type of ninja run that was popular. Everyone has probably seen it once or twice but their stance is low like in this video where they catch themselves to run, they have 1 arm infront of them to block or counter, the 2nd arm is behind them but grabbing onto their weapon on (typically a Ninjato). Though even this I'm not certain is true to the real art of Ninjutsu and may also have been something popularized by shows.   But I will say that having less motion with your arm (which you don't need as all your balance is thrown infront of you with the catching run) can create a smaller profile as well as create less noise from any fabric hitting each other on your clothes. So I wouldn't say it's out of the realm of possibility that either of these runs did exist in some way.",6년 전,0,

@001rupes3,"I believe that the art of ninjutsu is alive and well today. In the USA, check the methods used by SWAT teams, seal teams, Marine recon specialists. Probably most countries have them. Israeli Mossad? Russian Spetznas?  If you have a combat ready force  that specializes in quietly / secretly infiltrating hostile territory to gather intel, capture or kill specific high value enemy targets, then you have ninja. Spies aren't far off either. The clothing will be different, as will most of the tools they use. But the nature of what they do is the same.  The only real difference may be that the historical ninja lived by Bushido - or so they have been romanticized - whereas their modern equivalent are generally under no such compulsion.  This video implies as much when they discuss the original meanings behind the word ninja, and shinobi.",6년 전,0,

The reason Naruto portrays people not moving their arms when running ""Naruto style,"" it's because with Namba Bashiri, you're not twisting your body when running, therefore counterbalancing with your arms are completely obsolete. He also explains that this helps keep the sword from swaying as well. Basically your arms aren't needed and they can simply hang loose, or in the case of Naruto, pulled back",6년 전,13,

And I was trying to tie it back to Naruto, kind of explain why that pose is the ""Naruto Run."" Of course a shinobi would keep their arms close to their hilts, where their weapons are typically stored/a comfortable place for the hands to rest to keep the arms completely out of the way",6년 전,0,
@NurglesNugget, @zee_rowe   The title is misleading as they never even mention Naruto. The way they run in Naruto might be a reference (but a bastardization) to old ninja ways of moving but the main reason is that it's cheaper to animate a character when you don't have to animate the arms. This movie deserves a downvote for wasting my time.,6년 전,0,
@zee_rowe," @NurglesNugget  yea, it is nice to keep the arm movements minimal, but that doesn't explain how some of the characters DO run with their arms. I do agree with you that Naruto is very much a cheaply animated series, and i do agree about the title being misleading, but they did depict a real life shinobi running similar to how a Naruto run would be. I think maybe the person who uploaded this just thought that the Namba Bashiri looked alot like Naruto's running (or specifically, Sasuke), and wanted to get more clicks coming in",6년 전,0,

If you ever want to get into real historical research, that's the kind of documents and images you'd be looking for.  Now yes, groups like the Iga clan did serve lords, and acted as bodyguards, but this in no way suggests their primary function. Ninja clans served lords regularly, especially during the Segoku Jidai. However, protection requires more than just weapons and muscle. To defend against enemies, intelligence on your enemies' position and intent is needed. The ninja fulfilled these roles, and doing so protected their lord. They did not stand around as bodyguards like overpaid bouncers.",6년 전,3,

@sqfn08,"I have a theory or maybe just an idea and I hope it won't sound complicated but this is like the my third attempt to describe it and then just deleting everything because maybe it wasn't too clear. First; imagine going up a whole bunch of stairs, a lot. Enough that when you think your at the top your arms are basically dragging at your sides and no longer in a natural alternate back forth swing like motion when you walk. Now imagine you have to carry two bricks and you can choose to carry it up the stairs with the weight held out in front of you or carry the bricks up with both weights on either sides. Which on sounds easier to do? I would hope you'd say the latter. Why? Well carrying weight up stairs means you're expending energy already and carrying weight right out in front you while also climbing stairs means your expending even more energy than need be. Which is why it would be better to carry the bricks on your sides because now all your energy is focused on gripping them only. Now imagine going down the stairs while carrying the bricks, well now you have gravity helping you come back down which should be a lot faster  and easier than resisting gravity by going up. This is using momentum just like the last ninja explained. Okay, but why all this talk about the stairs and bricks? Well, your hands/ arms, just like the bricks, are still  two solid masses your body still has to carry the weight of, just think of how much lighter and faster your body could be if you could remove them! The stairs serve to help explain carrying your weight upright when going upstairs or running in regular fashion (hands swinging back and forth add extra wieght) or running downward using your own weight to help you gain momentum and use the least amount of energy to gain more speed. Now, leaning forward  to run will get you some kind of momentum as your body will try to continually balance itself by putting one foot in front of the other, but your body no longer needs your arms to keep that balance. They still remain two solid objects hanging right in front of you as you lean forward to run possibly getting in the way of your stride and causing more energy expenditure.  Simply tucking your hands to your sides or behind you (instead of flailing all in front of you or next to you) as you lean forward to run or otherwise known as the Naruto Run helps the body maintain a constant balance  as your body gains more traction going forward and uses less energy.",6년 전,2,

@cameronblaze4973,"Saying, ""it would be meaningless to continue passing down these traditions"" is depressing to hear... Rurouni Kenshin depicts characters who lost the war to the Meiji regime, the beginning of a new era, establishing a prohibition on swords and, from my perspective, truly tested those who kept striving for a purpose and continuing their quest for a deeper goal: peace, domination, strength, purity, etcetra... There are those who felt truly defeated and spent the rest of their days only as a stagnant failure, commit Seppuku, or never revive their pride again, only fail to realise that the spirit, Yin or Yang, were never taught or just misunderstood that never giving up until you drop dead protecting or fighting, in any case, is a trump-card that is given TO the body BY the spirit only when someone who is about to change the world is met with an obstacle that can only be overcome by always questioning your limits but never doubting your ability to overcome, and to righteously believe that you can and will. The most powerful realization that allows one to become much like ""The One"" in The Matrix. This man has the time and ability to pass down such teachings of discipline and honor, yet denounces his purpose and his destiny of keeping such spirit alive in this world both literally and metaphorically. As a child in late elementary, I remember subtle hints of such discipline and teachings in this Korean dojo, which, as subtle as they were, impressively influenced those worthy of such realizations to become such an invincible spirit when fate chose that the time was necessary to step up to everyday or once-in-a-lifetime obstacles. To say that such teachings are being overly exaggerated would be to doubt anyone's ability to become Battousai The Wanderer/Manslayer... Leaving such achievements to remain impossible. And these words are only a fraction of what there is to learn from such a culture. This Ninja has no purpose or achievement, just hobbies and simplicity...

If you keep your body rigid, including your legs, you won't swing around as much. In order to run with your legs very rigid and not kick your feet up you have to lean forward more to maintain balance. Leaning forward also allows you to accelerate quickly from standing because the downward momentum used while you begin falling can be carried into forward momentum. That's what I got from his demonstration anyway. Watch a ""drunken master"" fighting routine and notice how they basically go completely limp, almost like they are falling, only to direct that downward momentum into punches.",6년 전,0,

@dylanjantz1,"I mean, it sounds honorable but I don't think ninja cared about honor. What he says kindof supports this. They took pride in themselves and their devotion to their master. Their primary goal was intelligence gathering for their leaders. They would dress in plain clothes, wouldn't carry obvious weapons. They were well versed in appearing as though they were just normal citizens. But because of this they could achieve great things. They were primarily just the older version of spies. Combat was the last thing they wanted because that means they've blown their cover one way or another. If they wanted to kill I'm sure they tried to do it in a way where no one would know until it was too late. That's really not 'honorable' in any way shape or form. But they weren't as concerned with honor. Their concern was getting the information they needed and making it back alive with no one realizing the infiltration. Anything they needed to do to win is what they would do, at least that's my understanding.",6년 전,0,
@dylanjantz1," @putent9623  he's talking about what real ninja were though. You would never look at someone and know they were a ninja. I mean if you did, they were horrible ninja.

They wouldn't become famous through normal means and wouldn't want people to know who they were. Because this jeapordized the way they operated.

@bioforce5,"For anyone wondering, the REAL reason for the ""Naruto run"" is because it's easy to draw and animate. Since characters run a lot in the series it significantly reduced the amount of work it took to animate them running by having their arms be in a fixed position. In particular if the camera focused on the upper half of their body the animators barely have to animate anything at all beyond the background going by. It also made it easier in the manga to make it clear when a character was ""running"" because they have an obvious ""running"" pose, thus reducing the need for things like ""speed lines"" to indicate that someone was running. Overall it just made producing the manga and anime easier.   This is actually the same reason that Goku has blonde hair when he turns Super Saiyan. Toriyama hated coloring Goku's hair in every scene of the manga and decided to just leave Goku's hair purely an outline while Super Saiyan so he wouldn't have to color it in all the time. This ultimately meant Goku's hair had to be ""blonde"" whenever he was drawn in color as a Super Saiyan.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Like in the olden days they used to pass off as farmers and priests and laborers etc, folks who no one would notice and carried out their missions in secret.

@pudgeboyardee32,"Many practicing ninjas were commoners, but I wish ninja lords had been mentioned. For their service ninja clans were rewarded with estates and titles. These estates looked like simple farms from the outside but they were riddled with access tunnels, traps, the farm land leading up to the manor would be gently graded to provide innocuous defense leading to the main walls. They were master works of engineering and ninjutsu and I wish they had been mentioned here because the hidden defenses demonstrate very well the fullest application of ninja skills. Basically they had castles that looked like farms and were full of farmers that were actually ninja and that's pretty cool",6년 전,0,

Those ninjas, of course, were the weakest ninjas. Because an elite ninja didn't need to get into a fight to the death walking around in conspicuous, black garb. Elite ninjas spent their whole lives inhabiting a cover identity and could kill a person with household items.   One Daimyo died from his horse throwing him. His horse was well trained, the trainer was the best in the country and claimed to have just checked the horse.

That is announcing to everyone, including their enemies, that they are there and are now easier to find. ""Last Ninja""? Has anyone heard of the underworld? The Black Market? He must be retired. No Ninja lets out their name AND location. They hide in the shadows, blend in to society. And, for those who will try and say something like, ""what purpose does a ninja have today? Theres all sorts of cameras, guards, etc etc"". Those people also forget that assassinations still happen to this day. Maybe not on government officials or rulers as often anymore, but on crime bosses, revenge, maybe the local yakuza got a bit too confident and needs to ""disappear"" for the right price. They still exist. And, while it may seem unbelievable, there are some who either get lucky or are just that skilled and experienced to deal with whole groups. Again, thats who the ninja are.

Race means nothing. Culture means a little bit more but we are one. Were all human and I can't wait till we remember that and can start working together. Both of our cultures have a lot to learn from each other....",6년 전,0,

@keremcantarhan,"Well, most languages are very very literal if you go to their roots. It's because words are symbols for things and concepts. It's just much harder to notice in most languages than a language like Japanese. In English for example, a lot of words come from Latin and if you look at their Latin meanings, they are also often quite literal but because they have transformed both in meaning, pronunciation and spelling through their journey across time and languages they have become harder to dissect and understand. Another reason is languages like English have prefixes, suffixes etc. to change their words even further. Japanese language however often smushes two different words together to make new ones but the individual symbols for those words don't change so it's usually easier to see how a word was created.  An example would be the word ""economy"" for example. It means so much in this current age but it's basically the combination of words ""house(oikos)"" and ""custom(nomos)"" in Greek. So it becomes something like ""the custom of (distributing) (goods) in the house"", very literal if you ask me.",6년 전,3,
@av0-cad03," @keremcantarhan    I'm talking like Knight is a title given to knights,   And ninjas were just called ""person who moves stealthily""  And like I mentioned about transformers, they didn't give them names, they described what they do,  Like back in diaclone Megatron was ""gun robo""  I'm not slamming Japan, I just think their straightforward literal naming is funny.",6년 전,0,

@voxelated," @keremcantarhan   That's called agglutination, and it's a very common practice in many languages. Other languages, like English, are analytic, in that their morpheme bases (basically the little subunits that make up words) are usually entire words themselves. Other languages like German (or Japanese I presume) can take very small parts and stick them together. That's why sometimes if you read a German text the words are really, really long; usually, they're just two or three other morphemes for things that are put together to make something new.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@muyezhang343,"yes this is true.  Tho not necessarily in the technical way that you think.  Samurai is actually considered a social class, and its an upper social class.  Edo samurais and sengoku samurais are actually very different, and so was their interpretation of their honor code, with the sengoku ones being much mroe practical and brutal, since the period was way more brutal,.  The stereotype that we have about samurai's honor come from the edo period, which is basically when the samurai class was being phased out and so in an effort to remain releveant they rebranded themselves.  The sengoku ones on the other hand, only cared about one thing, and that is to satisfy their lords orders. They back stab you, poison, cheat, gang up on you, fight you at range, use whatever dirty tricks to get the job done.  Shinobi is a job, not a class, so there were indeed samurai who worked as a shinobi.",6년 전,0,

@armandowillem3694,"Killing a person isn't like a big secret skill or anything. We are very vulnerable bags of bones blood and meat. Bare handed you can gouge out eyes and with enough pressure crush someone's trachea break bones or even the neck. With bladed weapons that penetrate to a certain depth most stabs or strikes can be fatal if you have a rudimentary knowledge of anatomy for example slice open the throat or stomach or go for the femoral artery. If you want the victim to die silently, slit the throat deeply and stab upward under the ribcage into the lung or diaphragm simultaneously. We really are not that durable at all. Hence why most ancient warriors wore some type of armor and even nowadays those in conflict or combat wear protection against physical or projectile assault. Look at the body armor soldiers wear or even swat teams. Effective against projectiles like low caliber bullets and physical attacks like blunt force or even cutting and glancing stabs, although if you know where the armor separates you can get through it. The Shinobi just perfected killing into an art and made it second nature that is where the skill comes in. That and the balls to actually do it.",6년 전,0,

@efini_fc4276,"What if 9/11 was an inside job?  ""If"" does not exist to the senses, only in the mind. Not-existing opposes existing and these two opposites parallel many other understandings. Light and darkness, positive and negative, etc. for example.  Shinobi practiced their own constructed ways of essentially staying hidden/living in darkness/not exposed (negative). So whenever you ask something using ""if"", know that ""if"" is a very comfortable place to be when you want to stay hidden.. If does not exist. The only way to not be sensed by others is to be where another's senses are not. ""If"" only becomes something when enough truth is applied to the question of what the ""what if"" situation actually is. Avoiding this truth is an art of keeping others guessing. Understanding how to present something or exist someplace and leave the receivers senses around you (even online) feeling more ""if"" than ""is"" IS a successful shinobi technique.  Because ""is"" exists in reality and can be seen, this is not where you will ever find shinobi. You may find ninja or some other names that came after shinobi, but you will never experience shinobi this way, so your question will be forever asked or debated. The only absolute way you will ever find the answer is when you become shinobi yourself.",6년 전,0,

Also depending on what family taught you relates directly to what weapons you use. The IGA family actively use Throwing Stars"" and other throwing weapons as part of their family tradition. His INPO steps along the shed were wrong as Ninja would never sway their arms so much in case they hit something and made sound, in fact, all Ninja families teach INPO steps to limit body movement as much as possible to eliminate sound and conserve energy. His shoulder dislocation was not a dislocation as you need to move the joint laterally so the ball and socket joints rotate out of the joint, all he was doing was pulling down on loose ligaments known as Glenohumeral Ligament that are connected to the humerus or upper arm bone, pull down on that bone and bingo that happens it is certainly not a dislocation of the joint.",6년 전(수정됨),0,

@phantomhck,He talked about nanba which is the set of walking styles developed to move around crowded areas or traverse long distances easily.

Though I still drove my arms because it lends momentum to your legs thus putting less strain on them while providing more power.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

@Kostadin_Arolski, @NikSem65  how is the kunai a farming tool lmao?,6년 전,0,
@NikSem65," @Kostadin_Arolski  Well it was a farming tool and because it was cheap and had that sharp form ninjas started to use it.  According to Wikipedia:  A kunai (苦無 kunai) is a Japanese tool originally meant for farming in the Tensho Era of Japan (1573–1592). The two widely recognized variations of the kunai are the hand shovel used for turning up crops short kunai (小苦無 shō-kunai) and the big kunai (大苦無 dai-kunai).  Although a basic tool, in the hands of a martial arts expert, the kunai could be used as a multi-functional weapon, popular before the wide spread of firearms. The kunai is commonly associated with the ninja, who used it to gouge holes in walls. By attaching a rope to the ring, the user could easily climb walls or trees, which required great accuracy when thrown. The kunai blade was unsharpened, soft iron and was used for digging, prying, and smashing wood, plaster, and the like—which would have likely destroyed a tool which was sharpened or heat-treated.  Many popular manga and ninjutsu characters use kunai as both their primary and secondary weapons.  The kunai that were used by farmers were a fair bit smaller than the developed kunai that the ninja used. The farming kunai was smaller and there was a small handle with a hole on top. The farmers inserted the index finger into the hole and grabbed the small handle with the other fingers. The kunai that were used by ninjas had a bigger handle to allow them to hold the kunai more efficiently. The hole on the kunai was mainly used for putting a string or a rope so that the ninja could hang it on their belt.",6년 전,6,

His master Toshitsugu served as a bodyguard to the last emperor of china, which is pretty cool stuff.  Toshitsugu was the last of his specific ninjutsu style and passed it onto him.  It's neat stuff.  There are many ancient ninjutsu styles.   ""The Iga-ryū Ninja Museum of Japan lists the only legitimate inheritor of authentic Ninjutsu as Jinichi Kawakami. This may be a biased opinion as Jinichi Kawakami is also the honorary director of the Iga-ryū Ninja Museum, a commercial enterprise and tourist attraction.""

@masahikokumashiro6778," @derfinofred5491  False.  Shurikens come from bamboo fence fasteners and were used for grappling as well as throwing to distract, disable, or kill an opponent.  Generally, they were rusty and were feared by the samurai as it caused health issues to those who were hit by them.  They were primarily used by assassination clans.    Perhaps I did not clarify well, Masaaki Hatsumi learned multiple ancient styles and then blended them together to form Bujinkan.  In that right, he is both a ""ninja"" and a ""samurai"" in preservation terms, but bujinkan is still classified as ninjitsu. Masaaki is also 87 years old, so it is only a matter of time before a successor has to come.",6년 전(수정됨),7,

They basically use anything as effective as possible for to get job done, not try to get one on one combat situation like in naruto,, and I agree shuriken is useless for them. As ninja you don't want other people notice you, so if you throw shuriken and if it hit, the victim will get serious injury but its hard to say that the victim will die instantly because of that, and if not they can alarm others about your presence even if they are gravely injured. So stone is better even it can't injure enemy much but we can knock off people easier with stone make them incapacitated and after that kill him with blade or shackle so you can maintain your stealth throughout the mission.",6년 전(수정됨),1,

@pred6,"I think the reason that cinema and story tellers love ninjas is because of the romantic flair you can give to them. As with many things, sometimes the best stories ham things up, and when you have this legendary elite group of people that not many people actually know much about, you can take a lot of liberties to enhance the story. It's kind of the same way with general things like swords in movies. Everyone thinks swords were the weapon of choice for warriors long gone. Not at all, swords were backup weapons and spears were way more common and easier to use. But it looks cooler if you make them all use swords and not many people will know that it isn't accurate. It's all for fun telling a story.",6년 전,3,

@Dreagostini, @cloud20life  Plottwist: Master Ninja knows the military fanatcs would never surrender so the a-bomb was neccessary. Plottwist2 (for real): The Tenno Hirohito decided to surrender when the USSR invaded Manchuria after the first a-bomb put Stalin under pressure to gain as much territory out of Japan before Japan surrenders. So the second a-bomb was just some muscle flexing from Truman against Stalin. Master Ninja can't predict a mad man's actions though.,6년 전,0,

The main reason that he says their are no longer any ninja is because A governments now have assassin's  and B a gun against a knife isn't exactly a good idea. And what with all the forensic science and technology Killing somebody is not something many people will get away with. Unless of course you have a government officials covering for you. So why should he pass on something like this. In the movies you watch people like y'all are always The buttholes who gets their butts handed to them. And remember that karma always wins. And I don't care what religious beliefs you may have. I respect them but all the ones I know say what comes around goes around in some form or fassion,5년 전,0,

@Wips14,"Well, I kinda doubt the run part when he claims leaning forward is for gravity helping you run faster. If you look at force vectors, leaning forward will only kill your balance, as your center of gravity is now higher in regards of your upper body. Also if this ""trick"" were about to help you run faster, I think that professional athletes would do that, but I've never seen a single one doing this. So, as a lot of traditional thinghs, I believe this is rather a perception, more than a fact. I do think though, that the part in which he says the leaning is for keeping the sword out of your running motion makes a lot of sense. Running with anything that moves back and forth is annoying and will lead to bad technique, hence making you inefficient and resulting on injuries on the long run (as your body adapts to what is more comfortable).",6년 전,0,

@Kiyosuki,"This is an amazing little video. The whole image of Ninja being these super assassins is cool and all, and a guilty pleasure, but honestly the more I found out about the real history and idea behind them the more I found the reality actually a lot more interesting. The mindsets about advanced techniques in survivability, the value of stealth and anonymity, mental warfare (misinformation), adaptability, and ingenuity were all so ahead of their time it makes the whole image of them just being trained to simply be assassins seem mundane in comparison to me, because anyone can learn fighting skills or how to be a cutthroat, but supplementing that with the whole overencompassing methodology of ninpo is what made a Ninja. Also there's so much more of a fascinatingly evolved mindset to avoiding confrontation to that much of a degree, and the arming of common people. They were more secret agents than anything.  How interesting they actually were in real life is matched only by how interesting the sheer level of misconception about them in the general zeitgeist of modern culture has gotten. Everything from the whole thing about Ninja and Samurai (or their fighting arts at least, not so much the social caste.) being like, complete opposites or something...to having some bizarre restriction on their weapons, to even the very word ""Ninja"" being an invention as recent as the late 20th century. And whats great, is in a weird way...it's kind of par the course since the actual Ninja were all about spreading misinformation like that. lol  Also I didn't realize the entire Koga brand of ninjutsu was in that much of a decline.  I mean, I guess it depends on how you look at it I'm sure the knowledge wont die and as Jinichi said there might not be as much point in direct training in those arts the old way anymore...but it's still kind of sad in a way.",6년 전,0,

With lethal tools at hand and an intimate knowledge of the land they would often be able to use these to their advantage to eliminate Generals and spies. From there they started to form the art of combat around their role, Ninpo or Ninjustu. As the tool became more and more clearly useful, more and more lords got more and more ninja from more and more places. Turning them more into a specialty force in their military. In the same why, most knights where also farmers; since that is how you moved ahead in life until the industrial revolution.

@LondiniumArmoury," @bluesap7318  shurikenjutsu was part of the samurai arts, and Ninja were samurai, they were just samurai spies. The shuriken were used in actual fuedal japan, they were used to distract and damage an enemy before engaging them with your spear or sword. Shurikenjutsu includes throwing knives, stars and all manner of sharp metal projectile like objects including needle and darts. They work very well   and many soldiers used to throw weapons, in the west they usually sling stones and lead weights, javelins etc",6년 전(수정됨),3,

@00gyb00gy,"There are still Ninpo schools. This guy is NOT the last ninja... and we are talking about Shinobi.   Shinobi (edon period spies) wore their peasant style clothes often, their disguises less often, and their espionage gear (shinobi combat attire) least often. While similar to samari, who follow a code and train in a style in order to take on jobs and services, shinobi follow Ninpo, not Bushido, and they tend to avoid fighting. I like to think cats vs dogs. The reason I bring both up is that they train in martial arts. The shuriken and other throwing weapons are in the school of martial arts. It was part of their training to use throwing weapons, not necessarily to kill but to distract and to gain an advantage if they had to fight.   Backed into a corner, throw a poison dipped knife/needle/star right before pulling your sword/dagger/knife.   Throwing accurately and running away fast are great skills to have I'd say.   All of what I'm speculating at is backed up by historical texts and museums and the Japanese government and japanese art from the edon period...",5년 전,1,
@wasichu66," @LondiniumArmoury  Absolutely correct in regards to the technical aspects and origin. On the other hand Ninja were not samurai, not by birth, not by social rank, and certainly not by philosophy.  They weren't samurai spies either.  In more way than one, they were outcasts in Japan's feudal society. As Sensei Kawakami says, ninja clans were peasants living in remote areas of the main island of Honshu, present day central Japan. They actually developed one of the most amazing intelligence networks of recorded history, throughout Japan, but for their own purposes and survival. It so happens they would choose to work for one war lord or another, depending on their interest and advantage at the time.  The samurai lords found them very useful because Ninja not being held by the code of Bushido, they were more free to act in whichever way necessary, and they were, indeed, formidable spies. I guess sometimes there might have been confusion over who was using who :D The ninja network was strategically instrumental in the victory of a rising war lord, Tokugawa Ieyasu, who would unite Japan and become the first Shogun...",5년 전,1,
@LondiniumArmoury," @wasichu66  Many Shinobi were also Samurai, it's a myth that ninja were all low born or seperate, there are lots of historical examples of Samurai who were also shinobi Ihara Yorifumi is just one example.",5년 전,2,
@wasichu66," @LondiniumArmoury  I suppose some ninja might have posed as samurai, just as some of them would impersonate other social types and classes to blend into society, I suppose some samurai by peculiar circumstances might have been trained in ninjutsu, but in essence Bushido and Ninpo are so radically opposed when it comes to philosophical fundamentals and social codes that I would imagine these cases to be exceptions, although surely, real life and history is never as clearly cut as we may want to think centuries later.  In any case thanks for sharing and giving me a new direction for research and learning something new. Cheers",5년 전,0,

@HeadCannonPrime,"I'm really impressed for a youtube video on the internet. Everything this guy said was 100% accurate based on my own research.  (Myself being born in the 70s I grew up obsessed with ninja (shinobi) and have studied the topic on and off for decades).  As a kid I learned Ninja Step from some cheesy ninja books from the 60s and they were exactly what he showed.  Everything he said about the weapons was accurate.  Shuriken were for Samuri shinobi.  It was much easier for them to carry weapons in public.  Your average peasant shinobi are mostly just intelligence gathering and counter spys.  They made use of tools for weapons if the need arose.  Stuff like Kama (sickle), Kunai (ground stake), Claws (a planting tool often mistaken for climbing) and obviously kitchen knives, wooden staffs and such.",6년 전,0,

@CryptoJordanVR,"This guy's truths are blowing my mind. I can't believe shuriken were originally meant for samurais even though samurais are never depicted with them. I guess history made an oopsie. Also, notice how he wears navy blue instead of black. That's the actual color ninjas would have worn. Black would have been easily seen in the moonlight.  Edit: Actually I've been saying that for so long but from further research I find that ninjas actually wore a variety of colors. Most notably a collection of ninja poems from the 1600s says ""On a moonlit night, wearing white is unobtrusive"". Well how bout that? Turns out the color worn depended on the circumstances. However, it was most common for them to wear dark navy blue as I originally stated. Always do your research my friends!",6년 전(수정됨),392,

@Gebunator,"Considering they were commoners, they probably wore whatever clothes they could afford.. So all the colors.  But since espionage and other cloak and dagger stuff is rarily solo job and I figure some ""ninja factions"" did form, it's safe to say they adopted the navy blue as their ""uniform"" color. I even figure poorer groups pooled together their various colored cloths so they can have someform of camoflage. Dyed clothing was goddamn expensive back then, browns and such were cheapest, but dark blues and rest of the colors could be pricey (Ever wonder it's called royal purple and royals wear it? It's because it used to be most expensive dye in the market) Black alone is bad camo color, but with other natural colors it is great way to break your surface silhuette and make your camo better..

@alontsang7377,"Well.... a bit of misinformation here. This guy practices a specific school of ninjutsu which almost went extinct. However there is also the Bujinkan school of ninjutsu which is alive and well with many followers. Everything this guy said is also true to the Bujinkan perspective of shinobi. There is a rich history involving the topic and hundreds of different skills that are involved with studying these arts. Anything from survival in the wild, martial arts, espionage, cartography, swimming/diving long distances, mountain climbing, counter intelligence, cryptology, engineering, archery, forgery, herbal medicine, toxicology, explosives and any other practice that would be relevant for indirect warfare. Of course most of the shinobi absolutely did not practice all of these. They were specialists who played different roles and performed different tasks.  At their height, the shinobi were mainly trained as government spies and assassins. They were recruited from the general population in order to maintain their anonymity, they studied the samurai code mainly as counter intelligence. Since their way of life was very unusual it was necessary to incorporate a great deal of spirituality and philosophy into their training. Keeping a sharp mind was important in order to out think the enemy, create misdirection, interrogate, divulge information etc. ""Kunoichi"" (female shinobi) were used extensively in order to gather information, as women were often considered ""stupid"" and men would underestimate them frequently. They were far more instrumental in information gathering than assassination, but some instances included the use of poison and the like.       I spent about 7 years training and studying bujinkan ninjutsu. The school itself is ""rather new"" since its been cobbled together from a number of older disciplines. It has gone through a great deal of modernization, but tradition and history are taught at seminars for those who are interested. Today its mainly taught as a traditional martial art. It includes hardly any sparring and focuses on mastering the self.",6년 전,0,

@UmbraBlades,"He said at the start of the interview that he is 69 yo, and soon to be 70. Thus, he was born in 1950 and now we have 2019. It was definitely a worthy and dangerous secret to keep in 1950, post-WWII Japan, especially for a child. Japan surrendered and was being controlled by the US after Hiroshima and Nagasaki's nuke bombings (watch the 2012 movie ""Emperor"" starring Tommy Lee Jones and Matthew Fox, and you'll see just how hostile the social climate of Japan was in those years) and the martial arts and intelligence-gathering/espionage techniques of ninjutsu would have been an invaluable asset if they had fallen to the US army's hands. This man's Sensei probably thought about all this, so he decided to leave an heir for his legacy in case he was arrested and interrogated by the americans. But the years passed, Japanese culture was dubbed as oriental and elegant by the US and Europe and was spread to them as fashion eventually as they became growingly enamored with Japan, samurai and shinobi etc. Thus, circa 2019 it is no big deal anymore, ninjas are everywhere nowadays and although almost deified by movies and videogames (Mortal Kombat, Ninja Gaiden etc.) and their techniques further mixed and expanded by today's martial arts and intelligence agencies, the original yet outdated techniques are not useful anymore and are considered 'cult' even by him.",6년 전,0,

If anything at all he's a Ninjutsu practicioner. Second: he is not the last and only one to have inherited 'authentic' Ninjutsu  (as he calls it) from the Shinobi of the past. There's at least two other Japanese grandmasters who hold significant proof of being rightful heirs to Ninjutsu lineages.  I think this stupid ""I am the only one, all others are fake""-debate has gone on long enough. Let us all just behave like real warriors do. Respectful. Improving ourselves humbly.

Japan surrendered and was being controlled by the US after Hiroshima and Nagasaki's nuke bombings (watch the 2012 movie ""Emperor"" starring Tommy Lee Jones and Matthew Fox, and you'll see just how hostile the social climate of Japan was in those years) and the martial arts and intelligence-gathering/espionage techniques of ninjutsu would have been an invaluable asset if they had fallen to the US army's hands.

But the years passed, Japanese culture was dubbed as oriental and elegant by the US and Europe and was spread to them as fashion eventually as they became growingly enamored with Japan, samurai and shinobi etc. Thus, circa 2019 it is no big deal anymore, ninjas are everywhere nowadays and although almost deified by movies and videogames (Mortal Kombat, Ninja Gaiden etc.) and their techniques further mixed and expanded by today's martial arts and intelligence agencies, the original yet outdated techniques are not useful anymore and are considered 'cult' even by him.",6년 전,121,

@PlzDuntCensorME,"His branch of ninjutsu is quite different to others and one of the oldest. He specializes in espionage for the self and to keep oneself safe. Many other ninja branches, that were newer, specialized in espionage for the community and the newest ones served the lords. Ninjas that served the lord were also known as traitors because they went against their original ninja way, to serve the people and not serve the powerful.  His hand signs were to protect oneself. There are also handsigns for formations, praying to brutally murder someone, and praying for any deceased person. The handsigns were also used as a form of silent communication to replace speech. And ""stealthy steps"" is a technique called ""fox steps"" where you lean back and put weight on one foot, gently place the other foot in front with the toes touching down first, then shift your weight onto the foot in front. It was developed to sneak around in forests and not make any noise when stepping on twigs or leaves on the floor. If done right, you will make 0 noise even on creaky floors. Heck, you should practice on creaky floors to learn how to displace weight.",6년 전,0,

@austinaxley81," @kiroo_fox  Yes, but I also have a degree in cultural anthropology with a focus in Eastern Studies and I wrote my thesis on separating the myth from the history of Japan. There are like 50 ""last ninja"" in Japan, there's a ""last ninja village"" and a ""last kunoichi"" too, it's a tourist thing.  Historically they weren't even called ""ninja"" that's a western word derived from ninjutsu. They were called shinobi no mono or just shinobi and ninjutsu was part of training as Samurai not separate.  During the Genpei wars Minamoto Yoshitsune used shinobi in his army and Kusanoki Masashige is recorded to have frequently used it. After the Kenmu Restoration the style of ninjutsu was further developed by samurai in the Iga and Koka provinces (modern pronunciation ""Koga"")  The black costumes are from Japanese bunraku theatre and not from history. They wore the costumes on stage so as not to be seen operating the puppets against a black backdrop, but when ""ninja"" appeared in the script extra puppeteers would suddenly jump out of hiding to fight the puppet characters. Real shinobi were samurai so they would've had full or partial armour.",6년 전,0,

Christians and Muslims need us peaceful buddhists but we kind of need their power. America. A place to start a new life. With some trade offs.  Theres a reason asians dont go to jails in America compared to EVERYONE else.  Their cultures start.   At the same time like I said though Chinese are not too dominant these days in the UFC oddly enough most arts come from them except for wrestling which is thanks to the greeks and turks and persians... Asians didnt worry too much about grappling eh?  But jiu jitsu they made....  I love life.  We are all capable of love and hate on the SAME levels.

One of the misconceptions is that Samurai and Ninja were one in the same.  They were and ARE NOT !   Many if not most Ninjas were also Mercenaries who would offer their talents to whomever wanted them to perform a task, or to who paid the most.

@ArtSawce,"Something to point out that Ninja usually uses farming weapons like Kama, Kunai, Tekko as you can see in his weapon gallery. Because they are usually common farmers by day and they have to be ready at all times. The actual use of Ninjitsu or Shinobi-no-Jutsu is the skill set to prevent you from being detected. Also one should not really glorify Ninja's because it was considered the ""terrorists"" of that era but the art can be respected.",6년 전,4,

He explained that Ninja ran by throwing their upper body forward and letting gravity do most of the work instead of kicking your legs forward, that's how Ninja run in fiction, by throwing their upper body forward, which in turn causes their arms to go backwards because of the fast speed, also that position reduces wind resistance on the body.",6년 전,3,
@kerblingtime," @ppvsonicspy  waitttttttt the wind resistance isn't really a thing when you're running since we run so slow, but it does remove the extra movement which wastes energy and adds area when you re running which could bump/hit tree branches or walls and make noise. And since you're leaning forward, your arms behind you could help balance you since you're adding weight behind you so you don't face plant the ground.

@TurtleMountain," @Monkforilla  Damn you're not joking. I'm sorry but I dont understand this take at all. So i'm racist because I referred to people that live in asia as asians? Is that not a viable word to use when describing people who live on the asian continent? Am I also racist for calling people who live in north america, north americans, just because the population isn't completely homogenous? I was not aware being vague is racist by default now, what a time to be alive.  No, I think racism still exists now because of people who are so eager to fix things that don't need fixing. So eager to be offended on the behalves of others, who most likely don't actually care. Whether it be virtue signaling for clout, money, or to raise low self-esteem and inflate a dying ego I don't know.  Here is my advice, take a step back and realize that out of the (at least) 1500 people who saw my comment, you're the only one who interpreted it as something negative.

See my generation is sure inocent but what happened back than is just the crulest thing ever happened. Genocid and simliar things are not a joke. I dont blame the japanes. Humans can change and so do nations but we have to be aware pf that . Yeah this man has my respect cause he seems to be full of wisdom. I like japan and i like to learn about it as i do when it comes to korea. I like both countries equally but i know that korea  like for example france in europe had tho cope with the worst things in history. You can not  blame or hate on the koreans for being victims( like you can not hate about jews because of the genocid they are the victims they havent caused it). I am a part of one of the nations that where the monsters in ww2. But when i look around, when I look around when i look in the eyes of my friends i dont see those monsters couse we are no monsters we are born inocent and people who already lifed back in 1940 can change their opinions or maybe they never supported those leaders. I get that the nuclear bombs werent a quiet good  choice but i still can not stand how you talk about those topics. Am I a villian. No . Are japanese villians .

@山田-z3j8v," @bubblebubble7494   First of I have huge respect for Germans and nice to meet you. Now as for my flag you see it represents the ""Flag of the rising sun"" it is supposed to represent the Japanese honour and culture. This flag doesnt promote murder or war.  Now as for the victims. Yes Koreans were victims but some of them were treated good (my grandfather did atleast). But you see I am not angry at Korea. What did made a little bit angry were these comments. Look at how they are making fun of us being nuclear bombed and things. Now I can take jokes but these ones are not ok (I also lost my grandmother in a nuclear bombing of Nagasaki) so I try to avoid these jokes. But these comments are pure disgusting. Full of Korean trolls who hate Japan. So yeah we are used to it. Oh and greetings to Germany 😊🇯🇵🇩🇪🇮🇹",6년 전,0,
@bubblebubble7494," @山田-z3j8v    At first never put these there flags together i like italy i like japan( obviously, if that wouldnt be the case i wouldnt be here)but this way of thinking actually pleas scares me. It isnt a bound ok. Inget that hate always feels bad but you offended them with the flag i might wish that they would have had used other words but i totally can relate to them. I also dont wannt to be greted because of what happened back than . Dont get me wrong i love exchange of culture due to the internet and talk to people with other nationalis but today i am writing because i want to open your eyes how people feel about seeing this flag. I saw it and it just brought a lot of very bad things to my mind things i want to be aware of because i konw what happened in ww2 and keeping the hell that was created due to it in mind is the only way to educate people so something just like this could never happen again but that things are not the things  I want to think about when i think about japan cause it would turn every thing upside down it would just make me feel bad and it would make me less supportiv for japan. I think i might avoid the topic the country the culture. also i have to say that i dont know your grandparents and sure they could have been good humans ( who am into judge . I dont know them ) but what people see is arent your grandparents they see the war rape , murder and a lot more stuff like this. I got the point that at least as much as i know this flag had another meaning before the war but meanings change even the symbols at the flag once represented something diffrent. What people from all over the world see in this flag is every thing they want to overcome and they dont wannt to relate to japan anymore cause humas gave japan And  germany ( also italy)  a second chance  and we should use it and  try to built up a good realation ships with all the other countrys and keep in mind what could hurt them .  At the end i want to say that i understand that you miss your grandma my grandpa died before my birth to( for other reasons. Obviously. )but dont you think that she wouldnt like it that the flag who represented the cause of the war that killed her to be shown as a normal thing i am sure ( you might have another understanding of heaven i respect that . Thags just my opinion. ) that my grandpa looks afterme and is watching me. I actually talkt to him when i was younger. And i wannt to make him proud and i am sure that in heaven you dont see borders or nathionalitys, just humans, and so i think that he would want me to do my best to be kind and carefully when it comes to the feelings of others exspecialy  in situations like this when i discuss a very touchy topic like the war or the nuclear bombs . I dont want to offend you i just wannt to say that this flag could have another meaning for the most of humans round the earth and for that reason could hurt them. Please keep that in mind.",6년 전,0,

I think i dont agree with you in at least a few points but i dont know you. So who am into judge. I just always think about the worst when i see something that is in some kind of way related to the war. I always think that it means that people continue to think that what happened back thenwas right. What obviosly isnt the case. I just hope that you dont think it was ok ( it was what came to my mind when i saw the flag. Maybe this isnt true).  I hope that you agree with me that all nations on this wonderfull planet should stay united and love eachother.   I hope i could explain.

I don't like what happened back then nor do I want it to happen ever again. We must stay together and work for peace and help each other instead of killing. Because killing gets you nothing but hatred and yes I do not agree with what happened in the past. It was horrible. Well we have UN to prevent such acts today so wish we all could get along and have a peaceful and happy future with no enmity and hatred around the world (of course such things are impossible with power and greed it's sad).

Also that ninja didn't use throwing stars cuz iron was expensive, then show us his favorite weapon being a farm tool which they did use sickle for weaponry. Either way Stars were made from scraps of metal and were tools of harassment not exactly intended to harm or kill, they also used rocks, but nothing strikes fear into a person like when a chunk of sharpened metal gets stuck in the wall next to your face. Also stars weren't usually made into literal stars they were parts of broken tools or scrap shaved down into square shapes with bladed edges. When the is guy runningb he is running toe heel rather than most people running heel toe. People naturally walk heel toe when they have cumbersome shoes on for most of their lives. I you were to never wear full shoes for a majority of your life you will have a toe heel gape more naturally.

He walks and runs silently (listen to his sound compare to the girl) 4. When asked of killing capabilities he didn't hesitate to say it is easy with no emotions 5. He prefer the sickle to be his weapon, it is not fancy as the others but useful, killing or harvesting, no problem. Gathering infos by pretending to be a harmless farmer, thats why",6년 전(수정됨),0,

Hit him/her with on the head with a stone or heavy stick, stab him in the neck with a knife (or basically anywhere - death from bloodloss), push him off a ledge, run him over with a car (not possible before the invention of cars). With a little bit of training you can choke someone to death or hit him unconscious with bare hands. If someone is unconscious for longer times he might die - if he doesn't die from falling on hard ground. To make sure you can hit him on the head a few times. Poisoning someone is also very easy, but only if you can get your hands on deadly poison. If you know how to operate a gun and own one, you can shoot to kill.   Where do people get the idea that it's hard to kill someone? Same with ""deadly"" weapons/techniques. Lot's of things are deadly.",6년 전,1,

I assume the interviewer in the video wanted to ask the master if he knows techniques to kill, not if he holds any grudges or if he is easily offended to the point of killing someone.   I think a lot of people think it's hard to kill, even with the right mindset, that you need complicated techniques and long, dedicated practice - which is wrong.

In the Ko Ryu Kenjutsu schools this is part of the Hiden of those arts. This was a hostile political environment, with Shinto, and Zen Buddhist social, and spiritual influences. These techniques and  ideologies of course spread through time in the Koga and Iga Ryu. All in order to help complete missions to maintain their region generally in the local Daimyos and Shrine or Temples influence or interest. Also to note, that they did respectively develop their very own styles, tools, methods around this applicable combat knowledge. This is how Ryu were developed generally anyhow.  By cataloging and teaching a number of successful techniques together. It's how the old Kenjutsu schools became what they are.",6년 전,0,

@danielgamazo5494,"the ninjas as we know them never existed. They were peasants who lost their land because of the war and became mercenaries who, having little money, had to use their farming tools. The black ninja costume emerged from the Japanese theater later because it was used for the actors to become invisible with the black background. The symbols that they made with their hands comes from the Buddhist tradition that was in the area and a type of meditation that consisted in thinking that you wanted to achieve your goals through a series of mantras",6년 전,0,

@duality7404,"@Albion Chastity Hey, you figured out the weapon drawing part! By keeping your arms behind you, motionless, you leave them in a better position to grab weapons, as weapons are not usually worn directly in front, as that would impede running. If the arms are turned correctly, one could draw most weapons extremely quickly from that position. Running with arms in front or while moving makes it take a bit longer to draw said weapons. The arm placement of the run is more for versatility with the small weaponry of the stereotypical ninja than it is for speed or actual head-on combat. Note that actual ninja didn’t really use as many small weapons as they are stereotyped to, as so they would not have required nor utilized the positioning. Using said positioning makes outranging an opponent in combat easier, if you were moving around them, while also being useful for distracting defensive capabilities while moving towards the target.",6년 전,3,

@Valkaneer," @kamikaze6198  I can't see it being used for running though unless you are constantly falling forward, but at some point, you have to hit the ground.  So, therefore, you need to keep raising your body back up.  I don't see how this is not a waste of energy.",6년 전,2,
@duality7404,"Trey Nathaniel That would assume that a human’s weight is possible to completely distribute equally across the body. In most cases, it isn’t. It wouldn’t counteract the balance because of the sheer weight. Your arms aren’t enough to counteract your torso and head. In a case where you can’t run as fast as necessary, the position may negatively impact your balance to the sides, due to slightly offsetting the weight on the side of the foot that is on the ground. Along with this, note the way they run in the anime. Their heels touch the ground first. What this does as the move is shift their weight as they move, already counteracting the forward weight. Try this little experiment. Stand on one leg, arms behind you. Now, attempt to do this using only your toes. Now try with your heel. It is likely that after standing on your heel, the rest of your foot gets placed on the ground as well. This is because it shifts more weight backwards than just the heel. It also distributes more weight from your leg, and in some cases, your waist and torso. Unless your arms are as large in every dimension as your torso, you wouldn’t have enough weight to maintain balance with use of your arms. While it may help to balance it all out, it isn’t entirely enough for the run, and is more so used for versatility.",6년 전,1,

It's possibly loaned from the term ""tami-kusa"" used to refer to the masses or the commoners/people, seeing as the shinobi had the primary role of blending in with the populace as covert agents.   Another add-on I have remembered would be that Hattori Hanzo Masashige (Tokugawa Ieyasu's) one of the most famous ""Ninja"" in history, is actually a ""Bushi"" a.k.a. ""Samurai"" instead of what he is known as. He was a leader/member of the Iga Doushin which at the time would be equivalent to police agents under Ieyasu. We could very well say these ninja are part of what became the modern police, and it sure fits since police do still perform undercover work and tasks that classify them as agents.",6년 전,0,

@yattasuccess9212," @biteme9505  Even though I joked around I don't really want to agree but I disagree to disagree since... My mom is turning Mid-50 and some of Her coworkers when asked Her age told Her She was around high 30 or low 40. And A few years ago when She was about 49 She was though to be like mid to low 30 even. My dad is turning 50 and He still looks the same since 10 years ago as I remember. When my grandma was 70 up to 75 She looked nearly 50 even, ofc I guess it is quite true that A sudden hit happens and when She turned 80 I thought European grandmas who were 100 looked young.   I'm currently about to become 15 but I am still thought to be 11, but I guess my height is A big factor since I'm not as tall as all my friends who are 5""3-5""9 while I'm here lingering 3 inches lower than the lowest range there.   Many asians don't like hearing these type of stuff because it might attribute to some negative outcomes, some asians whom are professionals but still look younger than their ""professional"" coworkers are disregarded as looking less-experienced and therefore less-likely to be respected even if they might even be more-experienced. And this also might result as teasing or harassment from working because you look young therefore many assume you are young, but some people are already 30 but still look 14 and that's quite hard for them to experience especially when they work as hard or even harder. (I am not to speak of other asian countries specifically but only in general as this can apply to nearly anywhere where this happens, it just tends to happen more in asia, specifically East asia.)",6년 전(수정됨),0,

But if you have someone, like a contortionist or a spy or something, it's not hard to practice it at all, but still risky. I had been taught to dislocate my wrists and my right shoulder by someone. Thankfully I had not dislocated wrongly. You wouldn't really know if it worked until you dislocated your joint. The pain is different.

@Kvint-kh12345," @finethehuman1821  yup, it was rhetorical question)) it doesn't helps with speed, and it doesn't saves energy (cause this technique would be used in marathons). As many things about ninjas, it does look cool and also easier to animate. And gravity... Well, in cases, when gravity helps you (for example running downhill), it also makes you very unstable, and when someone is running away, it would be very bad to fall and smash face on rocks.

@greensoplenty6809,checkout the assassins guild. middle east they had tens of thousands of assassins for awhile. they had a fortress and was so many of em they held off some king's army for like 2 weeks when he went to crush em. the weapons would definitely help avoid capture if your on a recon mission. seems like you pretend to surrender if your caught and throw one of those glass powder filled eggs at em or draw your sword on em and try to get away maybe. if all you have to do is usually get away from 1 or 2 guards patrolling around. make yourself a hard target and alot of guards might run away to make sure they live long enough to tell others they caught someone sneaking around and might be an ambush or something coming. makes sense. rest the time dont need any weapons or anything unless you specialize in assassinations or something.,6년 전(수정됨),0,

Ninja have no sound, scent, recognition or popularity. we have nothing but we achieve a lot. that's how (the)ELITE ninja are."" and it stands to reason.

A lot of this fear stems from the increasing presence of foreign mafia in Japan, especially Chinese and Thai gangs.   So, lot of people here have a fear of foreigners, but now with the rise of half kids in showbiz, more half kids in general, more foreign sports players in Japanese teams, etc the fear will hopefully fade out.

Do they wish they could wear them more often or just wish they could go out of style? How do they feel when white people wear their traditional clothing?

@Synaxis-est," @breadbread6638  Actually I was just casually mocking the entire concept of finding appropriate descriptors racist but ok, let's chat.  I'm about to barf in my mouth but the constraints of the medium compel my speech - The N-word is something I use any time I talk about black people. Or people born with a strong permanent tan, as I like to say.   It's a short convenient two syllable word. Where I'm from we use it all the time and no one is racist for it.",6년 전,0,
@breadbread6638,"Edd Theman “appropriate discriptors” Okay sure. Your example is the absurd one here honestly.  The N word isn’t about what’s racist and what’s not. The literal word came from hate. It was a word used to make other people feel lesser than the sayer for YEARS. Doesn’t matter who says it, it’s a disgusting word that shouldn’t be used. I hope you realise that as well.  *edit: ‘that’s not’ (sorry seeing that typo got on my nerves)  I was just asking a question as to why they didn’t include other races, because I agreed with their main idea. You literally said, “It’s kinda racist that using ‘white people’ would stick out to you.”  It stuck out to me because there are other races who do the same thing so why highlight only one?Then the original commenter explained it and I completely understood why they wrote it.   People can wear/ use things from other cultures. Sharing is a wonderful thing and I believe it can bring people from many cultures together. Using derogatory language used to literally separate people for something they had no control over, however, does NOT bring us together. The N word is literally one of the most racially offensive words. I’m assuming you didn’t know all of that since I don’t know if they teach that where you’re from.  Also, my paedophile example was used to show me finding something strange and asking about it, as humans do when they are curious. I just made up an example on the spot. Sorry if it wasn’t clear in my comment.",6년 전(수정됨),0,
@Synaxis-est," @breadbread6638  No, I'm aware of the general American history. It's a foreign issue. I grew up as the n word being equivalent to white, asian, yellow or what not. It wasn't really relevant. It's a convenient word.   We did try to figure this nonsense out at some point - you can't use the n-word overseas anymore, they call theirs african americans. We tried to figure out what we would use instead of the n-word and it got ridiculous almost immediately. Our word for black for instance also means dirty or filthy.   Anyway, we quickly realized that these nonsense games with words you can't say aren't helping anyone. At the time we saw smth on TV where a woman was explaining that they can use the n-word and they do to take the word back and get rid of it's negative power but white people can't because ... it's racist. Which is racist in itself. So only half of that kinda made sense to me.   So again the comment I began with is just a hyperbole to mock the whole thing - it's is completely absurd (I'm surprised btw, that you didn't know what the commenter meant, I had thought it was plainly obvious). No blacks have been slaves for a while now. All this race thing is going on there, is racist and absurd. A nonissue at this point. I tuned out from this over a month ago.

@alexmash1353," @slyztercoreveanged3175   Such a lengthy text, full of baseless assumptions. He says it himself, at the age of six, he started it as a game. No parent (especially in Japan) would allow some random guy teach their children something really... practical. So it was mostly about silent movement, some medicine, simple explosives, etc. He was taught until the age of 19, after that he went to a college and whole his life was a technician at some big company(ies). Second, his shoulder isn't something special, just a trick. His words about getting compensation is probably a joke, even if true, it is just a bit unusual fraud. But, again, nothing special and nothing related to killing people or spying.   Third, there is no info(even in japanese) about his teacher at all. He could be anything, even some random ninja otaku guy. Any info about him is provided by this guy, so not reliable.  Fourth, have you ever seen a guy who is really used to his weapon? His movements would be very natural and even mundane while handling the weapon, but in case of this guy, he doesn't look/feel like that. It strongly points at the lack of pretty much any training with the weapon.  Fifth, you clearly had no idea about spies, martial art/military (proper) training, ninjas and human nature and the society in general. You just live in a fantasy. Perhaps, some day you will grow up.

There was not a single line about being inside the room(nor now, neither before). And otakus can be quite social, after all, if we take ""classic"" anime otakus for an example, they always had their comi..ket(?) or whatever. 2. Hobby is something you do in your free time. Thus, professionals cannot be an otaku(even if their work started as a hobby). 3. If you are ""simply just passionate"" about something and other person considers it extreme(using his own scale), he may call you otaku. So, ""If you want to be critical, at least make your terminology right. ""  Bonus: where did I say that these ninjas are just otakus? Do you have difficulties with comprehension?  ""He could be anything, even(including possibility of) some random ninja otaku guy. "" is what I said about his teacher whose work was something related to medicine.   If you didn't get it, I'll make it brief for you:  Just because someone said something doesn't mean it is true. By observing this guy I say there is no evidence of any sort that this guy knows/can do something serious.

@tomjordan4123," @alexmash1353   1.

Please do me a favor, do your research better.  2. Exactly. Hobby is something you do in your free time, and once you've reached to the ""extreme level"", you can't really call that ""free time"" any longer, now can you? BUT the funny thing is, I was not the one who said ""people who take it on extreme level"" in the first place. You're just refuting your own statement.  3. Passion is just a feeling of great enthusiasm about something. The only thing that differentiate it from professional is just their profession.  Really, you really need to work your terminology.

I've even checked a couple of them in case of you being possibly right(or wrong). Courtyard? Park? What of silly thinking is it? They will be in the placeы where they can do their hobbies. And is being in parks some kind of measurement of healthy social life?  And I'll give you another example. If you search through the net, you may find a japanese TV show featuring train otakus. Who go to different places to watch trains, have their own social circles and etc.  Of course, if you are obsessed with something it will be detrimental to your social interactions with normies, but it doesn't mean your whole life is a lonely room. What you do is cherry picking those otaku mixed with hikikomori.   2. Your blabbering about hobbies is nonsense. You don't work? Free time. You spend your whole free time on one thing? Hobby. Having free time doesn't mean you have to do a certain number of things.   So what do I refute? Plus what you consider as extreme may be not what I think extreme is.  3. I don't care about passion. Hobby is free time. Work is work time. And, by the way, funny thing is most(85-90% worldwide) workers, including professionals, dislike their job. So your passionate professionals are rather exception. Still, being very passionate(or obsessive) and being otaku are the same thing, just with different implications.

The answers we received, through this video, is only what pertained to what questions were asked. As far as claiming the title of last ninja, he isn't saying he is literally the last. Only that he is the last of his kind, from his line of shinobi, that still practices the art of the shinobi that was handed down to him.  Again, all we know is that he is a shinobi.

I imagine that it's hard to actually train to be a ninja nowadays as it's about spying/assassinating/int'l gathering which is illegal and probably better managed by modern int'l agencies.

OR This intelligent and skilled ninja who has been trained in intelligence work and understand how to uncover secrets and the value of deception has somehow been misled into thinking he's the last ninja, and decided to publicly advertise that fact to an international audience... OR This is a deliberate misinformation campaign by a ninja clan to help conceal their existence and strength.   The inclusion of factual information and its use to mask your deception is an important strategy in espionage and politics and a crucial skill for anyone in any related line of work.
