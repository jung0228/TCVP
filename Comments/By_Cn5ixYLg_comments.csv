New home, new car. Actually have a girlfriend and a future planned. Still cringy and playing video games…but a much different person than I was back then   It’s so wild how fast time flies and how much things change.  I still remember when this premiered and how excited I was  And also how simple times were. Before I had to worry about adult things.

He will say, ""Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen. 117. I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness. 118. If You should punish them - indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""",4년 전,1,

@guille8255,"I have seen that many discredit this rewind and value MrBeast's more because this was pure meme and his was more of creators. But the rewind is a compilation of what happens in the year, not the face of 50 youtubers, in any case it would be called the youtuber rewind, but no, it is called YouTube rewind, a compilation of the best that happens on YouTube. And the current world is dominated by memes, the memes summarize what has happened in the year, that is a true rewind. And they complain that there are no creators if rather these memes were created or were made by and for youtubers, so indirectly they would be entering the rewind, as it appeared here.

After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to have a dream. I take care to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning , that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.

@pastyobedtime3122,JOIN ME!!   This is going to sound impossible but it has to start somehow. I want to put pewdiepie in the #1 spot again. I am starting a movement. Just sub to pewdiepie and make sure all your friends do the same. It seems impossible because T series is a massive corporation with all of India backing them but if we can get the entire USA to sub to pewdiepie than we will pass T series in less than a year.  If for nothing else do it for Felix. He does so much for his viewers and we owe it to him. JUST SUB NOW AND SEND THIS TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AND THIS DREAM WILL BECOME A REALITY!!!!!!!!!!!,4년 전,1,

No tengo idea de que nos oculta el el gobierno, pero intento saber la verdad, si no la descubro significa que estoy muerto. PD: así como yo te aparezco • hace 48 años tu seguramente me aparezcas ""• hace +48 años"" el YouTuber que estan viendo seguramente valla a subir un video diciendo ""jajajaja que mentiroso, buena broma"" pero no, solo es una inteligencia artificial imitando su voz para seguir teniendolos segados.",5년 전,0,

@sheepmaster5252,The year is 2025. Pewdiepie was lost in the battle against Cocomelon in 2022. Tiktok has been banned everywhere except china. The Coronavirus Has wiped out 50% of the population but has since been eradicated. The world is in ruins. Please if your reading this i dont have much time i have gone back in  time to type this and warn you all too despite the memes collect toilet paper because it has become the currency along with food in 2025. Also subscribe to Pewdiepie so we dont lose this war. I have to go i wish your timeline good luck. Goodbye.,5년 전,1,

Muchas de las cosas no son realmente algo de YouTube en general, simplemente pasan, son tema del momento en Internet(en varias redes sociales, y no siendo necesariamente YouTube la más.. Eh, influyente xd) y de fuera de Internet y así. Osea, y se supone que el YouTube Rewind debe tomar.. Todo lo que pasó y demás en el año en YouTube, mezclando así muchos géneros y cosas que seguramente a muchas personas no le va gustar, a muchas personas les gusta una cosa y otras muchas personas les gusta otras cosas, asique.. Es como obvio que el YT rewind no le iba a gustar a la mayoría, es solo una mezcla de todo, quizá poniendo a los más influyentes en el tema que tratan cada Youtuber, y este video que por más que me haya gustado parece más como que simplemente va dirigido a un cierto público en general que le gustan cosas más similares, ya sea que algunas pocas no o sí.   PD:alguno de los animadores me hubiera gustado verlos, pero weno. xd",5년 전,0,
